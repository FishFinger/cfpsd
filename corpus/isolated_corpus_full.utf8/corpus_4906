Meeting Description:

The Boston University Conference on Language Development (BUCLD) was started in

approaches to language acquisition, cross-cultural language development, second
language development, language disorders, and literacy development. Each year,
close to 500 abstracts are submitted to the conference, from which about 87
papers and 66 posters are chosen for presentation. Internationally renowned
researchers also give keynote and plenary addresses, as well as a lunch
symposium on a topic of current interest.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
