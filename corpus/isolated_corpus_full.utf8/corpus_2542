Second Call for Papers

Second International Workshop on Emotion (satellite of LREC):

Corpora for Research on Emotion and Affect

Monday, 26 May 2008
Palais des Congrès Mansour Eddahbi
in Marrakech (Morocco)

In Association with

6th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation

LREC2008 http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/


This decade has seen an upsurge of interest in systems that register emotion (in
a broad sense) and react appropriately to it. Emotion corpora are fundamental
both to developing sound conceptual analyses and to training these
'emotion-oriented systems' at all levels - to recognise user emotion, to express
appropriate emotions, to anticipate how a user in one state might respond to a
possible kind of reaction from the machine, etc. Corpora have only begun to grow
with the area, and much work is needed before they provide a sound foundation.

This workshop follows a first successful workshop on Corpora for research
on Emotion and Affect at LREC 2006. The HUMAINE network of excellence
(http://emotion-research.net/) has brought together several groups working on
the development of emotional databases, the HUMAINE association will
continue this effort and the workshop aims to broaden the interaction that has
developed in that context. The HUMAINE Association portal will provide a range
of services for individuals, such as a web presence, access to data, and an
email news service; special interest groups will be provided with a working
folder, a mailing list, and a discussion forum or a blog. Conferences, workshops
and research projects in the area of emotion-oriented computing can be given a
web presence on the portal.

Papers are invited in the area of corpora for research on emotion and affect.
They may raise one or more of the following questions. What kind of theory of
emotion is needed to guide the area? What are appropriate sources? Which
modalities should be considered, in which combinations? What are the realistic
constraints on recording quality? How can the emotional content of episodes be
described within a corpus? Which emotion-related features should a corpus
describe, and how? How should access to corpora be provided? What level of
standardisation is appropriate? How can quality be assessed? Ethical issues in
database development and access.

Description of the Specific Technical Issues of the Workshop:
Many models of emotion are common enough to affect the way teams go about
collecting and describing emotion-related data. Some which are familiar
and intuitively appealing are known to be problematic, either because they
are theoretically dated or because they do not transfer to practical contexts.
To evaluate the resources that are already available, and to construct valid new
corpora, research teams need some sense of the models that are relevant to the area.

What are Appropriate Sources?
In the area of emotion, some of the hardest problems involve acquiring basic
data. Four main types of source are commonly used. Their potential contributions
and limitations need to be understood.

Acted:
Many widely used emotion databases consist of acted representations of
emotion (which may or may not be generated by actors). The method is
extremely convenient, but it is known that systems trained on acted material may
not transfer to natural emotion. It has to be established what kind of acted
material is useful for what purposes.

Application-driven:
A growing range of databases are derived from specific applications (eg
call centres). These are ideal for some purposes, but access is often restricted
for commercial reasons, and it is highly desirable to have more
generic material that could underpin work on a wide range of applications.

General Naturalistic:
Data that is representative of everyday life is an attractive ideal, but very
difficult to collect. Making special-purpose recordings of everyday life is a
massive task, with the risk that recording changes behavior. Several teams have
used material from broadcasts, radio & TV (talk shows, current affairs). That
raises issues of access, signal quality, and genuineness.

Induction:
A natural ideal is to induce emotion of appropriate kinds under appropriate
circumstances. Satisfying induction is an elusive ideal, but new techniques are
gradually emerging.

Which Modalities Should be Considered, In Which Combinations?
Emotion is reflected in multiple channels - linguistic content, paralinguistic
expression, facial expression, eye movement, gesture, gross body movement,
manner of action, visceral changes (heart rate, etc), brain states (eeg
activity, etc). The obvious ideal is to cover all simultaneously, but that is
impractical - and it is not clear how often all the channels are actually
active. The community needs to clarify the relative usefulness of the channels,
and of strategies for sampling combinations.

What are the Realistic Constraints on Recording Quality?
Naturalism tends to be at odds with ease of signal processing. Understanding of
the relevant tradeoffs needs to be reached. That includes awareness of different
applications (high quality may not be crucial for defining the expressive
behaviors a virtual agent should show) and of timescale for solving particular
signal processing issues (e.g recovering features from images of heads in
arbitrary poses).

How Can the Emotional Content of Episodes be Described within a Corpus?
Several broad approaches exist to transcribing the emotional content of an
excerpt - using everyday emotion words; using dimensional descriptions
rooted in psychological theory (intensity, evaluation, activation, power); using
concepts from appraisal theory (perceived goal-conduciveness of a development,
potential for coping, etc). These are being developed in specific ways driven by
goals such as elegance, inter-rater reliability, and faithfulness to the
subtlety of everyday emotion, relevance to agent decisions, etc.  There seems to
be a real prospect of achieving an agreed synthesis of the main schemes.

Which Emotion-related Features Should a Corpus Describe, and How?
Corresponding to each emotion-related channel is one or more sets of signs
relevant to conveying emotion. For instance, paralinguistic signs exist at the
level of basic features - F0, intensity, formant-related properties, and so on;
at the level of linguistic features of prosody ; and at more global levels (tune
shapes, repetitions, etc). Even for speech, inventories of relevant signs need
to be developed, and for channels such as idle body movements, few descriptive
systems have been proposed. Few teams have the expertise to annotate many types
of sign competently, and so it is important to establish ways of allowing teams
that do have the expertise to make their annotations available as part of a
database. Mainly for lower level features, automatic transcription methods
exist, and their role needs to be clarified. In particular, tests of their
reliability are needed, and that depends on data that can serve as a reference.

How Should Access to Corpora be Provided?
Practically, it is clearly important to find ways of establishing a sustainable
and easily expandable multi-modal database for any sorts of emotion-related
data; to develop tools for easily importing and exporting data; to develop
analysis tools and application programmers interfaces to work on the stored data
and meta-data; and to provide ready access to existing data from previous
projects. Approaches to those goals need to be defined.

What Level of Standardisation is Appropriate?
Standardisation is clearly desirable in the long term, but with so many basic
issues unresolved, it is not clear where real consensus can be achieved and
where it is better to encourage competition among different options.

How Can Quality be Assessed?
It is clear that some existing corpora should not be used for serious research.
The problem is to develop quality assurance procedures that can direct potential
users toward those which can.

Ethical Issues in Database Development and Access:
Corpora that show people behaving emotionally are very likely to raise
ethical issues - not simply about signed release forms, but about the
impact of appearing in a public forum talking (for instance) about topics
that distress or excite them. Adequate guidelines need to be developed.

All of the questions above will be studied during the workshop and will
contribute to the study of practical, methodological and technical issues
central to developing emotional corpora (such as the methodologies to be
used for emotional database creation, the coding schemes to be defined, 
the technical settings to be used for the collection, the selection of
appropriate coders).
