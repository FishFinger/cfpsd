MLMI'07 call for posters and demos
(apologies for multiple postings):


                 4th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                  and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI'07)

                          28-30 June 2007
                        Brno, Czech Republic

                       http://www.mlmi07.org


* Important dates

Submission of abstracts for posters and demos:  23 March 2007
Acceptance decisions:  17 April 2007
Workshop:  28-30 June 2007

* Guidelines for submission

For posters and/or demonstrations, extended abstracts of 1-2 pages=
=20
should be submitted at http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/ (PDF format=
).

Following the workshop, authors of posters and demonstrations will be=
=20
invited to submit long versions of their presentations (up to 12 page=
s),=20
to be considered for publication in a volume of revised papers.  In=
=20
common with the previous MLMI workshops, all the papers selected by t=
he=20
Program Committee will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in=
=20
Computer Science series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

For the post-conference submission, the Springer LNCS format for=20
proceedings and other multiauthor volumes will be required=20
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D5-164-7-7237=
6-0).


* Workshop topics

The fourth MLMI workshop will take place in Brno, Czech Republic,=
=20
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005) a=
nd=20
Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the=
=20
different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine=
=20
learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and human-compu=
ter=20
interaction.  MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual confere=
nce=20
of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007, Prag=
ue,=20
June 25-27, 2007).

MLMI'07 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers),=
=20
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submi=
t=20
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine=20
learning and multimodal interaction:
  - human-human communication modeling
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics =
above


* Satellite events

MLMI'07 will feature special sessions and satellite events such as th=
e=20
Summer school of the European Masters in Speech and Language=20
(http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/emasters/) and the PASCAL Speech Separation=
=20
Challenge II (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlincol1/SSC2/).  To prop=
ose=20
other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please contac=
t=20
the organizing committee.


* Venue

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital=
 of=20
Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the country's=
=20
judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of almost four=
=20
hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also the cultural=
=20
center of the region.

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and=
=20
Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km)=
.

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental=20
(http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet pa=
rt=20
of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The local=
=20
organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology=20
(http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was=
=20
founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
