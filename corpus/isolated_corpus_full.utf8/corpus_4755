Meeting Description:

The conference intends to:

- give NooJ users and researchers in Linguistics and in Computational
Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their experience as developers,
researchers and teachers;
- present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP applications
developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities, as well as its future
developments;
- offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic and one
advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP applications using NooJ.
- Present NooJ's Arabic resources to all researchers in Arabic studies:
linguists, computational linguists as well as all researchers who work with/on
Arabic corpora. 

Call for Papers

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used to
formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical and
productive morphology, local, structural and transformational syntax) using a
large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State Automata to Augmented
Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes tools to construct, test, debug,
maintain and
accumulate large sets of linguistic resources, and can apply them to large texts.

Modules for a dozen languages are already available for free download:
Arabic, Armenian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, English, French, Hebrew,
Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. A dozen of other modules are
under construction.

Submission
We invite the submission of papers until the March 29, 2009 either in English or
in French. The abstracts should contain the title of the article, the name, the
institution, the surface mail and the electronic address of each co-author. The
abstracts should not exceed one page, and should be submitted from the workshop
web site: www.miracl.rnu.tn/nooj.

All proposals will be reviewed by the scientific committee. You will be given
notice about the acceptance of the proposals no later than May 04, 2009.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
