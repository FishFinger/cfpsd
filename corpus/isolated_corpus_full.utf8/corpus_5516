CALL FOR PAPERS
1st International ISWC Workshop on Living Web: Making Web Diversity a true
asset

October 26, 2009
Washington DC, USA
http://livingweb.disi.unitn.it/index.html


SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP
The large diversity underlying the content creation process of the Web
contributes a lot to the    wealth and value of the Web. This diversity is a
consequence of many factors (e.g., cultural  background, opinion) and it has
always been largely present in the Web. However, lately it has been
further boosted by the success of Social Web applications. As a consequence,
it has become more   and more difficult to get a balanced view on a given
subject using current search technology.
The goal of this workshop is to discuss and highlight the potentials that
are inherent in diversity and that today are only marginally exploited, as
well as the risk of biasing through the Web. Furthermore, it will discuss
research ideas and results - especially in the area of semantics but also
multimedia and linguistic technologies - that are relevant for enabling
"Living Web" Technology, i.e., technology that more systematically looks
into diversity, helps identifying bias and different viewpoints, and - in
summary - leverages diversity for exploiting its full potential to the Web
user.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
-Extraction of semantic information/semantic annotation
-Multimedia annotation
-Opinion mining and management
-Opinion extraction from multidimensional media
-Handling Ontology heterogeneity and ontology mapping
-Context, contextual ontologies
-Diversity aware classification and clustering technology
-Diversity driven information aggregation technologies
-Semantic clustering
-Diversity aware search and semantic search
-Multimedia retrieval
-Event-based multidimensional media management
-Intelligent (information) visualization technology
-Analysis of socials Web data (especially with respect to diversity)

IMPORTANT DATES
August 11, 2009: Deadline for the submission of papers.
September 15, 2009: Deadline for the notification of acceptance/rejection.
October 2, 2009: Workshop camera ready copy submission.

SUBMISSION
Prospective authors are invited to submit original technical papers of no
more than 8 pages in the standard LNCS paper format. Paper should be
submitted electronically in PDF format. Accepted papers will be published in
the workshop proceedings as a volume of CEUR-WS. Prospective authors are
expected to present their papers at the workshop. Selected papers of the
workshop will be published in a special issue of a journal.
