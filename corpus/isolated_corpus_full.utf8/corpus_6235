Call for Contributions and Participation

NIPS 2009 Workshop on Applications of Topic Models: Text and Beyond
December 11, 2009
http://nips2009.topicmodels.net

Submission Deadline: Friday October 23, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together a diverse set
of researchers from multiple research areas, all of whom work on topic
modeling. Statistical topic models are a class of Bayesian latent
variable models, originally developed for analyzing the semantic
content of large document corpora. With the increasing availability of
other large, heterogeneous data collections, topic models have been
adapted to model data from fields as diverse as computer vision,
finance, bioinformatics, cognitive science, music, and the social
sciences. While the underlying models are often extremely similar,
these communities use topic models in different ways in order to
achieve different goals. This one-day workshop will bring together
topic modeling researchers from multiple disciplines, providing an
opportunity for attendees to meet, present their work and share ideas,
as well as inform the wider NIPS community about current research in
topic modeling. This workshop will address the following specific
goals:

 * Identify and formalize open research areas =96 e.g., how best to
evaluate topic modeling performance both within and across different
application domains
 * Propose, explore, and discuss new application areas
 * Discuss how best to facilitate transfer of research ideas
between application domains
 * Direct future work and generate new application areas, novel
modeling approaches, and unexplored collaborative research directions

We encourage researchers to emphasize real-world applications =96
ranging from specific applications to entire application domains =96 in
their submissions, and welcome the following types of papers:

 * Research papers that propose new topic models for specific applications
 * Research papers that apply existing topic models to novel
application domains
 * Position papers and speculative papers that discuss desiderata
of existing application domains or propose new domains and approaches
for future topic modeling research
 * Papers that discuss practical issues relating to topic models,
such as parallel computation environments and scalability for massive
data collections
 * Papers that investigate evaluation methodologies for topic models

The workshop will consist of invited talks (5 or 6) by established
researchers from multiple research communities, contributed talks (4
or 5), a poster session, and a panel session.

Invited Speakers (confirmed):

David Blei (Princeton University)
Mark Johnson (Brown University)
Eric Xing (Carnegie Mellon University)
Tom Landauer (University of Colorado)
Li Fei-Fei (Stanford University)

Submission Instructions:
