Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics=20

Call Deadline: 27-Sep-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Aim and Scope:

The vast and growing amount of user-generated textual content, including on=
line
news streams, blogs, electronic encyclopedias (e.g., the Wikipedia), and ot=
her
openly accessible and dynamically changing data readily available on the We=
b has
led to the emergence of new approaches to extracting valuable, structured, =
and
previously unknown information from such data. The aim of this workshop is =
to
bring together researchers from academia and industry who develop technolog=
ies
for mining open-source user-generated textual data on the Web, as well as
end-users interested in exploiting such technologies for knowledge discover=
y.
The emphasis is placed on large-scale text mining systems and
application-oriented approaches to processing on-line textual content in th=
e
context of security-related applications. Examples of such applications inc=
lude:=20

- Global medical and epidemic surveillance,=20
- Conflict early warning,=20
- Early detection of man-made or environmental hazards,=20
- Risk assessment,=20
- Border surveillance,=20
- Cross-border crime detection,=20
- Terrorism counterintelligence,=20
- Other applications relevant for security, law enforcement, and public hea=
lth
institutions=20

Due to a multitude of challenges of diverse and complex nature that are rel=
ated
to automating the process of mining user-generated content on the Web, we
believe that this workshop will serve as a forum to bring together research=
ers
from different areas, including data mining, language technology, computati=
onal
linguistics, information sciences, information retrieval and Web mining, fo=
r
sharing ideas and discussion. In particular, we believe that there is an
important gap to be filled, since the aforementioned research communities h=
ave
had limited interaction previously in the context of the topic of the Works=
hop.
The second major goal is to engage governmental and inter-state user
communities, and to bring them together with scientists and funding agencie=
s.

ntric
Media - UCMedia 2009 (http://www.usercentricmedia.org) in Venice, 9-11 Dece=
mber
2009=20

Call for Papers:

Topics of Interest:

- Mining from news streams, blogs, document repositories, and other openly
accessible and dynamically changing data, including Web 2.0 content, for th=
e
purpose of identifying threats to security or public health,=20
- Emphasis on multilingual approaches, and work on languages other than Eng=
lish,=20
- Applications, such as information extraction, classification, summarizati=
on,
sentiment detection, event detection, event forecasting, trend detection,
information fusion, and more,=20
- Contributions in the form of applications (working systems and prototypes=
) as
well as theoretical results are welcome,=20
- Application domains include crisis-related event reporting, political and
environmental analysis, and medical intelligence, under the general umbrell=
a of
the security intelligence domain,=20
- Methods including machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid approaches.=20

Submission:

We invite papers addressing primarily the language technology, natural lang=
uage
processing, data mining and information retrieval communities, as well as t=
he
relevant end-user groups. Submissions are invited in two categories:=20

- Regular: research papers presenting novel approaches and solutions, and=
=20
- Short (posters): system demonstrations, descriptions, and work in progres=
s

Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a web-based submission ser=
ver.
Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNICST style for LaTeX in producing =
the
PDF document. More information on this style can be found at:
