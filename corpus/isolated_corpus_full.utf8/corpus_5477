Call for Papers:

Subject Areas:

In the first subject area, we welcome abstracts dealing with the
methodology, experience, and feedback from an initial curriculum
introduction and the restructuring of both undergraduate and postgraduate
curricula involving the study of languages.

2. Teaching Linguistic Skills in Tertiary Education

Abstracts dealing with the teaching of linguistic skills in tertiary
education fall within the framework of this subject area. The term
linguistic skills should be conceived in a wider sense encompassing not
only the traditional skills (listening, reading, writing and speaking) but
also communication techniques such as translation, interpreting, the
application of Information and Communication Technology in class, etc.  

3. Intercultural Aspects of FLT

In the third subject area we welcome abstracts dealing with the teaching of
foreign languages, focused on the cultural aspects of interlingual
communication. 

4. Interdisciplinary Aspects of FLT, Related to Marketing, the Mass Media, 
Public Relations

In the fourth subject area we welcome abstracts dealing with the
relationship between foreign languages and the managerial and economic
activities in the public as well as in the private sector. The proposed
papers should go into the interaction between foreign languages and
Marketing, the Mass Media and Public Relations.   

5. Foreign Languages and the 'Public Sphere'

The concept of Public Sphere is that of a theater in modern societies in
which political participation is enacted through the medium of speech.
Abstracts in this area have to examine the formation of a critical
discourse, the exploration of ideas and the crystallization of a public
view over FLT.

Abstracts should not exceed 300 words (in English, French or Greek), and
they should have the following form:

-Title of paper
-Name(s) and affiliation of author(s) (principal author's name underlined) 
-Text
