The Third Workshop on Issues in Teaching Computational Linguistics:  
TeachCL-08
                     Held in conjunction with ACL 2008: HLT

                                  Columbus, Ohio
                              June 19th and 20th, 2008

========================================================================

Many of us in this field face the daily challenge of trying to teach
Computer Scientists, Linguists and/or Psychologists together.
Following the success of the two previous ACL workshops (2002 and
2005, http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~radev/TeachingNLP/) on this theme, we
are holding a 2-day workshop associated with ACL-HLT 2008 to carefully
examine various approaches to this task, and to explore techniques
specifically aimed at teaching computer science to linguists and
linguistics to computer scientists.  (Details about paper submission
are given at the end of this announcement.)  As Computational
Linguistics (hopefully) becomes of more and more relevance to
industrial applications, we must ensure that our students (both
undergraduate and graduate) are given adequate preparation for
functioning in a practical industrial environment as well as an
academic research environment.    We will exchange views on
appropriate curriculum for both undergraduate students and graduate
students, and linguists (including psycholinguists) and computer
scientists.  There are many questions to be addressed about the
necessary background for linguists and computer scientists before they
can
communicate effectively with each other and learn at the same pace.

How much math is necessary?

Is it possible to teach linguists Natural Language Processing techniques
independently of teaching programming?

Can undergraduates hold their own in graduate courses?

Can linguists and computer scientists make separate but equal
contributions to term projects?

How can linguistics students get ACL publications?

What special methodologies are needed to evaluate NLP systems in
Robot-Human Agent environments?

This is intended to be a "working" workshop that will include lengthy
discussion sessions inspired by three panels:

1) Chris Brew will organize a panel of industrialists to address the  
issue of
industry expectations for Computational Linguists;

2) Emily Bender and Fei Xia will organize a panel around the theme of
essential curriculum for computational linguistics;

3) Gina Levow will organize a panel on techniques for teaching
extremely interdisciplinary classes.

We will also have invited presentations by Lori Levin and Drago Radev
showcasing the recent very successful participation of American high
school students in the International Linguistics Olympiad.

In addition to these themes we would also like to invite the
submission of papers addressing the following topics:

1) Teaching Computer Science to Linguists
2) Teaching Linguistics to Computer Scientists
3) Teaching Computational Linguistics to Computer Scientists and
Linguists jointly.
4) Teaching graduate students and/or undergraduate students
5) Tools and technology for aiding the teaching of computational  
linguistics.
6) Any other topics of general relevance to teaching computational
linguistics,
such as:
          #  Effective course lectures
          # Innovative assignments and projects
          # Web resources
          # Connecting teaching and research
          # Seminar-style courses
          # Choice of programming languages (and programming  
requirements
in general)

We would also encourage all of the participants to come to the
workshop with a prepared handout (and possibly a poster) summarizing
their university's requirements for studying computational linguistics
with short course descriptions of each course.  This would allow us to
produce a compendium of alternative program styles and ideally a
consensus on essential elements comprising the answer to
"What should be an ideal curriculum for a CL Major of the 21st century?"

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission date - March 14, 2008.

Papers to reviewers - March 19, 2008.

Reviews due - April 7

Results to authors - April 14

Camera-ready papers from authors - Apr 21, 2008


SUBMISSION DETAILS:

A paper submitted to TeachCL-08 must describe original, unpublished  
work.
Submit a full paper of no more than 8 pages in PDF format by March 14,
2008, electronically through a web form at
https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS09/submit.html

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Submissions should follow
the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should not exceed
eight (8) pages, including references.  We strongly recommend the use
of the ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files.  Papers must
conform to the official ACL 2008 style guidelines.

In the submission form, you will be asked for the following
information: paper title,
authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses, contact author's
email address, a list of keywords, abstract, and an indication of
whether the paper has been simultaneously submitted to other
conferences (and if so which conferences). The contact author of an
accepted paper under multiple submissions should inform the program
co-chairs immediately whether he or she intends the accepted paper to
appear in TeachCL-08. A paper that appears in TeachCL-08 must be
withdrawn from other conferences.

Authors of accepted submissions are to produce a final paper to be
published in the proceedings of the workshop, which will be
available at the conference for participants, and distributed
afterwards by ACL. Final papers must follow the ACL 2008 style and
are due April 21, 2008.
