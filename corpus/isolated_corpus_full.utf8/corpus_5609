Ontology and Semantic Web Services for Knowledge Management
Second International Workshop on
Knowledge Acquisition, Reuse and Evaluation

In conjunction with the fourth IEEE international conference on =20
Signal-Image Technology & Internet Based Systems

(SITIS 2009)

November 29th - December 4rd, 2009, Marrakech, Morocco

Description
******************
The International Workshop on Knowledge Acquisition, Reuse and =20
Evaluation aims to bring together researchers, scientists, engineers, =20
and scholar students to exchange and share their experiences, new =20
ideas, and research results about all aspects of Knowledge, Ontology =20
and Sermantic Web Services Engineering. We will discuss the practical =20
challenges encountered and the solutions adopted.

This workshop will focus on the theoreticians and practitioners =20
concerned with developing methods and systems that assist the =20
knowledge management process and assessing the suitability of such =20
methods. Thus, the workshop includes all aspects of acquiring, =20
modeling and managing knowledge, and their role in the construction of =20
knowledge-based systems. Knowledge acquisition still remains the =20
bottleneck for building a knowledge based system. Reuse and sharing of =20
knowledge bases are major issues and no satisfactory solutions have =20
been agreed upon yet. There is a wide range of research. Much of the =20
work in this field has been knowledge acquisition. The advent of the =20
age of digital information has brought the problem of knowledge reuse =20
and knowledge evaluation. Our ability to analyze, evaluate and assist =20
user in reusing knowledge present a great challenge of the next years. =20
A new generation of computational techniques and tools is required to =20
support the acquisition, the reuse and the evaluation of useful =20
knowledge from the rapidly growing volume of information. All of these =20
are to be discussed in this workshop.

********
Topics
********
A non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop includes the following:

? Tools and techniques for knowledge acquisition, knowledge update and =20
knowledge validation
? Semantic web inference methodologies
? Semantic knowledge portals
? Web-based approaches for knowledge management
? Agent-based approaches for knowledge management
? Software agents for semantic web
? Semantic web-based knowledge management
? Tools, languages, and techniques for semantic annotation
? Semantic searching
? Semantic brokering
? CSCW and cooperative approaches for knowledge management
? Agent-based approaches for knowledge management
? Evaluation of knowledge acquisition techniques
? Information and knowledge structures
? Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modeling
? Ontology creation, evolution, reconciliation, and mediation
? Ontology-based approaches for knowledge management
? Knowledge delivery methods
? Knowledge life cycle
? Knowledge and information extraction and discovery techniques
? Corporate Semantic Webs for knowledge management
? Peer-to-peer approaches for knowledge management
? Knowledge extraction from images/pictures
? Intelligent knowledge-based systems
? Decision support and expert systems
? Re-usability of software/knowledge/information
