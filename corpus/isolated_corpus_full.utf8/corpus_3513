Preliminary Call for Papers

With apologies for cross-posting

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICBO: International Conference on Biomedical Ontology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
University at Buffalo, NY, July 24-26, 2009

Ontologies are being used in a variety of ways by researchers in
almost every life science discipline, and their use in annotation of
both clinical and experimental data is now a common technique in
integrative translational research. Principles-based ontologies are
being developed for the description of biological and biomedical
phenomena of almost every different type. To be maximally effective,
such ontologies must work well together. But as ontologies become more
commonly used, the problems involved in achieving coordination in
ontology development become ever more urgent. To address these
problems there is a need for an overarching conference involving
representatives of all major communities involved in the development
and application of ontologies in biomedicine. The ICBO conference is
designed to meet this need. It will be held in conjunction with four
days of tutorials and classes to be scheduled from July 20-23, 2009.

Papers are invited in the following areas:

Ontologies for Chemistry and Molecular Biology
Ontologies in Literature Curation, Text and Data Mining
Ontologies for Clinical and Translational Medicine
Ontologies for Cell Biology
Ontologies for Biomedical Investigations
Ontology Engineering
Ontologies and Standards
Disease Ontologies

Areas of special focus will include:

Ontologies and the treatment of patient data
Biomedical ontology and the Semantic Web
The OBO Foundry and other ontology federations
Reasoning with biomedical ontologies
Evaluation of biomedical ontologies
Minimal Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations
(MIBBI) and related standards
Defining disease in a new era of molecular medicine
Ontology and natural language processing
The role of ontology in the future of scientific publishing

Papers for presentation at ICBO must be submitted before March 31,
2009.
Guidelines for submission will be published at 
http://icbo.buffalo.edu/.

Organizing Committee: Barry Smith (Chair), University of Buffalo
Michael Ashburner, Cambridge University
Judith Blake, Jackson Laboratory
Suzanna Lewis (Co-Chair), Lawrence Berkeley Labs
Yves Lussier, University of Chicago
Mark Musen, Stanford University
Alan Ruttenberg, Science Commons
Susanna-Assunta Sansone, EBI
Chris Stoeckert, University of Pennsylvania

ICBO is sponsored by the University at Buffalo College of Arts and
Sciences, the National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR), the
National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) and Science Commons.

Participation in this meeting by women, minorities, and persons with
disabilities is strongly encouraged.
