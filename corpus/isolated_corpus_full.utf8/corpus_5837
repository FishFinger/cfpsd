LTC2009+LRL2009 - Extended submission deadline - September 6

=20

Dear Colleagues,

We recieved several letters asking for paper submission deadline =
extension.=20

=20

Due to the arrangement with the Publishers of confernce proceedings we =
are
now in possibility to extend the deadline.=20

The new deadline is September 6. Any further extension will not be =
possible
because of obvious technological constraints. As many authors succeeded =
to
send us their submissions within the initially fixed deadline, we will =
start
the evaluation procedure now.=20

=20

Please visit time to time the conference www site (www.ltc.amu.edu.pl) =
where
new, important information about the conference and related events will
sistematically appear.

=20

We hope to see you in Pozna=F1.

Best regards

Zygmunt Vetulani, LTC 2009 Chair

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language Technologies =
as a
Challenge

for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC 2009), a meeting organized by =
the
Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz =
University,
Pozna=F1, Poland in cooperation with the Adam Mickiewicz University =
Foundation
(co-organizer), will take place on November 6-8, 2009.

=20

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for =
computer
science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become an ever =
more
essential element of our everyday technological environment. Since the =
very
beginning of the Computer and Information  Age these fields have =
influenced
and stimulated each other. The European Union strongly supports HLT =
under
the 7th Framework Program. These efforts as well as technological, =
social
and cultural globalization have created a favorable climate for the
intensive exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across =
initially
distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange and
invite you to join us at LTC in November 6-8, 2009, as well as at the
FlaReNet workshop (LRL 2009, on November 5, 2009) on the theme "Getting
Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!".

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

=20

Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

=20

Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 - 18h00) + cocktail

=20

Theme:

Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the challenge =
of
Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is necessary to have =
access to
Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT performances. To this regard, =
the
situation is very different across the different languages. Little or =
sparse
data exist for languages in countries or regions where limited efforts =
have
been devoted to such issues in the past, also known as Less-Resourced
Languages (LRL). The workshop aims at reporting the needs, at presenting
achievements and at proposing solutions for the future, both in terms of =
LR
and of LT evaluation, especially in the European, Euro-Mediterranean and
regional frameworks. This will allow to identity the factors that have =
an
impact on a potential and shared roadmap towards supplying LR and LT for =
all
languages.

=20

Topics:

-          Experience in the production, validation and distribution of =
LR
for less-resourced languages

-          Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced =
languages

-          Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in =
less-resourced
languages

-          Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages,
language clustering.)

-          To be completed.

=20

Co-Chairs: Joseph Mariani (LIMSI-CNRS & IMMI-CNRS), Khalid Choukri(ELRA =
