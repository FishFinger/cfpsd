                                Call for Papers

     Special Issue on Biomedical Natural Language Processing
                    Journal of Biomedical Informatics

                               Guest Editors:
        Wendy W. Chapman, PhD, K. Bretonnel Cohen, PhD

                    Submission deadline: May 27, 2008
******************************************************
BioNLP is biomedical natural language processing, or the application of nat=
ural language processing and text mining to the biomedical, clinical, and g=
enomic domains. The goal of this special issue of the Journal of Biomedical=
 Informatics (JBI) is to publish papers describing novel work at the forefr=
ont of the new challenges and possibilities that face the BioNLP community =
today.

The last decade saw rapid growth in the area of BioNLP. This body of work h=
as resulted in quantitative and qualitative differences in both the types o=
f tasks we can undertake and the levels of performance on those tasks. Ther=
e has been a recent resurgence of work in foundational, lower-level linguis=
tic analysis tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and s=
emantic role labeling. There has also been a new emphasis on higher-level a=
pplication-oriented work such as automated ICD9-CM code assignment, use of =
NLP in clinical decision support, and management of the rapid growth in the=
 primary biomedical literature. These recent advances in foundational techn=
ologies and in application types and domains have created the possibility o=
f a new era in biomedical text mining.  The special issue is intended to he=
lp define and provide insights into that future.

We solicit papers on new methodologies applied to text from biomedical, cli=
nical, or genomic domains. In addition to original research papers, as is J=
BI=92s custom, we are soliciting one or more methodological review papers o=
n BioNLP methodologies. Possible topics for this special issue include, but=
 are not limited to, the following subjects as applied to biomedical text:

=B7        Morphological processing
=B7        Part-of-speech tagging
=B7        Syntactic parsing
=B7        Tokenization
=B7        Coordination and conjunction processing
=B7        Negation and uncertainty identification
=B7        Word sense disambiguation
=B7        Reference resolution
=B7        Temporal modeling from text
=B7        Information retrieval
=B7        Information extraction and encoding
=B7        Text classification
=B7        Text summarization
=B7        Question-answering
=B7        Development and evaluation of annotation schemas
=B7        Corpus and test set generation and evaluation
=B7        Software testing and engineering for natural language processing=
 applications

In accordance with JBI=92s editorial policies, we are soliciting full-lengt=
h article submissions that present and evaluate new methods rather than the=
 application or evaluation of existing approaches (see editorial guidelines=
 at http://www.elsevier.com/locate/yjbin).

Any questions regarding the special issue may be sent to the guest editors =
at jbi-nlp@list.pitt.edu. We welcome advance notice of your intention to su=
bmit a paper. Inquiries about suitability should include the subject line "=
suitability inquiry" and a short paragraph describing the primary objective=
 of the manuscript, emphasizing how the objective matches the JBI editorial=
 guidelines cited above.

Submissions: Manuscripts should be submitted to the JBI authors=92 gateway =
(http://ees.elsevier.com/jbi/) no later than May 27, 2008. Please be sure t=
hat your manuscript follows the JBI instructions for authors available on t=
hat web site. You will be offered an opportunity to specify the special iss=
ue (=93Biomedical NLP=94) as the preferred venue when you submit your manus=
cript to the gateway.

All appropriate submissions will be reviewed by at least two evaluators in =
addition to the editors.  Papers returned for revisions should generally be=
 revised and resubmitted within four weeks.  Accepted manuscripts are immed=
iately made available on the JBI web site in Science Direct (http://www.sci=
encedirect.com/science/journal/15320464) and indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE.  Th=
us they will become widely accessible even before the print version of the =
special issue is published.  Papers judged inappropriate for the special is=
sue may be referred to the JBI editor-in-chief to be considered for publica=
tion in a regular issue of the journal.
