Linguistic Field(s): Ling & Literature 

Call Deadline: 10-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

Discussions of linguistic or other conventional means of indicating that a
stretch of discourse might be fictional. 

Discussions solicited of linguistic or other conventional means used to indicate
that a stretch of discourse is fictional. Discussion of such markers can also
address how they can be defeated and otherwise exploited by narrative writers,
obviously: the working assumption will be that there is no device that, of
itself, Guagantees the fictional status of the discourse in which it appears. --
Or perhaps there is? Since this question stands at the frontier of current
research, it needs a thorough discussion. Inaugurating one is the goal of the
panel.  Proposals mixing generalities with multiple examples will be preferred.
Critiques of previous treatments are also pertinent.

Proposals (300-500 words) by 10 March to David Gorman (dgorman@niu.edu). A short
CV or the equivalent will be helpful, too, but what I really need to know is
whether or not you are an MLA member.
