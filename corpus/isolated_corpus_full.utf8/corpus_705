NAACL HLT 2007 Workshop:=20
Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2007


The Document Understanding Conference (DUC) is a series of
summarization evaluations that have been conducted by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 2001.  Its goal is
to further progress in automatic text summarization and enable
researchers to participate in large-scale experiments in both the
development and evaluation of summarization systems.  DUC 2007 has two
system tasks: The main task is to produce 250-word summaries of
multiple documents in answer to a complex question; the update summary
task is to produce short summaries of newswire articles under the
assumption that the user has already read a set of earlier articles.
The workshop will include the results of the DUC 2007 evaluation,
papers from task participants, and discussion of future tasks.

Organizers:

 Hoa Trang Dang, NIST
 Donna Harman, NIST

Application to participate due: Nov 19

Submissions will be handled through the workshop home page.

Computational Approaches to Figurative Language

Figurative language, such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms, among others,=20
is in abundance in natural discourse. The recognition of figurative
language use and the computation of figurative language meaning=20
constitute one of the hardest problems for a variety of natural=20
language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text=20
summarization, and question answering. As natural language processing
moves to an unprecedented new stage, it has become more urgent than=20
ever to tackle the bottleneck presented by figurative language. This=20
workshop will provide a venue for researchers in this area to=20

NAACL HLT 2007 Workshop:=20
Confidence Estimation for Natural Language Processing

Confidence estimation (CE) is a method for automatically estimating
the reliability of output generated by NLP systems. It is useful in
scenarios where the underlying systems make errors, especially when
human users are involved.  This is the case in many areas of NLP,
because systems are known to be imperfect. Applications can exploit
knowledge of likely mistakes to improve their interactions with
users and thereby enhance their overall effectiveness.
The workshop aims at bringing researchers from different NLP fields
together. We would like to provide a forum for sharing ideas,
techniques, and experience on common aspects of CE across different
areas of NLP. We hope to provide an opportunity for researchers to learn
from previous and ongoing work in other fields.

Organizers:

 Nicola Ueffing, National Research Council Canada
 George Foster, National Research Council Canada

TextGraphs-2: Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing

In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as
nodes in a graph and relations between them can be represented as
edges. Recent research has shown that graph-based representations of
linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give
rise to novel and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks. This
workshop focuses on graph-based algorithms for natural language
processing and on the theory of graph-based methods.

Organizers:

   Chris Biemann, University of Leipzig
   Irina Matveeva, University of Chicago
   Rada Mihalcea, University of North Texas
   Dragomir Radev, University of Michigan

Full paper submissions due: January 29

NAACL HLT 2007 Workshop:=20
Bridging the Gap: Academic and Industrial Research in Dialog =
Technologies

In the past decade, we have seen a rapid increase of dialog systems in
various industrial applications, including telephone-based services,
in-car interaction systems, internet-based customer support, talking
characters in computer games, and mobile devices. Industry-driven
standards, such as VoiceXML, are also becoming popular. While there
has been an increased amount of effort in dialog technology research
in the academic world, progress from such academic research has not
benefited the real world applications to a satisfactory extent. The
purpose of this one day workshop is to provide a forum to bring
industrial and academic researchers together to share their
experiences and visions in the dialog technology development, and to
identify topics that are of interest to both camps.

Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST)

Tree-structured mappings between languages are widely recognized as
desirable for statistical machine translation, and there is mounting
interest in approaches built on a family of formalisms that includes
synchronous/transduction grammars and their tree transducer
equivalents. From this formal basis, there has been rapid progress on
many different fronts, ranging from purely mathematical results to
very strong showings in large-scale evaluations. The workshop on
Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation seeks to bring
together researchers working on diverse aspects of
synchronous/transduction grammars in relation to statistical machine
translation, to build stronger connections in this area and stimulate
further progress.
