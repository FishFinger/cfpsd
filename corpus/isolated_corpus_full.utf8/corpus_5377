> Motivation
> 
> It is widely acknowledged that despite the great advances in
> Computational Linguistics nowadays, the creation of new
> Language Resources (LR) and Language Technology (LT) for a
> new domain or task is still quite expensive and
> time-consuming. At the same time there are already a lot of
> varieties of LR and LT, developed for various languages and
> purposes. What happens when new tasks come? Do we have to
> develop new resources and technology from the beginning, or
> can we re-use or adapt the existent ones? Last, but not
> least alternative is to combine both strategies depending on
> the task. The first option seems reasonable when richer and
> larger data is needed for the new applications. The second
> option is justified only if such a resource or technology
> does not exist at all, or some new approach is applied. The
> third one is the ever ?compromising?, but also very
> realistic option.
> As the machine learning techniques have matured enough to
> successfully support real applications within various
> domains, a new bottleneck became the requirement for large
> and adequate training data for input. Thus, the NLP
> community faced the question of the relevant LR and LT
> adaptation. It concerns the operability between general
> domain NLP toolkits and specific domain tasks with respect
> to terminology, language, structure, steps of preprocessing
> etc.
> Thus, the Workshop is devoted to various methods for
> transferring the linguistic knowledge and supportive
> technology from the existing language resources in one
> domain into a different one.
> 
> Topics
> 
> - parameters of adaptivity and re-usability of LR and LT
> - methods for adaptation of existing NLP resources to specific tasks
> - domain specific requirements to the LR and LT
> - general domain vs. specific domain processing
> - profiling LR
