Full Title: Current Issues in Language Planning 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics;Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2009 

CILP is announcing a Call for Papers for a forthcoming issue on 'Language
Planning and Feminism'.

The focus of feminist language planning has typically been to remove gender
bias from language. Different solutions have been adopted for this in
different countries and for different languages and in some cases,
proposals for feminist language reform have evolved between different
possible responses. It is important to document the range of responses
feminist language planning has proposed and the political, social and
linguistic contexts these have sought to address.

Feminist language planning has usually been associated with a political
agenda to address gender imbalances as they are represent and communicated
through language forms. This work has largely begun as a grass roots
movement in which feminists have articulated the perceived problem and
proposed solutions often without the agency to effect these solutions. It
has usually only been later that governments and other language planning
bodies began to address these issues. This movement from language planning
activism to language planning activity is one of the particular dimensions
of feminist language planning which needs to be explored.

It is also important for language planning scholars to consider the wider
impacts that feminist philosophies and theories have had on language
planning as an activity and to understand how language planning articulates
with wider debates.

This volumes aims to provide a forum in which the complexity of the
feminist contribution to language planning can be explored.

The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 31 October 2009.
The deadline for receipt of the final paper is 31 May 2010.

It is anticipated papers will be published in Vol 12,1. 2011.  

Please send abstracts (approx. 250-300 words) to Professor Tony Liddicoat
Tony.Liddicoat@unisa.edu.au
