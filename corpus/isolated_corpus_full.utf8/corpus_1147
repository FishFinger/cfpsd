ACM SenSys 2007: Call for Papers
The 5th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems
November 6-9, 2007* (subject to confirmation)
Sydney, Australia
http://sensys.acm.org/2007/
=============================================================================

Sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, SIGMOBILE, SIGARCH, SIGOPS, SIGMETRICS and
SIGBED (approval pending); with support from NSF.

The 5th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)
is a highly selective, single-track forum for the presentation of
research results on systems issues in the area of embedded, networked
sensors. Distributed systems based on networked sensors and actuators
with embedded computation capabilities enable an instrumentation
of the physical world at an unprecedented scale and density, thus
enabling a new generation of monitoring and control applications. This
conference provides an ideal venue to address the research challenges
facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these
systems. Sensor networks require contributions from many fields, from .....

Call for Papers - BPM 2007

5th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT
http://bpm07.fit.qut.edu.au

Brisbane, Australia, 24-27 September 2007
Organized by the
BPM Research Group
Faculty of Information Technology
Queensland University of Technology


BPM 2007 is the fifth in a conference series that provides one of the most prestigious forums for researchers and practitioners in all aspects of business process management. The conference has a record of attracting innovative research of the highest quality related to all aspects of business process management (theory, frameworks, methods, techniques, software architectures, empirical findings).

One explicit aim of BPM 2007 will be to provide a unique forum for bridging the viewpoints of leading research outcomes with practical demands. In addition to the main research track, BPM 2007 will include an industrial papers track. For this, the conference encourages industry practitioners to submit experience and application papers reporting on innovative industrial implementations and applications of business process management methods and techniques, with particular focus on their impact on current information technology or business practice. These papers have to go beyond mature prototypes and potentially applicable methodologies and techniques but have to be based on industry experiences or empirical data.

Awards will be given to the best papers in different categories. In addition, selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the journal Data and Knowledge Engineering.

BPM 2007 will be held in Brisbane, Australia and will be organized by the Business Process Management Research Group, Faculty of Information Technology of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The event will be conducted at the Gardens Point Campus of QUT. The campus is located in the Central Business District of Brisbane, the fastest growing town in Australia. With 1,7 mio. people, Brisbane offers all the infrastructure and facilities of a global hub for technology and tourism.

Topics include, but are not limited to: .....

Overview
--------
Interest in the role of artificial intelligence in interactive systems
has grown rapidly in recent years, in part because increasingly powerful
consumer hardware makes research-level AI usable in real-world games
and/or immersive learning environments. Accompanying this, there has
been a sharp escalation in the number of research questions related
to the use of agent technologies to shape human experiences in complex
environments. A number of tensions accompany the use of agents in these
contexts, since the goal is not to simulate autonomous agents for their
own sake, but to use them to
create an interactive experience with a pre-defined goal for the human .....

Workshop Background and Goals
-----------------------------
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication
technology that uses radio-frequency waves to transfer information
between tagged objects and readers without line of sight. This creates
tremendous opportunities for linking various objects from real world.
These objects are numbered, identified, catalogued, and tracked.
In recent years, RFID has gained a significant momentum and is emerging .....
