Meeting Description:

KR 2008
Eleventh International Conference on
Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Sydney, Australia, September 16 - 19, 2008
Collocated with NMR-08, ICAPS-08, CP-08

The single registration fee includes attendance to most events for all conferences

http://www.kr.org/KR2008/

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) is a vibrant and exciting field of
human endeavour. KR&R techniques are key drivers of innovation in computer
science, and they have led to significant advances in practical applications in
a wide range of areas from Artificial Intelligence to Software Engineering.

Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by reasoning engines are an
integral and crucial component of intelligent systems. Semantic Web
technologies, the design of software agents and Bio-Informatics technologies, in
particular, provide significant challenges for KR&R.

We intend KR2008 to be a forum for the exchange of new ideas, issues, and
results among the community of researchers in the principles and practices of 
KR&R systems. We encourage papers presenting substantial new results in the
principles of KR&R systems that clearly contribute to the formal foundations or
show the applicability of the results to implemented or implementable systems. 

We also encourage 'reports from the field' of building knowledge bases,
applications, experiments, developments, and tests. Such papers should be 
explicitly identified as reports from the field by the authors, to ensure
appropriate reviewing, and should include a section on evaluation. 

Updated Call for Papers:

Papers must be submitted in AAAI style (pdf only)

http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php

Paper length is 7 pages maximum including title, author information and
references. Authors may add to the paper an optional, clearly marked Appendix
containing technical material (such as proofs, evaluation results etc.)
supporting claims made in the paper. The Appendix must not exceed 2 additional
pages in AAAI style. The evaluation of the submission will be based on the
quality of the paper. The optional Appendix will be used in case reviewers are
in doubt about claimed results.

Submission will be through the Easychair conference management system

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008

Conference proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. Final versions of papers
will be considerably longer than the submissions: for each accepted paper 11
pages in AAAI style  will be allocated in the proceedings.

Topics of interest include:
- Exception tolerant and inconsistency-tolerant reasoning, Paraconsistent logics
- Nonmonotonic logics, Default logics, Conditional logics, Argumentation
- Temporal and spatial reasoning
- Causal reasoning, Abduction, Model-based diagnosis
- Reasoning about action and change, Action languages, Situation calculus,
Dynamic logic
- Reasoning, planning, or decision making under uncertainty
- Representations of vagueness, Many-valued and fuzzy logics
- Graphical representations for belief and preference
- Reasoning about belief and knowledge, Epistemic and doxastic logics,
- Multiagent logics of belief and knowledge
- Logic programming, Constraint logic programming, Answer set programming
- Computational aspects of knowledge representation
- Concept formation, Similarity-based reasoning
- Belief revision and update, Belief merging, Information fusion
- Description logics, Ontologies
- Qualitative reasoning, Reasoning about physical systems
- Decision theory, Preference modelling and representation, Reasoning about
preference
- KR & Autonomous Agents: Intelligent Agents, Cognitive Robotics
- KR & Multiagent Systems: Negotiation, Group decision making,
- Cooperation, Interaction, KR & game theory
- Natural language processing, Summarization, Categorization
- KR and machine learning, Inductive logic programming, Knowledge discovery and
acquisition
- WWW querying languages, Information retrieval and web mining, Website
selection and configuration
