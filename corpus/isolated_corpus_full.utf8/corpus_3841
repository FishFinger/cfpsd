NAACL-HLT 2009 Student Research Workshop
May 31-June 5, 2009 in Boulder, CO

(the Student Research Workshop will be held during the NAACL-HLT
2009 Conference)

CALL FOR PAPERS

Paper Submission Deadline: Dec 15, 2008

Unless otherwise stated, all submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST
on the specified day.

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback from a general
audience as well as from panelists. The panelists are experienced
researchers who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in
advance of the presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to
the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask
for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by
an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop
will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come
from any topic area within computational linguistics and is understood
to be applied to speech and/or text. A list of topic areas is provided
in the Call for Papers for the NAACL HLT 2009 Conference available at:

http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/call_for_papers.html

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is original and unpublished research.
The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who
have settled on their thesis direction but still have significant
research left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their
papers.
