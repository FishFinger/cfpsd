Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The seminar aims to promote the interaction and collaboration among researchers
interested in recent functionalist, cognitivist and/or constructionist
approaches with special focus on present-day English. Specifically, the seminar
is intended to be a forum for the discussion of virtually any theoretical and/or
descriptive/applied aspect concerning grammar, the lexicon and discourse, and in
particular controversial areas such as: the relationship between syntax and all
facets of meaning construction, the boundaries between grammar and the lexicon,
argument structure configuration, the interaction between lexical and
constructional templates, pragmatic inferencing, implicature and illocutionary
meaning, and the potential of metonymic operations in speech act configuration. 

Call for Papers

Submissions are invited for ESSE seminar S.21:
'Meaning Construction: Functionalist, Cognitivist and Constructionist Approaches'.

Convenors:
Prof. Annalisa Baicchi (University of Pavia)
e-mail: annalisa.baicchi@unipv.it

Prof. Francisco Gonzálvez-García (University of Almería)
e-mail: fgonza@ual.es

General Information:
Those wishing to participate in the Conference are invited to submit 200-word
abstracts of their proposed papers directly to both convenors of the seminar in
question before 1st March 2008. The convenors will let the proponents know
whether their proposals have been accepted no later than 21 March 2008.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral
presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply reading
their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced versions of the papers
are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in question.

There will be a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar session, and
convenors should plan so that there is time for discussion between speakers and
with the audience.

Meeting Description:

LREC 2008 Workshop 'Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008)' 

Call for Shared Task Participation

LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008) 

Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Deadline: Friday, 14 March 2008 (Shared Task)
Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for collecting, sharing
and exploiting MWE evaluation resources. Following an earlier call, numerous
contributors have submitted data sets of various kinds, which can now be
downloaded from the Multiword homepage: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/

With this call, we invite teams to participate in a shared task on multiword
extraction, based on a subset of the new resources. For this first and
exploratory evaluation campaign, we decided to focus on the simplest and most
straightforward task - ranking MWE candidates - in order to make it easier for
participating teams to adapt their existing systems before the deadline on March
14th.

Participating teams have to apply a MWE candidate ranking algorithm to at
least three different data sets, provided in the form of a list of MWE
candidates that have been manually annotated as true positives (TP) and false
positives (FP). Evaluation is carried out by the teams themselves in terms of
n-best precision, precision-recall graphs and mean average precision (sample R
scripts will be provided on the shared task homepage soon). Further analysis and
experiments are strongly encouraged (e.g. on different subsets of the
candidates, or for different subtypes of MWE). Baseline results for standard
association measures will be presented by the workshop organisers.

More information and downloads can be found on the shared task homepage:
http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwe2008/shared_task.html

Teams planning to participate in the shared task should also join the multiword
mailing list for up-to-date information and discussions:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/multiword-expressions

We expect a full-fledged competition with a more varied range of tasks to be
organised in the near future, making use of the full collection of data sets
from this workshop.

Submission Information:
Shared task participants have to submit a short paper with complete evaluation
results for their ranking algorithm on at least three different data sets.

Submissions are not anonymous and will be briefly reviewed by the workshop
organisers for compliance with the shared task requirements.

Papers must adhere to the format of LREC proceedings (preferably using the
style files provided on the conference Web site) and must not exceed four (4)
pages, including references. Only submissions in PDF format will be
considered.

The papers must be submitted no later than 23:59 GMT on March 14, 2008.

Please submit your paper here: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/MWE2008/submit.html

In addition, participants should make available their full candidate rankings
and, if possible, an implementation of their ranking algorithm, to encourage
further experiments. Details will be discussed on the multiword mailing list.

Important Dates:
8-page regular paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
4-page resource paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
4-page shared task paper submission deadline: March 14, 2008
Notification of acceptance: March 28, 2008 
Camera ready papers due: April 4, 2008
Workshop date: June 1, 2008

Workshop Chairs:
Nicole Grégoire 
University of Utrecht, The Netherlands 
Stefan Evert 
University of Osnabrueck, Germany
Brigitte Krenn
Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (ÖFAI), Austria
