Linguistic Field(s): History of Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

History of Linguistics, Missionary linguistics and Revitalising Older Linguistic
Documentation (16th-ca.19th century). 

Call for Papers

After the discovery of the New World the Europeans began to establish their
hegemony in a new continent. European expansion, colonisation and
christianization of a large number and variety of Amerindian tribes was
accompanied by the study and recording of the native languages of the Americas.
In the same period, Christian missionary activities escalated in Asia,
especially the Far East, and in Russia, and a little later in Africa. In the
early 19th century, the Pacific became a new "America" for missionary
linguistics. This congress aims to outline the state of research done in the
field. The subjects are to some extent limited in time (focusing primarily on
the period 1492-1850) but not in space. This conference aims particularly at
inter-relating grammars written in different languages (Latin, Spanish,
Portuguese, English, French, Dutch, etc.), by missionaries of different orders
(Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits, etc.), and in different continents. We wish
to 'globalise' the discipline, crossing national and linguistic frontiers in
order to create new views and to open new horizons.

Papers
Each paper is allotted 30 minutes, including discussion. That leaves 20 minutes for
the presentation and 10 minutes for the discussion. 

This congress aims to outline the state of research done in the field. The subjects
are to some extent limited in time (focusing primarily on the period 1492-ca.1850)
but not in space: we wish to 'globalise' the discipline, crossing national and
linguistic frontiers in order to create new views and to open new horizons. 

We invite the participants to concentrate on the following issues:
- Missionary linguistics and linguistic thinking and grammatical theory in general 
- Historical and political implications of missionary linguistics 
- Methodology of description in missionary linguistics 
- Didactic and pedagogical features of missionary grammars 
- Innovations of individual missionaries. (lexicography, grammatical analysis,
phonology, morphology, syntax) 
- Differences and/or similarities of works from different continents 
- Differences and /or similarities between works written in Latin, Spanish,
Portuguese, French, English, Dutch, etc. 
- Catholic and Protestant linguistic works 
- The sources of missionary works (Latin, vernacular, etc.) 
- The 16th and 17th century compared with the 18th century and (early) 19th
century and the question of periodization in linguistic theory 

The organisers aim at publishing a book with a selection of the best papers from
the conference. All authors who have presented their papers at the conference
are invited to submit their papers for consideration for the proceedings. 

Deadlines
March, 1 st, 2009: 
- Deadline of subscription 
- Summaries of the lectures. Languages: English or Spanish. Max. 2.500
characters. Mention: Name, institution, address, e-mail. 

June, 1st, 2009: 
- You will be informed if your lecture has been accepted and we send you the
provisional program. 

We have the intention to publish a selection of the best papers.
