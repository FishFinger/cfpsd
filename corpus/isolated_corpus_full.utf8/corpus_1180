  Dear Colleagues:
     
     We are excited to announce this unique interdisciplinary workshop
     at the premier ICWS conference on the emerging issues arising
     from the interplay of service-oriented Internet technologies with
     bio-medical research and applications.  This is expected to be a
     world-class forum bringing together both computer and domain
     scientists and practitioners, featuring papers reviewed by the
     high-caliber program committee we have assembled as well as
     keynote/invited talks and panel/tutorial discussions on hot
     topics.  The papers will be published by IEEE CS Press (hardcopy
     and online).
     
     Please encourage your students and colleagues to submit 5-page
     extended abstacts (deadline: March 10, 2007).  Details are in the
     CFP below.
     
     Program Co-Chairs:
     Phil Bourne, University of California, San Diego
     Shamkant B. Navathe, Georgia Institute of Technology
     Sushil K. Prasad, Georgia State University

     Call for Papers
     
     The Ist IEEE International Workshop on Service Oriented
     Technologies for Biological Databases and Tools (SOBDAT 2007)
     http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~hipc/sobdat07/
     In conjunction with ICWS/SCC 2007 9-13 July 2007, Salt Lake City,
     Utah
     
     Important Dates:
     
     5-Page Extended Abstract Submission Deadline: March 10, 2007
     Notification Deadline: April 15, 2005
     Camera-Ready Paper Due (8 pages): May 1, 2007
     
     Integration of data sources and tools, and performing
     computations on them is one of the key problems for using the
     data from experimental biology today. However, these resources
     are highly diverse in nature in terms of representation, data
     formats, and computer systems and are distributed across the
     network. Although this broad spectrum of information is
     accessible over the Web, each data source comes with its own
     structure, semantics, data formats, names, concepts, and access
     methods. Currently, the burden falls on the scientist to manually
     (via programs) convert between the data formats, resolve
     conflicts, integrate data, and interpret results in order to make
     viable use of this information. This workshop will provide a
     forum to bring together researches and practitioners working to
     solve these challenges in biological data and tools using service
     oriented technologies.
     
     Submission Instructions: The SOBDAT 2007 invites submission of
     high quality papers by the submission deadline of March 10, 2007.
     Original unpublished manuscripts in IEEE format (pdf or doc file)
     should be submitted electronically at ICWS 2007 Workshop
     Management System (http://www.servicesscience.org/scw07/).
     
     All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three
     program committee members. All accepted papers will be published
     as a single volume of proceedings encompassing all the workshops
     (held in conjunction with ICWS-2007) to be published by IEEE
     Computer Society and will also be available online in the IEEE
     explorer digital library.
     
     Submissions are specially invited on the following topics, but
     the scope is not limited to these. We also encourage the
     submission of survey and case study papers.
     
     Topics:
     
     - Challenges, solutions, and methodologies in providing web
       services interfaces to biological data sources and tools

     - Methodologies for data transformation and normalization
       including transformation of raw data into information and
       knowledge

     - Design, management, and governance for information
       infrastructures, including information flow, adaptive
       evolution, and interoperability

     - Development of algorithms and data structures for analysis of
       biological information

     - Querying and query optimization against biological sources

     - Ontology based data and tool integration

     - Semantic Web technologies and formalisms for biological data
       and applications

     - Web Service based biological workflow configuration and
       deployment systems

     - Web interfaces for defining, accessing, and executing workflows

     - Dynamic discovery of suitable of biological resources

     - Data exchange rules among data sources and tools

     - Peer-to-peer based architectures for data and tool integration

     - Case studies in application of service oriented techniques to
       solve data integration issues

     - Handheld based monitoring of biological workflows, and the role
       of pervasive computing
