CLUKI 2009 Final Call for Papers

=============================

12th Computational Linguistics in the UK & Ireland Research Colloquium
Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland; April 23-24, 2009
http://www.cngl.ie/cluki
Submission deadline: Wednesday, 11 March, 2009 (extended)

=============================

The UK special-interest group for Computational Linguistics ( CLUK,
http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/research/cluk/ ) will venture for the first time
beyond the UK to be hosted across the water in Dublin, and is renamed CLUKI.

Computational Linguistics UK & Ireland (CLUKI) aims to provide a forum for
the Computational Linguistics community in the UK and Ireland. The Annual
CLUKI Colloquium offers PhD students in Natural Language Processing and
related disciplines an opportunity to present and discuss their work with
members of the wider research community. Presentations are held in
conference-style sessions, to which senior established researchers are
invited, and there will be opportunities for general discussion.

Papers on any topic within the area of Computational Linguistics, Natural
Language Processing, and Language Engineering are welcome. Proceedings will
not be publicly available. However the title and abstract of accepted papers
will be displayed on the website.

Antal van den Bosch, Tilburg University
Khalil Sima'an, University of Amsterdam

and one (1) additional page of references.

We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
Style files, available from (

in the reviewing process, the paper should not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to
projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity
should be avoided. For example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".
