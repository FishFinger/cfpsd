Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Phonology; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

We invite abstracts in generative and formal syntax, morphology, and 
phonology. Authors must be enrolled in a Ph.D. or M.A. program in 
linguistics or philology and must not have a Ph.D. degree awarded at the 
moment of abstract submission. There is no registration fee for participants.

moment of abstract submission. There is no registration fee for participants.

Abstract Guidelines:

Abstracts should be sent in a PDF format as attachments to an 
identification e-mail message, which should include: the author's name, 
affiliation, and the title of the paper.  

Abstracts must be anonymous. Therefore, the first page of the abstract 
must include only the title of the paper with the author's name, affiliation and 
e-mail address.The second page (and third one, if needed) must be 
anonymous and must include only the title of the paper (repeated for 
identification) and the text.

The text of the abstract should be limited to 2 pages (A4 size or similar) 
including the references. Thus, together with the identification page, the 
whole submission should be limited to 3 pages.

E-mails with attached abstracts in a PDF format should be sent to the e-mail 
address provided below.

All abstracts will be reviewed by the board of referees.

Please, entitle your submission ''Abstract'' for our convenience. 

 
Send your e-mail with a pdf attachment to:

scofl2@ifa.amu.edu.pl.

Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 06-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

This panel is part of the 10th International Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg,
Sweden. It addresses the relationship between spatial and temporal language. 

The Language of Space and Time

Natural language expressions for spatial and temporal phenomena have long been
recognized as being closely interconnected. Often, similar terms are used in
both domains, and/or they have a similar history in the development of language.
Also, there are a number of consistent metaphors indicating a close conceptual
relationship between spatial and temporal relations. 
In this panel, we wish to bring together researchers concerned with the
relationship between spatial and temporal language, addressing the issue from a
range of different viewpoints, including at least the following:

- Language use: How is the conceptual relationship between spatial and temporal
domains reflected in the application of spatial and temporal terms?
- Semantics: In how far can parallels between the domains be detected in the
semantics of spatial and temporal terms? How can differences be explained?
- Syntax: Do the terms behave similarly or differently in diverse syntactic
contexts?
- Metaphors: Does the application of spatial terms in temporal contexts reveal
consistent patterns in the conceptualization of the two domains?
- Cross-linguistic research: How are the two domains treated linguistically in
other languages?
- Historical perspective: How did spatial and temporal terms develop over time?
- Child language acquisition: How do children learn to apply the terms for the
two domains?
- Formalizations: How do formal linguistic treatments of spatiotemporal
expressions deal with the similarities and differences involved in space and time?

Important Dates: 

Extended abstract submissions (up to 2.000 words as pdf) to Thora Tenbrink 
tenbrink@tzi.de by November 6th, 2006. 

Subsequent to the panel, selected (full) paper contributions will be considered
for publication in an edited collection or a special issue for a journal.
