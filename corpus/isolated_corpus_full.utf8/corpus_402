CONTEXT

The 5th International Workshop on Controlled Language Applications

CLAW2003:  http://www.eamt.org/eamt-claw03/

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Of interest are submissions on all topics relating to the design,
implementation and application of controlled languages, including but
not limited to: human communication protocols; controlled text
authoring; conformance checking systems; controlled language authoring aids; memory-based authoring; (re-)authoring combined with
translation; issues in Controlled Language design; industrial
experience and evolving requirements; quality and usability
evaluations of controlled language.

On the research front, we are grappling with issues like
standardization, design, and evaluation of controlled language
systems. On implementation issues, we are particularly interested in
studies regarding author productivity and document usability. The
workshop will give equal emphasis to the academic, corporate and
industrial perspectives, while bringing together researchers,
developers, users, and potential users of controlled language systems
from around the world.

WORKSHOP FORMAT

The one-day workshop will feature paper presentations.

SULA 4: THE SEMANTICS OF UNDER-REPRESENTED LANGUAGES IN THE AMERICAS

May 24- 26, 2007

Universidade de São Paulo - USP

The Department of Linguistics at the University of São Paulo, is pleased to announce the fourth conference on the Semantics of Under-Represented Languages in the Americas. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers working on languages or dialects which do not have an established tradition of work in formal semantics. We also invite submissions from those working on child languages (acquisition of semantics). We especially encourage abstract submissions from those whose work involves primary fieldwork or experimentation as well as analysis. We strongly encourage the participation of graduate students. The conference will be organized into panel discussions. The paper length will be 30 minutes, plus 15 minutes for discussion.
