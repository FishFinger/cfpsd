Linguistic Field(s): Language Documentation 

Call Deadline: 30-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

This workshop on language documentation and language description aims
to be a forum for discussing recent advances in Language Documentation
and their implications for linguists working on endangered and
lesser-known languages. 

Call for Papers

This is a pre-conference workshop, organized in conjunction with the 23rd
Scandinavian Conference of Linguistics. The workshop has two goals: First, to
discuss recent advances in Language Documentation - what it implies, how is it
different from traditional language description, how technological resources can
be a tool in documenting lesser-known languages. Second, to create a forum in
Scandinavia for those who are working on endangered and lesser-known languages.

There will be scope for a limited number of presentations. The deadline for
submitting abstracts is 30 March 2008.
