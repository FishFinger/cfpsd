pronouns, determiners, conjunctions, discourse particles, auxiliary/light
verbs, prepositionsincluding their phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,
pragmatics, discourse function, historical development, variation, and
acquisition (by children or adults). GURT 2007 will host plenary lectures,

The uses of ''voseo'' (use the pronoun ''vos'' instead of ''tu'' as second

as morphological study of the ''voseo'' pronominal and verbal.
