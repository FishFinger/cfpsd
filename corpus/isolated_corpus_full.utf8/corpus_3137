Workshop on ''Repairs''

This workshop is part of the 31st Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics
Society (DGfS 2009). It is co-organized by Patrick Brandt (University of
Cologne) and Eric Fuss (University of Frankfurt) and will explore repair
phenomena at the interface between syntax and other components of grammar.

We are pleased to announce Marcel den Dikken (NYU) as invited speaker.
 
It is a leading hypothesis in recent work on linguistic interfaces that grammar
is an optimal solution to conditions imposed by other cognitive systems (Chomsky
1995, 2001). It is assumed that the operations performed by the computational
system of language reduce to the bare minimum required to interpret hierarchical
syntactic structures in terms of sound and meaning. At the same time, it is
well-known that syntactic structures may be unfit for straightforward
interpretation. For example, elements often seem to be semantically interpreted
in positions different from their surface position (e.g., scope of quantifiers
(QR) and negation). At the sound end, hierarchical syntactic structures must be
converted into linearly ordered phonological exponents in order to be
interpretable at the serial interface to the articulatory-perceptual system.
This process may modify the constituent structure derived in syntax, cf.
analyses of 'affix-hopping'/'do-support' in English, or, more generally, clitic
placement (see Chomsky 1957, Bobaljik 1995, Lasnik 2000 on the former, and
Wackernagel 1892, Bonet 1991, Halpern 1992, Embick & Noyer 2001 on the latter).
While such 'repairs' of the syntactic output are usually viewed as imperfections
of the grammar, the workshop wants to turn around the perspective and look at
repairs as a device that is routinely and virtuously employed by the grammar to
economically code interpretations the transparent expression of which would be
tedious, unfeasible or even impossible. Adopting, e.g., ideas of C.S. Peirce
(cf. also Horn 1989: chapter 5), unexpected modal or generic interpretations
might be repairs of logical conflicts (specifically, circumventing the law of
contradiction and the law of the excluded middle, respectively); in
Antecedent-Contained-Deletion (Sag 1976, May 1985), QR (at LF) and Ellipsis (at
PF) seem to furnish interpretations that are difficult or even impossible to
express transparently. Recent approaches to structure-building in syntax take a
repair perspective on locality phenomena as such (Heck & Mueller 2000, den
Dikken 2006, 2007). Specific questions include, but are not limited to, the
following:
 
- Where do repair mechanisms appear to provide 'shortcuts' - or even necessary
conditions - to particular interpretations?

- Where exactly do specific repairs happen - e.g., is there true repair in the
semantics, or can pragmatics do all the required work?

- Are there grammaticalization paths that involve a 'repair stage' which gets
hard-wired? 

The workshop is of interest for researchers working on linguistic interfaces. We
are looking forward to applications that provide formally explicit analyses of
particular interface phenomena in terms of repair.
