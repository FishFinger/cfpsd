Meeting Description

Academic written discourse has become a central topic of research in recent
years, inasmuch as competent written academic communication is recognised as
essential for success in the academic world. Interpersonality (in academic
discourse) has been analysed from several perspectives, which have proved very
fruitful not only to understand but also to problematise the writer-reader
relationship and the role of relevant issues such as culture, discipline,
individual style, (non)native use of the language, the role of English as a
lingua franca, among others. 

The aim of this conference is to provide a multiperspective arena for both
theoretical and experimental approaches which can contribute to and stimulate
the current debate on the issues mentioned above. 

Academic written discourse has become a central topic of research in recent
years, inasmuch as competent written academic communication is recognised as
essential for success in the academic world. One of the main research concerns
has been the analysis of interpersonal/ interpersonally-driven features in
academic texts and the extent to which the use of these features is shaped by
generic, disciplinary and cultural factors. 

Interpersonality (in academic discourse) has been analysed from several
perspectives, which have proved very fruitful not only to understand but also to
problematise the writer-reader relationship and the role of relevant issues such
as culture, discipline, individual style, (non)native use of the language, the
role of English as a lingua franca, among others. 

The influence of some of these factors on academic written discourse has been
explored by the research team InterLAE, at the University of Zaragoza, which has
led us to propose this international forum of discussion on these issues. The
aim of this conference is to provide a multiperspective arena for both
theoretical and experimental approaches which can contribute to and stimulate
the current debate on the issues mentioned above. We are fortunate in having as
key speakers at the conference the following:

Trine Dahl, University of Turku, Finland
John Flowerdew, University of Leeds, Great Britain
Maurizio Gotti, University of Bergamo, Italy
Ken Hyland, London Institute of Education, Great Britain
John Swales, University of Michigan, USA

We welcome papers on issues regarding interpersonality in written academic
discourse. Those which adopt the following perspectives of analysis and/or
discussion, either from a theoretical or an experimental point of view, are most
welcome: 

- cross-cultural perspective
- cross-linguistic perspective (including native and non-native use of the language)
- cross-disciplinary perspective
- the perspective of individual factors

Papers (2,500 words max.) should be accompanied by an abstract (300 words max.).
They will be allotted 20 minutes of presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.
The language of presentation and discussion will, in all cases, be English.
All the proposals will be submitted to blind peer review by two members of the
scientific committee. A selection of the papers presented at the conference will
be published in an edited book or in a special issue of an international journal.
