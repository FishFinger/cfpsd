Specialist Group, European Association for Machine Translation, 
International Association for Machine Translation, the Institute of 
Translation and Interpreting and the Institute of Linguists.

The deadline for this call for papers is 1st July 2005.

This conference focuses on the user aspects of translation software. The
conference series attracts a wide audience which includes translators,

this year the conference will address the latest developments in translation (and translation-related) 
software. It will address the needs of the following conference attendees:
- industry

This call for papers invites abstracts of papers to be presented at the
conference. The papers (and the presentations) should focus on the user
aspects of translation or translation-related software rather than on
theoretical issues. Presentations accompanied by demonstrations are
especially welcome.

- use of MT systems

- controlled languages and their use in MT
- speech translation

- multilingual document management/workflow
- case studies of technology-based solutions
- the Internet and translation aids/services
- XML based standards
- Application of XML tools
- Project Management
- Non-business, non-profit organisations approach to translation problems
- the value of "free" versus "charging" services/sites on the Internet
