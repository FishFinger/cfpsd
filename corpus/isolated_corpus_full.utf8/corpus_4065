Meeting Description:

The theme of the 5th Annual Conference of the Language Learning and Teaching
Special Interest Group of the British Association of Applied Linguistics is
'Exploring the Interfaces:  Interrelating learning theories, policy and
practitioner perspectives on foreign and second language learning in the UK'. 

First Call for Papers

'Exploring the Interfaces:  Interrelating learning theories, policy and
practitioner perspectives on foreign and second language learning in the UK'

Plenary Speakers:
Do Coyle (University of Aberdeen)
Susanne Niemeier (University of Koblenz)
Nina Spada (OISE, University of Toronto)

The conference will be hosted by the Manchester Metropolitan University,
Institute of Education.

Submissions are invited for papers and posters addressing the theme of the
conference. Each submission should provide the name and affiliation of the
author(s), a title, and a 250-word abstract, indicating whether the submission
is for a paper or poster. Papers will be allocated 20-minute slots for
presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion. 

Deadline for abstracts: 28 February 2009.
Notification of acceptance by 4 April 2009.

Please note that registration rates and accommodation arrangements will be
published by 31 January 2009.

Abstracts should be submitted to Gee Macrory at g.macrory@mmu.ac.uk 

Rationale: 
This conference aims to address the relationship between different perspectives
on language learning and teaching with a particular focus on how these have an
impact upon practice in the UK at a time when languages have arguably a higher
profile than ever before. We have for the first time a National Languages
Strategy and this has implications at all levels of language learning and
teaching. Key issues include the introduction of languages in primary schools,
cross-curricular approaches in primary and secondary schools, the use of ICT,
the development of the plurilingual agenda, the opportunities for international
links and innovation in assessment at all levels. The future agenda for language
learning and teaching in the UK requires critical engagement with research if we
are to move forward in the right direction. Papers might focus on whether and
how a range of cognitive and/or socio-cultural perspectives on language learning
inform these debates Papers relating to other perspectives which may shed light
on them are also 
welcome.
