*********************************************************************
CALL FOR PAPERS - STUDENT RESEARCH WORKSHOP at ACL-07
June 24th=9629th 2007, Prague, Czech Republic
Submission deadline: January 23, 2007
Workshop URL: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/srw/
Submission URL: http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-SRW/submit.html
*********************************************************************

1. General Invitation for Submissions
The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Languag=
e
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from th=
e
general audience and from selected panelists -- experienced researche=
rs who
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentatio=
n.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the worksho=
p. As
the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis is=
 on
work in progress. Original and unpublished research is therefore invi=
ted on
all aspects of computational linguistics including, but not limited t=
o, the
following topic areas:
=95 pragmatics and discourse
=95 semantics and lexicons
=95 syntax and grammars
=95 phonetics, phonology, and morphology
=95 linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language
=95 information retrieval, information extraction, and question answe=
ring
=95 summarization and paraphrasing
=95 speech recognition and speech synthesis
=95 corpus-based language modeling
=95 multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation ai=
ds
=95 spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue syste=
ms
=95 multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems
=95 narrative understanding systems

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos. Mo=
re
information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page,
http://www.acl2007.org/.

2. Submission Requirements
The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with =
the
opportunity of presenting their work in a formal setting. Submission =
will
therefore normally be open only to students who have settled on their=
 thesis
direction but who still have significant research left to do; those s=
tudents
in the final stages of their thesis and those who have already presen=
ted at
an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop should submit to the main
conference instead.

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers s=
hould
clearly indicate directions for future research wherever appropriate.=
 The
papers may have more than one author; however, all authors MUST be st=
udents
(graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted are eligible only if th=
ey have
not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available publi=
shed
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the submission page.

3. Submission Procedure
Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings an=
d
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly re=
commend
the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailor=
ed for
this year's conference. These will be available from the web pages of
ACL-07. A description of the format is also available in case you are=
 unable
to use these style files directly. Submission must be electronic. The=
 only
accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Please use the sub=
mission
page (http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-SRW/submit.html) to submit =
your
paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure
Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed=
 by the
Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewer=
s. Each
submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior
researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based o=
n the
results of the review.

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make s=
ure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should lik=
ewise
not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the paper submit=
ted for
review. For example, rather than this: "We showed previously (Smith, =
2001),
=2E..", use citations such as: "Smith (2001) previously showed ...".

5. Schedule
The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time Januar=
y 23,
2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be automatica=
lly
disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after receipt.
Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by e-mail) on Mar=
ch 23,
2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final
camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance n=
otice.

Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007
