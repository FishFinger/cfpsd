CALL FOR PAPERS

************************************************************************ 
**************
ANNOTATION SCIENCE:
STATE OF THE ART IN ENHANCING AUTOMATIC LINGUISTIC ANNOTATION
************************************************************************ 
**************

To be held in conjunction with
The 5th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation
Magazzini del Cotone Conference Centre
Genoa, Italy
May 27, 2006

http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/events/ANNOTATION-LREC2006/

The high cost of manual annotation and validation of automatically  
produced
annotations for language data has led to the recent development of  
methods to enhance
the quality of automatically-produced annotations via mechanisms such  
as machine
learning.  To date, there has been no international forum fully  
dedicated to the topic,
where researchers working in different areas and different phenomena  
are brought together
to discuss methods and results.

This workshop will include papers describing current work on  
enhancing the results of
automated annotation for linguistic phenomena and provide both an  
overview and assessment
of the state-of-the-art. The workshop will include an introductory  
overview  as well as
a panel discussion following the paper presentations.

Papers are solicited on any of the following topics:

o Machine learning and other methods to enhance automatic annotation of
   linguistic phenomena, including segmentation and chunking; morpho- 
syntactic,
   syntactic, and discourse analysis; semantic annotation; entity
   and event recognition; alignment of parallel translations;  
annotation of
   dialogue, speech, gesture, and multi-modal data; etc.

o Use of information from multiple linguistic levels and/or phenomena to
   enhance performance of automatic annotation software

o Machine learning and other methods for enhancing automated knowledge
   acquisition (e.g, information for lexicons, ontologies, etc.)

o Evaluation and comparison of techniques to enhance the accuracy of
   automatically-generated annotations, as well as discussion of  
limitations

o Software systems for optimizing annotation accuracy, and methods and
   systems for optimizing "on the fly" annotation of web and other  
language data

o Identification and separation of annotation that cannot be
   automated, to simplify annotation enhancement by human proofreaders

o Identification and separation of applications that can tolerate  
"noisy" analysis,
   for which imperfect automated linguistic analysis would be  
appropriate
