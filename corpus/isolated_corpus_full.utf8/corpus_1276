Agnieszka & Karu,

In Eric's defense, I did try and call both of you on Friday arvo just =20=

to clarify what you meant by the new rules/policy and I couldn't get on =20=

to either of you.  Sending something out an email on a topic such as =20
the ICS PGRF on a  Friday afternoon afternoon is always going to look =20=

bad, especially when you are not there to clear up any misconceptions - =20=

such as the one I had.  Even if Friday afternoon is the first chance =20
you have, you may want to delay sending out such information until =20
Monday morning instead?

I agree that we should try and maximise our use of the MQ PGRF as this =20=

will maximise the money into the division, which is a great thing.  =20
However, I just hope that we are not moving in the direction of using =20=

the MQ PGRF for funding essential parts of our degree and moving away =20=

from the main aim of the MQ PGRF which is to "provide the University=92s =
=20
postgraduate research students with the means to enhance their =20
postgraduate research experience and add value to their thesis".

On a similar note, I have had no personal experience with any ICS PGRF =20=

applications being knocked back, although I haven't really written as =20=

many papers as I should have by now.  So, I would appreciate it if =20
anyone who has had an ICS PGRF application knocked back (current or =20
past application) because there wasn't enough money there for them to =20=

please contact me or one of the other reps with the details so that we =20=

can starting building up some data on this topic.  Matt, you sound like =20=

you have some information on this.  Without these details, we (the =20
reps) really can't do much.

Cheers
James

1) The division does not have an endless pot of money. We are in
deficit and

have been for several years. Yet all eligible ICS PGRF applications
were

funded last year.

2) If a student runs out of ICS PGRF funding and needs only $1000 from

MQPGRF in his last year of study, then to me it sounds like the

through their lack of planning and short-sightedness, failed to

<excerpt>Hey James and PGR Students,


I suppose you've read the email from Karu (conveniently sent on a

Friday afternoon). I don't have a problem with applying for the MQ

PGRF, but I do have a problem with applying for the MQ PGRF first and

then applying for the ICS PGRF. This way, the money that is allocated

to PGRF students on a DIVISONAL level (ICS PGRF) could end up being

used for something else than the PGRF students, if it wasn't used up

in any one year. I think I remember that I heard that this has been

practiced by the division before and I think that this is the wrong

way of approaching this, because it creates more work for us and we

don't get the direct access to the money that is allocated for our

research.

To me the process should be the other way around. First we apply for

the funding which is reserved for every student (4000 Au$ as far as I

know - correct me if I'm wrong) and once we have run out of this

money, than we have to find other sources.


What are your thoughts?


Eric

To: Postgraduate Research Students and Supervisors


MQ PGRF - Why should you consider it seriously?


The deadline for MQ PGRF is approaching. Why should you consider

applying to

MQ PGRF when you can apply to ICS PGRF practically anytime?


It is a condition in ICS PGRF that, where possible, support should

be sought

from MQ PGRF (and Macquarie International Travel Scholarships) before

applying for ICS PGRF support. If you apply to ICS PGRF without

trying MQ

PGRF, for any support that is eligible for funding through MQ PGRF,

your ICS

PGRF application is most likely to be rejected, as it will not

satisfy the

above condition. (We plan to enforce this rule strictly this year,

and you

have been warned.) The only exception is for students within the

first year

(EFT) of enrolment, because MQ PGRF is somewhat reluctant to support

first-year students especially for conference travel.


So, what items are eligible for MQ PGRF funding? When you read the

MQ PGRF

Guidelines you will find that most items ICS students get from MQ

PGRF are

in the MQ PGRF eligible list, include travel for collaboration and

conference attendance. The major difference is, items that are

ESSENTIAL for

your core/main/primary research project (eg. essential equipments)

are NOT

funded by MQ PGRF. Nevertheless, MQ PGRF has funded equipment in

cases where

the item was not essential for the original project but it added

value to

the project. Note the objective of MQ PGRF is to add value to a thesis

project, NOT to enable a thesis project that is otherwise impossible.


Regarding conference travel, you don't need a conference paper

acceptance at

the time of MQ PGRF application; in fact some students applied

successfully

even before the paper was submitted. Of course, you need to submit

the paper

acceptance letter later, to the Research Office, before MQ PGRF

funds are

released. If the conference stated in your MQ PGRF application did not

accept your paper but another conference did, you can still use the

same MQ

PGRF grant by submitting a Variation of Request Form to RO.


In brief, there are many reasons why one should apply to MQ PGRF if

eligible. If you need one more, MQ PGRF funding comes from the

university

pocket; ICS PGRF comes from the division pocket, which is not that

deep. If

you are not sure about eligibility, please consult me or your

Departmental

Director of Postgraduate Research.


Regards,


Karu

Round 2, 2007 of the PGRF Scheme is now open.  Funding Rules and

application material are available from the Research Office

website at

http://www.research.mq.edu.au/researchers/funding/internal/pgrf2


The closing date for receipt of hardcopy applications in the Research

Office is Friday 13 April 2007 at 5.00pm.  Electronic copies of

applications must also be received by the closing date, emailed to

Important points to note:


It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that the Supervisor's

Report Form is submitted independently of the application by the

closing

date in both hardcopy and electronically to grants@mq.edu.au.

Applications for which no Supervisor's Report Form is received by the

closing date will be ruled ineligible.


Applicants should also be aware that Departmental and Divisional

sign-off can take several days and ensure adequate time is allowed

for

this processing.  Divisions should also ensure timely processes

are put

in place for signing applications so that they can be received in the

Research Office by the due date.  Processing of applications in
