The call for papers for the 11th Texas Linguistics Society (TLS)
conference has been extended until August 15. TLS is an annual,
graduate-student-organized, peer-reviewed conference held at the
University of Texas at Austin.

This year's conference theme is "The New Empiricism in Linguistics",
focusing on how a wide range of subdisciplines in theoretical
linguistics are being affected by new, larger sources of data
(including corpus data and linguistic data gathered from the Web) as
well as the data-intensive methods that accompany them.

Further information regarding the conference is available from the
conference website at
http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~tls/2007tls/

Please email submissions to tls@uts.cc.utexas.edu. Abstracts should be
no longer than 2 pages including data and references if applicable,
and please limit submissions to at most 2 papers, with at most 1
single-authored paper.
