The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation
(PACLIC 23)

3-5 December 2009
City University of Hong Kong
http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk


First Call for Papers


The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation
(PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong Kong on 3-5 December
2009.  The PACLIC series of conferences emphasizes the synergy of 
theoretical
analysis and processing of language, and provides a forum for researchers in
different fields of language study in the Pacific-Asia region to meet, to 
inspire
and to be inspired.  According to the Computer Science Conference Ranking
Website, as in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of 701 conferences in 
topic
area II (AI and Machine Learning), roughly at top 7%.

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics.  Topics include 
but
are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
discourse analysis, typology, corpus linguistics, formal grammar theory,
natural language processing, natural language systems and related computer
applications.  Papers which are interdisciplinary, demonstrating synergy
among language, information, and computation especially on Asian
languages, are particularly encouraged.


Important Dates:

   9 Aug 2009      Paper submission deadline
   21 Sep 2009    Acceptance notification
   19 Oct 2009     Camera-ready paper due
   3-5 Dec 2009   PACLIC 23 conference


Paper Submission:

Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished work.
Papers should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10) pages,
including references. Please follow the formatting instructions and use the
style files provided on the conference website 
(http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk).
Accepted papers will be presented in one of the regular sessions or poster
sessions as determined by the program committee.  Such decisions will be
based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

The deadline for paper submissons is 11:59PM Aug 9, 2009 Hong Kong
time (GMT+7). Submissions should be made via the submission software at:

   https://www.softconf.com/a/PACLIC23/

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength,
significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. 
Each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.
As the reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the authors' 
names
and affiliations.  Authors should ensure that their identities are not 
revealed in
any way in the paper.  Papers that do not conform to these requirements will
be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which
will subsequently be digitally archived and sent to ISI for indexing. 
PACLIC
conference proceedings are indexed in the ISI Web of Science since 2002
and authors are encouraged to cite previous PACLIC papers in their work.
