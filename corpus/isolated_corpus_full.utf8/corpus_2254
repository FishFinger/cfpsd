Workshop Organisers: 
Hans-Christian Schmitz, schmitz@lingua.uni-frankfurt.de
Henk Zeevat, henk.zeevat@uva.nl

The workshop is organised in cooperation with the SIG Dialogue Systems of the
Gesellschaft für Linguististische Datenverarbeitung (GLDV).

Workshop Purpose and Topics:

Discourse particles and modal adverbs form a borderline case between semantics
and pragmatics and so can be the source of new insights in these areas. The use
of particles has been connected with discourse relations and other coherence
relations, the relation between semantic content and discourse context,
especially the mutual knowledge and the common discourse goals of the discourse
participants, with expression of speaker beliefs, desires and intentions and
with the control of interpretations that go beyond semantic content, i.e.
explicatures and implicatures. And, last but not least, particles and modal
adverbs can contribute to expressive and other non-truth-conditional aspects of
meaning. From the perspective of computational linguistics, these words are a
promise, because it would seem that their treatment would help NLP systems to
get a better grasp on the intentions of the user in interpretation and to
achieve natural and comprehensible output in generation. However, they are also
a challenge, because their analysis seems to involve concepts beyond current
levels of sophistication. 
The workshop proposes to collect contributions to the formal description and
implementation of discourse particles and modal adverbs.   
This third edition of workshop will in addition have a focus on the experimental
investigation of the use and interpretation of discourse particles and modal
adverbs, with a special view to the validation of formal and computational
approaches.
 
The workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers (including advanced PhD
students) to present and discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who
work in the broad subject of the disciplines relevant for particles and modal
adverbs, as represented in ESSLLI.

Meeting Description

Chronos is a series of biannual conferences dedicated to current research on the

different perspectives and in different theoretical frameworks. The current
meeting includes a parasession on Romance languages in addition to the main session.

Former conferences took place in Antwerp (2006), Geneva (2004), Groningen
(2002), Nice (2000), Valenciennes (1998), Brussels (1996) and Dunkerque (1995).
Chronos 8 is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Carlota S. Smith (1934-2007).
