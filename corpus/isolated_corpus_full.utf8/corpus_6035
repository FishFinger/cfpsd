Meeting Description:

The Center for Research in Syntax, Semantics and Phonology (CRISSP,
www.crissp.be) in Brussels is pleased to announce the Fourth Brussels Confe=
rence
on Generative Linguistics (BCGL4) on ellipsis. It will be held in Brussels =
from
November 9 till November 10, 2009.

The following invited speakers have accepted to give a talk at BCGL4:
Daniel Hardt (Copenhagen Business School)
Jason Merchant (University of Chicago)=20

3rd Call for Papers:

Extended Deadline: September 25, 2009

Theme Description:
Ellipsis has been an important research topic in generative linguistics at =
least
since Ross (1967, 1969), but with the advent of the Minimalist Program (Cho=
msky
1995), the interest in this topic has risen considerably. Because it is a
fortiori an interface phenomenon, understanding ellipsis requires an
understanding of the interaction between narrow syntax, PF, LF and the
information-structural component. In other words, ellipsis is a useful tool=
 for
gaining a better understanding of how the grammar of natural language works=
.
Very simply put, ellipsis is the occurrence of meaning without sound. A fir=
st
important question to ask is how much syntax is involved in deriving this
meaning. Roughly speaking, there are three types of proposals dealing with =
this
issue. A first one takes the ellipsis site to be a fully-fledged syntactic
structure that is deleted (or not pronounced) at PF (i.e. PF-deletion; cf. =
Ross
1969; Sag 1980; Hankamer & Sag 1976, Sag & Hankamer 1984; Tomioka 1999, 200=
1;
Merchant 2001; Johnson 1996, 2001; Lasnik 1999a, 1999b, 2001).

According to a type of second analysis the ellipsis site does not contain a=
ny
internal structure, but is a null pronoun (or proform). The meaning is deri=
ved
from the antecedent, either parallel to how overt pronouns are interpreted
(Wasow 1972; Shopen 1972; Hardt 1993, 1999; Lobeck 1995; Depiante 2000) or =
by
copying the antecedent into the ellipsis site at LF (i.e. LF copy; cf. Fien=
go &
May 1994; Chung et al. 1995; Wilder 1997; Beavers & Sag 2004; Fortin 2007).=
 A
third account assumes there is nothing at all in the position of the missin=
g
material (Ginzburg & Sag 2000; Culicover & Jackendoff 2005).

Recently, the debate on the presence or absence of internal structure has b=
een
extended to overt pronouns. Elbourne (2008) proposes that overt pronouns ar=
e
definite descriptions underlyingly, such that when a noun undergoes NP-elli=
psis,
its determiner is spelled out as a pronoun (cf. Postal 1969). This approach
turns the reasoning of the null proform analysis of ellipsis on its head:
instead of treating the ellipsis site as a (null) pronoun, it treats (overt=
)
pronouns as ellipsis sites (cf. also Baltin & Van Craenenbroeck 2008). A se=
cond
central question in the study of ellipsis involves the relation between the
ellipsis site and its antecedent. Merchant (2001), following Rooth (1992) a=
nd
Schwarzschild (1999), proposes that an ellipsis site has to be e-GIVEN: the
(non-focus-marked part of the) antecedent must entail the (non-focus-marked=
 part
of the) ellipsis site and vice versa in order for ellipsis to be recoverabl=
e.

However, recent works claim that a purely semantic recoverability condition=
 is
not sufficient and that ellipsis requires syntactic isomorphism between
antecedent and ellipsis site, cf. Lasnik (1995); Johnson (2001); Merchant (=
2007,
2008) (see also Fiengo & May 1994; Pullum 2000; Fox 1999, 2000; Sauerland 2=
004;
Hardt 2004, 2005 and van Craenenbroeck 2009 for discussion).

Apart from the conditions on the antecedent (i.e. the recoverability
requirement), ellipsis is subject to a syntactic licensing condition: even =
when
the ellipsis site is recoverable from the context, it can only occur in a
specific set of syntactic environments. Lobeck (1995), for instance, argues=
 that
VP ellipsis requires strong agreement on the inflectional head and claims t=
hat
English, but not German or French, exhibits this kind of agreement. Merchan=
t
(2001) on the other hand, captures the fact that ellipsis requires a licens=
ing
head by positing an ellipsis feature on certain heads, allowing them to lea=
ve
their complement unpronounced. A similar analysis is proposed in Aelbrecht
(2009), who argues that ellipsis is licensed by an Agree relation between a=
n
ellipsis feature and the ellipsis licensing head.

For the Fourth Brussels Conference on Generative Linguistics, we welcome pa=
pers
on any topic related to the theme of the conference.
