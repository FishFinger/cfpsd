Meeting Description:

This workshop aims at investigating interpretative and formal aspects of
indefiniteness in individual languages as well as crosslinguistically. We i=
nvite
applications focusing on theoretical (e.g. defining the category of
indefiniteness and its types) as well as empirical issues (e.g. corpus-base
studies, questionnaires).

Crosslinguistically, an NP may be marked as indefinite by different means. =
In
addition to the prototypical indefiniteness markers, e.g. the indefinite ar=
ticle
in languages such as English or German, there are markers like 'some' and
indefinite 'this' in English or 'irgendein' and 'so'n' in German. It is a m=
atter
of debate what facets of indefiniteness such markers express in comparison =
to
the indefinite article. A more complete picture of the exact function of
indefiniteness markers can be reached by taking into account languages like
Moroccan Arabic and Uzbek, which employ two distinct indefinite articles, o=
r
languages like Russian, in which indefiniteness is grammaticalized in the
complex system of indefinite pronouns. In his influential typological study=
,
Haspelmath (1997) determines different functions indefinite pronouns may di=
splay
in different languages.=20

Since this seminal work that was restricted to indefinite pronouns, there h=
ave
been important steps towards an understanding of the semantic and pragmatic
properties of different indefiniteness markers in general (e.g. by Farkas (=
2002)
and Ionin (2006) for English; Jayez & Tovena (2006) for French; Mart=ED (20=
07) for
Spanish; Ebert, Ebert & Hinterwimmer (to appear) for German; Geist (2008), =
Geist
& Onea (2007) for Russian, and von Heusinger & Klein (2008) for Uzbek). Suc=
h
fine-grained analyses of indefiniteness markers in particular languages now
provide a basis for cross=AClinguistic comparison with the aim to determine
universal types and crosslinguistically applicable concepts of indefinitene=
ss.=20

Call for Papers:

We welcome submissions in which the following issues are addressed:

- Comparative studies on the linguistic coding of indefiniteness;=20
- Systems of indefinite pronouns: semantic fine-grained distinctions and
pragmatic functions;=20
- Interrelations of indefiniteness with other phenomena like specificity,
information structure, aspect, and modality;=20
- The diachronic rise of indefinite articles and the degrees of
grammaticalization of indefiniteness markers in different languages.

Abstracts should be anonymous and at most 2 pages in length. Please send yo=
ur
abstracts electronically in pdf- and doc-format to indefiniteness 'at'
ling.uni-stuttgart.de. Include your name, affiliation and the title of the
abstract in the body of the e-mail. Submissions will be reviewed by two rev=
iewers.
