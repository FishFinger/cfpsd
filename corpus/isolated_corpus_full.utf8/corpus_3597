12th EUROPEAN WORKSHOP ON NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION (ENLG 2009)

http://enlg2009.uvt.nl/

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

[apologies for multiple postings]

ENLG 2009 is organized as an EACL workshop, and will take place on 30
and 31 March 2009 in Athens, Greece.

The ENLG 2009 workshop continues a biennial series of workshops on
natural language generation that has been running since 1987, providing
a regular forum for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG
specialists and for researchers from other areas. ENLG
2009 includes two special events. To begin, the Generation Challenges
2009 (see http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09) will be
held in conjunction with ENLG 2009, as an umbrella event designed to
bring together three different shared-task evaluation efforts that
involve the generation of natural language. The Generation Challenges
are organized by Anja Belz, Albert Gatt and Eric Kow. In addition, ENLG
2009 will have a special track devoted to the generation of vague
language based on exact input data.

ENLG 2009 invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on
all topics related to natural language generation. Topics of interest
include:

- Affective / emotional generation
- Content and text planning
- Generation for embodied agents and robots
- Evaluation of NLG systems
- Text-to-text generation
- Lexicalisation
- Multimedia or multimodal generation
- Story-telling and narrative generation
- NLG for real-world applications
- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks
- Personalization and personality of text
- Psycholinguistics and NLG
- Referring expression generation
- Statistical processing for NLG
- Surface realization
- Use of ontologies in NLG
- Vague expressions and large database [special track]

Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at ENLG 2009 must not
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
proceedings. Submission to other conferences should be clearly indicated
on the paper.

Category of Papers: ENLG has two submission categories, long and short
papers:

- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research
results and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references (these
will be orally presented);

- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research
effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these
will be presented as posters during the poster session).

Paper Submission: Submissions should be uploaded to the Start web site
for the workshop (to be made available). The only accepted format for
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two- column
format of ACL proceedings. Use of the ACL style files is strongly
recommended (see http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors). =20
Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors
within the paper. Please note that papers for the shared tasks should be
submitted via the Generation Challenges website.

If authors have any questions, they should contact the workshop
organizers.
