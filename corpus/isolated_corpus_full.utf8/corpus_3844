Second Call for Papers

Workshop Aims:
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from around the
world who have worked on pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds in order to share
expertise in different methodologies and theoretical approaches to the study of
these sounds and attempt to answer various outstanding questions regarding:

1. Language universals: why are pharyngeal sounds present in only 1% of
languages surveyed in the UPSID data base when they are present in children's
early vocalisations? How have these sounds evolved in languages that have lost
the pharyngeal distinctions? Is there a relationship between a dense consonantal
system and the existence of pharyngeal/pharyngealised sounds in a language?

2. Production and perception: what are the acoustic, articulatory, and
perceptual correlates of pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds? What role do
visual cues (e.g. lip rounding) play in processing pharyngeal articulations?

3. The sociolinguistic indices of pharyngeal/pharyngealised articulations: How
does pharyngealisation manifest itself in different languages/dialects? Is the
gender-correlated patterning that has been documented in urban areas in the Arab
world with respect to de-emphasis found in other varieties/languages with
pharyngeal/pharyngealised articulations? How are pharyngeal articulations
affected in language contact situations?

4. Acquisition: at what age are pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds acquired
and what are the developmental manifestations across languages and/or dialects?

Meeting Description:

The 7th Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium (DAARC2009)
Goa, India
hosted by AU-KBC Research Centre, Anna University, Chennai
November 5-6, 2009
http://www.au-kbc.org/daarc2009/ 

Call for Papers

Anaphora is a central topic in the study of natural language and has long been
the object of research in a wide range of disciplines such as theoretical,
corpus and computational linguistics, philosophy of language, cognitive science,
psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. On the other hand, the correct
interpretation of anaphora has played an increasingly vital role in real-world
natural language processing applications, including machine translation,
automatic abstracting, information extraction and question answering. As a
result, the processing of anaphora has become one of the most productive topics
of multi- and inter-disciplinary research, and has enjoyed increased interest
and attention in recent years.

In this context, the Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquia (DAARC)
have emerged as the major regular forum for presentation and discussion of the
best research results in this area.  Initiated in 1996 at Lancaster University
and taken over in 2002 by the University of Lisbon, and moving out of Europe for
the first time in 2009, to Goa, India, the DAARC series established itself as a
specialised and competitive forum for the presentation of the latest results on
anaphora processing, ranging from theoretical linguistic approaches through
psycholinguistic and cognitive work to corpus studies and computational modelling.
 
The seventh Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium (DAARC2009)
will take place in Goa, India, in November 5-6, 2009.  We would like to invite
anyone currently researching in the areas of discourse anaphora and anaphor
resolution, from any  methodological  perspective or framework, to submit a
paper to DAARC2009.
 
The closing date for submission is April 7, 2009. Notification of acceptance
will be sent by June 15, 2009. Final versions of selected papers to be included
in the proceedings are expected by June 30, 2009.

Submissions (extended abstracts) must be anonymous and at most 3 pages in
length. For further details on the submission procedure and other relevant info
on the colloquium visit its website at: http://www.au-kbc.org/daarc2009/
