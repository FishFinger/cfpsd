Meeting Description:

The aim of ACAH 2010 is to encourage academics and scholars to meet and exchange
ideas and views in a forum encouraging respectful dialogue. This international
conference will bring together a number of university scholars working
throughout Japan, Asia, and beyond to share ideas. ACAH 2010 will afford the
opportunity for renewing old acquaintances, making new contacts, and networking
across higher education. It is hoped that academics working in Japan and Asia
will be encouraged to forge working relationships with each other, as well as
with colleagues from Europe and the US, facilitating partnerships across borders.

Theme: 'East Meets West'
The theme of the Inaugural Asian Conference on Arts and Humanities is 'East
Meets West', which is a response to the ongoing process of globalization and its
implications. It offers an opportunity to search for similarities of ideas that
may enhance international understanding on the one hand and for differences in
culture that may have to be accepted as irreconcilable on the other. Racial and
religious disagreement, culturally contrasting ways of dealing with social,
economic, and political problems, exacerbated by the forces of globalization,
combine to exert enormous pressure on the systems that have been created to
manage human affairs on this planet. This conference is dedicated to the
cross-cultural exploration of the interconnectedness of the central questions
involved in order to generate new ideas and fresh approaches that will be
relevant and constructive as support for the emerging generation of thinkers,
educators, and global leaders. We look forward to seeing you in Osaka in June 2010. 

Call for Papers

The conference's theme is 'East Meets West' and the organizers encourage
submissions that approach this questions from a variety of perspectives.
However, the submission of other topics for consideration is welcome and we also
