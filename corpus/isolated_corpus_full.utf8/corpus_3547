Dr. Nagib Callaos is well known for running this long standing conferences
about nothing.
There was a time that I did some research on him and I could not find a PhD,
even though now he claims he has one.

Notice the big red lights in this sentence:
Authors of accepted papers who register in the conference can have access to
the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who
recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can
accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered
authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

Does it look like revenue based for you?
Conferences by the same person already accepted completely automatically
generated papers and almost hosted the first random talk in history.
