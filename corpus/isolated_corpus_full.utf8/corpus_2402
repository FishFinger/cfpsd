  FOMI 2008 - 3rd Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry
               5-6 June, 2008, Torino, Italy

                      CALL FOR PAPERS


Conference web site: http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it

Proceedings published by IOS Press, http://www.iospress.nl/

This event is jointly organized by:
       - Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento
       - University of Torino
       - University of Verona


CONFERENCE AIMS

FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and
industrial practitioners  meet to analyze and  discuss issues
related to methods, theories, tools and applications based on
formal  ontologies.

There is today wide agreement that knowledge modeling and the
semantic  dimension  of  information  plays  an  increasingly
central   role    in   networked    economy:   semantic-based
applications  are relevant  in  distributed  systems such  as
networked  organizations,  organizational  networks,  and  in
distributed knowledge  management. These knowledge  models in
industry  aim  to provide  a  framework  for information  and
knowledge  sharing,  reliable information  exchange,  meaning
negotiation and  coordination between  distinct organizations
or among  members  of the  same  organization.

New tools and applications have  been and are being developed
in  diverse  application  fields, ranging  from  business  to
medicine,   from  engineering   to  finance,   from  law   to
electronics. All these systems have exploited the theoretical
results and the practical experience of previous work. In all
cases,  it  has been  shown  that  formal ontologies  play  a
central role in describing in a common and understandable way
the    logical     and    practical    features     of    the
application domain.

The success  of the  methodologies associated  with knowledge
modeling and ontologies led to increased need of a comparison
between  different approaches  and results,  with the  aim of
evaluating the interdependencies between theories and methods
of formal  ontology and the activities,  processes, and needs
of enterprise  organizations.

The FOMI  08 Workshop  aims to advance  in this  direction by
bringing together researchers and practitioners interested in
ontology  application,  paying  particular attention  to  the
topics listed below.


CONFERENCE TOPICS

*problems in ontology application:*
  - practical issues in using ontologies in the enterprise
  - real cases of successful/unsuccessful use of ontology in
    business
  - from legacy systems to the new ontology-driven systems

*ontology and business:*
  - ontology and ontological methodologies in business;
  - adaptation of ontologies for companies and organizations;
  - ontology effectiveness and evaluation in business

*ontology and enterprise:*
  - ontology-driven enterprise modeling;
  - ontology development and change within organizations;
  - ontology-driven representation of products, services,
    functionalities,
	 design, processes;

*ontology and enterprise knowledge:*
  - ontologies for the know-how;
  - ontologies for corporate knowledge;

*ontology in practice:*
  - ontologies for electronic catalogs, e-commerce, e-government;
  - ontologies for marketing;
  - ontologies for finance;
  - ontologies for engineering;
  - ontologies for medical sciences;

*ontology and linguistics:*
  - ontology-driven linguistic representation in organization
    knowledge;
  - linguistic problems in standards and in codification
    processes;
  - ontologies and multilingualism in business and
    organizations


PROGRAMME

The  Scientific Programme  will include  invited talks,  oral
presentations,  poster and  demo  presentations, and  panels.
Submitted papers  will be  peer-reviewed and selected  on the
basis  of  technical  quality,  relevance  of  the  described
experiences  (depending  on  the  type  of  submission),  and
clarity of the presentation  for the workshop. In particular,
we insist that papers should  be written for a wide audience.
Accepted  papers  will  be  presented at  the  workshop,  and
published as proceedings.


PROCEEDINGS

Accepted  papers will  appear  in  the Workshop  Proceedings,
published  by  IOS  Press and  distributed  to  participants.
Following the  past edition, a  selection of the  best papers
accepted at  the workshop will be  considered for publication
in  the international  journal "Applied  Ontology".


SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

* Format
   - The maximal paper length is 10 pages, excluding title
     page and bibliography.
   - Papers must be submitted in PDF format
   - Instructions and tools about the submissions can be found
