Workshop on text and citation analysis for scholarly digital libraries
Call for Papers

http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/nlpir4dl/

In recent years, interest in scholarly publications in electronic forms has
boomed,
and several large-scale electronic digital libraries and citation indices
are now used
everyday by researchers. Current digital libraries collect and allow access
to digital
papers and their metadata (including citations), but largely do not attempt
to analyze
the items they collect.

The goal of this workshop is to investigate how developments in natural
language
processing and information retrieval techniques can advance the
state-of-the-art
in scholarly document understanding, analysis and retrival. Full document
text analysis
can help design automatic summarization and sentiment detection methods,
automated
recommendation and reviewing systems, and may provide data for visualizing
scientific
trends and bibliometrics. Citation analysis takes this a step further,
adding scientific
social network analysis as another strand of evidence to enhance solutions
to the above
challenges. Web based digital libraries add download counts and Web 2.0
information
such as tagging.

Aside from researchers, this workshop hopes to interest other stakeholders,
namely
implementers, publishers and policymakers. Even within computer science,
many
different scholarly sites exist -- ACM Portal, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar,
PSU's
CiteSeerX, MSRA's Libra, Tsinghua's ArnetMiner, Trier's DBLP, UMass' Rexa,
Hiroshima's PRESRI -- and with this workshop we hope to bring a number of
these
contributers together. Today's publishers continue to seek new ways to be
relevant to their
consumers, in disseminating the right published works to their audience.
The fact that formal citation metrics have become an increasingly large
factor in
decision-making by universities and funding bodies worldwide makes the need
for research
in such topics and for better methods for measuring the impact of work more
pressing.

We invite stimulating and unpublished submissions on topics including (but
not limited to)
full-text analysis, multimedia and multilingual analysis and alignment as
well as citation-based
NLP or IR. Specific examples of fields of interests include:

* new information access methods for scientific papers
* automatic creation of reviews
* automatic qualitative assessment of submissions
* summarisation of scientific articles
* navigation, searching and browsing in scholarly DLs
* techniques for suggesting and recommending scholarly papers, reviewers,
citations
   and publication venues
* information retrieval for scholarly text, e.g. citation-based IR
* topical modeling analysis
* network analysis and citation analysis in scholarly DLs
* citation function/motivation analysis
* novel bibliographic metrics
* niche search in scholarly DLs, e.g., survey paper finding and provenance
tracing of
  algorithms)
* knowledge discovery and analysis of the ancestry of ideas
* analyses of writing style in scholarly publications
* multilingual and multimedia analysis and alignment of scholarly works
* managing digital archives of linguistic corpora; federated access
* metadata and controlled vocabularies for resource description and
discovery
* automatic metadata discovery, e.g., language identification
* data cleaning and data quality
* disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs using NLP or IR techniques.

Organizers:

Simone Teufel
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
William Gates Building, JJ Thompson Ave,
Cambridge CB3 0FD, United Kingdom.

Simone Teufel is a senior lecturer in the Computer Laboratory at Cambridge
University,
where she has worked since 2001. Her main research interests are in
corpus-linguistic
approaches to discourse theory, and in the application of such information
to
summarisation, information retrieval and citation analysis. She has a
background in
computer science (1994 Diploma from University of Stuttgart) and in
cognitive science
(2000 PhD from Edinburgh University), and has also experience in medical
information
processing and search, from a postdoctoral stay at Columbia University, and
in
collocation extraction, from a research post at Xerox Europe. Her latest
research interests
include lexical acquisition, and the visualisation and language generation
of the analysis
results of scientific articles.

Min-Yen Kan
AS6 05-12 Computing 1, Law Link
National University of Singapore

Min-Yen Kan is an assistant professor at the National University of
Singapore. His research
interests include digital libraries and applied natural language processing.
Specific projects
include work in the areas of citation analysis, document structure
acquisition, verb analysis,
and applied text summarization. Prior to joining NUS, he was a graduate
research assistant
at Columbia University, and has interned at various industry laboratories,
including AT&T,
IBM and Eurospider Technologies in Switzerland.
