Issue #6: 'Diminutives and augmentatives in the languages of the world'

The e-journal Lexis is planning to publish its sixth issue, devoted to
Diminutives and augmentatives in the languages of the world, in October 2010.

When Scalise (1984) came up with an idea of evaluative morphology as a
third level of morphology, distinct from both derivational morphology and
inflectional morphology, he gave an important impetus to the research in
this field. By evaluative morphology we mean the use of morphological
devices to express various aspects of the categories of diminutiveness and
augmentativeness. These categories reflect various degrees of 'deviation'
from what is intuitively viewed as the standard quantity - physical
quantity as in Pipil wi:lu-tsín (bird-DIM) 'small bird'; the quantity of
quality as in Thai díi-dii 'very good'; quantity of action as in Jaqaru
jaych.k'a 'to kill' < jaycha 'to beat, to hit', and also hypocoristics,
such as Slovak be?ka? 'run-hypocoristic' < beha? 'run'; diminutives and
augmentatives may have an ameliorative or a pejorative meaning.
While it was demonstrated by Stump (1993) and Katamba (1993), among others,
that Scalise's assumption is language-specific (for example, a special
status of evaluative morphology in Italian and Bahnar, a Mon-Khmer
language) rather than of universal nature, Scalise succeeded in pointing
out the importance of this field of morphology. There are nonetheless many
issues still to be resolved concerning diminutives and augmentatives,
including, inter alia:
- the status of evaluative morphology within the morphological component;
- the scope of evaluative morphology in terms of semantic categories;
- synchronic and diachronic aspects of research;
- evaluative morphology from the perspective of langue and parole;
- the relation between the morphological and genetic type of language on
one hand;
- and the way of expressing evaluative categories on the other;
- the typology of diminutives and augmentatives, and the related
cross-linguistic research;
- evaluative morphology and word-classes;
- phonetic symbolism in relation to the categories of diminutiveness and
augmentativeness;
- homonymy/polysemy of evaluative affixes;
- productivity of morphological processes (suffixation, prefixation,
compounding, reduplication, etc.) used for the formation of
diminutives/augmentatives;
- evaluative morphology and recursiveness, etc.

Papers on any of these and other related issues are welcome for the 6th
issue of Lexis.
