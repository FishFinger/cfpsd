NEW SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR ALL CONTRIBUTIONS: APRIL 29th 2007

*******************************************************************

7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
    Plus GALA - Gathering of Life-like Agents
            17th - 19th September 2007
                Paris, France
            http://iva07.ntua.gr

            1st Call for Papers
*******************************************************************

SCOPE

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied 
agents in an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able to 
interact intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and especially 
with human users.

The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and 
practitioners in computer graphics, animation, computer games, virtual 
environments, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
cognitive modeling, human-computer interaction and artificial life. 
Since the first IVA back in 1999
firm lines of research have been established and there is much that the 
graphics and AI communities can learn from each other.

The domain of Intelligent Virtual Agents has become much more diverse 
and now encompasses a wide range of disciplines; cognitive and social 
psychology, communication models (conversational skills, interaction 
loops, conversational analysis), non-verbal communication, sociology 
(modeling human / IVA societies), HCI (intelligent user interfaces, 
gesture/body tracking interfaces), design and arts (e.g., interactive 
installations with IVAs), and numerous application domains.

While initial research often focused on the use of IVAs in virtual 
environments, they are now
increasingly used in web-based interfaces, personal computing devices 
and interactive television. The rapid advances in the field have enabled 
it to be applied in both in research and industrial contexts. IVAs can 
provide appealing characters for games and entertainment. They can also 
be used in novel user interfaces or even as tools of psychological 
research.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and 
practitioners from academia and industry with an interest in the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of IVAs and IVA applications. We aim for 
a lively program of timely, high-quality presentations and 
demonstrations to discuss the state of the art and future of Intelligent 
Virtual Agents. Papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag LNAI 
(Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series.

This year, IVA'07 and ACII'07 (http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/acii2007/) are 
happening close to each other. While we do encourage submitting to both 
conferences we do highlight there are differences in topics of interest 
in each conference. We highly advise authors to read them carefully. 
Papers submitted to both conferences should be clearly different in 
their scope and topic.

IVA'07 will also host GALA - The Gathering of Life-like Agents - see
