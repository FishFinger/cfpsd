Worth thinking about.  Suggested strategy:  do two papers, one with your
supervisor(s) for the main conference, and one solo for the SRW; your
supervisor will suggest appropriate material breakdown.

Meeting Description:

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback
both from the general audience and from selected panelists --
experienced researchers who prepare in-depth comments and questions in
advance of the presentation.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the
emphasis is on work in progress. Original and unpublished research is
therefore invited on all aspects of computational linguistics
including, but not limited to, the following topic areas:

-pragmatics and discourse
-semantics and lexicons
-syntax and grammars
-phonetics, phonology and morphology
-linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
-information retrieval, information extraction and question answering
-summarization and paraphrasing
-speech recognition and speech synthesis
-corpus-based language modeling
-multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids
-spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems
-multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems
-narrative understanding systems

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos.

More information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page,
http://www.acl2007.org/ . =


1. General Invitation for Submissions:

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback
both from the general audience and from selected panelists --
experienced researchers who prepare in-depth comments and questions in
advance of the presentation.

2. Submission Requirements:

The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with
the opportunity of presenting their work in a formal setting.
Submission will therefore normally be open only to students who have
settled on their thesis direction but who still have significant
research left to do; those students in the final stages of their
thesis and those who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL
Student Research Workshop should submit to the main
conference instead.

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers
should clearly indicate directions for future research wherever
appropriate. The papers may have more than one author; however, all
authors must be students (graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted
are eligible only if they have not been presented at any other meeting
with publicly available published proceedings. Papers that are being
submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate
this on the submission page.

3. Submission Procedure:

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. These will be available
from the web pages of ACL-07. A description of the format is also
available in case you are unable to use these style files directly.
Submission must be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. More details regarding the submission procedure
will be posted on the workshop website.

4. Reviewing Procedure:

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance
decision will be based on the results of the review.

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make
sure your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the
paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed
previously (Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001)
previously showed ...''.

5. Schedule:

The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time January
23, 2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be
automatically disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after
receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by
e-mail) on March 23, 2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the
preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors
with their acceptance notice.

Important Dates:

Paper submissions deadline: January 23, 2007
Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007
Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007
Conference date: June 24-29, 2007

6. Travel Grants:

Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to
the Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel
grants, please contact the co-chairs of the Student Research Workshop.

7. Contact Information:

If you need to contact the co-chairs of the Student Workshop, please
