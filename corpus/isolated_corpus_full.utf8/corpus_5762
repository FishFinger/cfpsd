CALL FOR PAPERS

Title: HCSNet Workshop on Mobile Applications for Communication Disorders
Topic: This workshop is designed to facilitate communication between different disciplines in order to initiate the collaborative development of new mobile applications for communication disorders.
Related Priority Areas: Human Communication Disorders, Effective Interfaces
Date: Monday 21st September 2009
Location: Melbourne Zoo, Melbourne, VIC
Contact: David Copland (d.copland@uq.edu.au)

Description

New technologies provide new opportunities for service delivery in managing communication disorders and addressing clinical constraints on face-to-face time availability. The recent advent of smart phones and mobile devices provides an exciting new range of potential platforms for the development of clinical tools for children and adults with communication disorders. These new technologies provide new opportunities for service delivery in managing communication disorders and addressing clinical constraints on face-to-face time availability.

Potential uses of this new technology include:
â¢ Augmentative or alternative communication
â¢ Measuring and monitoring day-to-day communicative activity
â¢ Delivering tailored speech, language, and reading treatment
â¢ Assessing communicative function

This workshop is designed to facilitate communication between different disciplines in order to initiate the collaborative development of new mobile applications for communication disorders. As this field is in its infancy, the primary focus of the workshop will be on identifying and understanding the potential of this new technology and determining possible clinical applications. Another focus will be currently developed tools or uses of mobiles and their possible application in these populations.

Other topics of interest include:
â¢ Accessibility and mobile phones
â¢ Mobile speech recording and analysis
â¢ Social uses of mobiles and implications for communication disorders
â¢ Technological capacity of mobiles for presentation of auditory and visual information
â¢ Current uses of mobile technology for language training or cognitive testing
â¢ Design considerations for application development
â¢ Gestural interactions using mobile technology
â¢ Speech recognition and mobile interfaces

This workshop will be held in conjunction with the HCSNet Workshop on Social Technologies for Health and Medicine.
Audience

It is expected that this workshop will be of interest to a range of researchers and clinicians including those from areas such as speech pathology, speech science, human-computer interaction, interaction design, information technology, computer science, electrical engineering, linguistics, rehabilitation, occupational therapy, developmental and educational psychology.
Event Format

The workshop will be held on the 21st of September at the Melbourne Zoo. It will include an international keynote speaker and invited national speakers who are experts in relevant fields. There will also be presentations from participants and opportunities for discussion and development of ideas and future directions in this area. In order to encourage the development of research collaborations and to foster inter-disciplinary discussions, there will be the opportunity for some participants to present short papers on âProposed uses of mobile phone applicationsâ which may not necessarily involve completed projects. Participants will get a chance to meet others with similar interest and exchange ideas. We envision further discussions to continue online after the workshop.
Submission Format

Interested participants are invited to make one of three submissions (up to 300 words)
(1) Statement of background and interests in this topic
(2) Abstract on âProposed uses of mobile phone applicationsâ
(3) Abstract describing research completed or in progress that is relevant to this topic
Note that to make a submission (or to qualify for travel support) you need to sign up to the HCSNet community (itâs free!); you can register for HCSNet at (http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/user/register).

Submission deadline: Monday 10th August 2009
