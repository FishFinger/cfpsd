Meeting Description

3rd International Symposium on Intercultural, Cognitive and Social Pragmatics

Dedicated to 'Intercultural Pragmatics and Language Teaching'

Pablo de Olavide University (Seville, Spain)
February 20-22, 2008 

Dear colleagues,

The research group 'Intercultural Pragmatic Studies (English-Spanish):
Pragmatic and Discourse Aspects' of the University Pablo de Olavide of
Seville (Spain) is pleased to announce its Third Symposium on
Intercultural, Cognitive and Social Pragmatics (EPICS III -  Encuentros de
Pragmática Intercultural, Cognitiva y Social), to be held in February
20-22, 2008. 

The third edition of the symposium will be devoted to ''Intercultural
Pragmatics and Language Teaching''. Dr. Helen Spencer-Oatey, Director of
the Centre for English Language Teacher Education, Warwick University,
(U.K.) and Dr. Victoria Escandell-Vidal, Professor of Linguistics at the
U.N.E.D. (Spain), have confirmed their presence as the symposium's keynote
speakers. 

The Symposium will serve as a forum where applied linguists and
practitioners of Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis can meet, share
experiences, discuss common problems, and present papers on their latest
research in the field. EPICS III also wishes to create awareness among
graduating students of the growing interest in this area of linguistic
expertise.
     		
Submissions

We welcome original papers, written in English or Spanish (20 minutes in
length, the last 5 minutes will be devoted to questions and discussion) on
any topic relevant to the mission of ''Intercultural Pragmatics and
Language Teaching''.  The symposium is especially interested in papers that: 

- explore the implications of pragmatics research for theoretical
developments and practical applications in the fields of second language
acquisition and intercultural communication,
- discuss language in use in the context of cross-cultural interaction,
- analyze pragmatics research findings from the perspective of bi- and
multilingual development, 
- study the nature of interaction of bi- and multilinguals and language
learners,
- investigate the effect of dual language and multilingual systems on the
development and use of pragmatics skills,
- examine the teachability and learnability of pragmatic skills in
instructional environments.

Participants should submit one-page abstract (500 words) accompanied by a
step-by-step outline of the presentation and the following information: 

1. Author's name(s) and affiliation
2. Title of paper
3. Audio-visual equipment required (VHS video, OHP, cassette)

Full Title: 2008 SLA Graduate Student Symposium 

Date: 11-Apr-2008 - 12-Apr-2008
Location: Madison, WI, USA 
Contact Person: Barbara Bird
Meeting Email: slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 05-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description

2008 SLA Graduate Student Symposium
'Evolving Perspectives in SLA'
Friday, April 11, 2008 & Saturday, April 12, 2008
Lowell Hall, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison)
Co-sponsored by the University of Iowa (U of I) 

Call for Papers

The field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is evolving to include a variety
of both cognitively- and socially-based perspectives. As is stated in the
Introduction to the December 2007 Focus Issue of The Modern Language Journal (in
press), ''some basic premises within these two traditions may be different, but
they both ask interesting and crucial questions, the answers to which can lead
to a deeper appreciation of the complex forces are work in [second language] L2
learning'' (Lafford, B. (in press)). Second language acquisition
reconceptualized?: The impact of Firth and Wagner (1997). Modern Language
Journal, 91.). 

We seek proposals from graduate student research, both theoretical and
empirical, that reflect the differing perspectives and methods currently used in
SLA research. The research may be interdisciplinary in nature. 

Invited Speakers from the Sponsoring Institutions
Sally Sieloff Magnan (UW-Madison): http://frit.lss.wisc.edu/frit/faculty/magnan.html
Roumyana Slabakova (U of I): http://www.uiowa.edu/~linguist/faculty/slabakova/

Invited Panel Discussion Moderator
Barbara Lafford (Arizona State University): http://www.public.asu.edu/~blafford/

The six-member panel of professors and graduate students from the U of I and the
UW-Madison will be led by Barbara Lafford, Guest Editor of the Focus Issue of
The Modern Language Journal (MLJ, 91, 5, 2007), which revisits the Firth &
Wagner debate (MLJ, 81, 3, 1997). The panel will address questions such as the
following:
- Can cognitively- and socially-oriented perspectives have something to offer
each other?
- What is the future of SLA research, and how may a 'global multilingual
reality'' impact it?
- Is SLA still part of Applied Linguistics?
- What does this debate, if anything, add to the field of SLA?

Submission Guidelines
We invite proposals for papers and posters from graduate students at any level
of graduate study. Paper presentations will be 30 minutes with a 10-minute
discussion period following. Poster presentations will be displayed at a 1-hour
session during which poster authors will stand by their posters to discuss their
work.

Please submit abstracts by November 5, 2007 to: slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu

Please adhere to the following format.

I. In the body of the email message, please fill all of the following fields in
the given order:
1. Title of presentation (maximum 10 words)
2. Presenter's name (family, given)

4. Mailing address (including city, state, zip code)
5. Phone/Fax
6. Preferred email address for correspondence
7. Summary of the presentation, with a clear theoretical or empirical focus (no
longer than 50 words). This summary will be included in the program booklet and
can not be subsequently revised.

II. Also in the body of the email message, please copy one of the following options:
1. I wish my abstract to be considered for presentation at the 2008 SLA Graduate
Student Symposium, but if not selected for presentation, I would like it to be
considered for presentation as a poster.
2. I wish my abstract to be considered only as a poster presentation at the 2008
SLA Graduate Student Symposium.

III. As an attachment, please include an abstract. The attachment must be a
Microsoft Word document and must not exceed 300 words. Please place the title as
the first line of the document. Author and institution names should be blinded
for review.

Evaluation of Proposals:
I.   Choice and clarity of topic, perspective, and/or method
II.  Quality of research (literature, methods, and conclusions)
III. Contribution to field, originality
IV. Relevance to current issues in SLA

Please contact slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu with questions. A website
