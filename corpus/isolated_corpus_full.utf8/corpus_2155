****************************************************

Natural language has always posed serious challenges to theory of
computation and Turing Machine based intelligence. This controversy also
inspired the writing of exciting stories in the literature, e.g., The
Cambridge Quintet by John Casti. However, natural language plays a key role
in many areas such as

* Web and Web based Information Systems

* Information Retrieval in Cross-Lingual or Mono-Lingual settings

* Digital Libraries

* Documentation in Software Engineering

* Document and Content Management Systems

* Human-Machine Interaction

* Machine Translation

* Knowledge Management and Electronic Encyclopedias

Since 1995, the NLDB conference, with high impact factor, has aimed at
bringing together researchers, industrials and potential users interested in
various applications of Natural Language in the Web and database driven
information systems area. It hascontributed to many areas such as

* improving the development process from the viewpoint of developers (e.g.,
the process of requirements engineering, conceptual modeling, validation,
etc.)

* the usability of applications (e.g., natural language query interfaces,
retrieval, semantic web, etc.)

* knowledge extraction and dissemination (e.g., text mining, knowledge
discovery, etc.)

To highlight these inspiring connections, NLDB 2008 will take place from
June 25 to June 27 in the world city of London (UK). It will provide the
stage for fruitful and challenging discussions.

**********INDICATIVE TOPICS OF INTEREST******************

* Semantic Web and Information Retrieval

* Text and Web Mining

* Taxonomies and Ontology Extraction from Text

* Document Classification and Indexing

* Natural Language in Conceptual Modelling

* Natural Language in Software Engineering

* Natural Language Based Interfaces for Database

* Querying and Retrieval

* Natural Language Based Integration of Systems

* Large Scale On-line Linguistic Resources

* Electronic Dictionaries

* Digital Libraries

* Applications of Computational Linguistics in Information Systems

* Management of Textual Databases

* Natural Language for Data Warehouses and Data Mining
