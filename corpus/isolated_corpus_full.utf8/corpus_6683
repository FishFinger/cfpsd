Meeting Description:

Key note speakers

- Professor Srikant Sarangi, Cardiff University
- Professor Hanna Risku, Danube University Krems
- Senior scientist Hugo Fjelsted Alr=F8e, International Centre for
Research in Organic Food Systems

The conference is the 3rd conference in our international biannual conferen=
ce
series that approach communication, discourse, and concrete texts from a 36=
0=B0
perspective. After the first two conferences in the series, which had the
instructive text (2006) and knowledge (2008) as the focal points, we now fo=
cus
on knowledge asymmetries.=20

According to Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English=20
Language (1989 edition), being asymmetric means 'not identical on both side=
s of
a central line'. Talking about knowledge asymmetries, i.e., using asymmetry=
 not
as a geometrical or mathematical concept but figuratively, we apply it as a
metaphor to human communicative interaction.=20

Call for Papers

We invite papers that approach knowledge asymmetries from different=20
perspectives. Accordingly, three tracks focusing on three different=20
perspectives are foreseen, i.e.:=20

- Communication
- Representation
- Construction and Learning

Track 1: Communication; e.g. papers focusing on:=20
- what features, crystallization points etc. can be found within communicat=
ive=20
events where knowledge asymmetries may manifest themselves?=20
- how do knowledge asymmetries influence communicative action?=20

Track 2: Representation; e.g. papers focusing on:
- how and to which extent are knowledge asymmetries in relation to an 'alte=
r'=20
constructed in texts?
- which strands of texts, genres, or discourses seem to favour a) the
development, b) the maintenance or c) the deconstruction of knowledge=20
asymmetries?

Track 3: Construction and Learning; e.g. papers focusing on:
- how and to which extent are knowledge asymmetries of an individual in=20
relation to an 'alter' measurable?
- what features, parameters etc. are responsible for the fact that individu=
als=20
seem to overcome knowledge asymmetries differently?

For participation with paper, please complete the abstract template on this=
=20
website:  http://www.asb.dk/article.aspx?pid=3D22137

The abstract must be sent to 360@asb.dk.=20

The deadline for submission of abstracts is 15th January, 2010

The conference languages are English and German.
