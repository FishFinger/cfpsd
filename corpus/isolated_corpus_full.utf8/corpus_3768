Full Title: Current Issues in Language Planning 


Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics;Discipline of Linguistics;General Linguistics;Language Documentation;Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2009 

Current Issues in Language Planning (ISSN 1466-4208), published by
Multilingual Matters since 2000, provides major summative and thematic
review studies and book reviews, spanning and focusing the disparate
language policy and planning literature related to: Polities & Language
Planning (2 numbers); Issues in Language Planning (2 numbers) a year.  

CILP is announcing a Call for Papers for a forthcoming issue on 'Language
Planning and information technologies'.

The Editor for this issue is Tony Liddicoat <Tony.Liddicoat@unisa.edu.au>.
It is anticipated papers will be published in Vol 11,1. 2010.

Information technologies have had a considerable impact on language use in
recent decades. The development of new technologies has often been
undertaken without consideration of language issues, and this has meant
that language-planning work has been needed to integrate new technologies
into existing language ecologies. At the same time, technology developers,
especially software developers, have become aware of some of the language
issues relevant to the uptake and use of their products. Information
technologies have also been seen as a way of democratising communication,
and this has afforded many language communities new ways to develop,
promote and use their languages in the public domain. Modern information
technologies are characterised by rapid change involving a continuous cycle
of innovation, replacement and obsolescence of technologies which further
complicates language planning work. These developments have required
responses from government and from various institutions to respond to the
issues to which the development of new technologies have given rise. The
focus of planning for language issues revolving around technology includes,
but is not limited to:
-	The planning of language and literacy capabilities required to access and
use technologies, including issues relating to the 'digital divide'.
-	The development of technologies to support languages and to permit access
to technologies through particular languages.
-	The use of technology to achieve language planning goals in areas such as
education, language maintenance, prestige planning, etc.
-	Corpus planning for the language of technology.
This volume seeks to canvass the range of technology related issues which
confront contemporary language planners and to profile work in this field.

The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 31 January 2009.

The deadline for receipt of the final paper is 1 June 2009.
