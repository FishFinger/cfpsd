Meeting Description

This session invites papers addressing meaning construction in critical
discourse analysis from the perspectives of cognitive linguistics and cognitive
pragmatics. 

Critical discourse analysis (CDA) identifies three analytic stages: description,
interpretation and explanation (Fairclough 1995: 98). Halliday's systemic
function linguistics has become synonymous with description-stage analysis of
representation in text. And at the explanation stage, CDA is associated with
Marxism and Critical Theory. Very little work, however, has been carried out at
the interpretation stage, which is concerned with discourse processing.
Discourse processing, of course, involves meaning construction as understood in
cognitive linguistics or cognitive pragmatics. Cognitive linguistics is a broad
paradigm subsuming a number of distinct theories and thus offering a range of
potential analytical tools to CDA. But whilst CDA has made use of conceptual
metaphor theory, it has not recognised cognitive linguistic approaches to
discourse and the input they provide at the interpretation-stage. Similarly,
cognitive approaches to pragmatics have not been recognised in CDA.

This methodologically-oriented session then, invites papers addressing meaning
construction in political text and discourse from the perspectives of cognitive
linguistics and cognitive pragmatics. As such, papers applying conceptual
blending theory, construction grammar, discourse space theory, frame
negotiation, mental space theory or relevance theory, for example, are
particularly welcome.

Meeting Description

FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and industrial
practitioners meet to analyze and discuss issues related to methods, theories,
tools and applications based on formal ontologies. 

FOMI 2008 - 3rd Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry

June 5-6, 2008, Torino, Italy

First Announcement and Call for Papers
		
Conference web site: http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it

This event is jointly organized by:
- Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento
- University of Torino
- University of Verona

Conference Aims

There is today wide agreement that knowledge modeling and the semantic dimension
of information plays an increasingly central role in networked economy:
semantic-based applications are relevant in distributed systems such as
networked organizations, organizational networks, and in distributed knowledge
management. These knowledge models in industry aim to provide a framework for
information and knowledge sharing, reliable information exchange, meaning
negotiation and coordination between distinct organizations or among members of
the same organization.

New tools and applications have been and are being developed in diverse
application fields, ranging from business to medicine, from engineering to
finance, from law to electronics. All these systems have exploited the
theoretical results and the practical experience of previous work. In all cases,
it has been shown that formal ontologies play a central role in describing in a
common and understandable way the logical and practical features of the
application domain.

The success of the methodologies associated with knowledge modeling
and ontologies led to increased need of a comparison between different
approaches and results, with the aim of evaluating the interdependencies
between theories and methods of formal ontology and the activities, processes,
and needs of enterprise organizations.

The FOMI 08 Workshop aims to advance in this direction by bringing
together researchers and practitioners interested in ontology application,
paying particular attention to the topics listed below.

Conference Topics

problems in ontology application:
- practical issues in using ontologies in the enterprise
- real cases of successful/unsuccessful use of ontology in business
- from legacy systems to the new ontology-driven systems

ontology and business:
- ontology and ontological methodologies in business;
- adaptation of ontologies for companies and organizations;
- ontology effectiveness and evaluation in business

ontology and enterprise:
- ontology-driven enterprise modeling;
- ontology development and change within organizations;
- ontology-driven representation of products, services, functionalities, design,
processes;

ontology and enterprise knowledge:
- ontologies for the know-how;
- ontologies for corporate knowledge;

ontology in practice:
- ontologies for electronic catalogs, e-commerce, e-government;
- ontologies for marketing;
- ontologies for finance;
- ontologies for engineering;
- ontologies for medical sciences;

ontology and linguistics:
- ontology-driven linguistic representation in organization knowledge;
- linguistic problems in standards and in codification processes;
- ontologies and multilingualism in business and organizations

Programme

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster
and demo presentations, and panels. Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and
selected on the basis of technical quality, relevance of the described
experiences (depending on the type of submission), and clarity of the
presentation for the workshop. In particular, we insist that papers should be
written for a wide audience. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop,
and published as proceedings.

Accepted papers will be electronically published on CD and distributed to
participants. Following the past edition, a selection of the best papers
accepted at the workshop will be considered for publication in the international
journal ''Applied Ontology''

Submissions and Dates

Format
- The maximal paper length is 10 pages, excluding title page and bibliography.
- Papers must be submitted in PDF format
- Detailed instructions can be found in the conference site.

Deadlines:
- Paper Submission: January 7, 2008
- Acceptance Notification: March 3, 2008
- Camera Ready: March 31, 2008
