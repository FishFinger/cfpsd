Meeting Description:

Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by the
Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event will be the
fifth annual installment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and the
continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various guises
since the early 90s.

The ALTA Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Australian Document
Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues ranging from the
fundamentals of document architectures and standards for markup, through various
aspects of document processing.

The goals of the workshop are:

- to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia
and New Zealand and encourage interactions;

- to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community and with the
wider international LT community;

- to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; to
encourage dissemination of research results;

- to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;

- to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to
become aware of local LT research; and, finally,

- to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. 

Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

- speech understanding and generation;
- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
- interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
- language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
- summarisation;
- machine translation and translation aids;
- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- natural language and multimodal systems;
- message and narrative understanding systems;
- evaluations of language systems;
- computational lexicography.

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT community, and
particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community
through the consideration of practical LT applications and through
multi-disciplinary research.
Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend
the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this
year's conference. The style files and example documents are available from the
workshop website. We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform
to these styles including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems, please
contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be rejected without
being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send an early version with the
typographical complexity of your final intended version so that we can check it
is printable. All papers should include the full authors' names and
affiliations. (Note that this diverges from the ''blind'' submission guidelines
adopted for ACL conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the workshop
website. Contact the organisers (workshop AT alta DOT asn DOT au) for any
questions regarding this process.
Proceedings

A proceedings containing all papers (presentations and posters) will be produced
in paper and/or CD-ROM format. Each format will have an ISBN number.
