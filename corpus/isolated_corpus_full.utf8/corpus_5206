Meeting Description:

Production of Referring Expressions (PRE-CogSci 2009): Bridging the gap between
computational and empirical approaches to reference
(29 July 2009, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)

http://pre2009.uvt.nl/

PRE-CogSci 2009 is organized as part of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive
Science Society (CogSci 2009 http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference2009/)

Invited Speakers:
- Deb Roy (MIT, USA)
- William S. Horton (Northwestern University, USA)

There is a long research tradition of work on the production of referring expressions, in the area of computational linguistics as well as in psycholinguistics and cognitive science. This encompasses work on definite descriptions, deictic expressions, anaphora, and many other topics. Both research traditions have resulted in many interesting findings, but so far the interaction between these two traditions has been very limited. We believe that much is to be gained from more interaction, for both research traditions involved.

This workshop aims to bring together --for the first time-- psycholinguists with an interest in computational modeling and computational linguists with an interest in human speech production. In addition, the workshop is expected to be of interest to theoretical linguists whose work borders on other areas of cognitive science, particularly those with an interest in discourse structure, and those interested in models of human language that are grounded in cognitive principles.

The workshop will open with a short introductory talk about the production or referring expressions, to make the workshop broadly accessible. The rest of the
day will consist of a mixture of regular 20 minute talks, poster presentations and two invited talks by renowned experts in the field.

We received financial support from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific
Research (NWO), via the Vici project 'Bridging the gap between computational
linguistics and psycholinguistics: The case of referring expressions' (Krahmer; 277-70-007), which is gratefully acknowledged.

We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!

Second Call for Papers
Extended Submission Deadline: May 15, 2009

We invite substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics
related to the production of referring expressions. Contributions may focus on
computational or experimental approaches to reference, with combinations of the
two especially appreciated. Note that we particularly welcome new results, but
given the purpose of the workshop, papers that present an original overview of
previously published work tailored to this workshop may also be acceptable.

Topics of interest include computational and/or experimental approaches to:
- different kinds of referring expressions; when are which types of reference
(pronouns, descriptions, etc.) most appropriate?
- plural and quantified references
- vagueness: the use of vague (e.g. gradable) predicates in referring expressions
- referential overspecification: why and how do speakers overspecify?
- referential underspecification: production of descriptions which do not
uniquely identify a referent
- referring expressions in interactive settings; audience design, adaptation and
alignment
- ambiguity avoidance in references
- common ground, cooperativeness and shared/private information in reference
- realization of referring expressions (including speech and gesture)
- visual scene perception and its influence on the production of referring
expressions
- social and contextual factors in reference
- data-collection and experimental evaluation methods

Extended Abstract Submission:
Paper selection will be based on extended abstracts (max 2000 words). The only
accepted format for submitted abstracts is Adobe PDF. Abstracts should be sent
to k.vdeemter@abdn.ac.uk.

Final submission:
Upon acceptance, authors are invited to prepare a 4-6 page paper using the
COGSCI author kit
(http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference2009/submissions.html). Final
versions need to be submitted as pdf. Papers will be published in on line
proceedings, and the authors retain the copyrights. Final versions of accepted
papers should be sent to k.vdeemter@abdn.ac.uk.

Special Issue:
We hope to edit a special issue based on the workshop results. More information
about this will follow.

If authors have any questions, they should contact the workshop organizers.
