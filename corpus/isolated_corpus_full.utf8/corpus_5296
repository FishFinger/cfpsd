========== ICMI-MLMI 2009 Call for Papers ================

ICMI-MLMI 2009

Cambridge, MA, USA,
November 2-6 2009
sponsored by ACM SIGCHI

The Eleventh International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces and The Sixth
Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction will jointly take
place in the Boston area from November 2-6, 2009. The main aim of 
ICMI-MLMI 2009 is to further scientific research within the broad field of 
multimodal interaction, methods and systems. This joint conference will 
focus on major trends and challenges in this area, and work to identify a 
roadmap for future research and commercial success. ICMI-MLMI 2009 will 
feature a single-track main conference with keynote speakers, panel 
discussions, technical paper presentations, poster sessions, and 
demonstrations of state of the art multimodal systems and concepts. It 
will be followed by workshops.

Venue:
The conference will take place at the MIT Media Lab, widely known for its
innovative spirit. Organized in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, ICMI-MLMI
2009 provides an excellent setting for brainstorming and sharing the 
latest advances in multimodal interaction, systems, and methods in a city 
known as one of the top historical, technological, and scientific centers 
of the US.

Important dates:

Paper submission May 29, 2009
Author notification July 20, 2009
Camera-ready due August 20, 2009
Conference Nov 2-4, 2009
Workshops Nov 5-6, 2009

Topics of interest:

Multimodal and multimedia processing:

Algorithms for multimodal fusion and multimedia fission
Multimodal output generation and presentation planning
Multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
Generating non-verbal behaviors for embodied conversational agents
Machine learning methods for multimodal processing

Multimodal input and output interfaces:

Gaze and vision-based interfaces
Speech and conversational interfaces
Pen-based interfaces
Haptic interfaces
Interfaces to virtual environments or augmented reality
Biometric interfaces combining multiple modalities
Adaptive multimodal interfaces

Multimodal applications:

Mobile interfaces
Meeting analysis and intelligent meeting spaces
Interfaces to media content and entertainment
Human-robot interfaces and human-robot interaction
Vehicular applications and navigational aids
Computer-mediated human to human communication
Interfaces for intelligent environments and smart living spaces
Universal access and assistive computing
Multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization

Human interaction analysis and modeling:

Modeling and analysis of multimodal human-human communication
Audio-visual perception of human interaction
Analysis and modeling of verbal and non-verbal interaction
Cognitive modeling of users of interactive systems

Multimodal data, evaluation, and standards:

Evaluation techniques and methodologies for multimodal interfaces
Authoring techniques for multimodal interfaces
Annotation and browsing of multimodal data
Architectures and standards for multimodal interfaces


Paper Submission:

There are two different submission categories: regular paper and short 
paper.
The page limit is 8 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers.
The presentation style (oral or poster) will be decided by the committee 
based on suitability and schedule.

Demo Submission:

Proposals for demonstrations shall be submitted to demo chairs
electronically.
A two page description with photographs of the demonstration is required.

Doctoral Spotlight:

Funds are expected from NSF to support participation of doctoral candidates
at ICMI-MLMI 2009, and a spotlight session is planned to showcase ongoing
thesis work. Students interested in travel support can submit a short or
long paper as specified above.
