Overview and Aim
==============================================================================
The International Symposium on Rules, Applications and Interoperability has
evolved from an annual series of international workshops since 2002,
international conferences in 2005 and 2006, and international symposia since
2007. This year, the 3rd International Symposium on Rules, Applications and
Interoperability (RuleML-2009) takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA,
collocated with the 12th Business Rules Forum, the world's largest Business
Rules event. RuleML-2009 is devoted to practical distributed rule technologies
and rule-based applications which need language standards for rules
(inter)operating in, e.g., the Semantic Web, Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems,
Event-Driven Architectures, and Service-Oriented Applications. Especially, 
this year's focus will be on the practical adoption and application of standards
such as W3C RIF, OMG SBVR, OMG PRR, RuleML, ISO Common Logic, OASIS BPEL++Rules, 
OMG BPMN++Rules, and industry standards in relation with rules such as XBRL, 
MISMO, FIXatdl, FIX, FpML, HL7, Acord, etc.

The main goal of RuleML-2009 is to stimulate the cooperation and
interoperability between business and research, by bringing together rule
system providers, participants in rule standardization efforts, open source
communities, practitioners, and researchers. The concept of the symposium has
also advanced continuously in the face of extremely rapid progress in
practical rule and event processing technologies. As a result, RuleML-2009
will feature hands-on demonstrations and challenges alongside a wide range of
thematic tracks, thus and will be an exciting venue to exchange new ideas and
experiences on all issues related to the engineering, management, integration,
interoperation and interchange of rules in open distributed environments such
as the Web.

Conference Theme
==============================================================================
This year, we particularly welcome submissions that address applications of
Web rule technologies for business and information systems. We invite you to
share your ideas, results, and experiences: as an industry practitioner, rule
system provider, technical expert and developer, rule user or researcher,
exploring foundations, developing systems and applications, or using
rule-based systems. We invite high-quality submissions related to (but not
limited to) one or more of the following topics:

    CEP)
  - Non-functional requirements, use of annotations, metadata to capture those
  - Design time and execution time aspects of rule-based (Semantic) Business 
    Processes Modeling and Management
  - Practical and business aspects of rule-based (Semantic) Business Process 
    Management (business scenarios, case studies, use cases etc.)

  - Rules in Current Industry Standards, including:
    - XBRL: Extensible Business Reporting Language
    - MISMO: Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Org
    - FIXatdl: FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language

    - HL7: Health Level 7
    - Acord: Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development 
      (Insurance Industry)
  - Rules for Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC), e.g., rules for internal 
    audit, SOX compliance, enterprise risk management (ERM), operational 
    risk, etc
  - Rules and Corporate Actions
    
General Rule Topics
  - Rules and ontologies
  - Execution models, rule engines, and environments
  - From rules to FOL to modal logics
  - Rule-based reasoning with non-monotonic negation, modalities, deontic, 
    temporal, priority, scoped or other rule qualification
  - Rule-based default reasoning with default logic, defeasible logic, and 
    answer set programming
  - Graphical processing, modelling and rendering of rules
  - Rules in Semantic Web Technologies
  - Miscellaneous rule topics
    
Case studies, experience reports, and industrial problem statements are
particularly encouraged.

RuleML-2009 Challenge 
==============================================================================

       ****    MAKE RULEML-2009 YOUR WEB RULES SHOWCASE!   ****

The RuleML-2009 Challenge is one of the highlights of RuleML-2009. Rules are
used in interesting and practically relevant ways to, e.g., derive useful
information, transform knowledge, provide decision support and provide
automated rule-based monitoring, enforcement, validation or management of the
behavioural logic of the application. The Challenge offers participants the
chance to demonstrate their commercial and open source tools, use cases, and
applications. The recommended categories for the Challenge submissions are:

  - derivation rules and constructive views over data, 
  - production rules and (complex) event processing reaction rules, 
  - benchmark for evaluation of rule engines, and 
  - use cases / case studies (possibly using rule standards). 

We strongly suggest participants declare their submissions related to at least
one of the above categories.

Prizes will be awarded to the two best applications from each category. All
accepted demos will be presented in a special Challenge Session. A submission
to the RuleML Challenge has to meet the requirement that declarative rules
explicitly play a central role in the application. Basically this means that:
Rules are explicitly represented in a declarative format and they are
decoupled from the application (rather than being compiled or hard-coded into
the application logic). The demo should preferably (but not necessarily) be
embedded into a web-based or distributed environment so that there will be a
need for features related to the RuleML conference topics, as listed in the
call for papers. For more details please consult the RuleML-2009 Challenge
website:

                    http://ruleml-challenge.cs.nccu.edu.tw


Conference Language
==============================================================================
The official language of the conference will be English.


Submission
==============================================================================
Authors are invited to submit original contributions of practical relevance
and technical rigor in the field, experience reports and show case/use case
demonstrations of effective, practical, deployable rule-based technologies or
applications in distributed environments. Papers must be in English and may be
submitted at

            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ruleml2009

as:

Full Papers (15 pages in the proceedings)
Short Papers (8 pages in the proceedings)
RuleML-2009 Challenge Demo Paper + Show Cases (3-5 pages in the proceedings)

Please upload all submissions as PDF files in LNCS format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). To ensure high quality,
submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by 3 PC members based on
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
Authors are requested to upload the abstracts of their papers before June 9,
2008 and to upload their complete papers by June 16, 2008. The selected papers
will be published in book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) series along with a CD with demo software and documents. The
best paper from all submissions will be determined by the PC and a Best Paper
Award will be handed over at the Symposium by a Sponsor. All submissions must
be done electronically. A selection of revised papers will be resubmitted to a
special issue of a journal.
 
Submissions to the RuleML Challenge 2009 consist of a demo paper of 3-5 pages,
describing the demo show case, and a link to more information about the
demo/show case, e.g. a project site, an online demonstration, a presentation
about the demonstration, or a download site for the demonstration. In case of
product demos, the link can be password-protected: please submit a password
for anonymous login from any Web browser, giving us the permission to pass the
password on to 3 PC members. The submissions should satisfy the minimal
requirements defined in the topics of interest and preferably exhibit some of
the additional desiderata. The more desiderata are met by an application, the
higher the score will be. The demos will be evaluated by the RuleML-2009
Program Committee and prizes will be awarded to the two best applications,
sponsored by the RuleML Inc. non-profit organization.

 
Review Process
==============================================================================
The submitted papers will pass the blind review process. At least three
members of the Program Committee will review each submission.
