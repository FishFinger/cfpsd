Description:

Television, radio, cinema and computers, in addition to print media, have greatly expanded access to culture and information produced in indigenous languages in Mexico, Central and South America. In the 21st century, literatures in both traditional and emerging genres are being presented through the media as performances, in written and oral forms, and more recently in Internet multi-media formats. How do these developments support the revitalization of indigenous languages and cultures in these territories? Are they accessible to all members of the community? How are literary genres evolving in terms of these new modes of transmission?  What are the implications of moving from traditional literacy to new multi-media literacies in the context of the educational and socio-economic situations of indigenous communities?  This seminar will be an opportunity to examine indigenous literature in the mass media, and to exchange information about indigenous language films and recordi!
  ngs, radio and television programs and performances, computer programs, websites, newspapers and magazines, and other mass media adaptations and recordings of literary materials in indigenous languages. Papers may be in Spanish or English.

The Following Paper Topics Are Suggested:

-Can the Web help save my language?

-Multi-media resources in indigenous language revitalization.

-Networking and collaboration: Sharing ideas for indigenous language maintenance and development.

-How to choose, collect and prepare materials in indigenous languages for electronic resources.

-The Internet as a social space for networking and community building.

-How can mass media effectively maintain and promote oral traditions in indigenous languages? How are content, language and performance modes changed by the media?

-What is the effect of mass media on local literacies?

-How are New Information and Communication Technologies supporting the preservation and diffusion of traditional and modern literatures, and the creation of new literary genres in indigenous languages? What future developments are being planned?

-How do the mass media change the relationship between author and reader, performer and audience?

-The impact of the use of individual indigenous language websites on language maintenance and revitalization.

-Audio books in indigenous languages: Bridging the literacy divide.

-Digitalization of books and virtual libraries.

-On-line poetry, testimonial, narrative: multi modal performances.

-Developments in the production of electronic newsletters, magazines, on-line newspapers in indigenous languages.

-Expanding functional domains of language use through radio, television and other mass media.

-Risks and benefits of using new technologies in an age of indigenous language revitalization and increasing globalization. Are there conflicts of interest? Is the integrity of cultural knowledge compromised by the mass media?

-The use of mass media to disseminate knowledge of historical, cultural, linguistic and literary works.

-Computer literacy and access to computers in indigenous communities
