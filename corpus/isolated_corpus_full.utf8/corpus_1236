Full Title: Asian EFL Journal 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition; Sociolinguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 01-Jan-2008 

Call for Papers

The Asian EFL Journal is conducting a call for papers for book reviews of
recently published (within the last three years) professional books,
textbooks, and course materials dealing with theory or practice in the
fields of teaching English as second or foreign language, acquisition,
assessment, linguistics, and related disciplines.

The Journal currently encourages two kinds of submissions, unsolicited and
solicited. Unsolicited reviewers select their own materials to review. Both
teachers and graduate students are encouraged to submit reviews.  Solicited
reviewers are contacted and asked to review materials from its current list
of availability. If you would like to be considered as a solicited
reviewer, please forward your CV with a list of publications to the Book
Review Editor at asianefljournalbookreviews@yahoo.com.

All reviewers, unsolicited and solicited, are encouraged to provide
submissions about materials that they would like to suggest to colleagues
in the field by choosing materials that they feel have more positive
features than negative ones. 

Length and Format: 

1. Reviews should be prepared using MS Word and the format should conform
to 12 pica New Times Roman font, 1.5 spacing between lines, and 1 inch margins.
2. The reviewer(s)' full names including middle initial(s), title, school
affiliation, school address, phone number, and e-mail address should be
included at the top of the first page.
3. The complete title of the text, edition number, complete name(s) of
author(s), publisher, publisher's address (city & state), and date of
publication should be included after the reviewer(s)' identifying information.
4. Reviews should be between 500-700 words.
5. A brief biography of the author(s) should be included after the review.
6. A statement that the submission has not been previously published or is
not being considered for publication elsewhere should be included at the
bottom of the page.

Organization: 

Reviewers are encouraged to peruse reviews recently published in the
quarterly PDF version of the Journal for content and style before writing
their own. While creativity and a variety of writing styles are encouraged,
reviews, like other types of articles, should be concisely written and
contain certain information that follows a predictable order: a statement
about the work's intended audience, a nonevaluative description of the
material's contents, an academically worded evaluative summary which
includes a discussion of its positive features and one or two shortcomings
if applicable (no materials are perfect), and a comment about the
material's significance to the field. 

Style: 

1. All reviews should conform to the Journal's APA guideline requirements
and references should be used sparingly. 
2. Authors should use plural nouns rather than gendered pronouns such as
he/she, his/her him/her and adhere to the APA's Guidelines for Non-Sexist
Use of Language, which can be found at
http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/texts/nonsexist.html. 

Consideration Guidelines:

Submission Procedure: Reviews should be submitted via e-mail attachment to
asianefljournalbookreviews@yahoo.com.

Deadline for submission: 1 Jan 2008
