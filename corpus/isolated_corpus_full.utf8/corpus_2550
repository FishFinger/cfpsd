Meeting Description:

ACL Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications

To be held in conjunction with the 46th Association for Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL 2008)

Either June 19 or 20, Columbus, OH, USA 

Call for Papers

Workshop Description:
NLP-based applications have had a profound effect on education in the areas of assessment and instruction. Early applications focused on writing for automated essay scoring, short-answer response scoring in assessment and intelligent tutoring, and grammatical error detection for proofreading. More recently, NLP has been introduced into additional educational contexts, including automated scoring of speech and text-based curriculum development for reading support. In addition, the earlier applications for grammatical error detection have greatly improved. Not only has the field improved existing capabilities, but as a community we are generating innovative and creative ways to use NLP in applications for multiple skill sets, including writing, reading, and speaking.

The need for, and the rapid development of, language-based capability 
development in the United States and other Anglophone countries are driven by increased requirements for state/national assessments and a growing population of English language learners. In the past five years, steady growth in the area of NLP-based applications for education has prompted an increased number of workshops which typically focus on one specific aspect of NLP-based educational applications. In this workshop, we solicit papers from all subfields.

We intend to bring all subfields together to foster continued interaction and 
collaboration among researchers in both academic institutions and industry. 
This workshop (consistent with previous workshops at ACL 1997, NAACL/HLT 2003, and ACL 2005) will continue to expose the NLP research community to these technologies with the hope that they continue to identify novel opportunities for the use of NLP tools in educational applications. 

Topics of Interest:
For this workshop, we invite submissions including, but not limited to:
1. Automated Scoring/Evaluation for Text and Speech
   - Automated processing of spoken and written lecture materials across 
     genres, e.g., - Content-based analysis - Grammatical error detection - 
     Response-based discourse analysis - Stylistic analysis
   - Knowledge representation in learning systems
   - Machine translation for assessment, instruction, and curriculum   
     development
   - Plagiarism detection tools 
    
2. Intelligent Tutoring
   - Intelligent tutoring systems that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods
     to evaluate response content, using either text- or speech-based analyses
   - Dialogue systems in education
   - Hypothesis formation and testing in automated tutoring systems
   - Multi-modal communication between human learners and machines
   - Automatically generating tutorial responses 
    
3. Learner Cognition
   - Automated assessment of students' language and cognitive skill levels
   - Automated systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or 
     emotional states
   - Automatic generation of test questions
   - Tools for learners with special needs 
    
4. Corpora and annotation standards for building NLP educational tools

5. Use of Response Databases
   - Data mining of student corpora for tool building
   - Visualization of concepts in learning systems 

6. Classroom Tools 
   - NLP tools for second language learners
   - Semantic-based access to instructional materials
   - Tools for teachers and test developers (such as tools that automatically 
     identify text on a given topic, or adapt a text to the grade level of the 
     student, or assist in text-based curriculum development)
   - E-learning tools for personalized course content 

7. Evaluation of NLP-based tools for education 

8. Descriptions of Working Systems 

Submission Information:
Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, PDF 
format (with up to 1 additional page for references). Previously published 
papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are 
anonymous.  Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description:

The PLA Symposium 2008 endeavors to provide faculty and students from various disciplines related to linguistics opportunities to interact with those both inside and outside their respective disciplines. The Symposium will consist of a Special Session centered on the topic of 'The Interaction between Data and Theory' and a General Session. 

Second Call for Papers

Conference: Saturday, March 29, 2008; Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN

Submission Deadline: Friday, February 8, 2008

Acceptance Notification: Monday, March 3, 2008

Our invited speaker for this year is Jerrold M. Sadock (University of Chicago). Prof. Sadock will discuss how the range of data that are considered relevant for linguistic theory is related to the form and style of the linguistic theory in question. Broadly speaking, it seems that the more abstract the concepts that a theory invokes, the narrower the range of data that investigators make use of. Conversely, the more superficial the basic concepts are, the more inclusive the range of data that investigators take into account.
 
Special Session: 
''The Interaction between Data and Theory''. How do data in each linguistic field contribute to the development of theoretical frameworks? How do frameworks constrain the generation or gathering of data? This Special Session aims at presenting views on how these two aspects of linguistic inquiry interact as well as specific examples of how data and theory fit together. We are especially interested in hearing papers on a variety of linguistic subfields on this topic, with the further aim of understanding whether the relationship between data and theory varies across subfields. The Special session will be followed by a general discussion on the topic.  
 
General Session: 
We invite submissions for abstracts for 20-minute presentations in any area related to linguistics, including, but not limited to:   
- Phonetics 
- Phonology 
- Syntax 
- Semantics 
- Sociolinguistics 
- Psycholinguistics 
- Historical Linguistics 
- Anthropological Linguistics 
- Computational Linguistics 
- First Language Acquisition 
- Second Language Acquisition 
- Second Language Writing 
- Speech and Hearing Sciences 
 
Please submit an anonymous abstract of not more than two pages (including examples, references and figures) by accessing the Symposium website at web.ics.purdue.edu/~pla2006. 

If you have any questions, please contact Sunny Park at skparkATpurdue.edu or Jason Overfelt at joverfelATpurdue.edu
