Meeting Description:

Vagueness in Communication (ViC 2009)
http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/~hcschmitz/esslli2009/
July 20-24, 2009 

Call for Papers

Organised as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2009 (http://esslli2009.labri.fr/), 20-31 July, 2009 in
Bordeaux, France

Workshop Organiser:
Nikolaus Bourbax (Manfred Krifka, Rick Nouwen, Robert van Rooij, Uli Sauerland
and Hans-Christian Schmitz)

The workshop is organised as an event of the VAAG project of the ESF Eurocore
LogicCC.

Workshop Purpose and Topics:
Although vagueness has long since been an important topic in philosophy, logic
and linguistics, some recent advances have made the functions of vagueness in
natural language communication an exciting and timely research area. This
renewed interest has a distinct cross-disciplinary character and has spawned
many new research questions. While the classical instruments of dealing with
vagueness -- like multi-valued logics, truth value gaps or gluts, or
supervaluations - have not been significantly extended, new approaches
investigate questions like context-sensitivtiy of vagueness (Kyburg & Moreau
2000), the sharpening of vague predicates in context (Barker 2002), and the
modeling of precision levels with expressions like 'roughly' or 'like' (Kennedy
2007). Within the study of comparatives and degree modification, moreover,
researchers are now exploring cross-linguistic aspects of vagueness (Beck et al
2004). On a more fundamental level, the question why there is vagueness to begin
with, what role vagueness serves in human communication, has been addressed. For
example, it has been argued that vagueness is an epiphenomenon of the
impossibility of complete shared knowledge about the extension of many terms
(e.g. Williamson 1994), hence a consequence of the cognitive limitations of
humans. It has been shown why this does not affect the utility of these terms in
communication (Parikh 1994). Game-theoretic methods have been employed that show
that being vague or imprecise can be beneficial for communication even if the
speaker could truthfully use more precise terms (de Jaegher 2003). Furthermore,
the important role of vagueness became evident in a number of empirical domains
beyond obvious examples such as the language of diplomacy -- for example, in
geographical terms (e.g. Bennett 2008) or in the description of measures of
economy (Qizilbash 2005). There are also initial experimental investigations
into the ways how speakers interpret vague terms (e.g., Bonini e.a. 1999).

The workshop aims to bring together researchers (including advanced PhD
students) whose work contributes to the broad inter-disciplinary line of inquiry
outlined here. In particular, we welcome:
- papers that broaden the empirical base for the study of vagueness, be it
linguistic or otherwise;
- papers offering a synthesis of theories from different disciplines; and
- papers addressing the pragmatics of vagueness. 

Submission Details:
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract. Submissions
should not exceed 2 pages, including references. Submissions should be in PDF
format. Please submit your abstract via the EasyChair system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/submission_new.cgi?c=.103147. For questions
regarding the submission procedure, contact Rick Nouwen (rnouwen [AT] gmail.com)
The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme committee.

Workshop Format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the first
week of ESSLLI. There will be 2-3 slots for paper presentation and discussion
per session. On the first day the workshop organisers will give an introduction
to the topic.

Call Deadline: 19-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

WSCLA 14

The Workshop on the Structure & Constituency of the Languages of Americas will
be held the 3rd through the 5th of April, 2009.
Purdue University (in collaboration with Ball State University) 

Call for Papers

Deadline: January 19, 2009
send abstracts to http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/wscla14-2009

The objective of this workshop has traditionally been to encourage linguists who
are engaged in the formal study of the languages of the Americas to exchange
ideas across theories, language families, generations of scholars, and most
importantly, the academic and non-academic communities involved in language
maintenance and revitalization. 

Invited Speakers:
Peggy Speas, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Keren Rice, University of Toronto

We invite the submission of abstracts:

(1) for a general session in the core areas of formal linguistics (phonetics,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) within any formal theoretical
framework, on any of the languages of the Americas.
  
(2) for two Special Sessions:
- Session on Modality and Evidentiality
The languages of the Americas present morpho-syntactic devices for Modality and
Evidentiality that transcend the range of devices that are found in Western
languages, thus yielding a higher potential for discovering unforeseen
properties of the human ability for Language.

- Session on New Data: Verbal Classifiers
The goal of this session is to generate new data and ideas about a specific
grammatical phenomenon that is typically under-represented in the literature.
The topic this year refers to morphemes, affixed to the verb, that encode
information about an argument's size, shape or position.

There will also be an invited session devoted to 
- Linguistics Beyond Linguistics: Science and Education

Abstracts can be sent for 20-min papers or for a poster session. Please submit:
1 page letter size (a 2nd page for references and examples may be included). 
1" margins throughout	
11pt Time Roman font size (min.) 

Abstracts should be sent to: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/wscla14-2009 
Deadline: January 19, 2009
Contact info: wscla14@purdue.edu

Participants whose abstracts are accepted will be eligible for financial support.
