7th international conference on Terminology and Artificial Intelligence
TIA 2007 - Sophia Antipolis, France, October 8-9, 2007
http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/tia2007/index-en.html

Conference presentation
For more than a decade, the TIA group has studied the large field of
terminological questions, confronting and combining various disciplines:
Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence,
Information Sciences, Knowledge Engineering, etc.
Knowledge is memorised and transmitted in documents. In scientific or
technical fields (medicine, aeronautics, education, etc), terms play an
important role in ensuring the precision of information.
The rise of the internet and globalisation have increased the sharing of
written documents between cultures and thus, between languages, but also
between fields. This phenomenon creates new problems which emerge when
exogeneous knowledge is appropriated by a community gathered around a
topic.
TIA 2007 will be particularly focused on the migration of terms which can
be understood as the passage from a language to another, from a domain to
another, from an application to another, or as an evolution through time.
The problem which underlies this question is the instability of terms and
has been left unconsidered in order to give precedence to the needs for
standardization.
Communications may tackle theoretical questions or consider methodological
aspects. Interdisciplinary studies which stress the possible convergences
and co-operations between various disciplines around terminological
questions are particularly welcome.

Topics of the conference
You are invited to propose an original communication having a theoretical,
methodological or practical range, on one of the following topics (non
exhaustive list):
- Semantic theories and the terminology compared to textual linguistics
and ontologies domains
- Methods to localise terminologies evolution (diachronic aspects,
interlingual transfers=85)
- Localisation of terminological evolutions within cultures or different
communities (scientific, technical) and role of terminological resources
in this localisation
- Confrontation of terminological terminologies / terminological resources
/ ontological resources issued from different languages, communities,
periods
- Automatic or manual constitution of terminologies from mono or
multilingual corpora
- Methods to automatically structure terminologies (identification of
relations between terms, distribution in fields)
- Use of terminologies to constitute and structure ontologies
- Methods and criteria to evaluate and validate terminologies
- Reusability, standardization, comparison and fusion of terminological
resources
- Difficulties to build multilingual terminologies
- Applications exploiting terminological resources (semantic web,
management of documentary flows, information retrieval, document
classification, technological survey, question and answer=85).

The TIA group (http://tia.loria.fr/) organises this conference which
follows conferences TIA'95 (Villetaneuse), TIA'97 (Toulouse), TIA'99
(Nantes), TIA'01 (Nancy), TIA' 03 (Strasbourg) and TIA'05 (Rouen).
Founded
under the aegis of the AFIA in 1994, now AFIA/GdR-I3 group, this group
gathers researchers in Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. The
received papers will be submitted to an international review committee
constituted by members of the TIA group and by experts of the concerned
fields (3 reviews per paper). The papers could be approved as oral
communication or poster.
