Computer Communications Special Issue on
End-to-end Support over Heterogeneous Wired-Wireless Networks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, many networking technologies have emerged and have
been deployed to enable ubiquitous Internet access anywhere, anytime,
using a wide range of devices. In particular, we have witnessed the
rapid proliferation of different types of wireless communication
networks including Cellular, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs),
Bluetooth, WiMax, etc which are widely being used as extensions to
the wired Internet infrastructure. In addition to the convergence of
heterogeneous wired-wireless networks, the issue of mobility of end-users
has also become a central issue of the evolving heterogeneous mobile
Internet. There are still many research challenges that need to be
addressed to enable seamless, transparent, wireless access to Internet
services for mobile end-users. This special issue will provide insights
into some of the latest research network design approaches, techniques, .....

WORKSHOP BACKGROUND AND GOALS
-----------------------------
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication
technology that uses radio-frequency waves to transfer information between
tagged objects and readers without line of sight. This creates tremendous
opportunities for linking various objects from real world. These objects
are numbered, identified, catalogued, and tracked. In recent years,
RFID has gained a significant momentum
and is emerging as an important technology for revolutionizing a wide
range of applications including supply chain management, retail, aircraft .....

in conjunction with 4th European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS'06),
4-6 December 2006, Zurich, Switzerland.

http://events.deri.at/semws06

Workshop Theme

Semantic Web and Web Services have been envisioned as Semantic Web
Services for dynamic discovery, selection, composition, negotiation and
invocation of Web Services. Significant work has already been done in
this decade to apply Semantic Web technologies for Web Services and a
large body of relevant work exists from earlier decades, in fields such
as formal languages, knowledge representation, planning, agent-based
systems and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless many difficult research
challenges remain, and much work is needed to adapt relevant existing
technologies to the context of Web services and the Semantic Web, and to
prepare the more mature models, languages, capabilities and architectures
for widespread deployment.

This workshop under the umbrella of the ECOWS conference as being on .....

Mirage 2007 is an international conference with focus on Computer
Vision/Computer Graphics collaboration techniques involving image
analysis/synthesis approaches. In the domain of Computer Vision, this
analysis by synthesis collaboration may take the form of model-based
approaches for which the analysis, recognition or understanding process
does not rely on the data only but is linked to
the optimization of a parametric model introduced A PRIORI.
In the field of Computer Graphics, this thematic refers to image-based
approaches which found the modeling, animation, lighting or rendering
process on the analysis of real pre-existing data in order to
gain in productivity or in realism ...
