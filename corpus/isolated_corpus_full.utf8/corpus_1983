Meeting Description

A Workshop on Reference to Abstract Objects in Natural Language will be held at
Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, March 28-29, 2008. 

Second Call for Papers

Workshop on Reference to Abstract Objects in Natural Language

Natural language is full of references to abstract objects - what we intuitively
call facts, propositions, questions, and situation types. Though there is a
substantial philosophical literature on the nature of such abstract objects, and
numerous linguistic studies on individual classes of expressions which may refer
to them (infinitives, nominalizations, neuter pronouns, or different types of
embedded clauses, for example), there is still surprisingly little work which
affords a global vision, either for a given language or cross-linguistically, of
the mapping between different types of expressions and a complete ontology of
these objects, or of how referents for abstract objects are constructed and
maintained across discourse. Still less work has been devoted to comparing
and evaluating existing theories of the mapping between natural language
and an ontology of abstract objects. The goal of this workshop is to work
towards such a global vision.

We invite abstracts for 40 minute papers (including 10 minutes for discussion)
which:
- Focus on the semantics of the predicates that expresses properties of or
relations involving "abstract objects": perception verbs, propositional
attitude verbs, verbs of saying, resolutive predicates, factive-emotives,
nominalizations, etc.;
- Seek generalizations concerning the semantics of the various types of
phrases and clauses that appear as subjects/complements to these predicates, and
which investigate their implications for a theory of
natural language ontology;
- Address the question of the division of labor between semantics and
pragmatics in the modeling of notions such as "fact", "proposition",
"question", etc.
- Investigate anaphoric reference to abstract objects and the range of
expressions used for this reference;
- Explore techniques/strategies for collecting better data in this area;
- Report on psycholinguistic or acquisition research on human understanding
of such abstractions and the expressions we use to talk about them.

Invited speakers
Nicholas Asher (CNRS, Toulouse)
Jonathan Ginzburg (King's College, London)
Michael Hegarty (Louisiana State University)
Graham Katz (Georgetown)

Submission guidelines: Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length, including
references, using a 12 pt. font with 2,5 cm margins on all sides.
Abstracts should be in form of a pdf file and should be submitted by e-mail
to abstract.objects@upf.edu.

Deadline for abstract submission: October 31, 2007.
Notification of acceptance: December 1, 2007
Workshop dates: March 28-29, 2008

Organizers: This workshop is part of a research collaboration between the
Institute of Cognitive Science, U. Osnabrueck); CNRS UMR 8163 (Savoirs,
Textes, Langages), U. Lille 3; and the Departament de Traducció i
Filologia, U. Pompeu Fabra.
Scientific committee: Antonio Balvet, Peter Bosch, Lisa Brunetti, Stefan
Evert, Louise McNally, Philip Miller, Rafael Marín, Carla Umbach.

Workshop location: Departament de Traducció i Filologia, Universitat Pompeu
Fabra, Barcelona.

Full Title: Structural Features of Varieties of French in Contact 
Short Title: PCF 

Date: 26-Jun-2008 - 28-Jun-2008
Location: New Orleans, Louisiana, USA 
Contact Person: Tom Klingler
Meeting Email: klingler@tulane.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Subject Language(s): French (fra)

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

The main goal of the conference is to explore the effects on linguistic
structures--and in particular on phonetics and phonology--of contact between
French and other language varieties. We are especially interested in receiving
proposals for papers dealing with the following themes: varieties of French in
North America (and in particular in Louisiana), varieties of French in Africa,
French in contact with creoles, and varieties of French in France. The
conference is being organized as part of the broader collaborative project The
Phonology of Contemporary French (http://www.projet-pfc.net/). 

The 2008 PFC Meeting in New Orleans: Structural Features of Varieties of French
in Contact

The Department of French and Italian and the interdisciplinary Program in
Linguistics at Tulane University are pleased to announce the international
conference Structural Features of Varieties of French in Contact, which will
take place in New Orleans from June 26 through 28, 2008. The conference is being
organized as part of the broader collaborative project The Phonology of
Contemporary French (http://www.projet-pfc.net/). The main goal of the
conference is to explore the effects on linguistic structures - and in
particular on phonetics and phonology - of contact between French and other
language varieties. We are especially interested in receiving proposals for
papers dealing with the following themes: varieties of French in North America
(and in particular in Louisiana), varieties of French in Africa, French in
contact with creoles, and varieties of French in France. Participants will have
20 minutes to present, followed by a 10-minute question period. Please submit a
150-word abstract to Tom Klingler at klingler@tulane.edu no later than March 31,
2008. The languages of the conference are French and English.

Keynote speakers
Barry Jean Ancelet (University of Louisiana, Lafayette)
Barbara Bullock (The Pennsylvania State University)
Bernard Cerquiglini (Louisiana State University)
Albert Valdman (Indiana University)
