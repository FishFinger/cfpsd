2nd CfP: International Workshop on the Semantic
Representation of Spoken Language 2007 (SRSL7)

Salamanca, Spain (12-Nov-2007 - 13-Nov-2007)
http://www.dfki.de/~mpla/SRSL/


The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in 
the semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous
speech. The current state-of-the-art supports solutions from very
different backgrounds, and still remain important and complex issues to
deal with, such as the accurate segmentation of speech in semantic
units. In-depth research on the semantic representation of speech can
provide us with a suitable basis for further analysis of related
linguistic levels, like prosody or pragmatics.

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research
concerning the semantic representation of spoken language. They can be
full (6-8 pages) or short papers (3-4 pages).

Possible topics include:

-Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, etc.)
and concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
-Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
-Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
-Dialogue and discourse structures.
-Topic Detection and tracking.
-Multimodal Representations including speech.
-Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.
-Speech in embedded systems.
-Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic
representations.
-Standardisation work.

Submissions must be written in English and should follow the Springer
format. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
author's names and affiliations.

Submission will be via email and must be sent to
manuel(dot)alcantara(at)dfki(dot)de. Accepted papers will appear in the
proceedings of the workshop. Both full (6-8 pages including references)
and short papers (3-4 pages including references) will have an oral
presentation at the workshop within the framework of the CAEPIA
conference in Salamanca (Spain). The University of Salamanca offers 15
grants/awards to facilitate the attendance of doctoral and young doctors
both to the event.
