Meeting Description:

The 2008 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI-2008)

July 13-15, 2008
Hilton Hotel, Las Vegas, USA

Call for Papers

The increasing volumes and dimensions of information have dramatic impact on effective decision-making. To remedy this situation, Information Reuse and Integration (IRI) seeks to maximize the reuse of information by creating simple, rich, and reusable knowledge representations and consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into legacy systems. IRI plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information; and applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains. This conference explores three major tracks: information reuse, information integration, and reusable systems. Information reuse considers optimizing representation methodologies; information integration studies strategies for creatively applying models in novel domains; and reusable systems focus on ontological opportunities for deploying models and corresponding processes.

The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. The conference feature contributed and invited papers. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, and keynote speeches. A forum will be conducted with the intent of bridging IRI and Systems of Systems and why the future of intelligent computing - including computing applications - will lie at the juxtaposition of these two topical areas. The best papers from IRI 2008 will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering Journal. The conference includes, but is not limited to, the areas listed below:
- Large Scale Data and System Integration
- Component-Based Design and Reuse

Macquarie University 

Call for Papers

We are delighted to call for contributions in the form of papers, workshops and colloquia to ISFC 2008, to be held at Macquarie University (http://www.mq.edu.au/), Sydney, Australia, 21-26 July 2008.
The Congress will be preceded by a Pre-ISFC seasonal (winter / summer) Institute, to be held at UNSW (the University of New South Wales; http://www.unsw.edu.au/), Sydney, Australia, 14-19 July, 2008. 

''Voices around the World'', ISFC35:

Only 2 weeks left to add your voice to our exciting congress!

This year, the 35th ISFC will be hosted at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. Once again, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to those who have already submitted abstracts for session papers, colloquia or workshops.  We're still receiving the incoming abstracts, and so far we have received submissions from more than 26 countries representing regions all over the world. The abstracts represent innovative, cutting-edge research in thematic areas close to the hearts and heads of systemic functional linguists.

Remember, after you have received comments on your abstracts, you will have an opportunity to produce a short paper to be included in an electronic volume of refereed congress proceedings, which can then be developed, after the congress, into hard-copy thematic volumes. But, don't forget ? you can't be published if you are not part of the congress!!

In addition to the publication, attendees at this year's congress will have the opportunity to become foundation members of a number of proposed 'research & resource networks' to be developed through the 35th ISFC.
If you would like to become involved in these innovative networks as well as have your research published in the proceedings, then it is essential you submit your abstract to us by the final deadline, March 31, 2008.
Please make sure not to miss this opportunity to add your voice to our exciting ''Voices around the World'' congress! 

You will find guidelines for abstract structure and submission on the ISFC35 website:

2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
