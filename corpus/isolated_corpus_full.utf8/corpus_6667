Scope and Aims
==============

The Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence is organised
biennially by the Hellenic Artificial Intelligence Society (EETN). It
has already been established as one of the most prominent forums for
Greek and International AI scientists to present original and

SETN 2010 highly encourages international participation and the

of Informatics and Telecommunications at NCSR "Demokritos".

The conference includes a tutorials session on May 5th, which aims to
inform undergraduate and postgraduate students about the current state
of affairs of AI research as conducted by scientists in Greece and
worldwide.

To this purpose, the SETN-2010 tutorials session will strive to offer
conference attendees and local participants a stimulating and
informative selection of tutorials reflecting current theoretical as
well as applied AI topics that have a relevance to any of the
scientific topics of the conference.
