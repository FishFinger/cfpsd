Full Title: Terminology 


Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 10-Jun-2008 

Special Issue of Terminology
Teaching and Learning Terminology: new strategies and methods 

Terminology is part of the programmes of several university degree and
postgraduate courses (Translating and Interpreting, Applied Languages,
Information Science) and specialist training courses focused on different
applications. 
In this special issue, we attempt to present and reflect on experiences
dealing with Terminology training, from the theoretical, practical and
professional perspectives. Specially, terminology practice has changed
drastically over the years and training in terminology must adapt to this
new reality. We believe that now, after a number of years teaching this
subject in different degrees and in diverse ways, it is time to consider
what should be taught about Terminology, how to teach it, how is it
learned, what experiences have been put into practice and how did they
work, and how to connect what is taught in universities and other
institutions with the practise required from professionals of different
areas (translators, information scientists, knowledge engineers), with
respect to their knowledge of Terminology.

Topics of the issue

Contributions from authors are expected to report about their training
experiences dealing with one or more of the following issues of higher
education:

- analysis of the training requirements in terminology depending on the
professional profile and on the subject area
- objectives sought when planning the teaching program, and obtained or
expected results depending on the professional profile, competences that
must be acquired by the students
- teaching/learning methodology of theoretical and practical contents of
Terminology, in terms of the tasks and exercises performed by the students,
lectures versus virtual learning models, or assessment methods
- designing and organising contents and competences of the curriculum
dealing with the different applications of Terminology, Terminology as a
component of the curriculum in the context of a larger training framework
(programmes, special courses, etc.)
- aim of terminology training, the role and the profile of the
terminologist in the current society, other professional environments in
which the command of terminology is required
- latest tendencies in terminology training, educative innovation
experiences, lecturers' classroom experiences, learning experiences in
virtual environments, adding new contents to the curriculum
- Terminology as a subject in different programmes and countries, the
profile of the lecturer responsible for terminology training
- computer tools and resources used in the classroom, ways of using them

Papers must clearly show the links between the didactic aspects and the
objectives and contents of Terminology, its applications or the
professional profile. Papers in which Terminology is just a complement of a
more general didactic methodology will not be accepted, unless they show a
relevant innovation of this general methodology.

Submissions

Papers should be written with Word and comprise between 20-30 pages. More
information on formatting requirements can be found on the John Benjamins
website 

(http://www.benjamins.com). 

English is recommended but submissions in French, German or Spanish will be
considered.  
Please send submissions to Amparo Alcina: (alcina@trad.uji.es). Each issue
of Terminology contains six articles.

Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
