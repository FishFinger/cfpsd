Second Call for Papers

International Workshop on

=93Metadata Mining for Image Understanding=94 (MMIU)
http://www.visapp.org/MMIU.htm

A Satellite event of the
3rd International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications =

(VISAPP),
22 - 25 January, 2008, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal
http://www.visapp.org/index.htm

Chairs
Gabriela Csurka, XEROX Research Centre Europe, France
Katerina Pastra, Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Greece

Scope
The number of digital images being generated, stored, managed and shared =

through the internet is growing at a phenomenal rate. Press and photo =

agencies receive and manage thousands or millions of images per day and =

end-users (e.g. amateur reporters) can easily participate into the =

related professional workflows. In an environment of approximately one =

billion photos, searchable in online databases worldwide, finding the =

most relevant or the most appealing image for a given task (e.g. to =

illustrate a story) has become an extremely difficult process. In these =

huge repositories, many images have additional information coming from =

different sources.

Information related to the image capture such as date, location, camera =

settings or name of photographer is often available from the digital =

camera used to take the photograph. The owner can further add a relevant =

title, filename or/and descriptive caption or any other textual =

reference. If the image is uploaded to a shared photo collection, =

additional comments are frequently added to the image by other users. On =

the other hand, images used in documents, i.e. web pages, frequently =

have captions and surrounding text. All this information can be =

considered image metadata and is of value for organizing, sharing, and =

processing images.

However, it is not always evident how to exploit the information =

contained in such metadata in an intelligent, generic or task-specific =

way. Linking this information with the actual image content is still an =

open challenge. The aim of this workshop is to offer a meeting =

opportunity for researchers, content providers and related user-service =

providers to elaborate on the needs and practices of digital image =

management, to share ideas that will point to new directions on using =

metadata for image understanding and to demonstrate related technology =

representative of the state of the art and beyond.

Research paper topics that may be addressed include, but are not limited to:

=96 image metadata pattern discovery and mining
=96 interaction of image metadata and visual content
=96 image and video metadata enrichment
=96 automatic metadata creation
=96 hybrid collaborative and machine learning techniques for metadata =

creation and/or fusion
=96 cross image-text categorization and retrieval
=96 image auto-captioning and annotation transfer
=96 learning user preferences, aesthetical and emotional measures from =

opinion mining
=96 integration of camera settings with image categorization, retrieval or =

enhancement
=96 application-specific issues of metadata mining:
o integration of visual and geo-location information for improved =

virtual tourism
o stock-photo
o web-based image retrieval

Important Dates
Full Paper Submission: *October 15, 2007*
Authors Notification: November 7, 2007
Final Paper Submission and Registration: November 19, 2007

Submission of Papers
Prospective authors are invited to submit papers in any of the areas =

listed above. All papers must be written in English, and the length =

should not exceed 10 pages for oral presentations and 6 pages for =

posters (including figures and tables).

Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex formats) =

are available at the following web page: =

http://www.grapp.org/paper_templates.htm

Papers (preferably in PDF format) should be submitted electronically via =

the web-based submission system at: =

http://www.grapp.org/paper_submission.htm

Workshop Proceedings
All accepted and registered papers will be published in a workshop =

proceedings book with an ISBN reference, which will be issued by INSTICC =

Press. The proceedings will be available at the time of the workshop. =

There will be also a CD-ROM publication.

Publication
A selection of the best papers will be considered for improvement and =

publication in a special issue of a journal (TBD).

Registration Information
At least one author of an accepted paper must register for the workshop.
