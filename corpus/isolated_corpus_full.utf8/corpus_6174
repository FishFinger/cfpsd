Location: New York, NY, USA 
Contact Person: Brian McElree

Linguistic Field(s): Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2009 

Meeting Description:

The 23rd Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing will be held March
18-20, 2010 at New York University, hosted by the Psychology and Linguistics
Departments. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts are solicited for papers and posters presenting theoretical,
experimental, and/or computational research on any aspect of human sentence
processing.

Information on the Special Session
The CUNY 2010 Special Session focuses on recent advances in neurolinguistic
tools for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying language processing.
Invited speakers will present cutting-edge research that uses a range of
methodologies electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS), and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)- and will emphasize how results
from different methodologies (including those from various behavioral
techniques) can be linked.

Invited Speakers
Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (University of Marburg)
Matt Davis (MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK)
Collin Phillips (University of Maryland, College Park)
Kuniyoshi Sakai (University of Tokyo)
Michael Tanenhaus (University of Rochester)

Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously, and will be considered both for the
general conference sessions and for a special session on advances in
neurolinguistics.

Accepted presentations will form a program made up of three days of spoken
papers presented in plenary session, and three poster sessions (one on each day
of the conference). Time constraints entail that fewer than 20% of submissions
can be given as talks at the podium. Therefore, reviewers will be asked to
identify submissions that seem most likely to generate broad interest due to
originality of ideas or significance to the field.  Space constraints at the
poster session also require that many poster submissions be rejected. 
Therefore, contributors are encouraged to select their best work for submission
and not to submit a large number of abstracts.

Submission Deadlines: Tuesday, December 1, 2009
Abstracts must be submitted electronically through the conference website: 
http://psych.nyu.edu/cuny

This deadline applies to all submissions, paper or poster. Notifications
concerning acceptance/rejection will be made by mid-January, 2010.
