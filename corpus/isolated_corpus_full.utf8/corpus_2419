Date: 23-Oct-2008 - 25-Oct-2008

Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Typology 

Call Deadline: 30-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

The conference is part of an ongoing research project on interrogative and
declarative clauses in Omotic languages. These topics and related issues in
morphological marking of mood and modality will be addressed in the conference.
Although the focus is in Omotic languages, we welcome papers from other
languages too. 

Call for Papers

As part of our project on ''Two modal systems in Omotic: declarative and
interrogative clauses'', funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific
Research (NWO), we organize a conference entitled:
Omotic Utterance Type, Mood and Attitude Markers and Linguistic Typology

Dates: 23-25 October 2008
Venue: Leiden University, The Netherlands 

Utterance type or attitudinal expressions are often indicated through
sentence-final affixes in main clauses in some of the Omotic languages. Other
morphological marking strategies have also been reported, such as using special
inflectional paradigms for questions, commands and various types of assertions
and a subtractive morphological derivational relation between some of these
constructions. Further more, in some Omotic languages different utterance type
markers are used depending on the polarity, tense-aspect as well as on
distinctions between realis, irrealis, obligation, etc.. 
The goal of the conference is to work towards a more complete typology of
utterance marking systems in Omotic languages and stimulate exchange of ideas on
how to account for their semantics and morpho-syntax in a rigorous and
theoretically informed manner. This will enhance comparison of systems among
Omotic languages and those from the genetically and areally related ones e.g.,
from Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic languages as well as with typologically
comparable systems in other languages. To this end, we plan special sessions on
general typological-theoretical discussions which can result in developing
heuristic tools for the documentation of mood and modality systems in
little-known languages.

Abstracts are invited for 40 minutes talk (30 minutes presentation and 10
minutes discussion). Papers on individual languages from Omotic or other
Afroasiatic languages as well typological studies on Modality are welcome. 

Invited Speakers: 
Professor Alexandra Aikhenvald, Research Centre for Linguistic Typology,
University of Melbourne, Australia. (confirmed)
Professor Johan van der Auwera, University of Antwerp, Belgium. (confirmed)
Professor Gerrit Dimmendaal, University of Cologne, Germany. (confirmed)
Professor Ferdinand de Haan, University of Arizona, USA. (confirmed)
Dr. Helen de Hoop, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. (confirmed).
Professor Baye Yimam, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia (confirmed) 

Organizing Committee: 
Azeb Amha, Anne-Christie Hellenthal and Maarten Mous 

Please submit an anonymous abstract by 30 March 2008 as attachment to the
following email addresses: 
a.amha@let.leidenuniv.nl, a.c.hellenthal@let.leidenUniv.nl and
m.mous@let.leidenUniv.nl, indicating your name, affiliation and contact
information only in the body of your email message.

We will send notification of acceptance of the abstract for presentation by 15
April 2008

Date: 25-Apr-2008 - 26-Apr-2008
Location: Chicago, IL, USA 
Contact Person: Alan Yu
Meeting Email: phonlab@gmail.com

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Historical Linguistics; Phonetics;
Phonology 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description

The Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago is pleased to invite
abstracts for submission to a symposium entitled 'Phonologization' to be held at
the University of Chicago, April 25-26, 2008. Explanations for sound change have
focused traditionally on identifying the inception of change, the nature of
phonologization - the transition from intrinsic phonetic variation to extrinsic
phonological encoding - remains largely unexplored. The goal of this workshop is
to facilitate collaboration among phonologists as well as specialists from
neighboring disciplines seeking unified theoretical explanations for the origins
of sound patterns in language, as well as to move toward a new and improved
synthesis of synchronic and diachronic phonology. 

The Phonology Laboratory of the Department of Linguistics at the University of
Chicago is pleased to invite abstracts for submission to a symposium entitled
'Phonologization' to be held at the University of Chicago, April 25-26, 2008.

Note: This symposium will take place concurrently with the 44th annual meeting
of the Chicago Linguistics Society. Papers presented at the Phonologization
Symposium will be published in an edited volume, not as part of the CLS
proceedings series.
