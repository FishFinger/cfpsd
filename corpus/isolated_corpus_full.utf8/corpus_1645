           Fourth Workshop on Constraint Handling Rules
                               CHR 2007

                          September 8, 2007
                           Porto, Portugal

                  http://chr2007.workshops.free.fr

          Co-located with the International Conference on
          Logic Programming (ICLP 2007)
   ------------------------------------------------------------

  Introduction
  ------------

The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language has become a major
declarative specification and implementation language for constraint
reasoning algorithms and applications.  Algorithms are often
specified using inference rules, rewrite rules, sequents, proof rules
or logical axioms that can be directly written in CHR.  Its clean
semantics facilitates program design, analysis and transformation.
See the CHR website (http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/projects/CHR/)
for more information.

Previous Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules were organized in
May 2004 in Ulm (Germany), in October 2005 in Sitges (Spain) and in
July 2006 Venice (Italy).

  Topics of Interest
  ------------------

The workshop calls for full papers and short papers describing
ongoing work, on all aspects of CHR, including topics such as:

    -  Semantics
    -  Logical Algorithms
    -  Constraint Solvers
    -  Expressivity and Complexity
    -  Program Analysis
    -  Programming tools
    -  Implementations and Optimization
    -  Program Transformation and Generation
    -  Language Extensions (Types, Modules)
    -  Retractable Constraints
    -  Programming Pearls
    -  Programming Environments (Debugging)
    -  Applications
    -  Critical Assessment
    -  Comparisons with Related Approaches

  Submission Information
  ----------------------

All papers must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages
in Springer LNCS format. The authors are encouraged, although
not obliged, to submit their papers already in Springer LNCS
format. General information about the Springer LNCS series and
the LNCS authors' instructions are available at the Springer
LNCS/LNAI home page (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html).

Submissions should be sent to chr2007.workshops@free.fr and mention
'CHR 2007 Submission' in the subject. Every submission should
include the names and e-mail addresses of the authors (with the
corresponding author indicated), the paper abstract in ASCII format
and the actual paper in postscript or PDF format. The submission
should also indicate whether it is a full paper or a short paper.

Accepted papers will be published in a technical report.
