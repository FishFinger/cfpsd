CALL FOR PAPERS

COLING 2008 Workshop TextGraphs-3: Graph-based Algorithms for  =

Natural Language Processing
Manchester, UK, August 24, 2008 =

http://lit.csci.unt.edu/~textgraphs/ws08/


This workshop is part of the 22nd International Conference on
Computational Linguistics (COLING 2008)


Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the =

field of graph theory into natural language processing. =

Traditionally, these two areas of study have been perceived as =

distinct, with different algorithms, different applications, =

and different potential end-users. However, as recent research =

work has shown, these two disciplines are in fact intimately =

connected, with a large variety of natural language processing =

applications finding efficient solutions within graph-
theoretical frameworks. =


In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented =

as nodes in a graph and relations between them can be =

represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-
based representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, =

sentences and documents give rise to novel and efficient =

solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of =

speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and parsing to =

information extraction, semantic role assignment, =

summarisation, sentiment analysis and up to the study of the =

evolutionary dynamics of language. =


The TextGraphs workshop addresses a broad spectrum of research =

areas and brings together researchers working on problems =

related to the use of graph-based algorithms for natural =

language processing as well as on the theory of graph-based =

methods. We are interested in looking at graph-based methods =

from the perspective of diverse applications to facilitate a =

discussion about the theory of graph-based methods and about =

the theoretical justification of the empirical results within =

the NLP community. =


Starting with TextGraphs-3 we would like to have one area of =

graph-based NLP research as the primary topic for discussion. =

This year's focus is on large scale lexical acquisition and =

representation. Efficient graph methods can help to alleviate =

the acquisition bottleneck for lexicon construction and =

resource building. They also provide smarter representation =

schemes for the lexicon that facilitate fast search and word =

retrieval. SIGLEX endorsed our workshop proposal for COLING-
08. =


We invite submissions of papers on graph-based methods applied =

to NLP problems. Especially, we encourage submissions =

regarding =


* Large-scale lexical acquisition using graph representations =

* Graph-based representation schemes of the mental lexicon =


Other topics include, but are not limited to: =


* Graph representations for ontology learning =

* Graph labeling and edge labeling for semantic representations =

* Encoding semantic distances in graphs =

* Graph algorithms for word sense disambiguation =

* Graph methods for Information Retrieval, Information =

Extraction, Text Mining and Understanding =

* Random walk graph methods =

* Spectral graph clustering =

* Small world graphs in natural language processing =

* Semi-supervised graph-based methods =

* Statistical network methods and analysis =

* Dynamic graph representations for NLP =
