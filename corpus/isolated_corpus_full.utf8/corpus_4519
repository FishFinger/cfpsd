Full Title: Seventeenth Manchester Phonology Meeting 
Short Title: 17mfm 

Date: 28-May-2009 - 30-May-2009
Location: Manchester, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Patrick Honeybone
Meeting Email: patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/17mfm.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 02-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

The mfm is the UK's annual phonology conference, with an international set of
organisers. It is held in late May every year in Manchester. 

Second Call for Papers

The meeting has become a key conference for phonologists from all corners of the
world, where anyone who declares themselves to be interested in phonology can
submit an abstract on anything phonological in any phonological framework. 

In an informal atmosphere, we discuss a broad range of topics, including the
phonological description of a wide variety of languages, issues in phonological
theory, aspects of phonological acquisition and implications of phonological
change. 

Special session: 'The History of Phonological Theory', featuring invited speakers: 
- John Goldsmith (University of Chicago) 
- Morris Halle (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
- D. Robert Ladd (University of Edinburgh) 
- Tobias Scheer (University of Nice) 
[Professor Halle's paper will either be presented in person, or may be read by
another] 

Abstract Submission 
This is a summary - please consult the website for full details: 
http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/17mfm.html 

- We are running a new system for abstract submission this year, using the
Linguist List's EasyAbstracts system. 
- There is no obligatory conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on anything. 
- Abstracts should be uploaded to the 17mfm's page on the EasyAbstracts site by
2nd March 2009: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/17mfm 
- Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm or one inch
margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal
character spacing. 
- Your abstract should be anonymous. You will be asked to submit a version with
your name and affiliation on it if your abstract is selected for presentation. 
All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by members of the organising
committee and advisory board. 
- You should use one of these formats for your abstract: pdf, Word, or plain
text. If you need to use a phonetic font in your abstract, either embed it in a
pdf file, or use the Doulos SIL font 
- Full papers will last around 25 minutes with around 5 minutes for questions,
and there will be a high-profile poster session lasting one and a half hours.
When you submit your abstract, you will be asked to indicate whether you would
prefer to present your work as an oral paper or a poster paper, or whether you
would be prepared to present it in either form. 
- If you need technical equipment for your talk you will need to let the
organisers know if your abstract is selected for presentation. We will do our
best to provide it, although this cannot be guaranteed. 
- We aim to finalise the programme, and to contact abstract-senders by around
the early April, and we will contact those who have sent abstracts as soon as
the decisions have been made. 

Further important details concerning abstract submission are available on the
conference website - please make sure that you consult these before submitting
an abstract: www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/17mfm.html
