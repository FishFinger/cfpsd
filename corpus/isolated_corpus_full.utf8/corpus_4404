Featuring the latest advances in theoretical and applied research, KEPT top=
ics include recent knowledge processing and discovery challenges. KEPT aims=
 to stimulate the interaction among the scientific communities of knowledge=
 engineering, with the purpose of exhibiting interesting applications of th=
ese areas both in theory and in practice. In 2009,  the event will take pla=
ce in Cluj Napoca, a traditional academic city in Romania, situated on the =
middle of Transylvania. KEPT 2009 will be hosted at Babes-Bolyai University=
 in Cluj Napoca, one of the oldest universities in Romania.

Topics:
