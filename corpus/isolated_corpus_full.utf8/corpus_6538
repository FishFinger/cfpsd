Full Title: Workshop on 3D Visualisation of Natural Language 

Date: 08-Sep-2010 - 10-Sep-2010
Location: Cardiff, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Bob Coyne
Meeting Email: coyne@cs.columbia.edu
Web Site: http://kes2010.kesinternational.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2010 

Meeting Description:

Workshop on 3D Visualisation of Natural Language
8-10 September 2010, Cardiff University, UK
KES2010: 14th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent
Information & Engineering 
Systems  http://kes2010.kesinternational.org

Aims and Scope:
Natural language understanding usually involves transforming language from one
representation into another, for example, from one language into another
language in machine translation, or from language to action in natural language
interfaces where natural language commands are performed by a machine, or from
language to visual representations in natural language visualisation. A language
visualisation system understands natural language by transforming it from a
linguistic form into a visual medium, such as a 3D scene or animation. The vital
issues of natural language visualisation include representation of common sense
knowledge, disambiguation, lexicons and ontology, spatial reasoning, animation
generation, just to name a few. Currently, it is a quite new interdisciplinary
subject emerging from the areas of natural language processing and computer
graphics.

This half day workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers from around
the globe to share their ideas, experience and research outcomes in natural
language processing and 3D visualisation and to nurture interdisciplinary
research on the new subject of language visualisation. 

Call for Papers

Co-Chairs: 
Dr. Minhua Ma, University of Derby, UK
Bob Coyne, Columbia University, USA
Prof. Nikolaos Antonopoulos, University of Derby, UK

Authors are invited to submit papers based upon academically rigorous research
in both theoretical development and applied research. Papers should present
original work that has not been published. Papers with real-world applications
are especially welcome. 

The published papers are expected to present high quality material that
illustrates the broad range of exciting work being carried out across the work
in natural language visualisation. Accepted papers for oral presentation in the
workshop will be included in the main conference proceedings, which will be
published by Springer LNCS/LNAI.

Subject Coverage:
The main topic of the workshop is 3D visualisation of natural language. Topics
of interest include, but are not limited to:
1. 3D visualisation 
- Computer animation
- Physically-based simulation
- Automatic 3D scene and animation generation 
- Embodied Agents, Virtual Humans
2. Natural Language Processing, computational linguistics
- Natural language understanding
- Computational semantics
- Word sense disambiguation
- Knowledge representation, common sense knowledge representation
- Lexical semantics
- Ontology, lexicons

Instructions for Prospective Authors:
All papers must be original, of high quality and of approximately 6-8 pages in
length at the publication stage. Submitted papers should not have been
previously published nor be currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

All papers will be peer-reviewed by the international program committee, and may
be accepted for oral presentation. A guide for authors, templates, and other
relevant information for submitting papers are available on the Springer
Information for LNCS Authors webpage 
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0). Full papers and
other inquiries must be sent directly to the workshop chair Dr. Minhua Eunice Ma 
m.ma@derby.ac.uk in the form of a pdf file attached to an email.

For information on the main conference KES2010 see
http://kes2010.kesinternational.org

Important Dates:
Manuscript due: 1 March 2010
Notification of acceptance: 1 April 2010
Final paper due: 1 May 2010
Registration deadline for presenting authors: 1 May 2010
At least one author of an accepted paper must register for the main conference
KES2010. If the registration fees are not received by 1 May 2010 the paper will
not be published in the Springer LNCS/LNAI conference proceedings.
