RaAM 8 conference: Metaphor and Domains of Discourse =


We are pleased to announce the 8th conference of the Researching and Applyi=
ng Metaphor International Association (RaAM), which will be held at VU Univ=
ersity (Vrije Universiteit), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 30 June throu=
gh 3 July 2010. =


As an association, RaAM strives to advance the study of metaphor, metonymy =
and other aspects of figurative language, with a commitment to the applicat=
ion of metaphor research to 'real world' issues. In light of this, the them=
e of the upcoming international conference will be 'metaphor and domains of=
 discourse'. The theme is intended to highlight the socio-cultural as well =
as the situational diversity of metaphor as manifested in, for example: =

-- government and politics; =

-- religion and ethics; =

-- education; =

-- science and healthcare; =

-- business and organizations; =

-- mass media and journalism; and =

-- literature and the arts. =


The conference will feature plenary lectures by: =

We are soliciting abstracts for 20-minute papers and for poster presentatio=
ns. Abstracts should be no more than 500 words (excluding references). Upda=
tes, including a link to the conference web site and information on abstrac=
t submission, will be posted shortly at http://www.raam.org.uk/Amsterdam_20=
10.html . The deadline for abstracts is 31 December 2009. Notification of a=
cceptance decisions will be sent by 1 March 2010. Early registration will b=
e open between 1 March and 30 April 2010.

The conference will also include a new way of linking basic and applied res=
earch: in addition to regular papers and a poster session, a selection of '=
real world workshops' will be offered. The workshops will involve demonstra=
tions for, and with, conference participants on how metaphor can be used as=
 an intervention or tool to change people's way of thinking and reasoning. =
