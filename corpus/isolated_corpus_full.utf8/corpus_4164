Meeting Description:

We invite you to join us at the Third Pearl River Delta English Studies Graduate
Student Conference (PRD). This annual academic event aims to bring together
junior scholars, graduate students established researchers from universities in
the Pearl River Delta region (including South China, Hong Kong, and Macau) and
beyond to generate ideas, cross disciplinary boundaries, and disseminate research. 

Call for Papers

We welcome junior scholars and graduate students in linguistics (including
descriptive and applied), language teacher education, translation, literature,
and cross-cultural communications. Through the conference, we would like to
consolidate the basis for cooperation in teaching and research among researchers
and post-graduate students in English Studies, which has been established in
previous conferences. The conference this year will consist of 
(A) Keynote Speeches 		
(B) Plenary Presentations with Invited Speakers
(C) Parallel Paper Sessions	     
(D) Symposium (a collection of papers on related topics)
(E) Workshops			     
(F) Poster Sessions 

Themes of Paper proposals
The conference welcomes papers on all aspects of English studies including the
followings:
Linguistics (descriptive and applied)
Language teacher education
Translation
Literature studies
Cross-cultural communications

Submission of Proposals
Please send a 150-200 word abstract for a 30-minute paper (20 minutes
presentation and 10 minute for discussion). Proposals for symposium (4- 6
presentations in an two-hour slot) are welcome while ideas for workshops and
alternative forms of presentation will also be considered. You may submit your
proposals as email attachments (in Microsoft Word 2003 format) to:
hkprd@ied.edu.hk

Abstracts submitted should include the following elements:
Paper title 
Author(s) name 
Author(s) institution affiliation, address and contact email 
Abstract text (max: 150-200 words) 
Times New Roman font size 12 pt. 
A Word 2003 file

Important Dates:
First call for papers: January 8 2009
Second call for papers: February 20 2009
Call for papers deadline: March 20 2009
Notification of acceptance: April 3 2009
Early-bird registration deadline: April 17 2009
Deadline for conference hotel registration: April 30 2009

Meeting Description:

Workshop on Language Change: Grammaticalization and Beyond
24-25 April 2009 at the University of Ulster, Belfast, Northern Ireland 

Second Call for Papers

Invited Speakers:
Professor Ian Roberts (University of Cambridge)
Dr Ioanna Sitaridou (University of Cambridge)
Dr Theodore Markopoulos (University of Uppsala)
Professor Alison Henry (University of Ulster)

Grammaticalization is perhaps the most well researched process of language
change. It is a process that involves the change of a word with lexical meaning
to one with functional meaning, often phonologically reduced to the point of
being an affix. One of the most well-studied properties of grammaticalization is
that of unidirectionality or irreversibility: only content words can become
functional, not vice versa. This property, apart from being puzzling in its own
right, has also affected the way we think of language change in general, like a
process with an endpoint, a specific goal that languages strive to achieve. 

In recent years and more specifically after Lightfoot's seminal 1979 work, and
the 'birth' of generative historical linguistics, more and more phenomena that
are not related to grammaticalization have been investigated from a historical
perspective (word order change, change in complementation patterns among
others). Moreover, there have been some very interesting proposals that try to
define the core properties of language change. Even more recently, language
change has emerged as a serious challenger of one of the fundamental concepts of
the Minimalist Programme, the strong minimalist thesis (SMT, Chomsky 1993)
whereby language is an optimal system at any given time of its history. The
obvious question with that is: if language is perfect at any time, how does
change originate from within the system of the language? Finally, a central
concept in generative linguistics is that of competing grammars that originates
from optionality. Optionality, which is a crucially problematic concept for
Minimalism, is particularly pronounced in multi-dialectal environments, like
Northern Ireland. Competing grammars rely on dialectal variability and can
further induce language change. 
	
This workshop aims at discussing topics of language change beyond
grammaticalization, and papers are invited on any topic relevant to this; we
plan on having two sections with specific focus: one will be on 'Language change
in relation to dialectal syntax.' For this we encourage papers that deal with
dialects from a historical perspective or from the competition of forms in
language change. A further section will be on the role of bilingualism and
second language acquisition on change, where new research on second language use
in the revival of Irish and other minority languages is beginning to contribute
new perspectives on the influence of second language acquisition on language
change. 
We invite abstracts for 30 minute presentations. Each abstract should be a
maximum two A4 pages (including examples and references), font size 12. Send an
anonymous abstract by email to c.sevdali@ulster.ac.uk, with the subject labelled
as: 'LSG workshop' and the details of the author (including name, email,
affiliation and title of abstract) in the body of the email. 

Important Dates:
Deadline for submission of abstracts: 26 January 2009
Notification of acceptance: 2 March 2009
Date of the workshop: 24-25 April 2009

Contact people: Christina Sevdali (University of Ulster) c.sevdali@ulster.ac.uk
