Full Title: Adjectives and Adverbials 

Date: 10-Oct-2009 - 10-Oct-2009
Location: Moscow, Russia 
Contact Person: Igor Yanovich
Meeting Email: yanovich@mit.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 20-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

The special session on adjectives and adverbials of the Moscow Syntax and
Semantics conference (MOSS) will be held on October 10, 2009, at the Institute
of the Russian language of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia.

The aim of the special session on adjectives and adverbials at the MOSS
conference (http://web.mit.edu/yanovich/www/moss/) is to bring together
researchers working on adjectives and adverbials from inside of semantics and
syntax, as well as those doing mostly theoretical-side research and those doing
more empirically-oriented work. Recently, there has been significant progress
made both in syntax and semantics, and both with respect to the theoretical
understanding of how adjectives and adverbials work and the range of empirical
data which must be accounted for, but the area is still heavily understudied,
and many important data are likely to be still missing from the general picture. 

Call for Papers: 

We invite papers both from the semantic and syntactic perspective, and
especially welcome papers which contribute novel data on the behavior of
adjectives and adverbials - for instance, data showing that APs in some
understudied language(s) do not behave as expected given the (semantic and/or
syntactic) analyses proposed for better-studied languages, or data on historical
change or dialectal microvariation in the domain of adjectives and adverbials, etc.

Invited speaker of the special session: 

Rajesh Bhatt (UMass)

Official language of the conference: English

Submission Guidelines:

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract for a 20 minutes'
presentation (plus 10 minutes for discussion). Abstracts should be at most 2
pages in length (including examples and references), submitted in PDF, RTF or
TXT format, 12-point font, with 2.5 cm margins throughout. Anonymous abstracts
should be emailed to moss.conf[at]gmail.com. Please include the author(s')
name(s), affiliation(s), contact information and title of the abstract in the
