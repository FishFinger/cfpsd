After the successful LR4Trans-I (28 May 2002, Las Palmas) and
LR4TRans-II (28 August 2004, Geneva) Workshops, we would now like
to draw your attention to this Third Edition. Please refer to the
workshop-related Internet pages (see below) to know more about the
scope, motivation, history, organising and scientific committees and
latest developments of this initiative.

Here the main points for now:

1) Target audience: we encourage participation from everyone interested in
translation and localisation technologies, from practicing translators to
translator trainers, going through researchers in various
interdisciplinary fields, ranging from computational linguistics,
translation to corpus linguistics, terminology and multilingual technical
documentation. We would be happy to have a more significant representation
of industry and government agencies handling electronic language resources
(LRs) to satisfy their multilingual needs.

2) Important dates (subject to slight changes):
- Deadline for workshop paper submission: 3rd February 2006
- Notification of Acceptance: 15th March 2006
- Paper Final Version for Workshop Proceedings: 3rd April 2006.
- Workshop Date: 28th May 2006.

3) Please download the full CfP text from
www.ifi.unizh.ch/cl/yuste/LR4Trans-III/CfP.pdf

4) Note to potential authors: Please remember that only electronic
submissions uploaded in the remote EasyChair system will be accepted.
