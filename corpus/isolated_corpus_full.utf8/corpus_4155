IV Workshop on Sp_ToBI: Transcription of Intonation of the Spanish language 

Call for Papers

4th Workshop on Spanish within the Tones and Break Indices

The purpose of this workshop, which will take place in conjunction with the
Conference Phonetics and Phonology in Iberia 2009 (PaPI 2009), is to advance in
the development of a common transcription system for Spanish within the Tones
and Break Indices (ToBI) framework. As a result of the first Sp_ToBI workshop
held in October 1999, Beckman, Díaz-Campos, McGory & Morgan (2002) published a
preliminary set of tagging conventions for Spanish ToBI (Sp_ToBI). While the
preliminary Sp_ToBI transcription system proposed by Beckman et al. (2002) was a
very important first step, in recent years several revision articles have been
published (Face 2006, Face & Prieto 2007, Estebas & Prieto 2009). Before a
consensus system is proposed, it is important to achieve a common analysis of
Spanish intonation within the AM model of intonational phonology that takes into
account a wide range of data coming from the dialectal differences across
Spanish varieties.

Each participant or group of participants dealing with a dialectal area will be
allocated 25 minutes. Presentations will briefly analyze whether the
abovementioned Sp_ToBI proposals are able to handle and cover the basic
intonational contrasts found in the dialect (including more sentence types than
the broad focus statements and informational yes-no questions) (approximately
10-15 mins). After this, the presentation will be based on the open discussion
of labeled sound files (break, tones) illustrating some potential specific
problems of analysis that the dialect poses and discussing a new labeling
proposal. These sound files, included in the powerpoint presentations, will be
distributed to all participants prior to the workshop, so that differences in
analysis and labeling can be contrasted.

The invited speakers and commentators of the workshop will be Timothy Face
(University of Minnesota), José Ignacio Hualde (University of Illinois atUrbana-
Champaign), and Martine Grice (Universität zu Köln). 

Researchers interested in participating in the workshop, please write to
pilar.prieto@uab.cat. Abstracts should be sent by March 15, 2009.
