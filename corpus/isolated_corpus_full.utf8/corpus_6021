Full Title: Linguistic Variation Yearbook 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics;Syntax 

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2009 

Second Call for Papers

The editors of the Linguistic Variation Yearbook invite submissions on
topics that fit the aim and scope of the yearbook. 

The main goal of the Linguistic Variation Yearbook is the study of the
scope and nature of linguistic variation within the minimalist program,
which radically redefines the status of various components of UG. While a
limited number of specific mechanisms and constraints apply within the
syntactic component (Narrow Syntax), many others are now only formulable at
the interface levels, the nature of which remains largely unknown.

Within that perspective, LIVY seeks to investigate to what extent the study
of linguistic variation can shed some light on the broader issue of
language particular vs. language universal properties, language design and
conceptual necessity. Establishing the exact content of such notions is of
particular importance within any framework that hopes to give a principled
account of the range of linguistic variation evidenced in natural languages.

The main emphasis of the Yearbook is to relate the patterns of linguistic
variation and the universal patterns found among the world's languages to
the organization of the language faculty proper, taking into account its
relations with other faculties of the human mind/brain within the domain of
Cognitive Science. It offers a forum for empirical and theoretical
developments which further both our understanding of the nature of
linguistic diversity and its preservation. 

The call deadline for volume 10 of the Yearbook is 15 October, 2009.
