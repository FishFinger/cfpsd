                         FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

                 4th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                   and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI'07)

                             28-30 June 2007
                          Brno, Czech Republic

                         http://www.mlmi07.org


The fourth MLMI workshop is coming to Brno in the Czech Republic,=20
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005) and=20
Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the=20
different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine=20
learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and human-computer =

interaction.  The motivation for creating this joint multi-disciplinary=20
workshop arose from the actual needs of several large collaborative=20
projects.

MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual conference of the=20
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007), which will=20
take place in Prague on June 25-27, 2007.


* Important dates

Submission of full papers:  23 February 2007
Submission of extended abstracts:  23 March 2007
Submission of demonstration proposals:  23 March 2007
Acceptance decisions:  17 April 2007
Workshop:  28-30 June 2007


* Workshop topics

MLMI'07 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers),=20
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit=20
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine=20
learning and multimodal interaction:
  - human-human communication modeling
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics =
above


* Satellite events

MLMI'07 will feature special sessions and satellite events such as the=20
Summer school of the European Masters in Speech and Language=20
(http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/emasters/) and the PASCAL Speech Separation=20
Challenge II (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlincol1/SSC2/).  To propose =

other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please contact=20
the organizing committee.


* Guidelines for submission

In common with the previous MLMI workshops, revised versions of selected =

papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science =

series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

Submissions are invited in one of the following formats:
  - full papers for oral or poster presentation (12 pages)
  - extended abstracts for poster presentation only (1-2 pages)
  - demonstration proposals (1-2 pages)

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at=20
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/, following the Springer LNCS format=20
for proceedings and other multiauthor volumes=20
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D5-164-7-72376-0)=
.


* Venue

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital of =

Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the country's=20
judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of almost four=20
hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also the cultural=20
center of the region.

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and=20
Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km).

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental=20
(http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet part=20
of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The local=20
organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology=20
(http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was=20
founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
