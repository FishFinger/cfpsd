Call for Papers

GENERATION CHALLENGES 2010
--------------------------

To be held in conjunction with INLG 2010.

Over the past three years, there has been a lot of activity in
connection with shared tasks in Natural Language Generation (NLG).
Three separate sets of shared tasks with their own data and
organisation team have so far been organised: TUNA (Gatt et al.), GREC
(Belz et al.) and GIVE (Koller et al.).  The Pilot Attribute Selection
for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place in
2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge in 2008; the
first umbrella event encompassing all three sets of shared tasks,
Generation Challenges 2009, has just been completed; and other
challenges are being prepared.  More information about all of these
activities can be found via the links on the Generation Challenges
homepage: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal10

In order to continue to provide a common forum for these activities,
we are organising Generation Challenges 2009, an umbrella event
designed to bring together a variety of shared-task evaluation efforts
that involve the generation of natural language.  Evaluation results
and participating systems will be presented at the Generation
Challenges 2010 Special Session at the 6th International Natural
Language Generation Conference (INLG'10).


1. Shared Tasks:
- - - - - - - - -

There will be two shared tasks at Generation Challenges 2010 which will
be organised independently (for details, please refer to the Call for
Participation for each task):

1. The GIVE-2 Challenge (Koller et al.): Generation of
natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a virtual
environment. This task has started, for more information go to:

http://www.give-challenge.org/research/give-2/

2. Post-processing Referring Expressions (using GREC-NEG and DUC data)
(Belz et al.): Call for Participation in preparation. For more
information go to:

http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal10



2. Track on Proposals for Future Tasks:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared
tasks in the general area of language generation.  Proposed tasks can
be in the area of core NLG, or straddle more than one research area in
which language is generated, e.g. core NLG and MT, or core NLG and
text summarisation.  Submissions should describe possible future tasks
in detail, including information regarding organisers, task
description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application
context, size and state of completion of data to be used, and
evaluation plans.


3. Open Track:
- - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers reporting any language generation
method and results obtained using the training and development data
from any of the shared task tracks.  The task definition should differ
in some way from that in the corresponding shared task track, and
submissions will be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing
criteria.


4. Evaluation Methods Track:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing any evaluation method that
can be used to evaluate systems submitted to any of the shared
tasks. Papers should report results for applying the evaluation method
to one or more systems implementing a solution to one of the shared
tasks (although different data may be used).  Submissions will
be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing criteria.


5. Instructions for Paper Submissions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Submissions in the Task Proposals Track, Open Track and Evaluation
Methods Track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long, and should
follow the ACL'10 guidelines using the style files provided via the
ACL 2010 homepage.  Papers should be sent in PDF format by email to
nlg-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk.  Task Proposals, Open and Evaluation
Track papers should be submitted no later than 11 April 2010.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Generation
Challenges Steering Committee (see below).  As reviewing will not be
blind, there is no need to anonymise papers.

Accepted submissions will be included in the INLG'10 proceedings, but
the page limit for camera-ready versions has not yet been finalised
(the final limit will depend on how many submissions there are).
