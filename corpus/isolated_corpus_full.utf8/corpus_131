*** Backgrounds and Goals

ROMANCE FrameNet (http://ic2.epfl.ch/~pallotta/rfn) is a joint 
initiative to create a special interest group with the goal of building 
a multi-lingual FrameNet resource for romance languages based on 
Fillmore's Frame Semantics (1977, 1982). ROMANCE FrameNet is different 
from Multi-Lingual WordNet since it will link collocational and 
constructional material to word senses (not only sub-categorization 
frames of verbs). Applications to foreign language learning are 
apparent, as well as for computer assisted translation, multi-lingual 
information extraction and cross-lingual question answering.

We consider the major 6 Romance languages, namely French, Spanish, 
Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, but we do not exclude other 
Romance languages whose representatives are equally invited to join the 
ROMANCE FrameNet initiative.

We suggest to adopt a new methodology for the development of ROMANCE 
FrameNet by translating the sentences annotated in the original FrameNet 
project from support corpora (e.g. BNC). This approach is inspired by 
the recent work on MultiSemCor. The translation task will be distributed 
among the participants and supervised by local teams in the 
participating institutions working on the different languages.

ROMANCE FrameNet is directed towards the following goals:

   1. creating a consistent aligned and frame-annotated multi-lingual 
corpus;
   2. highlighting cross-language regularities, and structural intra- 
and extra-typological idiosyncrasies;
   3. creating a semantically indexed translation memory and an inverse 
multi-lingual dictionary;
   4. creating one of the first freely available resource which contains 
cross-languages sub-categorization and collocational mappings;
   5. reusing the work done on automatic role assignment and semantic 
parsing (cf. Senseval-3).


*** Workshop and Kick-off Meeting

We propose to meet during the EUROLAN 2005 Summer School in Cluj-Napoca 
in order to develop an informal agreement on a work plan for 
bootstrapping the ROMANCE FrameNet resource.

As a first shared task for bootstrapping the project, we propose the 
translation and annotation of a common subset of 110 sentences from the 
English FrameNet data in each of the targeted languages. The burden of 
this work will be taken by the participants to the workshop and kick-off 
meeting, noting that there may be multiple translations for the same 
sentence. We consider this redundancy very useful for evaluating 
inter-translator agreement.

The mini-corpus will be the basis of the discussion during the kick-off 
meetings and possibly of the workshop papers. It is available for 
download at: http://ic2.epfl.ch/~pallotta/rfn/data.zip.

FrameNet annotations can be found by browsing the FrameNet data 
(http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/) locally or by using the Sato's 
FrameSQL browser 
(http://sato.fm.senshu-u.ac.jp/fn22/notes/fullMenuFrame.html).
 
The format of the ROMANCE FrameNet workshop and kick-off meeting will be 
of one hour of daily official public presentations and discussions (from 
18.30 to 19.30) during three consecutive days (July, 26, 27 and 28).

Additionally we expect and foster a number of spontaneous informal 
gatherings and working groups involving participants (either within the 
same language or cross-language) during day-long meetings at EUROLAN school.


*** Paper Submission

We invite papers on several aspects of the construction of the ROMANCE 
FrameNet resource. Topic of interest include but are not limited to:

    * Creation of aligned multi-lingual corpus for ROMANCE FrameNet
    * Transfer of Frames between English and Romance Languages
    * Transfer and Adaptation of Frame annotations
    * Cross-language similarities and differences in lexical choice for 
translating the lexical units
    * Cross-language similarities and differences in sub-categorization 
and selectional restrictions
    * Transfer of collocations and idiomatic expressions
    * Automatic methods for alignment of multilingual resources in 
perspective of Frame annotation
    * Applications of multilingual FrameNet
    * Evaluation (inter-translators agreement, annotation transfer, etc.)

Extended versions of a selection of the best papers will be published in 
a special issue "Romanian Journal of Information Science and 
Technology", published by the Romanian Academy Publishing House (ISSN: 
1453-8245). The issue will be printed as post-conference proceedings.


*** IMPORTANT DATES

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 30th June 2005

Notification of Acceptance: 10th July 2005
 
Camera-ready Papers: 15th July 2005

Workshop: 26-28 July 2005


*** Paper Requirements

Authors are invited to submit a 6-10 pages paper in electronic form (pdf 
only) by 30th of June 2005.  Like in the case of other EUROLAN workshops 
over the past years, the review process is not blind. Authors of 
accepted papers should submit the final version in electronic format not 
later than 15th of July. The final version must be also in pdf format.

For the papers selected for publication in the ROJIST journal, we 
require a Latex file (all macros used should be included; both Emtex and 
Latex2e are allowed; the standard "article" style is strongly 
recommended). All illustrations must be of professional quality and 
should be sent in separate files in bmp format. The Abstract, 
Introduction and Conclusion chapters are requested. References should be 
listed in alphabetical order.

A sample paper is available here: 
http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/Balkanet/journal/7_Overview.pdf

No galley proofs are sent to authors, the paper is printed in the final 
form received from the authors after the completion of the refereeing 
process. For each published paper 25 reprints are free of charge.

We suggest to comply with the ROJIST guidelines from the beginning in 
the submission of the workshop paper.
All the papers should be sent both to Vincenzo Pallotta and Dan Tufis.


*** Registration

People attending the ROMANCE FrameNet workshop are warmly invited to 
participate to the EUROLAN 2005 Summer School by registering here: 
http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/EUROLAN2005/index.php?r=Registr (Note that 
authors of the papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will 
benefit of early registration fee regardless of the date they register).
 
Participation to the workshop is open to all EUROLAN 2005 attendants and 
is included in the school's participation fee.  Copies of workshop 
proceedings will be included in the EUROLAN school's CD-ROM.

In alternative, it is possible to register only for the workshop with a 
fee of 50 euro to be payed on the workshop site.
