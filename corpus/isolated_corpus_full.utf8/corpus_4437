CALL FOR PAPERS
1st International Workshop on Stream Reasoning (SR2009)
http://streamreasoning.org/events/SR2009
May 31st, 2009
Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Collocated with the 6th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2009)


OBJECTIVES
Data streams occur in a variety of modern applications, such as network
monitoring, traffic engineering, sensor networks, RFID tags applications,
telecom call records, financial applications, Web logs, click-streams. They
have been studied since 2000 and today Specialized Stream Database
Management Systems exist. While such systems proved to be an optimal
solution for on the fly analysis of data streams, such systems suffers from
several limitation. They cannot handle heterogeneous data streams
originating from a variety of already deployed sensors. They cannot combine
data streams with slowly evolving knowledge at query time. They cannot
perform reasoning tasks.
At the same time, while reasoners are year after year scaling up in the
classical, time invariant domain of ontological knowledge; reasoning upon
rapidly changing information has been neglected or forgotten. Thus, we are
assisting to the rising of a new trend, hereby named "Stream Reasoning" as
an unexplored, yet high impact, research area; a new multi-disciplinary
approach which will provide the abstractions, foundations, methods, and
tools required to give answer to questions concerning reasoning over
streaming data, such as: "is a traffic jam going to happen in this highway?
And is then convenient to reallocate travelers based upon the forecast?" or
"By looking at the clickstream coming from a given IP, can we notice the
shifts of interest of the person behind the computer?" or "Are trends in
medical records indicative of any new disease spreading in given parts of
the world?" 
We believe this is the right time to organize a workshop around Stream
Reasoning. Starting from lesson learned in the database community, new
foundational theories can be developed, rooted into formal disciplines such
as logics and optimization theory. From these foundations, new paradigms for
knowledge representation languages design and reasoner construction could be
derived, and the consequent frameworks for stream reasoning oriented
software architectures and their instrumentation could be deployed. 
The workshop will welcome high-quality position and research papers about
the identification of actual trends in how to combine Data Stream and
Reasoning. Technologies as well as novel ideas, experiments, and application
visions originating from multiple disciplines and viewpoints will be
welcome. Topics of interest include:

TOPICS OF INTEREST (including but not limited to):
* Relation between data streams and reasoning techniques.
* Theory for stream reasoning.
* Notion of soundness and completeness for stream reasoning.
* Knowledge representation languages for streams.
* Computational paradigms for streams. 
* Query language for stream reasoning.
* Integration of data streams with reasoning systems.
* Stream reasoning engineering.
* Scalability issues in stream reasoning.
* Implementation and evaluation of stream reasoners.
* Applications of stream reasoning.


SUBMISSIONS
We invite two kinds of submissions:
* Research papers. These should not exceed 15 pages in length.
* Position papers. Novel ideas, experiments, and application visions from
multiple disciplines and viewpoints are a key incredient of the workshop. We
therefore strongly encourage the submission of position papers. Position
papers  should not exceed 5 pages in length.

Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science guidelines for proceedings available at
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0. Papers should
be submitted in PDF format. All submissions will be done electronically via
the SR2009 web submission system
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2009).

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop.
Information about registration will appear soon on the ESWC 2009 Web page.

PROCEEDINGS
We expect the workshop proceedings to be published as CEUR Workshop
Proceedings (see http://ceur-ws.org).

IMPORTANT DATES
* Paper submission: March 8, 2009
* Notification of acceptance or rejection: April 4, 2009
* Camera ready version due: April 18, 2009

WORKSHOP CHAIRS
Stefano Ceri (Politecnico di Milano)
Emanuele Della Valle (Politecnico di Milano)
Dieter Fensel (STI-Innsbruck)
Frank van Harmelen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
Rudi Studer (University of Karlsruhe)
