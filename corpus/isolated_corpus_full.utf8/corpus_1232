Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 18-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of the benefit of
different empirical approaches to the study of morphological case, the insights
that such studies provide, and how they inform theoretical models. The workshop
is part of the LSA Summer Institute, Stanford, CA. 

Last Call for Papers - Abstracts are due 18 March 2007.

In recent years, new and varied approaches to the empirical study of
morphological case have significantly increased our understanding of this
empirical phenomenon. These approaches have informed more refined theoretical
models which necessarily address interface questions, especially the interface
of morphological case with semantics. Such studies may rely on corpora,
experimental evidence, and the investigation of (synchronic and diachronic)
variation and how it bears on synchronic analyses.
 
The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of the benefit of
different empirical approaches to the study of case, the insights that such
studies provide, and how they inform theoretical models. Possible research
questions may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
 
- expanding our understanding of case phenomena through novel empirical methods
e.g. corpus studies revealing the productivity of 'quirky' or non-canonical case
arrays. 
- investigating how morphological case interfaces with other aspects of the
grammar e.g. semantic factors involved in case assignment. 
- hypothesizing how this interface should be modelled theoretically e.g. the
role of semantics in case licensing. 
 
Invited presentations will be given by:
Andrew Spencer (Essex)
Miriam Butt (Konstanz)
Joan Maling (Brandeis) and Jongsup Jun (Hankuk)
 
Abstract Guidelines: 
We are soliciting abstracts for 25-minute talks relevant to any of the topics
mentioned above. Abstracts should be in 11pt font, or larger, consisting of one
text page with a second page (only) for data, examples, charts, and references.
Abstracts should be submitted electronically in Word (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat
(.pdf) format to: 
case07@gmail.com. The author(s) of the abstract should not be identified in the
abstract itself; the body of the submission message should include the title of
the abstract, the names(s) of the author(s), the(ir) affiliation, and e-mail
address(es). 

Deadline for submission: March 18th, 2007. The conference program will be
announced in early April. 
 
Outlines: 
As there will be discussion of the papers, we will ask that you provide us with
an outline of your paper in advance of the workshop, no later than July 7th.
 
Important dates:
March 18 Abstracts due (send to: case07@gmail.com)
April 1	Notification of acceptance
July 7 Outline of papers due (send to: case07@gmail.com)
July 25	Workshop
 
More information about the workshop, including the final program, will be posted
on the workshop's website in due course: http://www.unr.edu/homepage/donohue/case
 
We plan to collect as many papers from the conference as possible for
publication with a major publisher on the theme of empirical approaches to
morphological case. 

For any questions about the workshop, please email your queries to either of the
organizers:
Cathryn Donohue (donohue@unr.edu) or Jóhanna Barðdal (johanna.barddal@uib.no.).

Meeting Description

The workshop 'Linguistic Studies of Ontology: From Lexical Semantics to Formal
Ontologies and Back' is part of the 18th International Congress of Linguists
(CIL 18).

Recent developments in the study of ontology have important implications for
cognitive science, knowledge engineering, and theoretical linguistics. In
particular, research on lexical ontology deals with how concepts are lexicalized
and organized across languages and cultures. This workshop aims to explore this
new departure in linguistic studies by building upon the three important
premises assumed in Fellbaum (1998), Schalley and Zaefferer (2007), and Huang et
al. (2007): First, that lexicalized concepts have a special status in every
language (as opposed to concepts that require complex coding), second that
lexically coded concepts can be shared by different languages, and third that
lexicalization universals are relevant for the construction of cross-lingually
portable formal ontologies. 

Following the references cited above, topics of this workshop include
foundational issues pertaining to the relation between formal ontology and
linguistic ontologies, as well as descriptive issues pertaining to the interface
between conceptual ontologies and lexica. In particular, we would like to focus
on the following issues during this workshop:

- Cross-lingual portability of upper-ontologies
- Ontology-based approaches to comparative linguistics
- Ontology enrichment: from concept formation via complex coding to lexicalisation
- Possible relevance of formal ontological principles (e.g. Roles cannot subsume
Types) to psychological/linguistic reality.
