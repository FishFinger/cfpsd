Society Meeting).

understanding of the mind through all available methodologies, notably those of
aesthetics, anthropology, artificial intelligence, computer science, education,
linguistics, learning sciences, logic, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology,
or any other disciplines insofar as it is deemed to be of interest to those who
pursue the study of the structure of the mind, through any other newly
developing methodologies that are most appropriate to promote cognitive science.

the rare academic olympics is highly recommended for intellectuals of high
caliber.  

ICCS6 is hosted by The Korean Society for Cognitive Science (KSCS) in

Full Title: CTIS Postgraduate Conference on Translation

Location: Manchester, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Wai Ling Looi

Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The First International CTIS Postgraduate Conference 2008
The Centre for Translation and Intercultural Studies University of Manchester
Translation Frames: Gateways and Gatekeeping 

Call for Papers

Keynote speakers: Dr Moira Inghilleri (University College London) and 
Professor Michael Cronin (Dublin City University)
 
30 June - 1 July 2008, Hulme Hall, University of Manchester	

However translation is defined or understood, whether in Eurocentric and modern
Arabic ideas of 'transferring across', or in terms such as the Hindi anuvad
(speaking after, following) and rupantar (change in form), the Igbo tapia and
kowa (to break up and tell or narrate differently) or the Chinese fanyi (turning
over and interpreting/exchanging), the notion of some kind of transformative act
seems to be unavoidable. One way of conceptualising these transformative acts is
to employ the notion of framing, which has been defined as 'strategic moves that
are consciously initiated in order to present... a particular position within a
certain perspective.'  Yet, framing is a broad concept used in many disciplines,
and might also be thought of in other ways.
The aim of this conference is to investigate the idea of transformative frames
and practices by exploring what translation as gatekeeping (a term taken from
media studies) prevents, restrains, and constrains, and alternatively (or
simultaneously), what translation as a gateway, allows, permits, and conveys. It
also aims to consider the practical, social, and geo-political implications of
these 'gates'. Papers may address, but are not restricted to, the following topics: 
- Translation and interpretation as re-narration or re-presentation
- Translation and interpretation and the negotiation of power/resistance
- Translation, migration, and imagined communities 
- Translation and multimodal analysis 
- Translation, globalisation, and technology
- Translators and interpreters as agents
- News and media translation, and the roles of translators, interpreters, and fixers
- Translating and interpreting conflict and situations of violence
- Translating social policy and social-political texts

We welcome contributions from doctoral candidates, MA students, and established
researchers working in translation, interpreting and audio visual translation.
We are particularly interested in work that draws on innovative theoretical
approaches to translation and/or investigates distinctive case studies that can
enrich and extend translation theory. We are keen to create a lively,
discursive, and progressive forum with sessions and keynote speakers
particularly addressed to postgraduate students and questions of research.
Speakers will have the opportunity to submit their papers for selection and
publication in a special conference edition of the CTIS Occasional Papers.

Please send 400 word abstracts for individual 20 minute paper presentations and
a brief (100-150 words) paragraph of your biographical information by March 31
2008 to the conference organising committee at
ctis_postgrad_conference@yahoo.co.uk. Successful proposals will be notified of
their acceptance by April 30 2008.
