Call Deadline: 10-Apr-2008 

Call for Proposals/Abstracts

Special issue of IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication
to focus on
Examining the Information Economy: Perspectives for Professional
Communication Practices

Guest Editors:
Kirk St.Amant
Texas Tech University

and

Jan M. Ulijn

Deadline for Proposals/Abstracts: April 10, 2008

Overview 

The information economy is based on the collection and the exchange of data
and ideas.  We all either contribute to or use materials from the
information economy in most aspects of our everyday lives.  Thus, the
information economy exists as an environment in which we are all
contributors and consumers. Within this system, effective communication is
essential to success and means individuals can contribute ideas and
information effectively and can make efficient use of the goods and
services.  In this way, each individual can play the dual role of content
user (audience) and content creator (professional communicator).  This
ability to create new content also allows individuals to become online
innovators and cyberspace entrepreneurs on a previously unprecedented level.  
 
This special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication
(IEEE-TPC) seeks to 'examine' this economic model by providing research
articles, commentaries, and tutorials that explore the connections between
communication practices and the products, practices, and services that
constitute the information economy.  The objective of the special issue is
to help individuals involved in professional communication practices better
understand and participate in the information economy as both contributors
and consumers.

Possible Topic Areas 

Possible topic areas for this special issue include but are not limited to
the following:
-	Establishing and assessing the value of knowledge work and knowledge products
