is to further scientific research within the broad field of multimodal in=
teraction,=20
methods and systems. This joint conference will focus on major trends and=
=20
challenges in this area, and work to identify a roadmap for future resear=
ch and=20
commercial success. ICMI-MLMI 2009 will feature a single-track main=20
conference with keynote speakers, panel discussions, technical paper=20
presentations, poster sessions, and demonstrations of state of the art=20=

multimodal systems and concepts. It will be followed by workshops.

Venue:
