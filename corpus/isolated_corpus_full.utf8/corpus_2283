Full Title: Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages 


Linguistic Field(s):  Sociolinguistics;Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 17-Dec-2007 

Extended deadline - Journal of NCOLCTL

The Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages (NCOLCTL) is soliciting articles for publication. As the official journal of the Council, the journal serves the professional interests of teachers, researchers, and administrators of less commonly taught languages in all settings and all levels of instruction. The Journal is refereed and published once a year.

Our general editorial focus is on policy, education, programs, advocacy, and research in the field of less commonly taught languages (all foreign languages except English, French, German, and Spanish). The envisaged segmentation of the Journal is as follows:

        a. Methodology and Technology
        b. Academia
        c. Beyond Academia
        d. Social Embeddedness

The first section shall include papers focusing on broader theoretical and technological issues in all fields of less commonly taught languages. The second section will encompass reports about research and teaching in academia, at both K-12 and collegiate levels. The third section shall comprise papers addressing research and teaching in government and industry. Finally, the fourth section will address the issues of a broader social environment, ranging from heritage communities to advancing LCTLs in federal initiatives and legislation.

In preparing the manuscript, please use the latest edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), see http://www.apa.org/journals/authors/guide.pdf. Manuscripts should be a maximum of 25 pages (excluding references, charts, notes, etc.) and preferably submitted electronically via email attachment. Double-space the manuscript throughout, including notes, references, and tables, using 12-point font with a 1.5 inch left margin. The manuscript should be accompanied by a 150 word (or less) abstract and a cover sheet containing the manuscript title, name, address, office and home telephone numbers, fax number, email address, and full names and institutions of each author. Because the manuscript will be blind reviewed, identifying information should be on the title page only, and not appear in the manuscript.

The submission deadline is December 17, 2007.
