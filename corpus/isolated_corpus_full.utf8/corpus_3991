Submissions:

Full Papers: Submissions must describe substantial, original,
completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation and analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged
on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance,
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. Each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members.

Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus one
extra page for references, and will be presented orally or as a poster
presentation as determined by the program committee.  The decisions as
to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster
presentations will be based on the nature rather than on the quality
of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between
full papers presented orally and those presented as poster
presentations.

The deadline for full papers is February 22, 2009 (GMT+8). Submission
is electronic using paper submission software at:
https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/papers

Short papers: ACL-IJCNLP 2009 solicits short papers as well. Short
paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. The
short paper deadline is just about three months before the conference
to accommodate the following types of papers:

* A small, focused contribution
* Work in progress
* A negative result
* An opinion piece
* An interesting application nugget

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions,
and will be given four pages in the proceedings. While short papers
will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, there will
be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented
orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper
submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.
The deadline for short papers is April 26, 2009 (GMT + 8).  Submission
is electronic using paper submission software at:
https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/shortpapers

Format:

Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of
content plus one extra page for references.  Short paper submissions
should also follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009
proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages, including
references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference, which
are available on the conference website under Information for Authors.
Submissions must conform to the official ACL-IJCNLP 2009 style
guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be
electronic in PDF.

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review.

Multiple-submission policy:

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information at submission time. If
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 accepts a paper, authors must notify the program
chairs by April 19, 2009 (full papers) or June 7, 2009 (short papers),
indicating which meeting they choose for presentation of their work.
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 cannot accept for publication or presentation work
that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

Mentoring Service:

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from
regions of the world where English is less emphasized as a language of
scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to
read the scientific literature in English, have little or no
experience in writing papers in English for conferences such as the
ACL meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of
potential mentors will be identified by Mentoring Service Chairs Ng,
Hwee Tou (NUS, Singapore) and Reeder, Florence (Mitre, USA), who will
organize this service for ACL-IJCNLP 2009. If you would like to take
advantage of the service, please upload your paper in PDF format by
January 14, 2009 for long papers and March 18 2009 for short papers
using the paper submission software for mentoring service which will
be available at conference website.

An appropriate mentor will be assigned to your paper and the mentor
will get back to you by February 8 for long papers or April 12 for
short papers, at least 2 weeks before the deadline for the submission
to the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 program committee.

Please note that this service is for the benefit of the authors as
described above. It is not a general mentoring service for authors to
improve the technical content of their papers.

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send
a message to Ng, Hwee Tou (nght[at]comp.nus.edu.sg) or Reeder,
Florence (floreederacl[at]yahoo.com).
