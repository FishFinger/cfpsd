Revisiting the work of Renward Brandstetter (1860-1942), Swiss linguist and
Austronesianist

Place and Dates: Lucerne, 28-29 June 2010 (University of Lucerne)

Organizers
The conference is organized jointly by the Institute of Linguistics and the
Institute of Social Anthropology of the University of Berne.

Conference Theme
At the occasion of his 150th anniversary, the conference will revisit the w=
ork
of Renward Brandstetter (1860-1942), eminent Swiss linguist and first true
systematizer of Austronesian languages.=20

Trained in 19th German philological tradition, Brandstetter taught language=
s at
the Lycee in Lucerne and worked for a lifetime on philological, historical,
ethnographic and psychological aspects of language. Brandstetter started
studying Malay and other Austronesian languages after making the acquaintan=
ce of
the Dutch Malaiologist Niemann in 1886. He corresponded and exchanged
publications across an extensive network of fellow scientists. Using the me=
thods
of comparative philology, Brandstetter published a number of seminal articl=
es on
'common Indonesian' (translated into English by Otto Blagden and published =
by
the Royal Asiatic Society in 1916). The four articles of this volume are on=
ly a
fraction of a large body of research - some 1500 pages - published by
Brandstetter between 1886 and 1940. Becoming slightly bitter over the littl=
e
tribute he had earned in Switzerland for his work, Brandstetter devoted mos=
t of
his post-1920 research to a project of comparative Austronesian etymology w=
hich
was more tangential to the development of linguistics of the period, and is=
 less
well known. But this project too is evidence of his mastery of these langua=
ges,
and his motivation to show the range and depth of the conceptual world they
embody. We think that it is worth re-reading Brandstetter, tracing the gene=
alogy
of his innovative but also idiosyncratic work which is spanning the discipl=
ines of
philology, literature, linguistics, history and ethnography.

More information on the conference will be posted on the website of the
Institute of Social Anthropology, University of Berne:

bert
Blust's (1986) with his study on Austronesian root theory.

We invite research papers
- on Brandstetter's biography and the social and political contexts which s=
haped

language, and its relevance for science, the polity and society

Brandstetter and dialectology
We welcome contributions=20

bove
should be submitted until October 31st, 2009 to:=20
brandstetter-tagung@bluewin.ch.=20
