''Towards Genre-Enabled Search Engines: The Impact of NLP''
Workshop held in conjunction with RANLP 2007

Workshop Location: Borovets, Bulgaria
Workshop Date: 30 September 2007

Organizers: Marina Santini and Georg Rehm
  
Workshop Description 
Broadly speaking, genres are textual categories that streamline communication by
relying on acknowledged conventions and raising predictable expectations. For
instance, the conventions underlying the Blog genre are represented by a
sequence of daily entries that contain narratives, opinions, as well as the
feelings of the blogger, an individual who wishes to participate in a discussion
on a certain subject. These entries are public and other bloggers can directly
comment on them by sending their own postings. These conventions are different
from those underlying the Editorial genre, where a single person presents an
argumentative statement of views that are considered to be representative of a
newspaper as a whole. In brief, genres convey the context of communication. This
context is essential when determining the relevance of the information contained
in a text.

The concept of genre has great potential for Information Retrieval (IR). One
application is its integration in a search-engine architecture, enabling the
user to combine topic-based search with genre-based search. 

The distinction between topical and non-topical textual dimensions is crucial
when it comes to features. Traditionally, topics and domains rely on features
based on content words (e.g. in the bag-of-words approach), while genre classes
appear to be more easily identified through the use of grammatical features
(like function words, POS tags, and syntactic features). As Natural Language
Processing (NLP) provides methods to retrieve grammatical features, an
investigation of the influence of NLP on automatic genre identification appears
of primary importance. For this reason, we wish to investigate to what extent
NLP can help identify genre in an IR scenario. 

The main aims of the workshop are as follows: 

- To identify the key features that help classify documents by genre, and their
efficiency and effectiveness within an IR framework. 
- To explore how genres can improve search engines, and in particular how it can
be integrated with topic-based retrieval. 
- To bring together researchers working on genre in different communities - such
as Computational Linguistics, NLP, Information Retrieval and Extraction, Text
and Web Mining, or Summarization - in order to investigate the extent to which
NLP can assist or enable automatic genre identification. 

Topics 
The topics of interests include but are not limited to: 

- Computational modelling of genres for web applications; 
- Implementation of genre-based applications for retrieval; 
- The impact of lexis, morphology and syntax on automatic genre identification; 
- Genre-revealing features and their automatic extraction; 
- Genre-driven NLP tools, such as genre-driven taggers, parsers, or discourse
annotation; 
- Genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and no-genre documents; 
- Test collections and evaluation metrics for genre-enabled applications; 
- Clustering and visualization of results based on genre. 

Categories of Papers 
Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: regular paper and poster.
Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time. Regular
papers are full-length papers and must not exceed 8 pages. Posters are submitted
as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). If accepted, a poster is presented in the
workshop poster session. Both regular papers and poster papers are included in
the workshop proceedings. 

Submission Instructions 
Format. Authors are invited to submit papers and posters on original and
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers and posters should
be submitted as PDF files, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 stylefiles,
without author name(s) and affiliation(s). Papers and posters should not exceed
the length indicated above. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are available at:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm 

Please, send papers and posters to both MarinaSantini.MS@gmail.com and
georg.rehm@uni-tuebingen.de 

Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by three members of the
Program Committee. Reviewing will be blind. Reviewers will be asked to provide
detailed comments, and to score submissions on the following factors: 

- Relevance to the workshop 
- Significance and originality 
- Technical/methodological accuracy 
- References to related work 
- Presentation (clarity, organisation, English) 

Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers (regular papers and posters) will be
published in the workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at least one
of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected
to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration fees. 

Dual submissions to the main RANLP 2007 conference and this workshop are
allowed; if you submit to the main session, please DO indicate this when you
submit to the workshop. If your paper or poster is accepted for the main
session, you should withdraw it from the workshop upon notification by the main
session. 

Registration 
Information on registration and registration fees are provided at the conference
website (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/).

- multi-modal speech corpora 
- speech corpus annotation tools 
- spoken language processing 
- the internet's effects on linguistic diversity 
- modifying computers to meet minority language requirements 

Requirements
Papers should describe original work. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference,
and interest to the attendees. A paper accepted for presentation at the SNLP2007
cannot be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly
available published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must papers
that contain significant overlap with previously published work. 

Submission Information
Submissions should follow a two-column format and should not exceed six (6)
pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of SNLP2007 Style
Files tailored for SNLP2007. The files and a description of the format are
available in the submission site.

Submission Site: http://naist.cpe.ku.ac.th/snlp2007

Note that full paper submissions are restricted to 6 pages.

Note also that as reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Kim, 1991) ...'', should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Kim, 1991)
...''. Papers that do not conform to the requirements above are subject to be
rejected without review. 

Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: July 31st, 2007
Notification of acceptance: September 15th, 2007
