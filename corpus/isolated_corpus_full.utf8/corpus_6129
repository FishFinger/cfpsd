Mining User-Generated Content for Security - MINUCS 2009

9 December 2009, Venice, Italy

web: http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs

email: minucs [ad] cs [dot] helsinki [dot] fi

This event is co-located with the First International Conference on User
Centric Media - UCMedia 2009 (http://www.usercentricmedia.org) in Venice,
9-11 December 2009

---------------
 AIM AND SCOPE
---------------

The vast and growing amount of user-generated textual content, including
online news streams, blogs, electronic encyclopedias (e.g., the Wikipedia),
and other openly accessible and dynamically changing data readily available
on the Web has led to the emergence of new approaches to extracting
valuable, structured, and previously unknown information from such data. The
aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and
industry who develop technologies for mining open-source user-generated
textual data on the Web, as well as end-users interested in exploiting such
technologies for knowledge discovery. The emphasis is placed on large-scale
text mining systems and application-oriented approaches to processing
on-line textual content in the context of security-related applications.
Examples of such applications include:

 * global medical and epidemic surveillance,
 * conflict early warning,
 * early detection of man-made or environmental hazards,
 * risk assessment,
 * border surveillance,
 * cross-border crime detection,
 * terrorism counterintelligence,
 * other applications relevant for security, law enforcement, and public
health institutions

Due to a multitude of challenges of diverse and complex nature that are
related to automating the process of mining user-generated content on the
Web, we believe that this workshop will serve as a forum to bring together
researchers from different areas, including data mining, language
technology, computational linguistics, information sciences, information
retrieval and Web mining, for sharing ideas and discussion. In particular,
we believe that there is an important gap to be filled, since the
aforementioned research communities have had limited interaction previously
in the context of the topic of the Workshop. The second major goal is to
engage governmental and inter-state user communities, and to bring them
together with scientists and funding agencies.

--------------------
 TOPICS OF INTEREST
--------------------

 * Mining from news streams, blogs, document repositories, and other openly
accessible and dynamically changing data, including Web 2.0 content, for the
purpose of identifying threats to security or public health,

 * Emphasis on multilingual approaches, and work on languages other than
English,

 * Applications, such as information extraction, classification,
summarization, sentiment detection, event detection, event forecasting,
trend detection, information fusion, and more,

 * Contributions in the form of applications (working systems and
prototypes) as well as theoretical results are welcome,

 * Application domains include crisis-related event reporting, political and
environmental analysis, and medical intelligence, under the general umbrella
of the security intelligence domain,

 * Methods including machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid approaches.

NB: Please note, this Workshop welcomes all work on computational approaches
to the analysis of textual data for gathering information from openly
accessible sources only. Submissions that focus on legal questions stemming
from snooping, spying, privacy infringement or violation, etc., will not be
considered relevant to the Theme of the Workshop, and the Committee will not
be able to review them.

------------
 SUBMISSION
------------

We invite papers addressing primarily the language technology, natural
language processing, data mining and information retrieval communities, as
well as the relevant end-user groups.
Submissions are invited in two categories:

 * regular: research papers presenting novel approaches and solutions, and
 * short (posters): system demonstrations, descriptions, and work in progress

Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a web-based submission server.
Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNICST style for LaTeX in producing
the PDF document.
More information on this style can be found at:
http://www.springer.com/computer?SGWID=3D0-146-6-564009-0

The page limit for regular papers is 6 pages, while short papers are limited
to 4 pages.  The information about the author(s) must be omitted in the
submitted papers, since the review process will be blind.

More detailed information about submission is available on:
http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs/authors.shtml

Each submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program
Committee.  Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how
to produce camera-ready versions.

-------------
 PUBLICATION
-------------

All workshop papers will be published in the official proceedings, Springer
Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and
Telecommunications Engineering - LNICST, of the main conference.

Selected workshop papers will be published in "ACM Springer Mobile Networks
and Applications (MONET) Journal Special Issue on Mobility and User-Centric
Media".

All workshop papers will be also published on the UCMedia2009 Website.
