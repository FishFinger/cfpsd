software and grammar engineering, testing and quality assurance as they relate
to natural language processing.  Some suggested areas are:
- Patterns for design, coding, refactoring, and unit testing of language
processing systems
- Test suite design and generation
- Special issues in metrology for natural language processing
- Grammar/rule engineering
- Usability
- Standardization of tools and/or resources
- Design for and evaluation of reliability and robustness
- Scalability issues in training and deployment
- Reusability and toolkit design

Meeting Description:

Finite-State Methods and Natural Language Processing FSMNLP 2009
Eight International Workshop
University of Pretoria, South Africa
http://fsmnlp2009.fastar.org
21-24 July 2009

As in 2008, FSMNLP is merged with the FASTAR (Finite Automata Systems
Theoretical and Applied Research) workshop. 

Call for Papers

Scope
Aim
The International Workshop Series of Finite State Methods and Natural Language
Processing (FSMNLP), is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on
- NLP applications or language (technology) research resources,
- theoretical and implementation aspects, or
- their combinations
having obvious relevance or an explicitly discussed relation to
Finite-State Methods in NLP.

In the past, seven FSMNLP workshops have been organised (Budapest 1996, Ankara
1998, Helsinki 2001, Budapest 2003, Helsinki 2005, Potsdam 2007, Ispra 2008).

We invite submissions related to all obvious or traditional FSMNLP topics, see
e.g. FSMNLP 2008. The updated list of topics includes All the obvious or
traditional topics plus some new topics such as: 
- common interfaces, portability, and shared methods for testing/benchmarking/
evaluation of finite-state tools
- coping with large alphabets during finite-state compilation and in real- word
applications
- fixed parameter tractability and narrowness in streamed NLP
- conventional/parallel algorithms using/manipulating conventional/ stochastic
finite-state automata/paths
- applications of rational kernels to active/statistical machine learning of
finite-state models.

Special Theme
In recognition of its location on the African continent, this year's FSMNLP has
Finite- State Methods for Under-Resourced Languages as a special theme. The
theme is relevant to finite-state methods
- applied to practical tasks such as language survey, elicitation, data
collection, computer-aided annotation, morphological description, modelling and
normalization,
- considering demanding conditions such as linguistic complexity and diversity,
scarce resources, research infrastructures, real- time grammar updates,
- in language processing fields such as comparative linguistics, field
linguistics, applied linguistics, language teaching, and computer-aided translation.

The special theme does not restrict the scope but attempts to draw the attention
of contributors to the challenges of computational linguistics in Africa. We
hope that the theme teases out promising and useful applications of Finite-State
Methods in this context.

Special Sessions

Related Events
Our plan is to catalyze discussion and subworkshopping under some intense topics
by providing tutorials, competitions (shared tasks), and sessions/submissions
suited for e.g. researcher training. Our special effort to catalyze discussion
and joint subworkshopping includes the following topic areas that have been
selected considering the opportunities provided by the location of this year's
event:
1. "Finite-State Methods for African and Other Under-Resourced/ Low- Density
Languages" including knowledge and data-driven methods and their combinations
2. "Practical Aspects and Experience of FS Methods and Systems" including
exchange formats, performance, tool demos, compression
3. "Tree Automata and Transducers" including all applications of formal tree
language theory in NLP.

Each such program is organized by international experts related to the topics.
The organizers are also represented in the main event Program Committee.

Tutorials and Invited Talks
We expect to have tutorials on the following tentative topics:
- "Developing Computational Morphology for Low/Middle-Density Languages" by
Kemal Oflazer
- "Machine Learning with Automata" by Colin de la Higuera

The Invited Speakers will be announced later.

Competitions
We hope to be able to include small competitions / shared tasks:
- machine learning of morphology
- compression of dictionaries

Business Meeting
We wish to provide a slot for a business meeting of a special interest group on
finite-state methods and models provided that the necessary initial actions for
getting such a SIG in Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) have been
carried out successfully before the FSMNLP 2009.

Submission

Paper Categories and Formats
We initially invite submissions of full papers i.e. scientific contributions
presenting new theoretical or experimental results. Papers should present
original, unpublished research results and should not be submitted elsewhere
simultaneously.

At a later stage, submission of extended abstracts on on-going research,
systems, interactive software demos, and joint projects will likely be invited
for each of the subworkshopping areas. (Note that the early acceptance
notification date for full papers may help to keep travel costs for
international participants reasonably low.) If you come from far away and have
only an extended abstract, the abstract can be submitted earlier as if it were a
full paper.

The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted papers
since the review process will be double blind (submissions by ordinary PC
members are such as well). Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a
web-based submission server.

Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNCS style (Proceedings and Other
Multiauthor Volumes) for LaTeX in producing the PDF document. For graph
visualization, Vaucanson-G LaTeX style, Graphviz/dot and XFig are recommended.
If you use a non- roman script or Microsoft Word, it is advisable to warn the
organizers as early as possible. The page limit is 12 pages for full papers.

Proceedings and Special Journal Issue
The on-site proceedings will be on CD.
The actual proceedings with revised regular papers will be published after the
conference in a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence as a part of
the LNCS Series by Springer-Verlag.  LNCS banner

In addition, a special journal issue on Finite-State Methods and Models in NLP
is being planned. Extended versions of the papers and abstracts may be submitted
to this special issue (the publication involves a second review/selection cycle).

Important Dates
First call for papers: December 2008
Full paper submissions due: 22 March 2009
Notification of acceptance for full papers: 22 April 2009
Camera-ready versions of full papers due: 10 May 2009
