Meeting Description:

Grammar between norm and variation 
(Section of the Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS) 2007 in Siegen)

Grammatik im Spannungsfeld von Norm und Variation 
(Arbeitsgruppe der DGfS-Jahrestagung 2007 in Siegen)

This workshop, co-organized by Alexandra Lenz (Philipps-Universität Marburg) and Albrecht Plewnia (Institut für Deutsche Sprache Mannheim), is part of the Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS).  It dedicates to the triangle grammar - norm - variation.  In this triangle, the term norm, being used as a social (and not primarily linguistic) concept, not only covers directive norms aiming at a codified standard enforced by strong social obligations.  It expressively also includes subsistent norms which support every variety, every system; norms to which speakers adhere, more or less consciously.  In this meaning, variation not only comprises varying forms or, respectively, cognitive semantic concepts side by side, but also a complex and dynamic system of coexistent and possibly clashing norms with a different status and a different (a.o. local, social) range each, one of which often but not necessarily comes with high social prestige, being the standard norm. 

The main focus of contributions will lie on the complex network that combines the terms grammar, norm and variation.  Main questions are:

- How does particularly grammatical variation influence norms as well as trends towards a formation and standardization of norms? How do norms vice versa influence grammatical variation?

- What kind of influence do norms have on the direction of dynamics of grammatical variations?  What makes variations that infringe the norm variations that are norm compliant, and when does that happen?

- How do subsistent and non standardized norms deal with grammatical variation, in contrast to codified and standardized norms?

- Are there sections of grammar that are more subject to the formation of norms than others?

- How does individual and collective awareness of language relate?

This workshop aims particularly towards grammarians and typologists, as well as to variation linguists, sociolinguists and historical linguists of all philologies.  It focuses on phenomena and is therefore basically open to theories.

Presentations will be 30 minutes (including 10 minutes for discussion). The workshop languages are German and English.

Please submit an abstract (one-page, 12pt, 300 words maximum, including references), including the following information: (a) Title of the paper, (b) Name of the author(s), (c) Affiliation(s), (d) e-mail address(es) 

Abstracts should be sent by e-mail to:
plewnia@ids-mannheim.de

We plan to publish the papers of the workshop in a volume.

Important dates:
August 15, 2006: 		                deadline for abstracts submission
September 15, 2006:		notification of acceptance
February 28 - March 02, 2007: 	workshop in Siegen
Mai 31, 2007:			deadline for papers submission (publication)

Meeting Description:

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting. 

Anaphoric Uses of Demonstrative Expressions

Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft(DGfS) 
28 February - 2 March, 2007, Siegen

In many languages, demonstrative expressions such as German 'der', 'dieser', 'jener' and English 'this' and 'that' have - in addition to their familiar deictic uses - anaphoric uses, on which they refer to objects introduced not in the utterance situation, but rather in the preceding discourse. In recent years increasing attention has been paid to these ''anaphoric demonstratives'' by formal, functional, computational and corpus linguistic researchers. 

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting, comparing them with other more prototypically anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns, reflexives, definite noun phrases and logophoric expressions and cataloguing their unique properties. We expect that a focussed study of anaphoric demonstratives will shed significant light on general processes of anaphoric reference, anaphora resolution, and the cross-linguistic variation in these processes. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
-	Syntactic properties of anaphoric demonstratives
-	Relations of anaphoric demonstratives to deictic  
                demonstratives
-	Studies of patterns of use of anaphoric demonstratives
-	Contrasts with pronominal expressions
-	Psycholinguistic studies of anaphoric demonstratives
-	Cross-linguistic investigation of anaphoric demonstratives

Note that in addition to traditional syntactic and semantic investigation we welcome studies of usage and of processing.  

Invited speakers:
Konrad Ehlich           (Institut für Deutsch als Fremdsprache,  
                                 Universität München)
