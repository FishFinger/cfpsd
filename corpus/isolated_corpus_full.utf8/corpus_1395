Meeting Description:

This interdisciplinary minitrack and workshop brings designers and researchers
together to explore persistent conversation, the transposition of ordinarily
ephemeral conversation into the potentially persistent digital medium.
Persistent conversations occur via instant messaging, text and voice chat,
email, blogs, web boards, MOOs, graphical and 3D virtual environments, gaming
systems, video sharing sites, document annotation systems, mobile phone texting,
etc. Such communication is persistent in that it leaves a digital trace, and the
trace in turn affords new uses. It permits conversations to be saved,
visualized, browsed, searched, replayed, and restructured. Persistence also
means that conversations need not be synchronous: they can be asynchronous
(stretching out over hours or days) or supersynchronous (with multiple parties
'talking' at the same time). Finally, the creation of persistent and potentially
permanent records from what was once an ephemeral process raises a variety of
social and ethical issues.

About Paper Topics
We are seeking papers that address one or both of the following two
general areas:
- Understanding Practice. The burgeoning popularity of the internet (and
intranets) provides an opportunity to study and characterize new forms of
conversational practice. Questions of interest range from how various features
of conversations (e.g., turn-taking, topic organization, expression of
paralinguistic information) have adapted in response to the digital medium, to
new roles played by persistent conversation in domains such as education,
business, and entertainment.
- Design. Digital systems do not currently support conversation well: it is
difficult to converse with grace, clarity, depth and coherence over networks.
But this need not remain the case. Toward this end, we welcome analyses of
existing systems as well as designs for new systems which better support
conversation. Also of interest are inquiries into how participants design their
own conversations within the digital medium -- that is, how they make use of
system features to create, structure, and regulate their discourse.

Examples of appropriate topics include, but are not limited to:
- Turn-taking, threading and other structural features of CMC
- The dynamics of large scale conversation systems (e.g. blog networks)
- Methods for summarizing or visualizing conversation archives
- Studies of virtual communities or other sites of digital conversation
- The roles of mediated conversation in knowledge management
- Studies of the use of instant messaging in large organizations
- Novel designs for computer-mediated conversation systems
- Analyses of or designs for distance learning systems

Next Steps
Submit a 250 to 500 word abstract of your proposed paper via email to
the chairs: Tom Erickson (snowfall at acm dot org), Susan Herring
(herring at indiana dot edu) by the deadline noted above. We will send
you feedback on the suitability of your abstract by the deadline noted
above.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/donation/fund-drive2007/ 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
