Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

THE FIFTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LEARNING, The University of Illinois, Chicago, USA, 3-6 June 2008 
http://www.LearningConference.com

The International Conference on Learning is for any person with an interest in, and concern for, education at any of its levels and in any of its forms, from early childhood, to schools, to higher education and lifelong learning Â— and in any of its sites, from home to school to university to workplace.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Learning. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 22 November 2007. Proposals are reviewed within four weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.LearningConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Chicago in June 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Helen Smith
