Mission
The mission of the ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) series of working conferences is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to evaluation of novel approaches to software engineering. By comparing novel approaches with established traditional practices and by evaluating them against software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, identify most hopeful trends and propose new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale software development and integration.


Goals and Topics of Interest
The conference solicits experiments, case studies, surveys, meta-analyses, empirical studies, systematic reviews, conceptual explorations, innovative ideas, critical appraisals, etc. related to:

* agile software development, 
* aspect-oriented software development, 
* agent-oriented software engineering, 
* multi-agent systems,
* model-driven engineering, 
* component-based software engineering, 
* evolutionary design, 
* intentional software, 
* example centric programming, 
* meta programming systems, 
* knowledge management and engineering,
* architectural design and meta architectures,
* business process management, engineering and reengineering, 
* process-centric paradigms,
* service-oriented architectures, 
* application integration technologies, 
* enterprise integration strategies and patterns,
* e-business technologies, 
* requirements engineering frameworks and models,
* collaborative requirements management systems, 
* business and software modeling languages,
* software quality management, 
* software change and configuration management,
* geographically distributed software development environments,
* cross-feeding between data engineering and software engineering,
* design thinking as a paradigm for software development, 
* formal methods, 
* software process improvement, 
* metamodelling, 
* software development methodologies
