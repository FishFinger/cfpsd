                       Call for participation
                       ICML-2007 Workshop on
          Challenges and Applications of Grammar Induction 

 In conjunction with the International Conference on Machine Learning, 
          Oregon State University, June 20 - June 24, 2007 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description 

Grammar Induction (GI), also known as Grammatical Inference, is about 
learning grammars from data. A well-known important application of GI 
is natural language learning, but it is applicable in a much broader 
sense to the problem of learning structural models from data. The data 
typically consists of sequences of discrete events from various domains 
(such as text, DNA fragments, primary structure of proteins, sequential 
process log-files and musical scores), but can also include trees and 
arbitrary graphs (such as metabolic networks and social networks). 
Typical models include formal grammars (regular, context-free, context-
sensitive, . . .), and statistical models in related formalisms such as 
probabilistic automata, hidden Markov models, probabilistic transducers 
or conditional random fields.

The CAGI workshop aims at highlighting current challenges in grammar 
induction with a special focus on applicability issues including:
- practical evaluations demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed 
techniques, 
- novel applications of grammar induction algorithms,
- noise resistant approaches,
- semi-supervised grammar learning,
- learning from partial sequences or streams,
- approximate induction and model optimization,
- experimental assessments illustrating the current limit(s) of the GI 
field,
- practical complexity and scalability issues (alphabet size, noise 
level, data sparseness, data inconsistency, . . .),
- evaluation of similarity learning algorithms from structured data 
(pair-HMM learning, stochastic transducer learning, . . .).


Workshop Format

The workshop will include presentations of peer-reviewed papers. Each 
such paper will be assigned 30 minutes, including 10 minutes for 
discussion. Each half-day will start with an invited paper for 45 
minutes including the discussion. The day will be concluded with an 
open panel for discussing the key lessons learned and pointing at 
relevant research perspectives.


Submission Information

Prospective authors are invited to email their 8-page papers to 
cagi07@cs.okstate.edu by the due date in PDF format. Formatting 
instructions are given by the conference at 
http://oregonstate.edu/conferences/icml2007/icml_format_2007.zip. 
The workshop will not have a blind review process, and therefore 
author names, affiliations, and contact information should appear in 
the submission, including postal address, email address, telephone 
number, and fax number. Electronic versions of the final papers will 
be available on the workshop home page at www.cs.okstate.edu/cagi07/. 

Interested participants are also invited to submit 2-page position 
papers. These will also be peer-reviewed and appear in the workshop 
proceedings. If the workshop schedule allows, short presentations 
at the end of the day may be possible as well.
