Towards Genre-Enabled Search Engines: The Impact of NLP - Workshop held in

Workshop Description
Broadly speaking, genres are textual categories that streamline communication by
relying on acknowledged conventions and raising predictable expectations. For
instance, the conventions underlying the Blog genre are represented by a
sequence of daily entries that contain narratives, opinions, as well as the
feelings of the blogger, an individual who wishes to participate in a discussion
on a certain subject. These entries are public and other bloggers can directly
comment on them by sending their own postings. These conventions are different
from those underlying the Editorial genre, where a single person presents an
argumentative statement of views that are considered to be representative of a
newspaper as a whole. In brief, genres convey the context of communication. This
context is essential when determining the relevance of the information contained
in a text.

The concept of genre has great potential for Information Retrieval (IR). One
application is its integration in a search-engine architecture, enabling the
user to combine topic-based search with genre-based search. 

The distinction between topical and non-topical textual dimensions is crucial
when it comes to features. Traditionally, topics and domains rely on features
based on content words (e.g. in the bag-of-words approach), while genre classes
appear to be more easily identified through the use of grammatical features
(like function words, POS tags, and syntactic features). As Natural Language
Processing (NLP) provides methods to retrieve grammatical features, an
investigation of the influence of NLP on automatic genre identification appears
of primary importance. For this reason, we wish to investigate to what extent
NLP can help identify genre in an IR scenario. 

The main aims of the workshop are as follows: 

- To identify the key features that help classify documents by genre, and their
efficiency and effectiveness within an IR framework. 
- To explore how genres can improve search engines, and in particular how it can
be integrated with topic-based retrieval. 
- To bring together researchers working on genre in different communities - such
as Computational Linguistics, NLP, Information Retrieval and Extraction, Text
and Web Mining, or Summarization - in order to investigate the extent to which
NLP can assist or enable automatic genre identification. 

Topics 
The topics of interests include but are not limited to: 
- Computational modelling of genres for web applications; 
- Implementation of genre-based applications for retrieval; 
- The impact of lexis, morphology and syntax on automatic genre identification; 
- Genre-revealing features and their automatic extraction; 
- Genre-driven NLP tools, such as genre-driven taggers, parsers, or discourse
annotation; 
- Genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and no-genre documents; 
- Test collections and evaluation metrics for genre-enabled applications; 
- Clustering and visualization of results based on genre. 

Categories of Papers
Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: Regular Paper and Poster.
Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time. Regular
Papers are full-length papers and must not exceed 8 pages. Posters are submitted
as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). If accepted, a poster is presented in the
workshop poster session. Both regular papers and poster papers are included in
the workshop proceedings. 

Submission Instructions
Format. Authors are invited to submit papers and posters on original and
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers and posters should
be submitted as PDF files, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 stylefiles,
without author name(s) and affiliation(s). Papers and posters should not exceed
the length indicated above. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are available at:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm 

Please, send papers and posters to both MarinaSantini.MS@gmail.com and
georg.rehm@uni-tuebingen.de 

Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by three members of the
Program Committee. Reviewing will be blind. Reviewers will be asked to provide
detailed comments, and to score submissions on the following factors: 

- Relevance to the workshop 
- Significance and originality 
- Technical/methodological accuracy 
- References to related work 
- Presentation (clarity, organisation, English) 

Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers (regular papers and posters) will be
published in the workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at least one
of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected
to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration fees. 

Dual submissions to the main RANLP 2007 conference and this workshop are
allowed; if you submit to the main session, please do indicate this when you
submit to the workshop. If your paper or poster is accepted for the main
session, you should withdraw it from the workshop upon notification by the main
session. 

Registration 
Information on registration and registration fees are provided at the conference
website (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/).

Full Title: Workshop on Second Language Acquisition 

Date: 10-Sep-2007 - 10-Sep-2007
Location: Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Kenny Coventry
Meeting Email: kenny.coventry@northumbria.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.cocolab.org/esla/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

In association with EUROSLA 17 and the Arts and Humanities Research Council. 
Workshop on Second Language Acquisition and Spatial Language
Spatial language, such as asking directions for places in large scale space, or
asking where a misplaced object is in small scale space, constitutes part of the
basic fabric of language. Research into spatial language has recently been a
hotbed of activity, including much work showing that languages vary greatly in
how they carve up space. Furthermore, it is often noted by researchers and
practitioners in second language learning that spatial language, and spatial
adpositions in particular, present a particular challenge for the second
language learner.
The focus of this workshop will be to bring together work on SLA and spatial
language with a view to characterizing the processes and constraints that affect
the acquisition of L2 in this important domain.

Attendance is free of charge and contributions to the workshop will be collected
into a special issue of a journal or a book. 

Workshop Format 

Submissions are now invited for oral presentation slots and poster presentation
slots. The oral presentations will be 20 minutes in length including (including
5 minutes for questions). There are 9 presentation slots available, and 15
poster slots. 


Submission Information

Submissions should be in the form of a single A4 sheet including the following
information:

1. Title of the paper,
2. Name and affiliation of the author(s),
3. Abstract of 300 words (excluding references and the title),
4. First author's postal address,
5. First author's e-mail address,
6. Type of presentation intended: please indicate whether you would like your
proposal to be considered for a paper, a poster or both. 

Please send your submission to kenny.coventry@northumbria.ac.uk by 1st June,
2007. Submission decisions will be sent out by the 15th of June, 2007.
