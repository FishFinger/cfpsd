ELECTRONIC CORPORA OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES
International Conference
Prague (Czech Republic), November 20th, 2007
http://enlil.ff.cuni.cz/ecal/

CALL FOR PAPERS

*** APOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE POSTINGS ***

* AIMS OF CONFERENCE

Electronic corpora of ancient languages offer important information 
about the culture and history of ancient civilizations, but at the same 
time they constitute a valuable source of linguistic information. The 
scholarly community is increasingly aware of the importance of 
computer-aided analysis of these corpora, and of the rewards it can 
bring. The construction of electronic corpora for ancient languages is a 
complex task. Many more pieces of information have to be taken into 
account than for living languages, e.g. the artefact bearing the text, 
lacunae, level of restoration, etc. The electronic corpora can be 
enriched with links to images, annotations, and other secondary sources. 
The annotations should deal with matters such as textual damage, 
possible variant readings, etc., as well as with many features specific 
to ancient languages.

Recent years have witnessed a considerable increase in electronic corpus 
construction for ancient languages, with the involvement of many 
institutions across the world. The time is ripe to see whether the 
experiences of scholars working on such projects can profitably be shared.

* SUBMISSIONS

We invite submissions on all aspects of the construction of corpora of 
ancient languages, as well as on their use for different purposes. We 
especially welcome submissions on the linguistic use of these corpora, 
and their linguistic annotation.

* SUBMISSIONS PROCEDURE

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on the topic of 
the conference. Submission of an abstract is required first, for the 
review process. After presentation at the conference, the papers will be 
published. They will be required in final form for publication in 
January 2008.
Abstracts in PDF format should be sent to petr.zemanek@ff.cuni.cz not 
later than September 24th.
