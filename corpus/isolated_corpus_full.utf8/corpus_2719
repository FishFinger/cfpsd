Call Deadline: 11-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

The number of health information web resources is increasing day by day. The
content of these resources is very variable and difficult to assess.
Furthermore, the number of people searching for health-related information is
also increasing. The development of tools to support the process of describing
the content of medical web resources with meta-data that facilitate their
retrieval, and with quality labels by certified authorities, is crucial for the
delivery of content of better quality to health information consumers.

The DRMed workshop at MIE 2008 aims at providing a focused international forum
for researchers, developers and labeling organizations to present the scope of
the problem, discuss the potential of semantic web technologies and outline
promising future research directions.
