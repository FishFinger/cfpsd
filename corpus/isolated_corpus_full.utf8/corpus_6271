Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both =
accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing =
processes and the accepted papers will be included in the same printed =
and electronic proceedings.

Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic =
forums) will be held for each session included in the conference =
program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and =
authors presenting at the same session can interact during one week =
before and after the conference. Authors can also participate in =
peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions.

All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing =
processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, =
and (3) participative peer reviews. These three kinds of review will =
support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be =
accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to =
be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have =
access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the =
reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so =
they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. =
Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their =
respective submissions.

Sessions' best paper will be awarded and the author who presented the =
paper will receive an award certificate at the award ceremony which will =
be held as the last event of the conference.

Authors of the best 10%-20% of the papers presented at the conference =
(included those virtually presented) will be invited to adapt their =
papers for their publication in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics =
and Informatics.

Registration fees of an effective invited session organizer will be =
waived according to the policy described in the web page  (click on =
'Invited Session', then on 'Benefits for the Organizers of Invited =
Sessions'), where you can get information about the ten benefits for an =
invited session organizer. For Invited Sessions Proposals, please visit =
the conference web site, or directly to =
