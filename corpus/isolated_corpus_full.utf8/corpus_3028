Dear Lev,

You can use El Grial to lemmatize your corpus. If you want to do it, we can
upload the corpus and then you can make the related querys. =


See www.elgrial.cl and the attached paper (in Spanish) for more information.
During the next weeks it will be under revision and some of the machines are
being changed. So you can experiment some delays or some kind of troubles. =

Please, don=92t hesitate to contact me if necessary. =

To: <CORPORA_AT_uib.no>

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.



Dear Corpora colleagues, some linguists ask, why we should collect phonetic
corpora. Surely, one can find many ways to use phonetic corpora. Our task is
to use phonetic corpora as another means to compare languages and to measure
language distances. We are looking forward from linguists who'd like to join
our group. It may be one more method which can add some additional
information to classify world languages into different taxa: subgroups,
groups, families, units, unions, etc. Looking forward to hearing from you to
yutamb_AT_mail.ru  Yours sincerely Yuri Tambovtsev

Subject: [Corpora-List] phonetic corpora as another means to	measure

To: corpora_AT_uib.no

Dear Yuri,

I may be showing my ignorance here, but isn't it likely that phonetic  =

distance varies as much between the origin of the speaker, as between  =

languages themselves? English spoken in various regions of Great  =

Britain (which barely differ when written) is a case in point.

I have, on occasion, listening to some people from Newcastle and not  =

understanding the words that they were speaking (a common enough  =

occurrence for me, coming from Cambridge), thought that they sounded  =

rather like native speakers of Dutch, or perhaps one of the  =

Scandinavian languages. As I don't understand these languages, I would  =

assume that a large part of this association was to do with the  =

phonetic content. Similarly, on rarer occasions when I have heard  =

people from my own part of the country speaking and for a moment not  =

understood what they were saying, I have registered it as something  =

more like German.

I don't think it is even an issue of regional dialects: it seems to me  =

that the phonetic signature of any language spoken by a non-native  =

speaker, or spoken as a second language, is generally skewed heavily  =

towards the phonetic content of their native region and/or first  =

language.

Can I ask how these issues factor in your research? For example, are  =

you taking spoken corpora for each language from a very broad  =

cross-section of speaker-regions, or are you also measuring phonetic  =

distance between speaker-regions for a broad cross-section of  =

languages and using this as some kind of contrast?

               Symposium on Semantics in Text Processing

          http://project.cgm.unive.it/html/STEP2008/index.htm

                         September 22-24, 2008

                     Auditorium Santa Margherita
                           Venice (Italy)

          Endorsed by SIGSEM, the ACL special interest group
                    on computational semantics


  MOTIVATION
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Thanks to both statistical approaches and finite state methods,
natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the area of robust,
open-domain text processing, has made considerable progress in the
last couple of decades. It is probably fair to say that NLP tools have
reached satisfactory performance at the level of syntactic processing,
be the output structures chunks, phrase structures, or dependency
graphs.  Therefore, the time seems ripe to extend the state-of-the-art
and consider deep semantic processing as a serious task in
wide-coverage NLP. This is a step that normally requires syntactic
parsing, as well as named entity recognition, anaphora resolution,
thematic role labelling and word sense disambiguation, as well as
other lower levels of processing for which reasonably good methods
have already been developed. Accurate automatic semantic
interpretation of text is expected to benefit newly emerging areas
targetting semantic and pragmatic issues, such as affectivity and
sentiment analysis of texts, textual entailment, and consistency
checking.


  WORKSHOP SCOPE
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The goal of the STEP workshop is to provide a forum for anyone active
in semantic processing of text to discuss innovative technologies,
representation issues, inference techniques, prototype
implementations, and real applications. The preferred processing
targets are large quantities of texts -- either specialised domains,
or open domains such as newswire text, blogs, and wikipedia-like text.
Implemented rather than theoretical work is emphasised in STEP.
In particular, relevant topics are:

- wide-coverage semantic/logical analysis of text
- computation and use of discourse relations
- use of lexical-conceptual and semantically related resources
- thematic role labelling in semantic representations
- word sense disambiguation in semantic representations
- implementations of specific semantic phenomena
- anaphora or ellipsis resolution in semantic representations
- implementations of sentiment analysis
- automatic detection of subjective and non-literal language
- acquisition of lexical knowledge and paraphrase from raw corpora
- background knowledge acquisition, representation, and selection
- semantic lexicons and ontologies for text interpretation
- learning semantic representations from raw text
- automated reasoning in the service of semantic analysis of text
- creation of gold standard meaning representations
- evaluation of semantic representations
- textual entailment and consistency checking
- systems that extract, represent or manipulate text meaning
- applications of semantic analysis in text processing

Applications inlude, but are not limited to, machine translation, text
understanding, question answering, summarisation, information
extraction, and the semantic web.


  SHARED TASK: COMPARING SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

STEP 2008 will also feature a "shared task" to compare semantic
representations as output by state-of-the-art NLP systems.
Participating systems will be given a number of (small) texts, before
the workshop.  The output of these systems will be judged on a number
of aspects by a panel of experts in the field, during the workshop.
Aim of the shared task is to discuss the feasibility of a gold
standard for deep semantic representations. Aim of the panel is to
identify a set of problematic and relevant issues for semantic
evaluation.  The panel will reward the system with the most complete
and accurate semantic representation with a special prize. Important
dates for the Step Shared Task are:

	Intention of participation:       June  1, 2008
	Shared Task paper submission:     June  6, 2008
         Notification of acceptance:       June 23, 2008
         Release of test data              June 25, 2008
         System's results due              July  4, 2008
         Final version paper due:          July 25, 2008
         Workshop:                      Sept 22-24, 2008

To participate in the shared task, submit a paper containing (1) a
system description, (2) a description of the semantic formalism used
by the system, and (3) an authentic small text and the way it is
analysed by the system.  This text should be in English (but see
below) and not exceed five sentences and 120 tokens. The test data for
the shared task will be composed out of all the texts submitted by the
participants. Please email Johan Bos (bos_AT_di.uniroma1.it) by June 1 if
you intend to participate in the shared task.

Shared task submissions should follow the workshop format for regular
papers and submission guidelines (see below), and will be published in
the STEP 2008 proceedings. Please choose the category "shared task"
when submitting a paper using the EasyChair system. The final paper
must include a discussion of the system's performance on the shared
task data.  Please contact Johan Bos (bos_AT_di.uniroma1.it) for further
questions on the shared task, or if you would like to participate with
a language other than English.


  SUBMISSIONS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should
indicate the state of completion of the reported results. Overlap with
previously published work should be clearly indicated.  Submissions
will be judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of
