General Information

Santiago de Compostela is a historic city located in the north-western part of
Spain. It is the administrative, social and commercial capital of the Autonomous
Community of Galicia. It was declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO thanks to
its multicultural nature and as the final destination of a thousand-year-old
pilgrim route: the Way of St. James. It was originally a stopping point on a
Roman road, but the discovery of the Apostle James' tomb at the beginning of the
9th century gave rise to a place of worship in the corner of the Iberian
Peninsula. From then on, all of Europe started walking towards Santiago, a holy
city of Christendom. This setting is alive with cultural expressions - annual
music, cinema and theatre festivals, permanent and travelling exhibitions and
traditional festivals- organised by the public and private sector, led by the
five-hundred-year-old University of Santiago, whose lecture rooms add thirty
thousand students to Compostela population of one hundred thousand residents.
