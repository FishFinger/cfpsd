Dear Colleagues from QATAR,

We are happy to announce the Mini-conference
 
"Semantic Web and Web 2.0 Technologies for the Knowledge Society"
http://www.open-knowledge-society.org/miniconf1.htm 
 
[A Workshop for Special issue on IEEE Transactions Journal will be
organized also in the context of the mini conference]
 
in the context of the Athens 1st World Summit on The Knowledge Society
Athens, September 24-28, 2008
http://knowledge-summit.org/
 
TWO THEMES:
 
The Human Semantic Web: Personalization, Management of Personal
Knowledge and Identity, Systems for the Knowledge Society"
 
Web 2.0 for the Knowledge Society: Social Networking, Collaboration,
Management of Knowledge in Social Networks
 
If you are interested in serving as Members of the Program Committee
please contact Dr. Miltiadis D. Lytras
 
 
The mini-conference "Semantic Web and Web 2.0 Collaboration
Technologies for the Knowledge Society" will promote a knowledge
transfer channel where academics, practitioners, and researchers can
discuss, analyze, criticize, synthesize, communicate, elaborate, and
simplify the more-than-promising technology of the semantic Web in the
context of information systems. This mini-conference aims to establish
value-adding knowledge transfer and personal development channels in
three distinctive areas: academia, industry, and government.
 
Within the Conference there are two pillars:

CALL FOR PAPERS 
 
The Human Semantic Web: Personalization, Management of Personal
Knowledge and Identity, Systems for the Knowledge Society" 
Workshop for a Special Issue on an IEEE Transactions Special Issue 
 
 
 
The Semantic Web vision has evolved in the last years as a blueprint
for a knowledge-based framework aimed at crossing the chasm from the
current Web of unstructured information resources to a Web equipped
with metadata and oriented to delegation of tasks to software
agents. Ontologies are the key piece of this framework in that they
provide shared semantics to metadata, thus enabling a degree of
semantic interoperability. The requirements of large-scale deployment
and interoperability of the Semantic Web vision represent a major
challenge to data and knowledge engineering, which raises a number of
issues and requirements regarding how to represent, create, manage and
use both ontologies as shared knowledge representations, but also
large volumes of metadata records used to annotate Web resources of a
diverse kind. The special issue aims at helping in communicating and
disseminating relevant recent research in knowledge and data
engineering as applied to the context of Information Systems. The
scope of the call includes Knowledge Engineering for organizational
applications, Semantic Web approaches to Information Systems and
Ontology-Based Information Systems research, as well as the diverse
underlying Database and Knowledge Representation aspects. Papers
dealing with aspects that touch both aspects are especially
sought. This is intended to initiate a dialog between the
organizational and more technical views of the field.
 
Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
1. Applications of the Human Semantic Web to the Knowledge Society:
- Potentially large-scale applications (e.g. to Personal Knowledge
  Management, Semantic Desktop, Knowledge Portals)
- Data Semantics and Web Semantics in peer-to-peer systems, grids,
  multimedia
- Communication, dialogue and argumentation models
- Mediation, negotiation and conflict resolution
 
2. Representing and Managing Semantic Web Data and Services:
- Languages, Tools, Methodologies, Rules
- Database, IR and AI technologies
- Integration, Analysis and Visualization
- Robust and scalable logics, knowledge management and reasoning 
- Machine learning and information extraction 
- Semantic Interoperability, Workflows, Web Mining
- Semantic Web Services and Processes (description, discovery,
  invocation, composition, choreography, cleaning, assurance, trust,
  provenance, etc.)
- Middleware and services for Personalization and User Modelling
- Semantic matching of user needs and web resources
 
3. Ontologies:
- Ontology Alignment (mapping, matching, merging, mediation and
  reconciliation)
- Ontology Learning and Metadata Generation (e.g. HLT and ML
  approaches)
- Ontology Management (creation, evolution, evaluation, etc.)
- Ontology Modeling, reuse, extraction, and evolution
- Searching and Ranking ontologies
 
4. Social Semantic Web:
- Social networks and processes on the Semantic Web
- Semantic web technology for collaboration and cooperation
- Representing and reasoning about Trust, Privacy, Security and
  Intellectual Property Rights
- Tools and processes for sense-making, analysis and decision-making
- Supporting strategic communication
 
5. User Interfaces:
- Interacting with Semantic Web Data
- Semantic Web content creation and annotation
- Mashing up Semantic Web data and processes

The key objective of the miniconference is to advancing the knowledge
on design variables and conditions for social networks. Knowledge
Management and Semantic Web are used as the technological lenses for
the specification and analysis of these variables towards a new era of
social interactions and human experiences with computers.
 
As semantic technologies prove their value with targeted applications,
there are increasing opportunities to consider their application
insocial contexts for learning and human development. Knowledge
management has been accepted as a critical enabler aiming to increase
knowledge-related performance by better use of intellectual assets, in
addition to which many governments are forced to increasingly deal
with knowledge services that form larger parts of the global economy
and society. Thus there are recent examples of applications of
semantics for empowering knowledge management or better supporting
knowledge services for social networks. The special issue aims at
communicating and disseminating recent research and success stories
that bring the power of semantics to improve upon traditional
knowledge management approaches, or realize emerging requirements of
knowledge services for social networks.

In the context of knowledge management, social and human issues are of
equal if not higher importance than the technical issues that have
tended to receive the bulk of attention in the past. Consequently,
papers that touch these aspects, or those that extend technical and
domain knowledge to social and human issues are especially
sought. This is intended to initiate a dialog between the social,
psychological and technical views of the field.
