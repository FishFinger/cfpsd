*** Intelligent User Interfaces - IUI08 ***
A new Generation of User Interfaces
Maspalomas - Gran Canaria - Spain
13-16 January 2008


*** Call for Workshop ***

Workshops provide members of a community a forum to discuss common=20
interests in a focused way. If you are working in an emerging area in=20
Intelligent User Interfaces, consider organizing a workshop. They are a=20
chance to meet mind-alike researchers and discover what others are=20
doing. A workshop offers a good opportunity for young researchers to=20
present their work and to obtain feedback from an interested community.=20
Successful workshops may result in edited books or special issues in=20
international journals.

IUI 2008 is looking for exciting proposals for half-day or one-day=20
workshops to be held on January 13, 2008, the first day of the=20
conference. Each workshop should generate discussions that give the IUI=20
community a new, organized way of thinking about the topic, or ideas=20
that suggest promising directions for future research. A successful=20
workshop can move the field forward and help in building community.=20
Researchers and practitioners in the intelligent user interfaces=20
community at large are invited to submit proposals for review.

      including the planned activities (such as position statements,

      discussion and interaction among participants; workshops
      consisting solely of paper presentations are discouraged. Provide
      a preliminary schedule with estimated times. Design your schedule
      for a length of 3 hours (half-day workshop) or 6 hours (full-day
