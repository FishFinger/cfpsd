Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
2nd UIMA@GSCL Workshop

September 30, 2009
Potsdam, Germany

http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/gscl09/workshops.de.html

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering =20
standards
causing a limited degree of re-usability of code and interoperability of
different modules within larger NLP systems. While this did not =20
really hamper
success in limited task areas (such as implementing a parser), it =20
caused serious
problems for the emerging field of language technology where the =20
focus is on
building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information =20
extraction
or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to =20
duplicated software
development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions =20=

of)
programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules
developed at different sites.

In recent years, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture =20=

(UIMA)
framework has been proposed as a middleware platform which offers =20
integration by
design through common type systems and standardized communication =20
methods for
components analysing streams of unstructured information, such as =20
natural
language. The UIMA framework offers a solid processing infrastructure =20=

that
allows developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual =20
analytics
components. An increasing number of members of the NLP community thus =20=

have
adopted UIMA as a platform facilitating the creation of reusable NLP =20
components
that can be assembled to address different NLP tasks depending on =20
their order,
combination and configuration.

This workshop aims at bringing together members of the NLP community =20
that are
users, developers or providers of either UIMA components or UIMA-=20
related tools
in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in =20
using UIMA
as a platform for modern, well-engineered NLP. In the context of an =20
emerging
NLP-oriented UIMA community, the challenge to create not only =20
reusable, but also
interoperable components raises particular interest. =46rom a =20
methodological
perspective, interoperability relies largely on UIMA type systems. =20
Technically,
it includes issues related to the packaging and distribution of UIMA =20
components.
Also, tools are important, for example to assemble complex processing =20=

work
flows, to manage the bodies of data that are to be analysed and to =20
visualize,
explore, and further deploy the analysis results. Finally, =20
interoperability is
also affected by legal issues, such as potentially incompatible =20
licenses of
components and tools.

The availability of ready-to-use components plays a major role in =20
choosing UIMA
over other alternatives. To accentuate this, the workshop puts a =20
focus on
UIMA-based components and tools that are freely available for research.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Participants are invited to present applications realized using UIMA, =20=

general
experiences using UIMA as a platform for natural language processing, =20=

as well as
technical papers on particular aspects of the UIMA framework. =20
Alternatives to
and comparisons of other frameworks with UIMA are of interest, too. More
specifically, workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

     * UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type-=20
system
       independence
     * repositories of ready-to-use UIMA-based components
     * (generic) type systems for UIMA
     * distribution of UIMA components: documentation, licensing and =20
packaging
     * sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing =20
pipelines
     * experience reports combining UIMA-based components from =20
different sources,
       as well as solutions to interoperability issues
     * processing of very large data collections: scale-out, =20
parallelization, and
       performance optimization
     * analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and
       statistical analysis
     * developing for UIMA: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing, =20=

and
       limitations of UIMA

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We invite submissions of full papers, limited to 8 pages of text, and =20=

position
papers or papers describing ongoing work as short papers, limited to =20
4 pages.
Both kinds of papers will be orally presented. Double submissions =20
(whether
verbatim or in essence) should indicate this fact and name the =20
workshop or
conference event also addressed. Reviewing will not be anonymous but =20
authors
wishing to keep their anonymity may hide their identity on demand.

All submissions must be in English and follow the Springer LNCS style =20=

[1] and
should be created using LaTeX. Submissions must be sent in PDF format to
uima.gscl2009@googlemail.com no later than July, 6th.

Accepted submissions will appear in the GSCL conference proceedings.
