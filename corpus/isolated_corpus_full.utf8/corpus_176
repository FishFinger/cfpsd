Research on the Web as corpus is currently at a very exciting stage:
increasing evidence points to the enormous potential of the Internet as =
a
source of linguistic data, but we are still far from a working,

be
tackled, ranging from Web frequency distributions and registers, to
efficient handling of massive data sets, to copyright.

We invite submissions which:=20

the process (crawling, filtering, language-id, tokenizing,=20
lemmatizing, POS-tagging, indexing, ...)=20

- explore characteristics of Web data, from a linguistics/NLP=20
perspective=20

- use crawled Web data for NLP purposes.=20

Preference will be given to projects where Web data are downloaded and=20
processed directly, rather than via search engine interfaces.=20
