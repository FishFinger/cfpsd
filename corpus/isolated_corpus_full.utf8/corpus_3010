Coling 2008 workshop on human judgements in Computational Linguistics

Manchester, UK
23 August 2008

Deadline Extension 

New deadline for submission: 10 May 2008

Workshop Description:
Human judgements play a key role in the development and the assessment of
linguistic resources and methods in Computational Linguistics. They are commonly
used in the creation of lexical resources and corpus annotation, and also in the
evaluation of automatic approaches to linguistic tasks. Furthermore,
systematically collected human judgements provide clues for research on
linguistic issues that underlie the judgement task, providing insights
complementary to introspective analysis or evidence gathered from corpora.

We invite papers about experiments that collect human judgements for
Computational Linguistic purposes, with a particular focus on linguistic tasks
that are controversial from a theoretical point of view (e.g., some coding tasks
having to do with semantics or pragmatics). Such experimental tasks are usually
difficult to design and interpret, and they typically result in mediocre
inter-rater reliability. We seek both broad methodological papers discussing
these issues, and specific case studies.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Experimental design:
- Which types of experiments support the collection of human judgements? Can any
general guidelines be defined? Is there a preference between lab-based
experiments and web-based experiments?
- Which experimental methodologies support controversial tasks? For instance,
does underspecification help? What is the role of ambiguity and polysemy in
these tasks?
- What is the appropriate level of granularity for the category labels?
- What kind of participants should be used (e.g., expert vs. non-expert), how is
it affected by the type of experiment, and how should the experiment design be
varied according to this issue?
- How much and which kind of information (examples, context, etc.) should be
provided to the experiment participants? When does information turn into a bias?
- Is it possible to design experiments that are useful for both computational
linguistics and psycholinguistics? What do the two research areas have in
common? What are the differences?

Analysis and interpretation of experimental data:
- How important is inter-annotator agreement in human judgement collection
experiments? How is it best measured for complex tasks?
- What other quantitative tools are useful for analysing human judgement
collection experiments?
- What qualitative methods are useful for analysing human judgement collection
experiments? Which questions should be asked? Is it possible to formulate
general guidelines?
- How is the analysis similar to psycholinguistic analysis? How is it different?
- How do results from all of the methods above affect the development of
annotation instructions and procedures?

Application of experiment insights:
- How do the experimental data fit into the general resource-creating process?
- How to modify the set of labels and the criteria or guidelines for the
annotation task according to the experimental results? How to avoid circularity
in this process? 
- How can the data be used to refine or modify existing theoretical proposals?
- More generally, under what conditions can the obtained judgements be applied
to research questions?

Call Deadline: 16-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

We aim at bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers who are
working on high-level information extraction. The goal of this workshop will be
to structure and explore the state of the art, to evolve high-level IE models
with regard to real-world applications, and to identify future challenges and
applications. We intend to cover a broad range of methods, including
pipelined/hybrid approaches and structured prediction models. 

Call for Papers

Information extraction (IE) techniques aim at extracting structured information
from unstructured data sources. IE methods are successful at addressing
naturally arising learning tasks where the data is generally structured, highly
correlated, and frequently preserve multiple-way dependencies within and between
recurrent structures.

By now, ''low-level'' tasks such as named entity recognition are well
understood, however, solving complex IE tasks - like relation and event
extraction - remains a challenge.

In the last years, significant contributions to high-level IE in relevant fields
led to applications that have matured to a point beyond proof of concept.
However, which strategy (e.g., pipeline, structured, or hybrid) is beneficial
for which problems is not yet well understood, neither from the theoretical nor
the practical point of view.

We are interested in the following topics:

- Algorithms:
What are the differences between pipelined and structured methods? Are there
hybrid methods, using the best of the two worlds? Are there novel algorithms and
techniques for solving high-level IE or subproblems thereof?

- Theoretical results:
Are there convergence/generalization bounds for high-level IE techniques? Is
there a characterization of problems for which a direct solution always exists?
How can high-level IE methods be evaluated?

- Pre- and post-processing techniques:
Which high-level IE applications benefit from pre-/post-processing? Can
pre-/post-processing be harmful? Are these techniques independent of the
underlying IE methods? How can pre- and post-processing techniques be evaluated?

- Applications:
What are novel applications involving high-level IE? Are there equivalent
problems in related areas that can be solved with existing methods?
