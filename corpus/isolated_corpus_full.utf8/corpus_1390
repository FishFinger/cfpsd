CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
(Apologies for multiple postings)

The French Association for Cognitive Linguistics (AFLiCo) is pleased to 
launch a call for contributions to their on-line, peer-reviewed journal 
CogniTextes. The journal is a forum for scientific exchange among 
researchers in France and beyond working in, or with an interest in, 
Cognitive Linguistics.
CogniTextes is one of the first on-line, peer-reviewed journals in 
Cognitive Linguistics. Its editors, and its editorial board of 
internationally renowned scholars, vouch for the scientific quality of 
the journal. On-line access to the full text of the articles is free.
On-line publishing allows articles to include audio and/or video clips 
which the reader can listen to or view without leaving the text. This 
facility is invaluable for illustrating research in fields such as sign 
language or gesture.
CogniTextes publishes articles in English and French. Authors need not 
be AFLiCo members.

MISSION STATEMENT AND SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND
Cognitive Linguistics is an umbrella term for a number of related 
theories including Cognitive Grammar, (Radical) Construction Grammar, 
Conceptual Metaphor Theory, Conceptual Blending Theory, etc. Unlike 
so-called formal theories of language, such as Generative Grammar and 
its derivatives, all these approaches adopt a usage-based view of 
language in that they claim that our linguistic knowledge, from the most 
concrete level to the most abstract, derives from usage. Cognitive 
Linguistics emphasizes the symbolic nature of grammar, which is viewed 
not as an autonomous system of representation, but rather as an 
inventory of symbolic units that organize conceptual content in a 
conventional manner. Each symbolic form thus captures some 
socio-physical or conceptual human experience.
Cognitive Linguistics has something in common with certain cognitivist 
theories developed mainly in France over recent decades, such as the 
Theory of Metaoperations, the Theory of Enunciative Operations and the 
recent Theory of Semantic Forms. For their interest to the wider 
cognitive linguistic research community, CogniTextes welcomes 
contributions that are inspired by these theories, and that explore 
points of convergence and divergence between Cognitive Linguistics and 
cognitivist approaches of the French tradition. As its name suggests, 
CogniTextes also welcomes papers on stylistics and discourse structure 
from a cognitive perspective.
The primary goal of CogniTextes is to provide a publication forum for 
researchers in the cognitive linguistic tradition as represented by the 
International Cognitive Linguistics Association (ICLA), with which 
AFLiCo is officially affiliated. The editorial board of CogniTextes has 
been selected with a view to ensuring both the quality of the 
publication and its relevance to Cognitive Linguistics.
