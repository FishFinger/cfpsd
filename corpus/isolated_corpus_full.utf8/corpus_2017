ENASE 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS
3rd International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering http://www.enase.org

Funchal, Madeira, 4 - 7 May, 2008

organized by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC)

IMPORTANT DATES:
Full Paper Submission: November 9, 2007
Authors Notification: January 4, 2008
Final Paper Submission and Registration: January 25, 2008

ENASE 2008 will be held in conjunction with WEBIST 2008
(http://www.webist.org)

Mission
The mission of the ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) series of working conferences is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to evaluation of novel approaches to software engineering. By comparing novel approaches with established traditional practices and by evaluating them against software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, identify most hopeful trends and propose new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale software development and integration.


Goals and Topics of Interest
ENASE provides a yearly forum for researchers and practitioners to review and evaluate relatively new and original in conception SE methods, practices, architectures, technologies and tools. An important underpinning and assumption of ENASE is that in software engineering "novel" turns out frequently to be just new hype. An objective of ENASE is to reveal any such hype as soon as feasible. This means that ENASE does not exclude more traditional approaches to software development and integration. On the contrary, ENASE endeavors to compare novel with traditional, also to discover if novel is not just traditional in disguise. Consequently, ENASE accepts also papers concentrating on a critique of more established and popular SE approaches.
Against that background, ENASE undertakes to provide fast but careful scientific and empirical evaluation of new as well as more established approaches to software engineering. Of particular interest are experience reports and evaluations (qualitative and quantitative) of existing approaches as well as new ideas and proposals for improvements. The conference solicits experiments, case studies, surveys, meta-analyses, empirical studies, systematic reviews, conceptual explorations, innovative ideas, critical appraisals, etc. related to:

* agile software development,
* aspect-oriented software development,
* agent-oriented software engineering,
* multi-agent systems,
* model-driven engineering,
* component-based software engineering,
* evolutionary design,
* intentional software,
* example centric programming,
* meta programming systems,
* knowledge management and engineering,
* architectural design and meta architectures,
* business process management, engineering and reengineering,
* process-centric paradigms,
* service-oriented architectures,
* application integration technologies,
* enterprise integration strategies and patterns,
* e-business technologies,
* requirements engineering frameworks and models,
* collaborative requirements management systems,
* business and software modeling languages,
* software quality management,
* software change and configuration management,
* geographically distributed software development environments,
* cross-feeding between data engineering and software engineering,
* design thinking as a paradigm for software development,
* formal methods,
* software process improvement,
* metamodelling,
* software development methodologies

Conference Format
There will be full papers presented to the conference by the authors, poster papers available for viewing and discussions, and demo papers available for viewing and related to the demonstrations of software tools and products.

Conference Publications
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, in paper and in CD-ROM support. A book including a selection of the best full papers will be edited and published by Springer-Verlag.
