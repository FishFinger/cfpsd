Meeting Description:

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different
frameworks to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes
of evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and applications of 'deep' grammars to real-world
domains and NLP tasks.

Grammar Engineering across Frameworks (GEAF08)
August 24
Manchester, UK
http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF08/GEAF08.html
				   
This workshop is part of The 22nd International Conference on Computational
Linguistics (COLING-08).

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to
support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world
domains and applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in
significant advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid
statistical/symbolic approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of
large-scale lexicons. The effective acquisition, development, maintenance and
enhancement of grammars is a central issue in such efforts, and the size and
complexity of realistic grammars makes these tasks extremely challenging;
indeed, these tasks are often tackled in ways that have much in common with
software engineering. This workshop aims to bring together grammar
engineers from different frameworks -- for example LFG, HPSG, TAG, CCG,
dependency grammar -- to compare their research and methodologies.

The workshop is a follow-up to the first GEAF workshop
(http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/GEAF/2007/geaf07.html) which
was held at Stanford in 2007.

Paper Topics:
The workshop is soliciting submissions for papers on the following
themes:
1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages.
2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks on promoting or inhibiting modularity.
3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multideveloper
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis.
4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on how to
present grammar engineering work to other research communities.
5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars.
6. Applications of ''deep'' grammars to real-world domains and NLP tasks, such
as parsing, machine translation, question answering, dialogue, generation; with
a focus on how the use of deep grammars can lead to improved performance on such
tasks.
