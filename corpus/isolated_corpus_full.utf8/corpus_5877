Announcement and Call for Papers

ICGL2010: The Second International Conference on Global =20
Interoperability for Language Resources

City University of Hong Kong

Hong Kong SAR, China

18 =96 20 January 2010

http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, =20
knowledge bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the development of =20=

language processing applications that are increasingly important to =20
the global society. Substantial effort has been devoted to the =20
creation of such resources for the world=92s major languages over the =20=

past decades, and new projects are developing similar resources for =20
less widely-used languages. Some standards and best practices have =20
emerged for representing and linking language corpora and annotations. =20=

Efforts such as the =93Global WordNet=94 and the development of =
framenets =20
in multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical and =20
semantic resources across languages, and there are efforts to =20
integrate such resources into general-purpose ontologies such as SUMO.

As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is =20
increasingly important to develop resources in the world=92s languages =20=

that can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with common =20
software, and that contain linguistic information for the same or =20
comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a =20
=93global web=94 of language resources, wherein, for example, =20
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are inter-=20
linked via the use of common categories, or categories that are mapped =20=

to one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked =20
not only to versions in different languages, but also to each other; =20
and common representations enable analysis and use of resources in =20
different languages and of different types within available systems. =20
Interoperability also fosters universal access to language resources, =20=

enabling researchers who have fewer resources for performing costly =20
and time-consuming transductions to have the same capabilities as =20
others.

The Second International Conference on Global Interoperability for =20
Language Resources will bring together designers, developers, and =20
users of language resources, tools, frameworks, and infrastructures =20
from across the globe, in order to:

=B7         assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for =20
resource representation, annotation, processing, interlinkage, and =20
access;

=B7         consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be =20=

used to enable resource accessibility, interoperability and inter-=20
linkage;

=B7         consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) full =20
interoperability, especially with regard to multi-lingual and multi-=20
modal data;

=B7         consider the requirements for achieving interoperability =20
among multi-lingual resources of different types, including corpora, =20
lexicons, knowledge bases, ontologies, etc., as well as the systems =20
and frameworks that enable their creation and exploitation;

=B7         work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and =20=

standards for language resource representation, annotation, and use =20
that will enable interoperability;

=B7         consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in =
=20
order to better enable cross-lingual studies;

=B7         provide direction for developers of resources for less =20
widely used languages;

=B7         promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of =20=

language resources and tools across the globe;

=B7         consider ways to provide central or distributed access to =20=

language resources developed throughout the world.

This year=92s conference will include a special focus on the use of web-=20=

based technologies for interoperability and open access to language =20
resources.

  Topics

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following =20
topics:

=B7      web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-=20
linkage, and access;

=B7      multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus =
=20
on the mechanisms enabling interoperability;

=B7      support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in systems/=20
frameworks for resource creation, annotation,  use, and access;

=B7      existing and proposed standards for language resources, =20
including standards for linguistic annotations at any and all =20
linguistics levels;

=B7      systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the =20
development and use of interoperable language resources;

=B7      evaluation of existing resources, systems and frameworks, and/=20=

or standards in terms of support for interoperability;

=B7      harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language =20
resources, including corpora, wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;

=B7      ontologies for language resources, especially for support of  =20=

multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and multi-modality.

Proceedings

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. A =20
selection of outstanding conference presentations will be published in =20=

a special issue of the journal Language Resources and Evaluation.

Submissions

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in length, including =20
bibliography and any appendices. Author instructions will be posted on =20=

the conference web site.

Paper submission deadline: 15 October 2009

Notification of acceptance: 15 November 2009

Camera-ready papers due: 30 November 2009

Conference dates: 18 =96 20 January 2010
