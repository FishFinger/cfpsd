The Second Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-2005)
The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio
May 14-15, 2005

Call for Papers

Abstract Deadline: April 10, 2005

The Computational Linguistics and Language Technologies Group of the
Departments of Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering at The
Ohio State University are pleased to sponsor the second meeting of the
Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC). This colloquium
offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics researchers
to get together and present ideas and work. It is intended to be
primarily for researchers from the Midwest region, but applications
from all regions are welcome. The first meeting of MCLC was
successfully held at University of Indiana Bloomington in 2004, and
with this second installment it is on its way to becoming an annual
event.

The Organizing Committee invites submission of extended abstracts
addressing any aspect of computational linguistics. As MCLC is
intended to provide a forum for presentation of original research
ideas that may benefit from peer review and discussion, both completed
work and work-in-progress are welcome. Submissions from faculty,
graduate students, and other researchers are all encouraged.

INVITED SPEAKER

Richard Sproat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

- Interested researchers should submit a 2-page extended abstract
 (including references) using the ACL style file.

- Abstracts should be submitted by email to jianguo AT ling.osu.edu or
  xflu AT ling.osu.edu. The abstract should be attached as a .pdf
  (preferred) or .doc file. The name of the file should be the first
  word of the title plus underscore plus your last name (e.g.,
  Firstword_Lastname.pdf). The subject of the email should be "MCLC
  submission".

- The abstracts should be anonymous. In the body of the email, include
  the following: name(s) of author(s); affiliation(s) of author(s);
  the address, phone number, and email address at which the author(s)
  would like to be notified; the title of the paper; the name of the
  file attached; a note indicating your equipment requirements; and
  any additional comments.

REVIEW

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. The major
criteria of evaluation will be the originality, soundness, and clarity
of the research idea presented and the relevance of the topic to the
colloquium.

PUBLICATION

Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited (but not required) to
submit a 4-8 page full paper using the ACL style files for the
proceedings, which will be distributed in a CD. Copyright of a
submitted paper remains with the author(s).

REGISTRATION

Registration will be free, but there will be a small fee for the CD
proceedings.
