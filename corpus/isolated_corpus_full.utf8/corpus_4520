Meeting Description:

42nd Annual Meeting of the British Association for Applied Linguistics
Theme: 'Language, Learning and Context'
3 - 5 September 2009
Newcastle University, Newcastle, England, UK 

Call for Papers

BAAL 2009 will be held at Newcastle University. The conference will be organised
by the School of Education, Communication and Language Sciences (SECLS), and the
Centre for Research in Linguistics and Language Sciences (CRiLLS).

The University campus is located in the city centre close to a wide range of
cultural, culinary, shopping and entertainment attractions, and within easy
reach of railway and bus stations. Newcastle airport is served by regular
flights with low-cost airlines from cities across Britain and Europe.

BAAL 2009 is directly preceded by the UK Language Variation and Change
Conference this year, also taking place at Newcastle University. We are
therefore confident that Newcastle will provide a memorable and inspiring
conference experience.

Plenary Speakers:
David Crystal (Bangor University)
Bethan Benwell (University of Stirling) & Elizabeth Stokoe (Loughborough
University) 
Pauline Rea-Dickins (University of Bristol)

Abstracts are welcome in any area of Applied Linguistics that fits within the
theme of the conference - "Language, Learning and Context". This theme includes
papers that focus squarely on language, learning, or context, or any combination
of the three.

Deadline for Receipt of Abstracts: 31 March 2009

Please go to the BAAL conferences webpage to submit your abstract and follow the
steps below (this works best in Internet Explorer 5.5 or better):
http://www.baal.org.uk/confs.htm.

1. Click on 'submit an abstract to BAAL2009 here' and register with the system.
Make sure to save your details in case you want to amend your submission later.
You will be sent an e-mail about successful registration and submission
guidelines, the latter of which you are free to ignore if you are familiar with
online abstract submission.

2. Go back to the abstract submission page, log in to the submission system and
start the submission process (you will have to answer a maximum of ten
questions). An e-mail confirmation of receipt of abstract will be sent to you
immediately. Your contact details will be included in the book of abstracts
unless you opt out during the submission process.

If you are unable to submit your abstract online, contact Erik Schleef at
Erik.Schleef@manchester.ac.uk.

Format:
-Title in Times New Roman 12 (no caps, no bold print)
-Text 300 words maximum (including references, if any)
-Times New Roman 12
-Align text left, single-spaced
-Do not use any special fonts, such as bold print or caps (italics fine)
-Do NOT add tables, photos, or diagrams to your abstract
-Do NOT indent your paragraphs, leave one space between paragraphs instead

Abstract Type:
Indicate the type of abstract that you are submitting during the submission
process: individual presentation, poster, SIG presentation, or colloquium.

-Individual presentation for the parallel sessions. Individual papers have 25
minutes: 20 for the presentation, 5 for questions.

- Poster. We strongly encourage the submission of abstracts for posters. We aim
to raise the profile of posters at our conference since we value them as equal
to other forms of presentation, and we believe that they tend to receive more
feedback than individual papers. All posters will be listed in the book of
abstracts, and there will be a dedicated area and time slot for discussion of
poster presentations. There will also be a prize for best poster displayed at
the conference. The winner will receive Â£50 and a book.

- Presentation for a Special Interest Group (SIG) track. If you believe your
paper is of interest to a SIG track, you may want to submit it to one of the SIG
tracks (all individuals, whether or not officially SIG members, are eligible).
The SIG may then wish to include your paper in a track at the annual meeting.
Submitting your abstract to a SIG track may or may not lead to your paper being
included in a SIG track and has no impact on abstract acceptance to the
conference. BAAL has eight Special Interest Groups. They are UK Linguistic
Ethnography Forum, Corpus Linguistics, Psycholinguistics, Multimodality,
Language Learning and Teaching, Language in Africa, Gender and Language, and
Vocabulary Studies.

- Proposed colloquium paper. Colloquium introduction and individual papers
within the colloquium must be submitted separately, due to technical
constraints. The organiser of the colloquium should first submit colloquium
title and introduction along with an overview of paper titles in the colloquium
(max 450 words). The paper abstracts of the colloquium should then be submitted
by the organiser one by one, entitled "Paper X of colloquium title: paper title"
followed by the abstract (max 300 words per abstract). Colloquia have half a day
and a minimum of four papers. Colloquia proposers should plan their half day in
four slots, in step with the individual paper slots. If they wish to have a
larger number of papers, they may fit two papers into what would normally be a
single slot. Colloquia papers should cohere. The order of the papers should not
be changed after acceptance.

Scholarships:
During the abstract submission process, you will be asked to indicate whether
you want to apply for a scholarship. If so, choose the scholarship you want to
apply for and write a short paragraph (max. 200 words) explaining why you are
applying for one of the scholarships.

BAAL offers ten UK student scholarships to postgraduate students based in the
UK. The scholarships cover the registration fee. BAAL also offers two
International scholarships, one of which is the Chris Brumfit International
Scholarship. These are worth Â£1,000, which goes towards registration,
accommodation, meals and travel.

All presenters have to be BAAL members.
