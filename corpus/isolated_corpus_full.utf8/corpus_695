You will be asked to register with your name, email, affiliation and phone number. Once registered, your username will be your email. During the submission process, please make sure that you indicate for which session (Main Session / Interfaces / Microparametic) you want to be considered. Submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author.
