Meeting Description:

The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting edge
research in discourse and dialogue to both academic and industry researchers.
Due to the success of the nine previous SIGDIAL workshops, SIGDIAL is now a
conference. The conference is sponsored by the SIGDIAL organization, which
serves as the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for both ACL and
ISCA. SIGDIAL 2009 will be co-located with Interspeech 2009 as a satellite event.

In addition to presentations and system demonstrations, the program includes an
invited talk by Professor Janet Bavelas of the University of Victoria, entitled
'What's unique about dialogue?'. 

Call for Papers

Topics of Interest
We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementation, experimental, or analytical
work on discourse and dialogue including, but not restricted to, the following
themes:

1. Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems
Discourse semantic and pragmatic issues in NLP applications such as text
summarization, question answering, information retrieval including
topics like:
- Discourse structure, temporal structure, information structure;
- Discourse markers, cues and particles and their use;
- (Co-)Reference and anaphora resolution, metonymy and bridging resolution;
- Subjectivity, opinions and semantic orientation;

Spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems including topics such as:
- Dialogue management models;
- Speech and gesture, text and graphics integration;
- Strategies for preventing, detecting or handling miscommunication
(repair and correction types, clarification and under-specificity, grounding and
feedback strategies);
- Utilizing prosodic information for understanding and for disambiguation;

2. Corpora, Tools and Methodology
Corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and spoken, text-based and
multi-modal dialogue including its support, in particular:
- Annotation tools and coding schemes;
- Data resources for discourse and dialogue studies;
- Corpus-based techniques and analysis (including machine learning);
- Evaluation of systems and components, including methodology, metrics
and case studies;

3. Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling
The pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e. beyond a single
sentence) including the following issues:
- The semantics/pragmatics of dialogue acts (including those which are
less studied in the semantics/pragmatics framework);
- Models of discourse/dialogue structure and their relation to
referential and relational structure;
- Prosody in discourse and dialogue;
- Models of presupposition and accommodation; operational models of
  conversational implicature.

Submissions
The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers for full plenary
presentation as well as short papers and demonstrations. Short papers and demo
descriptions will be featured in short plenary presentations, followed by
posters and demonstrations.

- Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title, examples,
references, etc. In addition to this, two additional pages are allowed as an
appendix which may include extended example discourses or dialogues, algorithms,
graphical representations, etc.
- Short papers and demo descriptions should be 4 pages or less (including title,
examples, references, etc.).

Please use the official ACL style files:
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/

must provide this information (see submission format). SIGDIAL 2009 cannot
accept for publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published
elsewhere. Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to the General Co-Chairs.

Authors are encouraged to make illustrative materials available, on the web or
otherwise. Examples might include excerpts of recorded conversations, recordings
of human-computer dialogues, interfaces to working systems, and so on.

Best Paper Awards
In order to recognize significant advancements in dialog and discourse science
and technology, SIGDIAL will (for the first time) recognize a Best Paper Award
and a Best Student Paper Award. A selection committee consisting of prominent
researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.
