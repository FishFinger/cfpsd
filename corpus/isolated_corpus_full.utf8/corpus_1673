The EUROLAN 2007 Summer School will teach how to seize the difference

words, to know how sentiments and emotions are expressed by authors,
how could they be identified and how to make use of them in writings.
It offers two weeks of intensive study in the emerging areas of
sentiment and opinion analysis complementing deep semantic analysis,
and their applications to discourse and dialogue, next generation
Semantic Web, applications of Natural Language Processing to blogs,
wikis, etc.  Lectures will consist of half- and full-day seminars,
together with hands-on labs to provide to PhD, master or even
undergraduate students in-depth understanding and experience.

The venue of EUROLAN 2007 is the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of
Iasi - the capital city of the historical region of Romanian Moldavia.

high reputation in the scientific community devoted to different areas
