Full Title: Procedural Meaning: Problems and Perspectives

Web Site: http://www.uned.es/proceduralmeaning 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The distinction between conceptual and procedural content, which represents a
new view on other classic characterisations, is a major component of Relevance
Theory. According to Wilson and Sperber (1993:1), an utterance can be expected
"to encode two basic types of information: representational and computational,
or conceptual and procedural -that is, information about the representations to
be manipulated, and information about how to manipulate them."

Research on procedural content has already produced very noteworthy results in
many areas. However, there are still a number of questions that require further
clarification and more detailed analysis. The conference is intended to be a
meeting point for those working on procedural meaning from different points of
view and to identify new challenges that will determine the directions for
research in the next few years. 

Call for Papers

The conference will consist in a limited number of plenary oral presentations
and a general poster session. Papers are invited for 30-minute presentations
plus 15-minute discussion. The conference call encourages the presentation of
contributions in three main areas: theoretical, analytical-descriptive and
experimental.

Within the theoretical focus, enquiries on topics such as the following would be
appropriate: 
- the distinction between conceptual and procedural content
- theoretical characterization of procedural content, its defining features,
nature and status
- the type of units that encode these contents
- the relationship between procedural content and grammatical categories
- the differences between procedural content that contributes to explicit
content and that which contributes to implicatures
- diachronic processes in the emergence of procedural meaning
- the relationship between semantic change and grammaticalization
- the existence of universal restrictions on the type of procedural content that
can be encoded in a language
- the consequences of all of these characterizations for semantic and pragmatic
theory and the interface between grammar and pragmatics.

Analytical and descriptive proposals could be related to any kind of linguistic
unit or aspect of grammar with procedural content, including:
- pronouns
- nominal reference
- deixis
- discourse anaphora
- units encoding expressive or affective meaning
- tense and temporal reference
- mood
- aspect
- modality
- evidentiality
- word order and information structure
- the procedural function of prosody
- discourse markers

Any of the above topics would allow for treatment in experimental terms; thus,
the following types of investigations are equally welcome:
- neurological or psychological research contributing reliable data on
processing effort in the computation of procedural content
- brain areas involved in processing this kind of content and types of
inferential processes,
- computational models
- experimental studies on acquisition of procedural content both in L1 and L2
- experimental studies supporting the establishment or bases of significant
correlations among the different points in the areas of focus mentioned above.

Abstract Submission
Abstracts submitted must represent original, unpublished research. An author may
submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Each abstract will be blind
reviewed by 3 members of the Scientific Committee.
The official language of the conference will be English.
The text of the abstract should fit on two A4 pages, and should not include the
authors' names and affiliations: avoid self-references that may reveal the
authors' identities. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be
rejected without review.
Authors are requested to submit an anonymous copy of the abstract of their
contribution as a .txt, .doc, .pdf, or .odt document through the following link:

- Diane Blakemore (U. Salford)
- Bruce Fraser (U. Boston)
- Thorstein Fretheim (U. Trondheim)
- Daniel Wedgwood (U. Edinburgh)
- Deirdre Wilson (University College London)

Meeting Description:

Bantu syntax workshop- Inversion Constructions in Bantu 

Call for Papers

In addition to the 3rd Bantu conference in Tervuren, to be held 25-27 March
2009, there will be a Bantu syntax workshop on Saturday 28 March. The theme for
this workshop is "Inversion constructions in Bantu", and papers are welcome on,
for example, 
- subject/object reversal;
- thetic subject inversion and expletive constructions;
- semantic and formal properties of locative inversion;
- subject and object agreement in these constructions;
- interpretations and contexts for use of these constructions;
- comparison of constructions or languages;
- in-situ versus ex-situ analyses of the inverted subject.

If you are interested to present a paper in this workshop, send a 1-page
abstract of your talk to Jenneke van der Wal (j.van.der.wal@hum.leidenuniv.nl)
before 1 January 2009, which contains your name and affiliation, and the title
of the paper. Please indicate whether you will be participating in the 3rd Bantu
conference, as well.
