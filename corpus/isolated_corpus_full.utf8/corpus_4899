Interested scholars should hand in a title and short abstract (max. 350 words)

Panel proposed for the ICCA 10
Rose Marie Beck & Christian Meyer

Though still infrequent, there is a growing interest in CA as an 
anthropological, sociological and linguistic method for the study of non-western
cultures and societies. In recent years, it has also increasingly been used by
non-native researchers. With this panel we intend to provide a forum for
conversation analysts who do research in this area. Addressing this issue, this
panel has two general aims: 
(1) First, we intend to provide space for a critical inventory of work that has
been done or that is going on at present. Future projects may also be presented
and discussed in this panel. 
(2) Secondly, as such research is met with particular epistemological
challenges, theoretical, conceptual and methodological gaps in CA resulting from
its overly strong focus on Western societies shall be addressed. Drawing on
experiences from ethnographic fieldwork, the notorious question of context and
contextualization comes into focus again, as well as analysts' practices of
sense-making and reconstruction.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
