TALN 2007 --- First Call For Papers

http://www.irit.fr/taln07/

======================================


The conference Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles (TALN 2007) is the conference of ATALA (Association pour le Traitement Automatique des Langues / The French natural language processing association).  The 14th edition will take place in Toulouse, from June, 5 to June, 8, 2007.  It is jointly organised by IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse -- CNRS, INPT, Université Toulouse I, II et III) and by ERSS (Équipe de Recherche en Syntaxe et Sémantique --CNRS, Université Toulouse II).  The conference is jointly organised with the doctoral consortium RECITAL, (see the separate call on this site).  The conference will consist of oral communications and posters, invited talks, workshops and tutorials.  The main language for the conference is French, but submissions in English are accepted for non-french speakers.

The program committee will select two among the accepted papers to be published in an extended version in the "Traitement automatique des langues" (t.a.l.) journal
