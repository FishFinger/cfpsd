Meeting Description:

IPCITI 2009
5th International Postgraduate Conference in Translation and Interpreting
http://www.sml.hw.ac.uk/events/ipciti/
 
We are pleased to announce the Fifth International Postgraduate Conference
in Translation and Interpreting (IPCITI 2009) which will take place at
Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, on 21-22 November 2009.

IPCITI 2009 is the fifth in a series of postgraduate conferences which
marks  the consolidation of a series of international conferences organised
in collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, Dublin City
University, the University of Manchester and Heriot-Watt University. The
aim of IPCITI 2009 is to promote greater participation in translation and
interpreting research and address salient issues in the field, and to
promote a supportive environment in which young researchers can exchange
ideas on current themes and issues in Translation Studies.  

Because our event is intended for all students from the discipline of
translation and interpreting studies, we have chosen to keep it widely
focused so that delegates are invited to submit abstracts from ALL areas
relating to translation and interpreting studies.

Keynote Speakers
Prof. Christina Schaeffner Professor of translation studies at Aston
University in Birmingham, UK. She is the Aston representative on the
National Network for Translation, and a member of the EMT expert group set
up by the Directorate General for Translation (DGT) of the European
Commission. For several years, she has also been a member of the
international CETRA staff (annual summer school for PhD students in
translation studies). 

First Call for Abstracts

Conference Aims
This two-day conference is designed to give translation and interpreting
postgraduates from ALL research areas an opportunity to present and discuss
their research in an informal and intellectually stimulating setting.

Key Dates
Abstracts must be received by Friday, 31st July 2009
Notification of acceptance: Tuesday, 15th September 2009

Fee 
TBA (payable on registration day)

Abstract Submission Guidelines
As with most conferences, it is inevitable that more abstracts will be
submitted than may ultimately be accepted. Here are a few guidelines to
those of you wishing to submit abstracts so that you maximise your chances
of acceptance: 

- Bear in mind that there is a 300-word limit for abstracts being submitted
for consideration by the organising committee. Thus abstracts which exceed
this limit will be less likely to be accepted. Abstracts should be sent to
ipciti2009@gmail.com
- If you are not a native speaker of English, it might be a good idea to
have someone who is proficient in written academic English read your
abstract before submission. Abstracts which are poorly or unclearly written
are obviously more likely to create a negative impression. 
- Try to avoid providing irrelevant background detail with your abstract.
If, for example, the paper you are proposing is concerned with analysing
French translations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, avoid opening by
emphasising how important and difficult literary translation is - just get
straight into providing a brief and succinct account of the analysis of the
Romeo and Juliet translation which will be the subject of your paper. Bear
in mind that the people who will be reading your abstract will all be very
familiar with the main trends and terminology in Translation Studies. 
- By all means you may include footnotes and bibliographic references with
your abstract. 
- To save us contacting you again later, it would be a good idea for you to
include your name, e-mail address, institutional affiliation (i.e. details
of the school or department at the college or university where you are
studying) and a brief account (up to about 100 words) of your research
interests, projects you are working on, and notable publications.

Abstract should include only:
1. The title of the paper
2. A list of 3-5 key words describing the area and focus of the paper
3. The research focus
4. The research methodology
5. A brief summary of findings (if applicable)
6. A short list of key references
Please note: 300-word limit does not include points (1), (2) and (6).

Paper Submission
We also welcome paper submissions by IPCITI 2009 participants. However,
only selected papers will be published in a special issue of 'New voices in
Translation Studies', a refereed electronic journal co-sponsored by the
International Association for Translation and Intercultural Studies (IATIS)
and the Centre for Translation and Textual Studies (CTTS) at Dublin City
University. For paper submission guidelines, please see:
