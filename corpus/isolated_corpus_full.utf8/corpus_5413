John Benjamins Publishing announces a new journal to be published in 2010.
 
Chinese Language and Discourse
An International and Interdisciplinary Journal
Edited by K. K. Luke, Hongyin Tao and Li Wei
Nanyang Technological University & University of Hong Kong /
University of California, Los Angeles / University of London
 
A peer reviewed journal which seeks to publish original work on Chinese and
related languages, with a focus on current topics in Chinese discourse
studies. The notion of discourse is a broad one, emphasizing an empirical
orientation and encompassing such linguistic fields as language and
society, language and culture, language and social interaction, discourse
and grammar, communication studies, and contact linguistics. Special
emphasis is placed on systematic documentation of Chinese usage patterns
and methodological innovations in explaining Chinese and related languages
from a wide range of functionalistic perspectives, including, but not
limited to, those of Conversation Analysis, sociolinguistics, corpus
linguistics, grammaticalization, cognitive linguistics, typological and
comparative studies. The journal also publishes review articles as well as
discussion topics. Exchanges of research views between authors and readers
are also encouraged.
