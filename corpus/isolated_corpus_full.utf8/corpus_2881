  The 4th International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC'08)
      The 5th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and
                     Knowledge Discovery (FSKD'08)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

                25-27 August 2008, Jinan, China

       *** Extended Submission Deadline: 10 April 2008 ***

          Call for Papers, Invited Sessions & Sponsorship

The joint ICNC'08-FSKD'08 will be held in Jinan, China. Jinan is the
capital of Shandong Province, which is known for the home of Confucius,
the Taishan Mountain, and the Baotu Spring.

ICNC'08-FSKD'08 aims to provide an international forum for scientists
and researchers to present the state of the art of intelligent methods
inspired from nature, including biological, ecological, and physical
systems, with applications to data mining, manufacturing, design, and
more. It is an exciting and emerging interdisciplinary area in which a
wide range of techniques and methods are being studied for dealing with
large, complex, and dynamic problems.

Previously, the joint conferences in 2005, 2006 and 2007 each attracted
over 3000 submissions from more than 30 countries.

All accepted papers will appear in conference proceedings published by
the IEEE and will be indexed by both EI and ISTP. Furthermore, extended
versions of selected papers will be published in a special issue of
Soft Computing: An International Journal (SCI indexed).

To promote international participation of researchers from outside the
country/region where the conference is held (i.e., China), foreign
experts are encouraged to propose invited sessions.  Each invited
session should have at least 4 papers. Invited session organizers will
solicit submissions, conduct reviews and recommend accept/reject
decisions on the submitted papers. All invited session organizers will
be acknowledged in the conference proceedings. Each invited session
proposal should include the following information: (1) the name(s) and
contact information of invited session organizer(s); (2) the title and
a short synopsis of the invited session. Please send your proposal to
nc2008@sdu.edu.cn

For more information, visit the conference web page. If you have any
questions after visiting the conference web page, please email the
secretariat at nc2008@sdu.edu.cn

Join us at this major event in historic Jinan !!!
