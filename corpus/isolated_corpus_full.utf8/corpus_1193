Full Title: 'Manner' in the Theory of Language

Location: Tampere, Finland 
Contact Person: Urpo Nikanne
Meeting Email: manner-organizers (at) helsinki.fi

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 16-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

Call for Papers
The Linguistic Association of Finland is organizing a symposium on
'Manner' in the Theory of Language' to be held in Tampere, Finland,
August 20-21, 2006. 

'Manner' in the Theory of Language
Symposium to be held in Tampere, August 20-21, 2007

The purpose of the symposium is to concentrate on the theoretical issues
concerning the category/feature 'Manner' in different linguistic theories and
different domains of language meaning, structure, and use. We invite papers
addressing theoretical questions as well as papers taking a specific (empirical)
viewpoint on one (or more) particular language(s).

Manner is a category that comes up in various parts of language description:
syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse studies, phonology, prosody research,
etc. Manner is used often as a feature that makes two otherwise similar
categories different from each other. However, it is not always clear what kinds
of phenomena count as 'manner.' For instance, the adverbs of manner can refer to
many different kinds of phenomena which seem to have nothing in common. Thus, it
is worth taking a closer look to 'manner' in order to come up to a treatment of
the various phenomena that are called 'manner'.

Irrespective of the theoretical framework, the treatment of 'manner' is a
relevant topic. In the symposium, different linguists can learn from each
other's ideas of how to treat the phenomena called 'manner' in a way that helps
us to really understand it better.


Problems concerning the topic are for instance the following:

- Is 'manner' one category/feature or many?
- How are ''manner-phenomena'' lexicalized/grammaticalized in different
languages?
- What is the proper description of 'manner' for different linguistic
phenomena?
- Should the linguistic category of 'manner' be restricted to
semantico-grammatical phenomena; how to treat such notions as e.g.
'style' or 'mode' with respect to 'manner'?

We encourage contributions broadly from diverse areas of linguistics, including
traditional theoretical linguistics, experimental psycholinguistics, linguist
working on spoken language, historical linguistics, grammar, constructions,
text, etc.
