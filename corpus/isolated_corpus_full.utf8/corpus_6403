Full Title: Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2009 

Call for Papers - Journal of NCOLCTL 
(deadline extended until November 30, 2009)

The Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught
Languages(NCOLCTL) is soliciting articles for publication. As the official
journal of the Council, the journal serves the professional interests of
teachers, 
researchers, and administrators of less commonly taught languages in all
settings and all levels of instruction. The Journal is refereed and
published once a year.

Our general editorial focus is on policy, education, programs, advocacy,
and research in the field of less commonly taught languages (all foreign 
languages except English, French, German, and Spanish). The envisaged
segmentation of the Journal is as follows:

a. Methodology and Technology,
b. Academia,
c. Beyond Academia,
d. Social Embeddedness

The first section shall include papers focusing on broader theoretical and
technological issues in all fields of less commonly taught languages. The 
second section will encompass reports about research and teaching in
academia, at both K-12 and collegiate levels. The third section shall
comprise papers addressing research and teaching in government and
industry. Finally, the fourth section will address the issues of a broader
social environment, ranging from heritage communities to advancing LCTLs in
federal initiatives and legislation.

In preparing the manuscript, please use the latest edition of the
Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), see
http://flash1r.apa.org/apastyle/basics/index.htm. Manuscripts should be a
maximum of 25 pages (excluding references, charts, notes, etc.) and
preferably submitted electronically via email attachment. Double-space the
manuscript throughout, including notes, references, and tables, using
12-point font with a 1.5 inch left margin. The manuscript should be
accompanied by a 150 word (or less) abstract and a cover sheet containing
the manuscript title, name, address, office and home telephone numbers, fax
number, email address, and full names and institutions of each author. 
Because the manuscript will be blind reviewed, identifying information
should be on the cover sheet only, and not appear in the manuscript.

While submissions are welcome at any point, only papers received by
November 30, 2009 will be considered for the 2010 issue of the Journal.
