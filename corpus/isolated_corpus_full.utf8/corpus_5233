Meeting Description:

Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems 2009 
13th-14th September, at Queen Mary University of London 

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems (YRRSDS) is an annual
workshop designed for post-graduate students, post-docs and junior researchers
working in research related to spoken dialog systems in both academia and
industry. The roundtable provides an open forum where participants can discuss
their research interests, current work and future plans. The workshop has three
main goals: 
- To offer an interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about current issues
in spoken dialog systems research 
- To provide young researchers with career advice from senior researchers and
professionals from both academic and industrial backgrounds 
- To develop a stronger international network of young researchers working in
the field. 

Call for Papers and Participation 

Topics and Sessions

Potential roundtable discussion topics include: best practices for conducting
and evaluating user studies of spoken dialog systems, the prosody of
conversation, methods of analysis for dialog systems, conversational agents
and virtual characters, cultural adaptation of dialog strategies, and user
modelling.

YRRSDS'09 will feature: 
- A senior researcher panel (both academia and industry) 
- A demo and poster session 
- A special session on frameworks and grand challenges for dialog system evaluation 
- A special session on EU projects related to spoken dialog systems.

Previous workshops were held in Columbus (ACL 2008), Antwerp (INTERSPEECH 2007),
Pittsburgh (INTERSPEECH 2006) and Lisbon (INTERSPEECH 2005).

Workshop Date
YRRSDS'09 will take place on September 13th and 14th, 2009 (immediately after
Interspeech and SIGDial 2009).

Workshop Location
The 2009 YRRSDS will be held at Queen Mary University of London, one of the UK's
leading research-focused higher education institutions. Queen Mary's Mile End
campus began life in 1887 as the People's Palace, a philanthropic endeavour to
provide east Londoners with education and social activities, and is located in
the heart of London's vibrant East End.

Grants
We are negotiating with ISCA and other supporters the possibility of offering a
limited number of travel grants to students. 

Endorsements
SIGDial, ISCA, Dialogs on Dialogs

Sponsors
Orange, Microsoft Research, AT&T

Submission Process
Participants will be asked to submit a 2-page position paper based on a template
provided by the organising committee. In their papers, authors will include a
short biographical sketch, a brief statement of research interests, a
description of their research work, and a short discussion of what they believe
to be the most significant and interesting issues in spoken dialog systems
today and in the near future. Participants will also provide three suggestions
for discussion topics. 

Workshop attendance will be limited to 50 participants. Submissions will be
accepted on a first-come-first-served basis. Submissions will be collated and
made available to participants. We also plan to publish the position papers and
presentations from the workshop on the web, subject to any sponsor or publisher
constraints.
