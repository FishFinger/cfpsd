Meeting Description:

Since 1992, the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from the database, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.

As CIKM 2008 will be held in Napa Valley, just one hour to the north of San Francisco, one of the goals of the conference is to embrace the innovative spirit of the Bay Area/Silicon Valley in bridging further the academic-commercial gap in the database, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities. To help achieve this goal, we will have a series of invited speakers and an industry day (separate from the industry research track) where luminaries, primarily from industry and from the VC (Venture Capital) community, will provide insights on how DB/IR/KM technologies are/can be leveraged to make a billion-dollar success.
