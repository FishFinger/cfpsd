Meeting Description:

Workshop on the foundations of language comparison: Human universals as
constraints on language diversity (to be held as part of the 30th annual meeting
of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS), Bamberg, Germany,
27-29 February 2008)

Organizers:
Dietmar Zaefferer (Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich)
David Poeppel (University of Maryland)

Information on the Workshop:

Language comparison presupposes comparability, and this in turn presupposes the
common denominator of definitional universals. The idea of this workshop is to
look both within and beyond the field of linguistics to find out about the
underpinnings of linguistic universals, both of the definitional variety (What
makes the cluster of phenomena defined by the notion of language coherent?) as
well as and especially of the empirical kind (Which non-definitional features
cluster around the definitional properties and why?). To do this it is necessary
to determine the place of linguistic universals among the human universals
(Brown 1991). Since the latter concern both the human body with its brain and
mind, and the cultures and societies it lives in (Enfield and Levinson 2006),
contributions are invited from all relevant fields: biology, neuroscience,
cognitive science, anthropology, sociology, philosophy and last, but not least,
linguistics. Chomsky (2004) is certainly right in assuming that genetic
endowment, experience, and language independent principles of efficient
computation contribute to language development in the individual, but it is
rather controversial (a) what the genetic endowment consists of, (b) how these
factors interact in the individual, and (c) how the individual mind participates
in the shared, i.e. distributed and collective, mind. Handedness is certainly
part of our genetic endowment, and so Krifka's (2006) proposal that it might
motivate the universal availability of topic-comment structuring is an excellent
example of the kind of phenomena this workshop is intended to collect and relate
to one another. Cultural constraints on grammar as discussed by Everett (2005)
are another case in point. Ideally, the workshop will draw together
contributions from different fields to document the state of the knowledge in
this domain and instigate progress towards a more and more complete picture of
the ways human universals shape human language. 

Topics include, but are not restricted to:

- Biological underpinnings of the human language faculty
- Somato-biological underpinnings of the sensorimotor system
- Somato-biological underpinnings of the conceptual-intentional system
- Neuro-biological basis of human language production
- Neuro-biological basis of human language comprehension
- Social cognition as prerequisite for language use
- Social cognition and ontological universals
- Universals of deixis and the ecological nature of language use
- Anthropological universals and their lexical reflexes
- Social universals and universals of linguistic interaction
