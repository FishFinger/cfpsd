Location: Ghent, Belgium=20
Contact Person: Gunther De Vogelaer

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Sociolinguistics=20

Subject Language(s): Dutch (nld)

Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2009=20

Meeting Description:

In this workshop we hope to provide an overview of the more recent developm=
ents in the field, thereby focusing on the following three issues:=20

1. Methodological innovations: since the 1990s, new, mainly quantitative me=
thods have been introduced to measure the effect of the relevant factors (s=
ee, e.g., Britain 2002 for geographical mobility; Gooskens 2007 for intelli=
gibility), yielding more precise estimates on the weight of each of the all=
eged factors.

2. Theoretical innovations: the fact that regiolectization phenomena have b=
een described for a large number of European languages (e.g., Auer 2005; Au=
er, Hinskens & Kerswill eds. 2005) allows for cross-linguistic comparison, =
which should, in turn, facilitate language-independent theorizing on the na=
ture of the factors in regiolectization.

3. Broader empirical coverage: the past decade has witnessed the emergence =
of a wealth of empirical data, such as new dialect atlases for Dutch phonol=
ogy, morphology and syntax, and the Corpus of Spoken Dutch. These new data =
allow a considerable refinement of the current theories, as well as a prope=
r description of the developments that have occurred the past 10-20 years, =
including the rise of new, regionally flavoured varieties of Standard Dutch=
 (e.g. Poldernederlands in the Netherlands, 'tussentaal' in Flanders).=20

Invited Speakers:

The following invited speakers have confirmed their participation:
Peter Auer (Freiburg)
David Britain (Essex)
Frans Hinskens (Meertens Institute / Vrije Universiteit)
J=FCrgen-Erich Schmidt and Roland Kehrein (Marburg)

The Organizing Committee:

Sjef Barbiers (Meertens Institute - University of Utrecht)
Luk Draye (University of Leuven)
Gunther De Vogelaer (FWO-Flanders - Ghent University)
Magda Devos (Ghent University)
Wilbert Heeringa (Meertens Institute)
Roeland van Hout (Radboud University Nijmegen)

Venue:

The workshop will take place in Ghent, in the 'Royal Academy for Dutch=20
Linguistics and Literature' (or 'Koninklijke Academie voor Nederlandse Taal=
- en=20
Letterkunde' (KANTL)), Koningstraat 18 (i.e. in the historical centre of th=
e=20
city). Anyone in need of accommodation for the night may contact the organi=
zers=20
(gunther.devogelaer@ugent.be).=20

Call for Papers:

As in many European languages, traditional dialects in the Low Countries ar=
e shifting towards regiolects, i.e. non-standard vernacular varieties chara=
cterizing a region rather than a specific locality. For Dutch, the relevant=
 developments have been described in the 1990s (e.g., by Hoppenbrouwers 199=
0 and Hinskens 1996 for the Netherlands, and by Vandekerckhove 2000 for Fla=
nders; see also Hinskens, Hoppenbrouwers & Taeldeman, eds. 1993). The main =
factors in regiolectisation include both sociological and linguistic ones, =
such as an increased social and geographical mobility on the language user'=
s part, changing attitudes towards dialects and standard languages, intelli=
gibility differences between dialects and standard languages, and tendencie=
s towards simplification in situations of dialect contact (where 'koineizat=
ion' is observed).

While the workshop centers on the Dutch language area, we also welcome cont=
ributions targeting other areas. To participate, send your one-page abstrac=
t (including references) to gunther.devogelaer@ugent.be or wilbert.heeringa=
@meertens.knaw.nl, to arrive no later than July, 15. Talks are 20 min. (+ 1=
0 min. discussion). Decisions on the acceptance of the abstract can be expe=
cted before September, 1. A selection of papers will appear as a theme issu=
e of Taal & Tongval (http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/taalentongval/).
