Meeting Description:

Invited Speakers:

Leora Bar El (SOAS-London)
Ekkehard König (FU Berlin)

The Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality will take place on November 9th -
10th, 2007, in Paris. It is organized by the project 'Distributive dependencies:
nominal and verbal plurality' (CNRS, Fédération TUL). 

This project explores the parallels and interactions between the nominal and the
verbal domain by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality, and its
morpho-syntactic manifestations across languages.

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of plurality
are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of event
plurality and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals,
distributivity, 'pluractionals', plural nominalizations) and the nature of
cross-categorial plurality markers.
