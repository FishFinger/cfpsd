Full Title: Grammar Engineering Across Frameworks 
Short Title: GEAF 

Date: 24-Aug-2008 - 24-Aug-2008
Location: Manchester, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Tracy Holloway King
Web Site: http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF08/GEAF08.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 05-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes of
evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and applications of 'deep' grammars to real-world
domains and NLP tasks. 

2nd Call for Papers

Grammar Engineering across Frameworks (GEAF08)
August 24
Manchester, UK
http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF08/GEAF08.html

This workshop is part of The 22nd International Conference on Computational
Linguistics (COLING-08).

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to
support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world
domains and applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in
significant advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid
statistical/symbolic approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of
large-scale lexicons. The effective acquisition, development, maintenance and
enhancement of grammars is a central issue in such efforts, and the size and
complexity of realistic grammars makes these tasks extremely challenging;
indeed, these tasks are often tackled in ways that have much in common with
software engineering. This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers
from different frameworks -- for example LFG, HPSG, TAG, CCG, dependency grammar
-- to compare their research and
methodologies.

The workshop is a follow-up to the first GEAF workshop
(http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/GEAF/2007/geaf07.html) which was held at
Stanford in 2007.

Keynote Speaker:
Professor Jun'ichi Tsujii
Department of Computer Science, University  of Tokyo
Director, National Center for Text Mining (NacTeM), UK

Paper Topics:
The workshop is soliciting submissions for papers on the following
themes:
1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages.
2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks on promoting or inhibiting modularity.
3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multideveloper
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis.
4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on how to
present grammar engineering work to other research communities.
5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars.
6. Applications of ''deep'' grammars to real-world domains and NLP tasks, such
as parsing, machine translation, question answering, dialog, generation; with a
focus on how the use of deep grammars can lead to improved performance on such
tasks.

Call Deadline (N.B.: Extended): 02-May-2008 

The 10th Seoul International Conference On Generative Grammar 

Dongguk University, Seoul

Theme of General Session: Minimalist Explorations of the Syntax-Lexicon Interface 

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the 
general session specified above, equal consideration will be given to papers
from all areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the

number, and (vi) the preferred session (general, workshop, poster). 

Abstracts should be sent electronically as Word or PDF attachments to Hee-Don
Ahn at hdahn@konkuk.ac.kr no later than May 2, 2008. 

Abstracts will be reviewed by readers, and authors will be notified by April 31,
2007. Each speaker of the general and the workshop session will be allotted 20
minutes followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Accepted papers will be published
in the Proceedings of 2008 Seoul International conference on Generative Grammar,
which will be distributed to the conference participants. All presenters will be

possible alterations and changes. Additional questions concerning the conference
can be answered by sending a question to Myung-Kwan Park at parkmk@dgu.edu. 

Workshop: Structuring Lexical Information in Syntax 

The characterization of words and structures and the division of grammatical
labor between them have been a major component of the generative linguistic
agenda. In recent years, a number of grammatical models have been advanced to
defend the view that the core syntactic properties of lexical entries can be
shouldered by various aspects of UG-determined structural templates (see Borer
2005 and Marantz 2001, among others). This view suggests that lexical entries,
in particular, has very limited, if not null, inherent formal properties and can
be just raw material which is pured into the structural mould to be assigned
grammatical properties. Thus, under this view syntactic structures essentially
provide unambiguous formulas for the semantics to interpret. 

In this workshop, we invite papers that deal with the issues concerning this
particular neo-constructionist approach of nominal or verbal projections.
