syntax, and semantics. Submissions in other areas, e.g. psycholinguistics,
neurolinguistics, phonetics, etc., will also be welcome if their theoretical
significance is made clear. Papers are allotted 30 minutes for presentation plus
10 minutes for discussion.

would like to hold two poster sessions.

Abstracts should not exceed two pages, including data, references and diagrams. 
They should be typed in at least 11-point font, with one-inch margins
(letter-size; 8"1/2 by 11" or A4) and a maximum of 50 lines of text per page.
Abstracts must be anonymous and submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1
joint abstract per author. 

To submit your abstract, please go to
