Meeting Description:

'[?] von endlichen Mitteln einen unendlichen Gebrauch machen' - Recursion a=
s a Central Issue in Recent Linguistics (DGfS 2010)

Since Chomsky referred to Humboldt when thinking about the 'creative aspect=
 of language use' as a human-specific capacity and describing it by using r=
ecursive function theory, recursion is a prominent issue in linguistics. Re=
cently, Hauser et al. argue that only syntactic recursion belongs to what t=
hey call FLN (Faculty of Language - Narrow Sense), i. e. that only this fea=
ture of the human language faculty is both human- and language-specific. Co=
nsequently, Hauser et al. are challenged by findings of cross linguistic fi=
eldwork (Everett), by comparative psychology (Gentner et al.), and by a vas=
t amount of literature describing similar kinds of recursion in other cogni=
tive domains than language (e. g. Jackendoff & Lehrdahl).=20

This workshop aims at recursion within grammatical theory as connected to c=
ross linguistics and language acquisition studies. Moreover, it deals with =
neurobiological research localizing aspects of syntactic recursion in neura=
l tissue, e. g. the processing of long-distance dependencies. Beside these =
'biolinguistic' aspects, recursion is also addressed by accounts describing=
 language qua communication and not qua internal computational system. Acco=
rdingly, recursive structures of theory of mind and their implications for =
linguistic pragmatics are also of great interest.

As the workshop aims at approaching the issue multidimensionally, it invite=
s all researchers wondering - like Humboldt - about this gift of nature 'vo=
n endlichen Mitteln einen unendlichen Gebrauch [zu] machen.'

The workshop is part of the annual meeting of the German Society for Lingui=
stics (DGfS) in Berlin from February 23-26, 2010.
