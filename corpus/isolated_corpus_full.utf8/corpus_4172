Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE, CULTURE AND CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONS     
Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA     
24-27 June 2009     
http://www.ManagementConference.com     

The primary interest of the Management Conference is knowledge-based social and economic change. Driven by globalisation and advances in information and communications technologies, this change has been characterised in terms of emerging information/knowledge societies and a global knowledge-based economy.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 29 January 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.ManagementConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Boston in June 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Marcus Breen     
Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA     
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations and the International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations
