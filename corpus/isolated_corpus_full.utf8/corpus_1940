Dear Colleague,

13 October 2007 is the proposal deadline in the call for papers for the: 

The World Universities Forum
Davos, Switzerland, 31 January to 2 February 2008
http://universitiesforum.com

The World Universities Forum was created in the belief that academe must better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus.

All presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed Journal of the World Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the online edition of the Journal.

To submit your proposal, please visit the Submit Proposal link on the Forum website http://universitiesforum.com

We look forward to receiving your proposals and hope you will be able to join us in Davos in January 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Professor Fazal Rizvi
Department of Educational Policy Studies
University of Illinois
Urbana, Illinois, USA
For: The International Advisory Board of the World Universities Forum
