               Coling 2008 Call For Tutorial Proposals


Tutorial proposals are invited for the Tutorial Programme of Coling =
2008,
to be held in Manchester, Great Britain, 18-22 August, 2008
(see http://www.coling2008.org.uk/). Coling 2008 is the
22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics.
The tutorials will be held on the weekend preceding the conference,
16-17 August, 2008.

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of computational linguistics and
its applications are sought. Especially encouraged are
cross-disciplinary tutorials that educate the community about recent
technical advancements in semantic processing, machine learning,
statistics, or data mining technology that are of interest to
computational linguistics, or introduce relevant algorithms and theory
that may be "old hat" to specialists in these areas but are still
unfamiliar to part of the natural language processing community.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

* A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its
 relevance to the Coling community (not more than 2 pages).
* A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
 tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including
 a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are
 available as well.
* The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
 the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their
 research interests and areas of expertise.
* A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same
 or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate
 of the audience size.
* A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g.,
 Internet access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text
no later than 19 March, 2008 to

      pkoehn@inf.ed.ac.uk

The subject line should be: "COLING 2008 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

PLEASE NOTE: PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY REGULAR MAIL OR FAX.


TUTORIAL SPEAKER RESPONSIBILITIES

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by 18 April, 2008, and
must then provide descriptions of their tutorials for inclusion in the
conference registration material by 16 May, 2008. The description
should be in three formats: a LaTeX version that fits onto 1/2 page;
an ASCII version that can be included with the email announcement; and
an HTML version that can be included on the conference web site.
Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials, at least containing
copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the material
covered in the tutorial, by 14 July, 2008.
