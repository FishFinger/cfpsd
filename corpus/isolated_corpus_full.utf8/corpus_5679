Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

Speech Prosody 2010 Satellite Workshop:

Efficient tools for (semi-)automatic prosodic annotation are becoming more and more important for the speech community, as most systems of prosodic annotation rely on the identification of syllabic prominence in spoken corpora (whether they lead a phonological interpretation or not). The use of automatic and semi-automatic annotation has also facilitated multilingual research; many experiments on prosodic prominence identification have been conducted for European and non-European languages, and protocols have been written in order to build large databases of spoken languages prosodically annotated all around the world. 

The aim of this workshop is to bring together specialists of automatic prosodic annotation interested in the development of robust algorithms for prominence detection, and linguists who developed methodologies for the identification of prosodic prominence in natural languages on perceptual bases. The conference will include oral and poster sessions, and a final round table. 

Call for Papers:

The following topics will be considered: 

-Annotation of prominences 
-Perceptual processing of prominences: background of the Gestalt theories 
-Acoustic correlates of prominence 
-Prominence and its relations with prosodic structure 
-Prominences and its relations with accent, stress, tone and boundary 
-The use of syntactic/pragmatic information in prominence identification 
-Perception of prominence by naive listeners 
-Statistical methods for prominences' detection 
-Number of relevant prominence degrees: categorical or continuous scale 
-Prosodic prominence and visual perception

Paper Submission:

Anonymous four-page papers (including figures and references) must be written in English and uploaded as pdf files through http://www2.unine.ch/speechprosody-prominence/page28603.html. All papers will be reviewed by a minimum of three members of the scientific committee. Accepted four-page papers will be included in the online proceedings of the workshop, published on the workshop website. The publication of extended selected papers after the workshop in a special issue of a journal is being considered.
