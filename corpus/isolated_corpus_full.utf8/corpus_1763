Meeting Description:

The second International Symposium on Historical English Lexis (HEL-LEX2)
will be held on April 25-28, 2008. We hope to build on the success of the
first HEL-LEX symposium held in Helsinki in March 2005, which brought about
50 scholars from a number of countries together. This area of research is
increasing rapidly both in Finland and internationally, especially with the
emergence of corpus linguistics as a means of data compilation and
retrieval. The number of publications focusing on aspects of the history of
the English lexicon continues to rise. 

Full Title: 2nd International Symposium on Historical English Lexis
Short Title: HEL-LEX2

Date: 25-Apr-2008 - 28-Apr-2008
Location: Helsinki - Lammi, Finland
Contact Person: Roderick McConchie
Meeting Email: hellex-2008 helsinki.fi

Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2007

The symposium will be held once again under the aegis of the VARIENG Centre
of Excellence of the English Department, University of Helsinki. We hope to
bring together both Finnish and international scholars with a range of
interests in lexical studies, including professional lexicographers,
working on applying and developing new research methods in this area of
English historical linguistics.

The plenary speakers will be
Prof. Dieter Kastovsky, Chair of English Linguistics, University of Vienna;
Elizabeth Knowles, Publishing Manager, Oxford University Press;
Julie Coleman, Reader, Department of English, University of Leicester.

We invite all interested scholars and professional lexicographers to attend and
to submit an abstract. The subject should be primarily an aspect of the history
of the English lexicon, but we also welcome papers of a comparative nature.
Abstracts should be sent to hellex-2008 helsinki.fi by 30 September, 2007.

The proposed venue for the symposium is the pleasantly situated Lammi
Biological Station, a University of Helsinki research facility located at
Lammi, 120 km north of Helsinki. The town of Lammi is well served by public
transport, but we will provide a bus from Helsinki if there is sufficient
demand for it. Further details on transportation, from both Helsinki and
Tampere, will be provided in the next call. The conference homepage is to be
found at

Linguistic Field(s): Language Documentation 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

A workshop on Language Diversity: From the Perspective of Descriptive Lnguistics
will be held in conjunction with the 18th International Congress of Linguists 
(CIL 18). 

Organizers:

Kayo Nagai
ILCAA Tokyo University of Foreign Studies
Asahicho 3-11-1. Fuchu, Tokyo

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on
less-described languages in order to look into various grammatical phenomena
that have been revealed in the course of fieldwork surveys, and to contribute to
the enrichment of typological studies and theoretical linguistics. Most
languages of the world are minority languages that have not been properly
described to date. Theoretical linguists rely on data from such
less-investigated languages and, as is often the case, surveyors approach native
speakers with theoretically biased questions that may sometimes be leading and
can elicit answers which are artificial or in some cases wrong. That is why
exposure to the practice of fieldwork and to the descriptive data of minority
languages is definitely beneficial to theoretical linguists who are looking for some
real-world data, helping them to broaden their cross-linguistic perspective.
This workshop is intended to serve as a forum for field researchers to share
their views on data elicitation, recording, documentation, and other problems
related to descriptive studies. It will also be a place for exchanging
information with researchers working in other areas of linguistics.

Topics for potential papers are not restricted, if the presentation is based on
original primary data. Papers related to methodological issues are also welcome.


Important Dates:

August 31, 2007: Deadline for submitting the abstract.
November 30, 2007: Notification of acceptance.


Form and submission of abstracts:

An abstract (.pdf or .doc file) should be up to 3 pages long, including data and
references. 

The abstract should start with the title of the paper, followed by the text of
the abstract. 

Please do not include the author's name in the abstract. On a separate page,
please give the author's name, affiliation, e-mail address, telephone number,
mailing address, the paper title and the session number (title).

Please send the abstract and the author's information to both cil18@cil18.org
and k_nagai@tc4.so-net.ne.jp.
