                  CALL FOR PAPERS / ACTIVE PARTICIPATION 

               Robotics: Science & Systems 2006 Workshop on 

     "Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction For Getting The Job Done" 

                           Philadelphia PA, August 18 2006 

[ http://www.dfki.de/cosy/www/events/intuitive-
interaction.rss2006wsh.html ] 

* Introduction 

Over the last couple of years, robots have been deployed well beyond
the 
production line. Robots are slowly making their way into our
households, 
and we see practical uses in e.g. search & rescue missions, and 
maintenance in underwater or planetary operations. An important
consequence 
of this wider deployment is that robots are now more likely to
interact with 
non-export users. This raises serious issues for human-robot
interaction. 
Ultimately, the usefulness of a robot will depend on how easy it is
to deal with 
it, to interact with it. Intuitive modes of interaction are thus
likely to be a 
determining factor in how well robots can be integrated into our
working 
environments and lives. 

The purpose of this workshop, organized in conjunction with 
Robotics: Systems & Science 2006 [ http://www.roboticsconference.org
], 
is to discuss methodologies for establishing, developing, and
evaluating 
mission-dependent intuitive forms of human-robot interaction. 

Invited speakers for the workshop include Candy Sidner (MERL, Boston
MA). 

* Call for submissions 

The workshop is organized around a core of invited talks and panels,
to 
ensure a broad platform for discussion. To promote active
participation 
of the audience, we would therefore like to call for position papers
and 
background papers on topics related to methodologies for establishing, 
developing, and evaluating HRI systems. 

The idea behind a position paper is to state what you believe ought
to be 
done, whereas a background paper provides a succinct statement of what 
you have done. The material from position papers and background papers 
will provide the setting for panel discussions, to be briefly
presented by the 
panel chair, with each panel concluding a thematic block of a few
presentations. 

Finally, we would like to call for full papers for presentation. The
idea behind 
a full paper is to relate what you have done to the general questions
raised 
by the workshop: How do we establish what kind(s) of interaction
would be 
intuitive? How do we design HRI systems that are intuitive? And how
do we 
evaluate that they are intuitive? 


For those who just want to attend the workshop without submitting a
paper, 
please drop us a line before the submission deadline! 

* Submission details 

The deadline for submitting papers is Monday July 3 2006. Papers
should 
be sent by email as PDFs to Geert-Jan Kruijff <gj@dfki.de>, with as
