Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Call for papers: thematic issue

Relations between phonological models and experimental data

Over the past decades, experimental data have been used increasingly as
evidence in phonological theorising. The success of the LabPhon conferences
and the associated book series is evidence of this. However, most research
in laboratory phonology eschews the kinds of formal grammatical models used
in theoretical phonology. LabPhon papers tend to be neutral with respect to
choice of grammatical model, or explicitly argue against a phonological
grammar approach. On the other hand, research in theoretical phonology
tends to rely solely on descriptive grammars or fieldwork as its empirical
base. This thematic issue aims to build further bridges between theoretical
phonology and laboratory phonology.
We welcome any contributions that discuss the relationship between
theoretical phonology and experimental data. For the purpose of this
thematic issue, we give a broad interpretation to 'experimental data', so
that it includes data from experiments as diverse as
psycholinguistic/processing tasks (word-likeness, phoneme identification,
lexical decision, etc.) and acoustic/articulatory experiments, as well as
from experiments in which a computational model is tested against human
behavioural evidence. We particularly invite contributions which consider
the challenges that non-categorical experimental data may pose to
phonological models, those which account for gradience in experimental data
and those which use experimental data to investigate properties of the
grammatical theory.

This thematic issue, which will be edited by Andries Coetzee (University of
Michigan), René Kager (University of Utrecht) and Joe Pater (University of
Massa¬chusetts, Amherst), is open to all potential contributors, and is
projected to appear as one of the first issues of Phonology 26 (2009). The
deadline for submissions is 1 March 2008. General information on the
submission of manuscripts can be found in previous issues of the journal,
or on the Phonology website. For this issue, submissions should be sent in
PDF format to Coetzee@umich.edu and Ewen@let.leidenuniv.nl. An abstract (no
longer than 150 words) should be included either as a text file or in any
commonly available word-processing format.
Preference will be given to papers which will occupy no more than 25-30
printed pages in the journal. Submissions will be read by at least two
reviewers and by the editors of the thematic issue.
