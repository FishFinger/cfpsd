NAACL HLT 09 Call for Demonstrations

The NAACL HLT 2009 Program Committee invites proposals for the 
Demonstration Program to be held June 1-3, 2009 at the University of 
Colorado at Boulder.

We encourage both the exhibition of early research prototypes and
interesting mature systems. Commercial sales and marketing activities 
are not appropriate in the Demonstration Program, and should be 
arranged as part of the Exhibit Program. We invite proposals for two 
types of demonstrations:
- Type I: theater-style, as part of the regular program
- Type II: poster-style, where demos are to be presented on 
 table-tops in sessions scheduled for a specific time slot.

Submission of a demonstration proposal on a particular topic does not
preclude or require a separate submission of a paper on that topic;
it is possible that some but not all of the demonstrations will
illustrate concepts that are described in companion papers.

Areas of Interest:

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following types
of systems, some of which have been demonstrated at recent ACL
conferences:
- End-to-end natural language processing systems
- User interfaces for monolingual and multilingual information
  access systems, including retrieval, summarization, and QA engines
- Voice search interfaces
- Dialogue and conversational systems
- Multimodal systems utilizing language technology
- Language technology on mobile devices
- Applications using embedded language technology components
- Meeting capture and analysis systems utilizing language technology
- Natural language processing systems for medical informatics
- Assistive applications of language technology
- Visualization tools
- Software for evaluating natural language systems and components
- Aids for teaching computational linguistics concepts
- Software tools for facilitating computational linguistics research 
- Reusable components (parsers, generators, speech recognizers, etc.)
- Tools that assist in the development of other NLP applications
  (e.g., error analysis)

Format for Submission:

Demo proposals consist of the following parts, which should all be sent
to the Demonstration Co-Chairs. Please use the main ACL paper formatting
guidelines. Please note that no hardware or software will be provided 
by the local organizer.
- An extended abstract of the technical content to be demonstrated,
 including title, authors, full contact information, references, and
 acknowledgements. Please indicate a Type I or Type II demo.
- A "script outline" of the demo presentation, including accompanying
 narrative, and either a Web address for accessing the demo or visual 
 aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams).
The entire proposal must not be more than four pages.

Submissions Procedure:

Proposals must be submitted by February 9, 2009 to the Demonstration
Co-Chairs. Submissions must be received electronically. Please submit 
your proposals and any inquiries to:

Michael Johnston, AT&T, johnston 'at' research 'dot' att 'dot' com
Fred Popowich, Simon Fraser University, popowich 'at' sfu 'dot' ca

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to
computational linguistics, innovation, scientific contribution,
presentation, as well as potential logistical constraints.

Accepted submissions will be allocated four pages in the Companion
Volume to the Proceedings of the Conference.

Further Details:
Further details on the date, time, and format of the demonstration
session(s) will be determined and provided at a later date.

Please send any inquiries to the demonstration co-chairs at the
email addresses listed above.

Important Dates
February 9, 2009  Submission deadline
March 27,   2009  Notification of acceptance
April 6,    2009  Submission of final demo related literature
June 1-3,   2009  Conference

All submissions or camera-ready copies are due by 11:59pm
EST on the date specified above.
