CALL FOR PAPERS

ESSE 2008 Seminar on

Methodological Perspectives on Communicative Functions: Definition,
Identification and Classification

August 22-26, 2008 - Aarhus, Denmark

http://www.esse2008.dk/

Submission deadline: 1 March 2008

********************************************************************

*Seminar topic*

The notion of communicative function is invoked in discourse studies to
define speech acts, genres, text types, and to account for macro/micro
properties of linguistic constructs like their rhetorical structure, lexical
encoding, and addresser-addressee's role-relationships. Yet, it is an
elusive notion, which may refer to: language's role in interaction, a text's
purpose, the addresser's illocutionary intent, an utterance/move's semantic
contribution to a communicative exchange.

*Seminar aim*

We aim to trace a standard characterization of the notion of function by
exploring the relationships between functions and the encoding-decoding of
meaning, and by discussing criteria for the definition, identification and
classification of functions.

*Submissions*

Those wishing to participate in the Seminar are invited to submit 200-word
abstracts of their proposed papers directly to all convenors of the seminar
in question before 1 March 2008. The convenors will let the proponents know
whether their proposals have been accepted no later than 21 March 2008.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral
presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply
reading their papers aloud. The convenors will ensure that reduced versions
of the papers are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in
question. There will be a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar
session, and suitable time for discussion between speakers and with the
audience.
