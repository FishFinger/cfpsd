I am pleased to invite you to submit a paper to the Language and =

Technology Conference 2009, Pozna=F1, Poland, in November 6-8.
Please do notice that the Conference is extended to November 5 by =

Less-Resourced Languages Workshop (LRL 2009) co-organised by FlaReNet =

and Elra/Elda (see below).

We hope to see you in Pozna=F1.
Best regards

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language Technologies =

as a Challenge
for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC 2009), a meeting organized by =

the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz =

University, Pozna=F1, Poland in cooperation with the Adam Mickiewicz =

University Foundation (co-organizer), will take place on November 6-8, 2009.

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for =

computer science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become =

an ever more essential element of our everyday technological =

environment. Since the very beginning of the Computer and Information =

Age these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. The European =

Union strongly supports HLT under the 7th Framework Program. These =

efforts as well as technological, social and cultural globalization have =

created a favorable climate for the intensive exchange of novel ideas, =

concepts and solutions across initially distant disciplines. We aim at =

further contributing to this exchange and invite you to join us at LTC =

in November 2009, as well as at the FlaReNet workshop (LRL 2009) on the =

theme "Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!".

Zygmunt Vetulani
LTC 2009 Chair

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 - 18h00) + cocktail

Theme:
Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the challenge =

of Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is necessary to have =

access to Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT performances. To this =

regard, the situation is very different across the different languages. =

Little or sparse data exist for languages in countries or regions where =

limited efforts have been devoted to such issues in the past, also known =

as Less-Resourced Languages (LRL). The workshop aims at reporting the =

needs, at presenting achievements and at proposing solutions for the =

future, both in terms of LR and of LT evaluation, especially in the =

European, Euro-Mediterranean and regional frameworks. This will allow to =

identity the factors that have an impact on a potential and shared =

roadmap towards supplying LR and LT for all languages.

Topics:
-	Experience in the production, validation and distribution of LR for =

less-resourced languages
-	Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced languages
-	Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in less-resourced languages
-	Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages, language =

clustering...)
-	To be completed...

Co-Chairs: Joseph Mariani (LIMSI-CNRS & IMMI-CNRS), Khalid Choukri(ELRA =

& ELDA), Zygmunt Vetulani (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan)
