Meeting Description:

Second Annual Conference 
Explorations in Ethnography, Language and Communication: Focus on Data
Friday 11th September 2009, Aston University, Birmingham. 

Call for Papers

Following the success of the first annual conference in Ethnography Language and
Communication, we are now inviting abstracts for papers and posters for 2009. We
welcome abstracts that explore the possibilities and problems of employing
ethnographically sensitive approaches to language and communication research
across a wide range of disciplines and topics (including health, education,
social and political processes, culture and identity). The second annual event
has a focus on data and methodology. The selection process will therefore give
particular consideration to those abstracts (a) oriented towards the concepts
and methods of ethnography and (b) providing a clear focus on how these methods
can be applied to the collection and analysis of language data.

The conference is run as a one-day event. Oral presentations will be 30 minutes
in length, followed by 15 minutes for discussion. Dedicated time and space will
also be allocated for poster presentations. Plenary speakers are Professor Jan
Blommaert (Department of Languages, University of Jyvaskyla) and Professor
Martyn Hammersley (The Open University).

Abstracts (up to 300 words) should be submitted by e-mail attachment (Word
files) to explorations09@googlemail.com. Please submit two files, one containing
the abstract and details of the author(s) (name(s), affiliation, email address)
and one containing an anonymous abstract. Under the title for the abstract,
please give four keywords which summarise the paper/poster. In the body of your
email please specify whether the abstract is for a poster or paper presentation.

An optional data-focused workshop will be available to conference registrants on
the afternoon of Thursday 10th September. Participants are invited to submit
data from their own research projects. Those wishing to submit data for analysis
should send a brief (no more than one page) description of the data (background,
participants, method of collection etc), the aims of the research project and
the questions they would like to explore. Submissions should be made by e-mail
attachment to explorations09@googlemail.com. Please specify in the title and
body of your email that this proposal is for the data-focused workshop. Workshop
facilitators include Professor Ben Rampton (King's College London), Dr Adam
Lefstein and Dr Jeff Bezemer (Institute of Education University of London). 

The deadline for submission of papers, posters and data analysis proposals is
Friday 1st May 2009. Registration for the conference will open in June 2009.The
one-day conference fee is £35, including a buffet lunch, tea and coffee, with a
reduced rate of £15 for students. There will be a charge of £10 for the optional
data-focused workshop. Places for the data workshop will be limited so early
registration is advised.  

The conference is organised by Dr. Fiona Copland (School of Languages and Social
Sciences, Aston University), Dr. Julia Snell (Institute of Education University
of London) and Dr. Sara Shaw (Department of Primary Care and Population Health,
University College London / The Nuffield Trust).
