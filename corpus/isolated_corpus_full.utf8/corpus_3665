Meeting Description:

the 2009 conference of the Linguistic Society of Belgium (LSB) 
Lessius Antwerp , Belgium, from April 23rd to the 25th.
This meeting will be devoted to 'Framing: from grammar to application'. 

Call for Papers

The conference wants to stimulate reflection on recent insights and future
challenges for the development of different approaches to framing and frame
semantics. Frame semantics (Ch. Fillmore) arose out of an empirical tradition
and gave rise to fundamental new insights in formal linguistics and the
semantics of grammar. Right from the start, this grammatical orientation, in
line with similar developments in cognitive psychology, led to semantic-role
descriptions of lexical domains and so-called Framenet(s), and it has an
important impact on the study of how discourse sequences are linguistically
structured and interpreted in everyday language or language for specific
purposes (LSP).

The textual or discursive aspect of framing implies extra-textual (domain)
knowledge, thus touching upon genre on the one hand and ideology on the other.
Within the field of lexicography and terminography, frame-based approaches for
the processing and representation of definitory knowledge have been elaborated.
In the social sciences, based on seminal work by Erving Goffman, framing deals
with the analysis of multiple and alternative interpretation schemas active in
the social construction of phenomena, which lead the perception of an audience,
in fields as different as interaction analysis, psychotherapy, and media
language or economic and political discourse, amongst other discourse types. 

We invite scholars of diverse disciplines and working on various languages to
contribute to this conference. Papers dealing with any facet of frame theory are
welcome, including research on the relation between framing and other
(cognitive) grammatical models, language use, and discourse analysis. Papers
will be selected on the basis of their theoretical or methodological import
and/or the thorough analysis of empirical data or specific corpora, both mono-
and multilingual. The conference is open to papers with different theoretical
backgrounds or empirical orientations. 

Issues to be addressed during the conference include but are not limited to: 
- critical assessment of framing and frame semantics, 
- (interdisciplinary) comparison of framing models, 
- the relation between framing and other (cognitive) grammatical models, 
- the relation between framing and corpus linguistics, 
- frames in interaction analysis, 
- Framenet(s) (and the possible relation with Wordnet), 
- the use of framing in particular fields or domains of application, such as -
journalism studies, political science, economics, lexicography and
terminography, communication sciences, IT, medicine or law. 
  
The official languages of the conference will be English, French and Dutch. 

Invited Speakers 
- Hans C. Boas (The University of Texas at Austin)
- Mirjam Fried (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague)
- Jan-Ola Östman (University of Helsinki and Freiburg Institute for Advanced
Studies) 
- Stef Slembrouck (Ghent University)

Meeting Description:

17th Annual Interdisciplinary German Studies Conference
at the University of California, Berkeley
March 13-15 2009
http://german.berkeley.edu/germanconf/

The Threat and Allure of the Magical in Literature, Language, Philosophy,
History and the Arts

We invite scholars from all disciplines to submit paper proposals in German or
English for a conference entitled, 'The Threat and Allure of the Magical,'
hosted by the Department of German at the University of California, Berkeley.
Please distribute widely and forward this email to the appropriate parties.

Thank You,
Ashwin Manthripragada 

Call for Papers

Dating back to the 9th Century Old High German Merseburg Incantations (die
Merseburger Zaubersprüche) and their influence on the fairy-tale world of the
Brothers Grimm, references to the magical boil forth from a wide range of
cultural forms, from Mozart's The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte) in music to
Werner Herzog's Invincible in film. In silent film, modern literature and the
arts, magic both heralded and haunted an artistic revolution in which the
avant-garde and the occult recurrently intersected. In critical theory, ideology
is often described in terms of a spell. Accordingly, this conference presents an
opportunity to explore these cultural encounters with the magical and further
inquire why this space of radical alterity carries such an allure and/or threat.

Thus, we invite scholars from all disciplines to submit paper proposals in
German or English on the questions of the magical and its role in the
German-speaking world. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

-The magical in art, film, music, pop-culture and history
-The occult and the avant-garde
-Nazism and the occult
-The magical in the language of critical thought
-Magic of ideology
-The magical in courtly culture, Renaissance and the Early Modern 
-Linguistic alchemy
-Sprachmagie
-The magical in philosophy
-Magical Realism
-Astrology and Alchemy in literature 
-Magic in fairy tales and folklore
-The weird, strange and the other 
-The living dead/creatures of myth and magic in film and literature
-The language of incantations and spells

Please send an abstract of not more than 250 words with a separate cover sheet
indicating the proposed title, author's name, affiliation, and email address to:

Ashwin Manthripragada/Emina Musanovic/Dagmar Theison
Department of German,

Deadline for Submissions: January 5, 2009
