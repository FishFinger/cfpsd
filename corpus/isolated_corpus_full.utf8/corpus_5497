CALL FOR PAPERS

1st International ISWC Workshop on Living Web: Making Web Diversity a
true asset

October 26, 2009
Washington DC, USA
http://livingweb.disi.unitn.it/index.html


SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP

The large diversity underlying the content creation process of the Web
contributes a lot to the wealth and value of the Web. This diversity
is a consequence of many factors (e.g., cultural background, opinion)
and it has always been largely present in the Web. However, lately it
has been further boosted by the success of Social Web applications. As
a consequence, it has become more and more difficult to get a balanced
view on a given subject using current search technology.
The goal of this workshop is to discuss and highlight the potentials
that are inherent in diversity and that today are only marginally
exploited, as well as the risk of biasing through the
Web. Furthermore, it will discuss research ideas and results -
especially in the area of semantics but also multimedia and linguistic
technologies - that are relevant for enabling "Living Web" Technology,
i.e., technology that more systematically looks into diversity, helps
identifying bias and different viewpoints, and - in summary -
leverages diversity for exploiting its full potential to the Web user.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
- Extraction of semantic information/semantic annotation
- Multimedia annotation
- Opinion mining and management
- Opinion extraction from multidimensional media
- Handling Ontology heterogeneity and ontology mapping
- Context, contextual ontologies
- Diversity aware classification and clustering technology
- Diversity driven information aggregation technologies
- Semantic clustering
- Diversity aware search and semantic search
- Multimedia retrieval
- Event-based multidimensional media management
- Intelligent (information) visualization technology
- Analysis of socials Web data (especially with respect to diversity)
