Meeting Description:

The University of Rouen will be organizing an International Conference on F=
inal Particles on 27-28 May 2010 (FiPa2010).=20

Plenary Speakers:=20

Dagmar Barth-Weingarten (University of Mannheim);=20
Bernd Heine (University of K=F6ln);=20
Jacques Moeschler (University of Geneva);=20
Sung-Ock Sohn (UCLA).

The purpose of the conference is to shed new light on final particles.

Sentence-final adverbials in English are traditionally associated with VP-o=
riented adjuncts, especially manner, time and space adverbials, whereas the=
 presence of clause-oriented adverbials is said to be rare and even problem=
atic in such a position. But the examination of recent spoken English corpo=
ra has shown that they are attested in various dialects of English, such as=
 American English, Australian English, Southern British English and Geordie=
 English, to name a few.=20

Even though it is still an emerging process in English, and more generally =
in Germanic languages, along with Romance languages, compared to the use of=
 these particles in Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, t=
his phenomenon is worth exploring since it contributes to discourse coheren=
ce and cohesion and it partakes of linguistic creativity in language.=20

Call for Papers:=20

The purpose of this conference is to gather original research papers on sen=
tence-final particles in various types of language. A special attention wil=
l be devoted to the analysis of these adverbials in relation, but not exclu=
sively, to the following topics:

- Grammaticalization theory=20
- Information structure theory=20
- Construction grammar
- Relevance theory
- Conversational analysis
- Iconicity
- Language contact
- Prosodic and phonetic features
- Sociolinguistic criteria
- Affect (attitudes and emotions)

Time for Papers: 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for questions.=20

Conference Languages: English and French

Submission Procedure:=20

Abstracts should be anonymous and no more than one side of A4. They should =
be sent to the following address in PDF format: smhttiki@hotmail.com. Pleas=
e include the following information in the main body of your email: title a=
nd name of author(s); affiliation; email address for correspondence; presen=
tation title; 3-5 keywords.=20

Submission Deadline: October 30, 2009=20
Notification of acceptance will be sent to the authors by the end of Novemb=
er 2009.
