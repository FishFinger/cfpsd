************Final Call for Papers - Due Nov 13th!********


~~~~~   Workshop on Common Sense and Intelligent User Interfaces ~~~~~

@ IUI 2007
January 28, 2007
Honolulu, Hawaii

~~~~~~~~~~  Paper Submission Deadline November 13th ~~~~~~~~~

Ideally, computer interfaces will be able to interact with users at a higher 
level by understanding our goals, our problems, and the social procedures by 
which we live. In order for these intelligent computer interfaces to see the 
world from the perspective of their users, they must have access to a wealth of 
information about the world that human users take for granted. This 
information, which forms the basis of goal-directed computer interactions, is 
common sense knowledge.

Common sense knowledge is non-expert and possessed by every person. Thus, 
volunteers make up a significant source of common sense knowledge being 
collected today, and intelligent interfaces help these contributors create 
robust and complete common sense databases. An interactive and intelligent 
environment can guide a contributor to add the information that would be most 
useful to the system and, with good design, can make the knowledge entry 
experience more rewarding for the contributor.

In turn, this collected common sense knowledge helps enable a wide variety of 
interfaces to function better. We're interested in exploring both sides of this 
symbiotic relationship. How can common sense enable computers interfaces to 
better understand their human users? How can interfaces enable the elicitation 
of common sense knowledge?

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Knowledge engineering and gathering of common sense knowledge:

     * Interfaces for volunteers to contribute common sense knowledge
     * Interfaces for verification and consistency-checking of common sense 
knowledge
     * Knowledge elicitation
     * Mining of common sense knowledge from text, and from observation of user 
actions

Adaptation of interfaces using common sense knowledge:

     * Understanding context, affect, and other kinds of implicit knowledge 
using common sense knowledge
     * Using common sense knowledge for understanding user intentions, 
preferences, goals and plans
     * Using common sense knowledge to predict user actions and providing 
intelligent defaults
     * Common sense for debugging, "sanity checking", and dealing with unusual 
situations
     * Diversity of common sense knowledge across different languages and 
cultures
