Full Title: ACL Special Interest Group in Morphology and Phonology 
Short Title: SIGMORPHON 2008 

Date: 19-Jun-2008 - 19-Jun-2008
Location: Columbus, Ohio, USA 
Contact Person: Jeff Heinz
Meeting Email: heinz@udel.edu
Web Site: http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Morphology; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 24-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

This is SIGMORPHON's first workshop whose scope reflects the SIG's new charter,
which has expanded with ACL's approval to include morphology and phonetics as
well as phonology.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
applying computational techniques to problems in morphology, phonology, and
phonetics.  Papers will be on substantial, original, and unpublished research on
these topics, potentially including strong work in progress. 

Second Call for Papers - Extended Deadline
ACL 2008

Tenth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Morphology and
Phonology

Deadline extended: now Mon 24 Mar 2008

Ohio State University
Columbus, Ohio
June 19, 2008

Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to) the following as they relate
to the areas of the workshop:
- New formalisms, or computational treatments of existing linguistic
  formalisms
- Probabilistic models and machine learning
- Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning of linguistic knowledge
- Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or
  diachronic data
- Algorithms, including finite-state methods
- Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology
- Instructional technologies for second-language learners
- Psycholinguistics and speech science (both production and
  comprehension)
- Machine transliteration and back-transliteration
- Corpus linguistics
- Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP
  tasks
- Tools and resources

One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between work in
computational linguistics and work in theoretical and empirical linguistics. Our
recent meetings have been successful in this regard, and we hope to see this
continue in 2008.  Many mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology, and
morphology are now asking and answering computational questions. We hope that
this workshop will allow the CL community to consider their problems, tools, and
models.

This workshop will be the tenth meeting of SIGMORPHON (formerly called
SIGPHON). We will hold a full-day workshop consisting of approximately
10 half-hour presentations.

The workshop will be held on June 19, immediately after the ACL 2008 meetings at
Ohio-State University in Columbus, Ohio.

The workshop website is:
http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/

Important Dates:
- Submission Deadline: Monday, March 24, 2008, 20:00 EDT
- Notification: April 16, 2008
- Camera-ready Copy Due: April 30, 2008
- Workshop: June 19, 2008

Paper Submission:
Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work is
preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should clearly indicate
the state of completion of the reported results. Authors are encouraged to study
the actual form used by reviewers
(http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/review-form.html) to
assess papers.

Submission Format: 
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should
follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and should not exceed eight (8)
pages. One additional page is allowed for the References section.  Thus, your
PDF file may be 9 pages. However, all material other than the bibliography must
fall within the first 8 pages!  We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style
files or Microsoft Word document template that are available on the ACL
conference web site
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html). We reserve the right to
reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size
restrictions.

Anonymous Review: 
The paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

Conflicts of Interest: Authors should mark on the submission page any
program committee member with whom they have a conflict of interest, such as a
recent collaborator, a recent colleague at the same institution, or a close
personal friend.

Double Submitting: Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings
or publications must provide this information on the START online submission
page. Papers may not be submitted to SIGMORPHON 2008 if they are currently or
will be submitted to other meetings or publications and that other meeting or
publication prohibits multiple submission. If SIGMORPHON 2008 accepts a paper,
authors must notify the program chairs immediately indicating which meeting they
choose for presentation of their work. SIGMORPHON 2008 cannot accept for
publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

Submission Procedure: Authors must submit papers online here:
https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS06/submit.html

The submission deadline is Monday March 24, 2008 20:00 EDT. Papers
submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
