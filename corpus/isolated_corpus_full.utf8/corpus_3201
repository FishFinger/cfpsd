Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

GASLA brings together researchers within theoretical linguistics (syntax,
semantics, phonology, morphology), second language acquisition, and
psycholinguistics to present state of the art work providing contemporary
insights into second language acquisition. The conference is devoted to
mentalist aspects of second language acquisition, such as the description of
nonnative grammars, similarities and differences between first and second
language acquisition, and sentence processing by nonnative speakers. Theoretical
and empirical links between second language acquisition, bilingualism, and
language disorders are also emphasized.
