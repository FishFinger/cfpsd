Meeting Description:

Workshop on the status of semantics in the biolinguistic approach to language 

Call for Papers 

Call Deadline Extension: 30-Apr-2008 

Biosemantics: Semantics within the biolinguistic program 

This workshop addresses foundational aspects of semantics within a broadly biolinguistic approach to language, where explanatory accounts to the semantic component of the language faculty (in comparison to the sensorimotor component, or syntax) are still lacking. The workshop's more specific focus is the question of how syntactic structures feed semantic interpretation. It is particularly devoted to the 'elements of truth', such as predication, categorization, and reference. Truth is the basic category and theoretical primitive around which most semantic theories have been built. But only very specific syntactic structures are evaluable for truth: not Noun Phrases, in particular. The origin of truth therefore throws up central questions in the pursuit of biolinguistics: the structure of the syntax-semantics interface and the mapping of syntactic to semantic categories, clause-structure, the theory of categories, the units of computation (phases), the truth-reference distinct!
 ion, cross-linguistic variance in categorization, clause-structure, the growth of reference in acquisition, semantics and extra-linguistic domains, the neurological basis of the syntax-semantics interface, and the theory of predication. The conference is a part of the NWO-funded project on the 'Origins of truth'. 

Please send a 2-page abstract (together with figures, examples and references, font size 12, margins at least 2.5cm) to b.arsenijevicuva.nl, by 30 April 2008. Limited travel stipends may be available.

Full Title: Persistent Conversation minitrack at HICSS 42 
Short Title: HICSS 

Date: 05-Jan-2009 - 08-Jan-2009
Location: Big Island, HI, USA 
Contact Person: Susan Herring
Meeting Email: herring@indiana.edu
Web Site: http://www.visi.com/~snowfall/HICSS_PC.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Sociolinguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 21-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Persistent Conversation minitrack is a yearly gathering of people who design and study systems that support computer-mediated communication. Persistent conversation is not limited to asynchronous textual communication: It includes instant messaging, voice chat, and other 'ephemeral' media. Nor do we limit our focus to systems explicitly designed to support conversation: We are interested in conversational exchanges as manifested in applications (for instance, blogs, annotation systems, distance education) and in sites oriented around the use of photos, video and other media. If you're interested in presenting a paper in the minitrack, the first step is to submit an abstract by April 21, 2008. A 10-page paper would be due June 15th. 

Second Call for Participation

Persistent Conversation Minitrack
Digital Media and Content Track at HICSS 42
January 5-8, 2009
Hilton Waikoloa Village, the Big Island, Hawai'i
See http://www.visi.com/~snowfall/HICSS_PC.html for an online version and further information.

Important Dates:
- 04/21: Prospective authors submit 300-word abstracts
- 05/05: Feedback on abstracts sent
- 06/15: 10-page papers due (see http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_42/authorinstruction.htm for details)
- 08/15: Accept/Conditional Accept/Reject notices sent
- 09/15: Final papers due; at least one author must register for conference

About the Minitrack:
This interdisciplinary minitrack and workshop brings designers and researchers together to explore persistent conversation, the transposition of ordinarily ephemeral conversation into the potentially persistent digital medium. Persistent conversations occur via instant messaging, text and voice chat, email, blogs, web boards, MOOs, graphical and 3D virtual environments, gaming systems, video sharing sites, document annotation systems, mobile phone texting, etc. Such communication is persistent in that it leaves a digital trace, and the trace in turn affords new uses. It permits conversations to be saved, visualized, browsed, searched, replayed, and restructured. Persistence also means that conversations need not be synchronous: They can be asynchronous (stretching out over hours or days) or supersynchronous (with multiple parties 'talking' at the same time). Finally, the creation of persistent and potentially permanent records from what was once an ephemeral process raises a!
  variety of social and ethical issues.

About Paper Topics:
We are seeking papers that address one or both of the following two general areas:
- Understanding Practice. The burgeoning popularity of the internet (and intranets) provides an opportunity to study and characterize new forms of conversational practice. Questions of interest range from how various features of conversations (e.g., turn-taking, topic organization, expression of paralinguistic information) have adapted in response to the digital medium, to new roles played by persistent conversation in domains such as education, business, and entertainment.
- Design. Digital systems do not currently support conversation well: It is difficult to converse with grace, clarity, depth and coherence over networks. But this need not remain the case. Toward this end, we welcome analyses of existing systems as well as designs for new systems which better support conversation. Also of interest are inquiries into how participants design their own conversations within the digital medium -- that is, how they make use of system features to create, structure, and regulate their discourse.

Examples of appropriate topics include, but are not limited to:
- Turn-taking, threading and other structural features of CMC
- The dynamics of large scale conversation systems (e.g. blog networks)
- Methods for summarizing or visualizing conversation archives
- Studies of virtual communities or other sites of digital conversation
- The roles of mediated conversation in knowledge management
- Studies of the use of instant messaging in large organizations
- Novel designs for computer-mediated conversation systems
- Analyses of or designs for distance learning systems

Next Steps:
Submit a 250 to 300 word abstract of your proposed paper via email to the chairs: Tom Erickson (snowfall at acm dot org), Susan Herring (herring at indiana dot edu) by the deadline noted above. We will send you feedback on the suitability of your abstract by the deadline noted above.
