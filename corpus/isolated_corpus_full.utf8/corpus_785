<excerpt>Hi James,


thanks for the report.

Just one quick question about OOT: is it possible to submit without
being enrolled (at the end of a full period of enrollment, of course)
?=20

I'm asking that, because international students start paying fees
after 3.5 years, which is prohibitive for most students--if not all.
Having still the possibility to submit beyond 3.5 years, while not
being enrolled anymore, would be quite helpful.


Cheers,

JP

OOT management

All divisions have been requested to develop a policy for the

management of OOT.=A0=A0OOT is over 4 years for PhD full-time and 2 =

document is not an option - the priority is to look at how to get the

Confidentiality of the annual report

There has been some discussion recently about the confidentiality of

the annual report and so this point was raised by Anders.=A0=A0It seems=20=


that they only reason that you would want your report to be

confidential is if you have a problem with your supervisor.

Remember, anything that you put on this report will go on your file

in HDRU so you will be accountable for what you write.=A0=A0After some=20=


discussion it seems that next year we should be able to have our

section handed directly into the division/HDRU without it going

about who we don't/do want to see the report.=A0=A0At some stage, we =

have to confront the issue with our supervisors, they are going to

While this issue is being discussed, you may want to consider this

flow for dealing with your supervisor associated problem.=20

with your supervisor/s you really should try and sort it out with

them first.
