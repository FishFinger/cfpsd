Meeting Description:

Root Phenomena
ZAS Berlin 
Sept. 2-4, 2009 

Call for Papers

Invited Speakers: Kristine Bentzen, Liliane Haegeman, Caroline Heycock.

In their classical paper, Hooper and Thompson 1973 described root phenomena as
occurring unembedded and under assertive embedding. Unembedded environments
include what would today be unintegrated (Reis 1997) or peripheral (Haegeman
2004) adjunct clauses as well as appositive relatives (see de Vries 2006, Citko
2008). Matrix verbs that allow assertive embedding show interesting parallels to
those verbs that embed indicative (as opposed to subjunctive) mood in Romance, a
parallel explored early for English parenthetical formation in Bolinger 1968. A
helpful recent review of the literature on embedded root phenomena is Heycock 2006.

The workshop is planned as a syntactic enterprise, with a warm welcome to
semanticists. Questions of interest include, but are not limited to:

Non-uniformity of embedded root phenomena (e.g. de Haan 2001), Germanic V2 as a
root phenomenon (Reis 1997, see Bentzen et al. 2007), root phenomena in
non-Germanic languages, modal particles and root phenomena (see e.g. Coniglio
2007), root phenomena and speech acts, more precise characterizations of
'assertive' embeddings, the grammatical representation of root phenomena, the
semantic interpretation of root phenomena (see e.g. Potts 2005).

Please send non-anonymous abstracts with maximally one page of text and one
additional page with examples and references, font no smaller than Times New
Roman 11, reasonable margins, in pdf (or Word at your own risk) by e-mail to
roots09@zas.gwz-berlin.de no later than May 15 2009. In your e-mail, please copy
title and authors. The return address of the electronic submission will be used
for correspondence.

Looking forward!

The Organizers,
Werner Frey, Hans-Martin Gärtner, André Meinunger, Hubert Truckenbrodt, and
Tonjes Veenstra





This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
