AST 2009 - Applications of Semantic Technologies

4th International AST Workshop located at Informatik 2009, Lübeck,
Germany, October 2nd, 2009

http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/ast2009

Organised in cooperation with the Knowledge Representation Fachgruppe of
the German Informatics Society (GI)
<http://fbki.kuenstliche-intelligenz.de/index.php?id=7707> and
the Semantic Technology Institute Germany, STI Germany
<http://www.stigermany.de/>.


==== Deadline for paper submissions: April 26th, 2009 ====



Invited Speaker
---------------

Dr. Peter Mika, Yahoo! Research



Objectives
----------

Semantic Web is a major international research effort with the goal to
make web content available for intelligent knowledge processing. It
draws on standard and novel techniques from various disciplines within
Computer Science, including Knowledge Management, Artificial
Intelligence, Databases, Internet Technology, Software Agents,
eCommerce, etc. The methods and tools developed and integrated for this
purpose  often called Semantic Technologies  are generic and have a
very large application potential outside the domain of the Semantic Web.

Such applications are currently being investigated in various
disciplines within Computer Science, including Ambient Intelligence,
Software Engineering, Cognitive Systems, Corporate Intranets, Knowledge
Management, Bioinformatics, etc. We believe that Semantic Technologies
provide methods and tools which will persist in these and other
application areas for the foreseeable future.


Topics of Interest
------------------

This workshop shall bring together researchers and practitioners who
work on applications of Semantic Technologies. It shall further the
cross-fertilization between application areas and aid the technology
transfer from foundational research into practice. The workshop shall
cover diverse application areas of Semantic Technologies, including, but
not limited to, the following.

     * Ambient Intelligence
     * Cognitive Systems
     * Information Integration
     * Multimedia Data Management
     * Software Engineering
     * Service-Oriented Computing
     * Machine Learning
     * eScience
     * Information Extraction
     * Grid Computing
     * Peer-to-Peer Systems
     * eCommerce
     * eGovernment
     * Bioinformatics
     * Digital Libraries
     * Sensor Web
     * Semantic Web for Life Sciences
     * eHealth
     * Social Sciences
     * Mobile Computing
     * and any other application area of Semantic Technologies


Submission and Proceedings
--------------------------

Submissions must not exceed 15 pages (shorter papers are also welcome)
and must comply with the
requirements laid out under
<http://www.gi-ev.de/service/publikationen/gi-edition-lecture-notes-in-informatics-lni-2005/autorenrichtlinien/>.

Information on how to submit will be posted on the workshop webpage shortly.

Submissions will be reviewed. Accepted publications will appear as part
of a book, bearing an ISBN number.


Important Dates
---------------

     * Deadline for paper submissions: 26th of April, 2009
     * Notification of acceptance: May 25th, 2009
     * Camera-ready versions: June 15th, 2009
     * Workshop: to be determined October 2nd, 2009
