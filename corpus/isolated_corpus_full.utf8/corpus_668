Call Deadline: 10-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

The Faculty of Languages and Linguistics at Georgetown University are pleased to announce that the 2007 Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics (GURT 2007) will focus on little wordsitems such as clitics, pronouns, determiners, conjunctions, discourse particles, auxiliary/light verbs, prepositionsincluding their phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse function, historical development, variation, and acquisition (by children or adults). GURT 2007 will host plenary lectures, colloquia, individual papers, and poster presentations. 

Plenary Speakers:

Jonathan D. Bobaljik (University of Connecticut): Comparative suppletion: 'Least' has More
Thomas Cravens (University of Wisconsin-Madison): Little words: Where they come from and where they go
Katherine Demuth (Brown University): Phonology-syntax interactions in acquisition
Kai von Fintel (MIT): 'If': The biggest little word
Claire Lefebvre (Université du Québec à Montréal): Saramaccan taa, a small word with several functions

Call for Papers:

We invite abstracts for presentations related to theory, history, acquisition, and usage pertinent to the topic of little words. A prize will be awarded to the best student paper proposal.

Presentation formats include:
- Colloquia: Scheduled for 2-hour blocks. Colloquium organizers may organize as they choose, but time should be allocated for opening and closing remarks, presentations, discussion and audience response. Organizers serve as the liaison between participants and the conference organizers. Organizers may choose to participate in the panel as a presenter or discussant. 
- Individual papers: 20 minutes long with a 10-minute discussion period. 
- Poster presentations: displayed for a 2-hour block of time; an opportunity to report on work in progress in one-on-one discussions.

Proposal deadline: November 10, 2006  (acceptance notification by December 20, 2006)
