Call for papers for the conference

LINGUISTIC EVIDENCE 2008:
EMPIRICAL, THEORETICAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Hosted by SFB 441 "Linguistic Data Structures" at the University of
Tuebingen (Germany)

31st January to 2nd February 2008

Aims and scope:

The SFB 441 "Linguistic Data Structures" has been working since 1999
on the implications for linguistics of the rapid increase in quantity
and evidential quality of data types. As part of the SFB 441's effort
to further external links, this conference aims to bring together
researchers from all areas of linguistics who are working on the
closer integration of linguistic theory and linguistic evidence. We
are particularly interested in innovative perspectives on the use and
exploitation of data sources in investigating linguistic research
questions. We therefore invite unpublished contributions which relate
to issues of the empirical base of linguistic explanation and
linguistic theory from all fields of linguistics (including syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, phonology, morphology, phonetics,
psycholinguistics, acquisition, computational linguistics,
neurolinguistics, historical linguistics, typology.)

Papers might concern issues of data collection and analysis, the
comparison and contrast of multiple data types, studies of the
evidential value of data sources, their relevance for the evaluation
and construction of linguistic theory, and studies illustrating the
explanatory insights to be gained.

There will be a special session on empirical methods in syntax and semantics.

For more details about aim and scope of the conference see also the
proceedings volume: Kepser, S. & M. Reis (2005), Linguistic Evidence:
Empirical, Theoretical and Computational Perspectives. Berlin: De
Gruyter

Invited speakers:

Greg Carlson  (Rochester)
Lyn Frazier  (Amherst)
Hubert Haider  (Salzburg)
Rada Mihalcea  (North Texas)

Submissions:

We invite abstracts for 25+10 minute talks and also for poster
presentations. Further submission instructions can be found on the
conference website:

http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/LingEvid2008/call.html

We intend to publish selected papers in a separate proceedings volume,
as at the preceding conferences.

Successful students submissions may be subsidized.

Important deadlines:

Deadline for receipt of abstracts: 30th September 2007
Notification of acceptance: First week of November 2007
Conference: 31st January to 2nd February 2008
