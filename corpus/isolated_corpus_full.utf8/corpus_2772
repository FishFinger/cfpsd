Meeting Description:

The objective of the 2nd MMIES Workshop: Multi-source, Multilingual Information
Extraction and Summarization is to bring together researchers and practitioners
in the areas of extraction, summarization, and other information access
technologies, to discuss recent approaches to multi-source and multi-lingual
challenges. Approaches to handling the idiosyncratic nature of the new Web2.0
media are especially welcome, including: mixed input, new jargon, ungrammatical
and mixed-language input, and emotional discourse. 

Call for Papers

MMIES2: Multi-source, Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization
Workshop 

Manchester, 23 August, 2008

Held in conjunction with COLING-2008 (http://www.coling2008.org.uk/), the 22nd
International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 18-22 August, 2008. 

Workshop Web Site: http://doremi.cs.helsinki.fi/mmies2/

Organisers:
- Sivaji Bandyopadhyay (Jadavpur University, India)
- Thierry Poibeau (CNRS / Universite Paris 13, France)
- Horacio Saggion (University of Sheffield, UK)
- Roman Yangarber (University of Helsinki, Finland)

Information extraction (IE) and text summarization (TS) are key technologies
aiming at extracting from texts information that is relevant to a user's
interest,   and presenting it to the user in concise form. The on-going
information explosion makes IE and TS particularly critical for successful
functioning within the information society. These technologies, however, face
new challenges with the adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g. blogs, wikis)
because of their inherent multi-source nature. These technologies must no longer
only deal with isolated texts or single narratives, but with large-scale
repositories or sources -- possibly in several languages -- containing a
multiplicity of views, opinions, or commentaries on particular topics, entities
or events. There is thus a need to adapt and/or develop new techniques to deal
with these new phenomena.

Recognising similar information across different sources and/or in different
languages is of paramount importance in this multi-source, multi-lingual
context. In information extraction, merging information from multiple sources
can lead to increased accuracy as compared with extraction from a single source.
In text summarization, similar facts found across sources can  inform sentence
scoring algorithms. In question answering, the distribution of answers in
similar contexts can inform answer ranking components.

Often, it is not the similarity of information that matters, but its
complementary nature. In a multi-lingual context, information extraction and
text summarization can provide solutions for cross-lingual access: key pieces of
information can be extracted from different texts in one or many languages,
merged, and then conveyed in many natural languages in concise form.
Applications need to be able to cope with the idiosyncratic nature of the new
Web 2.0 media: mixed input, new jargon, ungrammatical and mixed-language input,
emotional discourse, etc.  In this context, synthesizing or inferring opinions
from multiple sources is a new and exciting challenge for NLP. On another level,
profiling of individuals who engage in the new social Web, and
identifying whether a particular opinion is appropriate/relevant in a given
context are important topics to be addressed.

It is therefore important that the research community address the following
issues:
- What methods are appropriate to detect similar/complementary/contradictory
information? Are hand-crafted rules and knowledge-rich approaches convenient?
- What methods are available to tackle cross-document and cross-lingual
entity and event coreference?
- What machine learning approaches are most appropriate for this task --
supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised? What type of corpora are required for
training and testing?
- What techniques are appropriate to synthesize condensed synopses of the
extracted information?  What generation techniques are useful here? What kind of
techniques can be used to cross domains and languages?
- What techniques can improve opinion mining and sentiment analysis through
multi-document analysis?  How do information extraction and opinion mining connect?
- What tools exist for supporting multi-lingual/multi-source access to
information? What solutions exist beyond full document translation to produce
cross-lingual summaries?

Important Dates:
- Paper submission deadline: 5 May
- Notification of acceptance of Papers: 6 June
- Camera-ready copy of papers due: 1 July
- Workshop: 23 August

Paper Submission:
Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of completion
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality,
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest
to the attendees.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend
the use of the Coling 2008 LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files
tailored for this year's conference 
(http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/harold.somers/coling/style.html).

Submission will be electronic (pdf format only), using the START paper
submission webpage dedicated to the workshop
