Meeting Description:

Linguistic Evidence 2010:
Empirical, Theoretical, and Computational Perspectives

T=FCbingen, 10-12th February 2010

Aims and Scope:

The field of linguistics is growing more empirical, more technical, and mor=
e rigorous.  Linguists are spending more time addressing the evidential bas=
e of their work, developing tools to gather, process, and exploit linguisti=
c data, and testing assumptions and analyses empirically.  There is thus a =
clear trend for most branches of linguistics to grow more related to the fi=
eld of cognitive psychology.=20

The Collaborative Research Centre 'The Construction of Meaning' in T=FCbing=
en (SFB 833) has inherited from the old SFB 441 'Linguistic Data Structures=
' both the organization of the Linguistic Evidence conference series and th=
e endeavour to more closely integrate data-driven and theory-driven approac=
hes to the study of language representation and processing, language behavi=
our, and the interaction of language behaviour with other cognitive functio=
ns and phenomena.=20

Call for Papers:

We invite unpublished contributions on the empirical base of linguistic exp=
lanation, language processing, and linguistic theory from all fields of lin=
guistics. Papers might concern:=20

- The mental and computational processing of linguistic structures at any l=
evel of analysis (syntactic, semantic, phonological, lexical, discourse, ..=
. )

- The application of data from linguistic corpora, psycholinguistic and neu=
rolinguistic experimentation, language acquisition and loss, language patho=
logy, literary texts, fieldwork, and diachronic evidence.=20

- The implications for the representation language structures of data gathe=
red by whatever means.

- The introduction to the linguistic world of data types, collection method=
s, analytical procedures, interpretative possibilities.

The ideal paper at Linguistic Evidence combines both innovative data gather=
ing and a discussion of the implications of the findings for linguistics.  =
In practice, however, interesting papers which make a contribution to just =
one of these are often positively reviewed.

Submissions:

We invite abstracts for 25+10 minute talks and also for poster presentation=
s. Unless you specify otherwise on your abstract, we shall consider all sub=
missions first as talks and then as posters.  We will consider at most one =
single-authored paper and one joint-authored paper per person.=20

Abstracts should be no more than 3 pages long including data, graphics and =
references. They should have a 2.5cm margin on all sides, and should be wri=
tten in at least 11 point font.

Deadline for abstract submission: 19th October 2009.

Please send one abstract with author(s) name(s) and affiliation and one wit=
hout author(s) name(s) and affiliation.  Electronic submission as pdf is pr=
eferred, to LingEvid2010@uni-tuebingen.de

Address for postal and fax submissions:

We intend to publish selected papers in a separate proceedings volume, as a=
t the preceding conferences.

Student presenters may be subsidized.
