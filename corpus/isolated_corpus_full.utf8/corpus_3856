ECSQARU 2009
10th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to 
Reasoning with Uncertainty
1-3 July 2009, Verona (Italy)


2nd Call for Papers: Deadline extended to January 9, 2009


The biennial ECSQARU conferences are a major forum for advances in 
the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty. Contributors 
are expected to come both from researchers interested in advancing 
the technology and from practitioners who are using uncertainty 
techniques in applications. The scope of ECSQARU includes, but is not 
limited to, fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, 
and decision making in qualitative and numeric paradigms.

Previous ECSQARU conferences have been held in Marseille (1991), 
Granada (1993), Fribourg (1995), Bonn (1997), London (1999), Toulouse 
(2001), Aalborg (2003), Barcelona (2005) and Hammamet (2007).

The 10th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches 
to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2009) will be held in Verona, 
Italy, on July 1-3, 2009.


Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
------------------------------------------------
   * Foundations of reasoning and decision making under uncertainty
   * Default reasoning
   * Bayesian networks
   * Belief revision & inconsistency handling
   * Causal networks
   * Argumentation systems
   * Decision theory and graphs
   * Learning for uncertainty formalisms
   * Markov decision processes
   * Automated planning & acting
   * Game theoretic agents
   * Information fusion
   * Belief functions
   * Uncertainty & data mining
   * Fuzzy sets and Fuzzy Logic
   * Classification & clustering
   * Rough sets
   * Algorithms for uncertain inference
   * Possibility theory
   * Empirical studies of algorithms
   * Logics for reasoning under uncertainty
   * Implementation and applications of uncertain systems


Submissions:
------------
The proceedings of ECSQARU 2009 will be published in the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science/Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 
series of Springer. Authors are requested to prepare their papers in 
the LNCS/LNAI format, that can be found at the following address:
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0

Papers must not exceed 12 pages and must be submitted as PDF through 
the EasyChair conference system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsqaru2009

Papers that are not in the stated format or that exceed the page 
limit will not be reviewed. Submitted papers will be evaluated by 
peer review on the basis of originality, significance, technical 
soundness, and clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be 
included in the conference proceedings. Authors of accepted papers 
are expected to attend the conference and to make oral presentations 
about their work. One full registration will cover acceptance of two papers.


Location:
---------
ECSQARU 2009 will be held at the Department of Computer Science, 
University of Verona, Ca' Vignal 2, strada le Grazie 15, 37134 Verona (Italy).

Verona is a comfortable city located in Veneto (Venetia), a 
northeastern region of Italy. It is close to Dolomite Mountains to 
the north, Lake Garda to the west and Venice to the east. The 
historic city of Verona was founded in the 1st century B.C. It 
particularly flourished under the rule of the Scaliger family in the 
13th and 14th centuries and as part of the Republic of Venice from 
the 15th to 18th centuries. Verona has preserved a remarkable number 
of monuments from antiquity, the medieval and Renaissance periods, 
and represents an outstanding example of a military stronghold. (from 
Unesco World Heritage List)
