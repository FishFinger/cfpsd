Meeting Description:

Workshop on the Natural Language Engineering of Legal Argumentation: Language,
Logic, and Computation.
Collocated with the 21st International Conference on Legal Knowledge and
Information Systems (JURIX 2008)
http://www.ittig.cnr.it/Jurix08/

The Institute of Legal Information Theory and Techniques (ITTIG-CNR) and the
European University Institute (EUI)
Florence, Italy
December 10-13, 2008 

Call for Papers

The aim of this workshop is to draw together researchers around the issues of
the empirical analysis, formalization, and implementation of legal argumentation
in natural language.  Such a system would be a decision-support tool which
translates natural language arguments into and out of an argumentation framework
or logic which supports reasoning and inference.  As the interface is in natural
language, the tool would be accessible to a wide range of end-users.  The
workshop builds on recent advances in natural language engineering and
argumentation including:  controlled languages, predictive editors, text mining
and corpus analysis, natural language parsing, ontology construction,
translation of natural language sentences into first order logic, logical
inference, linguistic analysis of argumentation, and computational theories of
argumentation.  It draws on an interdisciplinary community in Computer Science,
Linguistics, and the Law.

While argumentation can be addressed in a broad range of areas, the workshop
focusses particularly on the language, logic, and computation of legal
argumentation such as that found between lawyers arguing a case before a court
or found in legal briefs and decisions where justifications are given for and
against a decision.

Topics of Interest:
- Corpus development
- Corpus analysis and text mining
- Logical analysis of legal language
- Automated parsing and translation of natural language arguments into a logical
formalism
- Legal argument schemes
- Pilot implementations of tools
- Defeasible reasoning systems for the law with natural language interfaces
- Burden of proof in argumentation
- Consistency, inconsistency, and compatibility of statements in the law
- Coherence in legal argumentation
- The identification of enthymemes (missing premises due to presupposition with
respect to common knowledge and shared knowledge)
- Legal argument modification
- The generation of legal arguments
- Linguistically-orientied XML mark up of legal arguments
- Dialogue protocols for argumentation
- Legal argument ontology
- Legal Ontologies with associated lexical information
- Computational theories of argumentation that are suitable to natural language

Submission Procedure:
Each position paper (in PDF format) should be no more than one page long with
references appearing on a separate page.  The position paper should briefly
outline the author's interests in the workshop theme, what specific issues are
being addressed, some review (with references) of the state-of-the-art, what
approach will be taken, the problems foreseen, and how the approach relates to
other approaches to natural language engineering of legal argumentation.

The position papers will be reviewed by the program committee.

The position paper should be submitted directly by email to:

Dr. Adam Wyner
adam@wyner.info

One of the authors of the position paper must register for the JURIX conference.

Presentation:
Each position paper will have 15-20 minutes for presentation.  Time will be
allocated for open discussion.

Important Dates:
Position Paper Submission Deadline: Friday. November 7, 2008
Position Paper Acceptance Notification: Monday November 17, 2008
JURIX Conference Dates: December 11-12, 2008
Workshop Date:  Saturday, December 13, 2008
