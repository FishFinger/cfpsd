Meeting Description:

Identifying & Describing Lexical Borrowings=20

Call for Papers

Lexical borrowing has been a topic of research for many years, from both
theoretical and empirical viewpoints. So far, it has mostly been studied in
connection with etymology, diachronic processes, and borrowability. Conside=
rable
energy has therefore been spent on studying the history of loanwords and th=
e
complex modalities of lexical transfer, on describing the socio-historical =
paths
followed by words before entering any given target language, as well as on
examining the likelihood of lexical borrowings. Nevertheless, these topics =
are
not our primary concern. We would rather like to focus on how words are bor=
rowed
in a given language, starting from very concrete experiences coming from:
1) the practice of editing texts and the hermeneutics of texts,
2) the fields of lexicography and lexicology,
3) historical linguistics.

The aim of this conference is thus twofold: how can we identify and recogni=
ze as
such a lexical borrowing? And how is it possible to formalize this borrowin=
g at
a linguistic level by defining the degree of grammatical integration? To a =
first
approximation, we will define a lexical borrowing as 'the transfer of a lex=
ical
entity from a linguistic system to another one, including inside what is
perceived as one and a single language'. Papers should focus on how a lexic=
al
borrowing is integrated in the host language/norm. As this integration is a
matter of degree, the following various levels of linguistic analysis may b=
e
considered relevant:
- graphemic level;
- word-class status;
- phonetic constraints;
- morphological integration;
- syntactic integration;
- semantic changes.

In this latter case, some attention should be paid to the onomasiological l=
evel,
as this is especially important for the borrowing of non-technical terms, a=
nd
could lead to an in-depth analysis of the reorganization of the semantic fi=
elds
concerned. Also worth discussing is the distinction one can make in practic=
e
(not only in theory) between lexical borrowing, code-switching, and the
co-occurrence of words coming from distinct registers.Ideally, each case st=
udy
should suggest a system of the linguistic encoding that identifies a lexica=
l
borrowing as such. In order to facilitate the discussion, but also to remai=
n as
close as possible to the primary sources, we suggest that the papers focus =
on
the Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages.
