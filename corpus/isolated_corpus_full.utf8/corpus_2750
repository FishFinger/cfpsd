Dear All,

We are pleased to announce the release of the development dataset for =

the CLEF-QA 2008 track =93Question Answering on Speech Transcripts=94 (QAst=
).
We take this opportunity to launch a first call for participation in =

this evaluation exercise.

QAst is a CLEF-QA track that aims at providing an evaluation framework =

for QA technology on speech transcripts, both manual and automatic.
A detailed description of this track is available at: =

http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~qast <http://www.lsi.upc.edu/%7Eqast>

It is the second evaluation for the QAst track.
Last year (QAst 2007), factual questions had been generated for two =

distinct corpora (in English language only). This year, in addition to =

factual questions,
some definition questions are generated, and five corpora covering three =

different languages are used (3 corpora in English, 1 in Spanish and 1 =

in French).

Important dates:

# 15 June 2008: evaluation set released
# 30 June 2008: submission deadline

The pilot track is organized jointly by the Technical University of =

Catalonia (UPC), the Evaluations and Language resources Distribution =

Agency (ELDA) and Laboratoire d'Informatique pour la M=E9canique et les =

Sciences de l'Ing=E9nieur (LIMSI).

If you are interested in participating please send an email to Jordi =

Turmo (turmo_AT_lsi.upc.edu) with "QAst" in the subject line.

Best regards,

QAst organizers.
