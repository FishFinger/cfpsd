Meeting Description

PIONIER Workshop on Locative Case 

Call for Papers

PIONIER Workshop on Locative Case

Nijmegen, August 25-26, 2008

Organized by Helen de Hoop, Kees de Schepper, and Sander Lestrade

Structural case has played a major role in the development of formal
theories of language. So far, however, locative case has not been looked at
in so much detail. The incorporation of the latter in the study of case
might well change the way in which we have to think of this phenomenon. In
this workshop we wish to fill this gap and collect insights from formal and
typological linguistics on the syntax and semantics of locative case.

Invited Speakers

Miriam Butt (Universität Konstanz)
Marcus Kracht (UCLA) 
Joost Zwarts (Universiteit Utrecht, UIL-OTS)

Possible topics of the conference include, but are not restricted to:
- 'case studies' on locative case;
- the relation between locative and structural case;
- the relation to other spatial systems;
- principles at work in the domain of locative case (compositionality,
economy, iconicity);
- non-locative use of locative cases;
- typological generalizations

Submission Details

Abstracts for talks can be sent to s.lestrade@let.ru.nl. Abstracts must be
anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references, figures and
data. The body of the message should include: name, title, affiliation, and
e-mail. The subject of the message should include ''abstract locative case''. 

Deadline for submission: April 1st, 2008
Notification of acceptance: May 1st, 2008
