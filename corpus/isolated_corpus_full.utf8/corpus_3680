        First CFP for the CALICO'09 Pre-Conference Workshop on

          Automatic Analysis of Learner Language (AALL'09):
           From a better understanding of annotation needs
     to the development and standardization of annotation schemes

      March 10 or 11, 2008. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.

                Submission Deadline: December 1, 2008

In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers working on the
analysis of learner language in the broad sense, including work on
annotation schemes for learner corpora and NLP techniques used to
detect learner errors and other learner language properties. We invite
abstracts addressing these general issues, including but not limited
to:

- Which properties of learner language are useful and relevant to
  obtain for Foreign Language Teaching and current Second Language
  Acquisition research?

- What annotation scheme or (error) taxonomy is appropriate for this
  and how do different annotation schemes compare?

- How reliably can errors and other properties of learner language be
  obtained automatically given the current state-of-the art in NLP?

- What is the impact of the specific properties of learner language on
  the (re)use of NLP technology? How does it impact performance and
  the potential use of such technology in foreign language teaching
  tools?

- Which annotated learner language corpora have been used or could be
  used to evaluate the performance of different approaches to
  analyzing learner language?

The workshop is intended to follow up on the pre-conference workshop
on the Automatic Analysis of Learner Language held at CALICO 2008
(http://purl.org/net/calico-workshop).

We invite submissions of anonymous two page abstracts in an email with
the abstract as a pdf attachment. Name, affiliation, and email address
should only be included in the text of the email, not in the abstract
in the pdf attachment.

Send submissions to: calico-workshop@ling.osu.edu
Submission Deadline: December 1
Please use the following Subject: Submission to AALL '09

The workshop is organized by the ICALL Special Interest Group of
CALICO (http://purl.org/calico/icall), currently chaired by Xiaofei Lu
(Pennsylvania State University) and Detmar Meurers (Universität
Tübingen).
