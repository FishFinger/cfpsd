Meeting Description:

Workshop on Language Change: Grammaticalization and Beyond
24-25 April 2009 at the University of Ulster, Belfast, Northern Ireland 

Call for Papers

Invited Speakers:
Professor Ian Roberts (University of Cambridge)
Dr Ioanna Sitaridou (University of Cambridge)
Dr Theodore Markopoulos (University of Uppsala)
Professor Alison Henry (University of Ulster)

Grammaticalization is perhaps the most well researched process of language
change. It is a process that involves the change of a word with lexical meaning
to one with functional meaning, often phonologically reduced to the point of
being an affix. One of the most well-studied properties of grammaticalization is
that of unidirectionality or irreversibility: only content words can become
functional, not vice versa. This property, apart from being puzzling in its own
right, has also affected the way we think of language change in general, like a
process with an endpoint, a specific goal that languages strive to achieve. 

In recent years and more specifically after Lightfoot's seminal 1979 work, and
the 'birth' of generative historical linguistics, more and more phenomena that
are not related to grammaticalization have been investigated from a historical
perspective (word order change, change in complementation patterns among
others). Moreover, there have been some very interesting proposals that try to
define the core properties of language change. Even more recently, language
change has emerged as a serious challenger of one of the fundamental concepts of
the Minimalist Programme, the strong minimalist thesis (SMT, Chomsky 1993)
whereby language is an optimal system at any given time of its history. The
obvious question with that is: if language is perfect at any time, how does
change originate from within the system of the language? Finally, a central
concept in generative linguistics is that of competing grammars that originates
from optionality. Optionality, which is a crucially problematic concept for
Minimalism, is particularly evident in multi-dialectal environments, like
Northern Ireland. Competing grammars are often found in environments with
dialectal variability and can ultimately result in language change. 

This workshop aims at discussing topics of language change beyond
grammaticalization, and papers are invited on any topic relevant to this; we
plan on having two sections with specific focus: one will be on 'Language change
in relation to dialectal syntax.' For this we encourage papers that deal with
dialects from a historical perspective or from the competition of forms in
language change. A further section will be on the role of bilingualism and
second language acquisition on change, where new research on second language use
in the revival of Irish and other minority languages is beginning to contribute
new perspectives on the influence of second language acquisition on language
change. 

We invite abstracts for 30 minutes presentations. Each abstract should be a
maximum two A4 pages (including examples and references), font size 12. Send an
anonymous abstract by email to c.sevdali@ulster.ac.uk, with the subject labelled
as: 'LCGB workshop' and the details of the author (including name, email,
affiliation and title of abstract) in the body of the email. The organizers hope
to have a publication resulting from this workshop. 

Important Dates:
Deadline for submission of abstracts: 26 January 2009
Notification of acceptance: 2 March 2009
Date of the workshop: 24-25 April 2009

psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, acquisition, typology, writing, history of
Chinese linguistics), including the contact languages of China. Abstracts may

"Missionary linguistics in China: 17th-19th centuries"

This special panel seeks to compare early missionary contributions to the study
of Sinitic languages. Papers can focus on one particular work (dictionary,
grammar) compiled by a missionary or on the linguistic tradition of one order
(e.g., Jesuit language studies). Submissions are welcomed.
