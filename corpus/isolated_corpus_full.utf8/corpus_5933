Call for Papers - Journal of Language Contact (JLC) VARIA 3.

The Journal of Language Contact (JLC) focuses on the study of language use
and language change based on a view of language contact whereby both,
empirical data and the resulting theoretical elaborations are considered.
JLC considers contributions with a theoretical or an empirical approach.
Articles discussing the association of linguistic, anthropological,
sociological, historical, and cognitive factors are welcome. We favour the
publication of such contributions and results of research that have been
not published elsewhere and welcome articles which are likely to bring
forward international research on language contact at the empirical as well
as at the theoretical level.

Papers may be submitted in French or English. Contributions should be sent
as a mail attachment in RTF or DOC, and PDF. Please send your contribution
to nicolai@unice.fr  and H.Schreiber@em.uni-frankfurt.de  (email-subject:
Contribution.JLC.VARIA). We thank you very much for your interest and look
forward to your contributions. If you have any questions, please contact us.
