Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce the 8th conference of the Researching and Applying Metaphor International Association (RaAM), which will be held at VU University (Vrije Universiteit), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 30 June through 3 July 2010. 

As an association, RaAM strives to advance the study of metaphor, metonymy and other aspects of figurative language, with a commitment to the application of metaphor research to 'real world' issues. In light of this, the theme of the upcoming conference will be 'Metaphor and Domains of Discourse'. The theme is intended to highlight the socio-cultural as well as the situational diversity of metaphor as manifested in, for example: government and politics; education; science and healthcare; business and organizations; mass media and journalism; and literature and the arts. 

The conference will feature plenary lectures by: 

Paul Chilton (Dept. of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, UK) http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/profiles/Paul-Chilton/ 
Dedre Gentner (Dept. of Psychology and School of Education and Social Policy, Northwestern University, USA) http://www.psych.northwestern.edu/psych/people/faculty/gentner/ 
and an address by the outgoing Chair of the RaAM Executive Committee: 
Lynne Cameron (Faculty of Education and Language Studies, Open University, UK). http://www.open.ac.uk/education-and-languages/people/people-profile.php?staff_id=1618003&show=researchInterests Faculty of Education and Language Studies Open University, UK

The conference will also include a new way of linking basic and applied research: in addition to regular papers and a poster session, a selection of 'real world workshops' will be offered. The workshops will involve demonstrations for, and with, conference participants on how metaphor can be used as an intervention or tool to change people's way of thinking and reasoning. 'Real world workshops' will be offered on: 

- Metaphor in communicating public interest issues (Joseph Grady, Cultural Logic, USA) 
- Metaphor in business organizations (Joep Cornelissen, Leeds University Business School, UK) 
- Metaphor in education professionals' discourse (Graham Low, University of York, UK) 
- Metaphor in knowledge management (Daan Andriessen, INHolland University of Applied Sciences, NL) 
- Metaphor and metonymy in painting (Irene Mittelberg, RWTH Aachen University, Germany) 
- Metaphor in product design (Paul Hekkert, Technical University Delft, NL). 

Updates, including a link to the conference web site, will be posted at http://www.raam.org.uk/Amsterdam_2010.html 

See the link for 'Joining' at the top of that web page if you wish to become a member of the RaAM International Association. 

Sincerely yours, the local organizing committee: 
Alan Cienki and Gerard Steen (chairs); Lettie Dorst, Berenike Herrmann, Anna Kaal, Tina Krennmayr, Tryntje Pasma 

Call for Papers: 

We are soliciting abstracts for 20-minute papers and for poster presentations. Abstracts should be no more than 500 words (excluding references). Updates, including a link to the conference web site and information on abstract submission, will be posted shortly at http://www.raam.org.uk/Amsterdam_2010.html. The deadline for abstracts is 31 December 2009. Notification of acceptance decisions will be sent by 1 March 2010. Early registration will be open between 1 March and 30 April 2010.
