Full Title: IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication 


Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2008 

Call for Abstracts
Special issue of IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication
to focus on
Professional Communication in Humanitarian Environments

Guest Editors:
Rebecca Walton and Mark Haselkorn
University of Washington
Deadline for Abstracts: April 15, 2008

IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication (IEEE-TPC) is accepting
submissions for a special issue on professional communication in
humanitarian environments. Communication in humanitarian environments
supports systems designed to meet the needs of communities and individuals
in developing countries and post-disaster areas where existing systems and
technologies are not adequately functioning.  Many of the assumptions of
the market-based professional environment do not hold for humanitarian
work: e.g., there is not the usual customer/provider relationship, goals
are far more complex, and existing infrastructure is unreliable. Effective
research and practice must consider not only efficiency or effectiveness,
but also the full range of social, behavioral, political, cultural, and
economic issues that impact the humanitarian service domain.

To explore this important domain and the complex challenges associated with
it, IEEE-TPC welcomes papers that examine how information and communication
practices, approaches, tools, and innovations in for-profit organizations
translate into the humanitarian environment, as well as where these
practices fall short. We welcome a wide range of approaches, including case
studies, histories, annotated bibliographies, original research, action
research, and others. Topics may include (but are not limited to) the
following:

-	Examinations of the gaps between traditional professional communication
and the needs of the humanitarian environment
-	Proposals of strategies or tools that may be appropriate or useful in the
humanitarian work environment
-	Case studies describing the humanitarian environment and current
communication practices
-	Unique benefits and challenges of trans-disciplinary research efforts in
the humanitarian work domain

The guest editors of this special issue are Rebecca Walton and Mark
Haselkorn. Please send your abstract of approximately 250 words to Rebecca
Walton at rebeccaww@gmail.com no later than 
April 15, 2008.
