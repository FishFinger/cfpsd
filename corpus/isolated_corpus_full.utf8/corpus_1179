LOCATION

Plzeò (Pilsen) is located in Western Bohemia on the confluence of four 
rivers. With 170 thousand inhabitants it is the fourth largest city in 
the Czech Republic and an important industrial, commercial, cultural, 
and administrative center. 

Plzeò is well known for its brewing tradition. The trademark Pilsner-Urquell
penetrated all over the world thanks to the traditional recipe, high quality
hops and good wells. Beer lovers will also appreciate a visit to the Brewery
museum or the Brewery itself.

Apart from its famous beer, Plzeò has a lot of hidden treasures in its core. 
Plzeò can pride itself on the second largest synagogue in Europe. The old 
city center is dominated by a 13th-century Gothic church which features the 
highest tower in Bohemia (102.34 m). It is possible to go up the stairs and 
admire the panorama. Not far from the church is a splendid Renaissance Town 
Hall from 1558 and plenty of pleasant cafes and pubs.

Plzeò has also a beautiful historical underground under the city center 
there are 25 km of tunnels. Visitors can pass through the most beautiful 
part of thislabyrinth.

It is also recommended to visit the zoo having the second largest space for 
bears in Europe and keeping the Komodo dragons - large lizards existing in 
only a few zoos in the world.

In the neighborhood of the city there are castle Radynì and hunting-seat 
Kozel. St. Peter's Rotunda in Starý Plzenec was built in the 10th century.

The University of West Bohemia in Plzeò provides a variety of courses for 
both Czech and international students. It is the only institution of higher 
education in this part of the country which prepares students for careers in 
engineering (electrical and mechanical), science (computer science, applied 
mathematics, physics, and mechanics), education (both primary and secondary), 
economics, philosophy, politology, archaeology, anthropology, foreign 
languages, law and public administration, art and design. 


GETTING THERE

The city has an access from the D5 highway connecting Prague (Praha) with 
Germany. Plzeò has a very good bus and train connections with the capital 
Prague (takes about 1 - 1.5 hour). From the international airport Prague 
- Ruzynì you can reach Plzeò by frequent public transport in 1.5 - 2 hours.


SOCIAL EVENTS

The international conference will also include social events and trips i.e. 
visit of brewery and city sightseeing.
