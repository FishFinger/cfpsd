Call for Papers
***************
The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has
established itself as the world's premier research conference in data
mining. The 2009 edition of ICDM provides a leading forum for
presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and
dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The
conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms,
software and systems, and applications.  In addition, ICDM draws
researchers and application developers from a wide range of data
mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern
recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization,
knowledge-based systems, and high performance computing. By promoting
novel, high quality research findings, and innovative solutions to
challenging data mining problems, the conference seeks to continuously
advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. Besides the technical
program, the conference will feature workshops, tutorials, panels, and
the ICDM data mining contest.

Paper Submissions
*****************
High quality papers in all data mining areas are solicited. Original
papers exploring new directions will receive especially careful
consideration.  Papers that have already been accepted or are
currently under review for other conferences or journals will not be
considered for ICDM'09.

Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages in the
IEEE 2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the
IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines
http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/AuthorKit.asp?Community=CPS&Facility=CPS_Dec&ERoom=ICDM+2008).
All papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of
technical quality, relevance to data mining, originality,
significance, and clarity. A double blind review process will be
adopted. Authors should avoid using identifying information in the
text of the paper. A Submission Form to submit your work will be
announced on the ICDM'09 website.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE
Computer Society Press and accorded oral presentation times in the main
conference. Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 10
pages in the proceedings. Submissions accepted as short papers will be
allocated 6 pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation
time at the conference than regular papers.

A selected number of IEEE ICDM'09 accepted papers will be invited for
possible inclusion, in expanded and revised form, in the Knowledge and
Information Systems journal published by Springer-Verlag.

ICDM Best Paper Awards
**********************
IEEE ICDM Best Paper Awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper, (2) the best application
paper, and (3) the best student paper.  Strong, foundational results
will be considered for the best research paper award and
application-oriented submissions will be considered for the best
application paper award. The best student paper award will be given to
the authors of the best paper written solely by one or more students.

Workshops and Tutorials
***********************
ICDM'09 will host short and long tutorials as well as workshops that
focus on new research directions and initiatives. All accepted
workshop papers will be included in a separate workshop proceedings
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

ICDM Data Mining Contest
************************
ICDM'09 will host a data mining contest to challenge researchers and
practitioners with a real practical data mining problem. For further
details on proposals and expression of interest, please see the Call
for Data Mining Contest Proposals.
