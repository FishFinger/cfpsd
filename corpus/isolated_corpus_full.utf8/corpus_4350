Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Typology 

Call Deadline: 08-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The last years have seen substantial advances in the typological study and the
formal modelling of natural language morphology. However, progress in the
theoretical analysis of morphological systems highlights a basic empirical
problem: We know too little about the morphology of too few languages and
language families. 

Call for Papers

This conference in the tradition of Syntax of the World's Languages seeks to
bring together researchers working on the documentation or analysis of
morphological data from less widely studied languages to broaden the empirical
scope of morphological theory. Contributions are expected to be based either on
new data, new generalizations, or new approaches to analysis. All major
theoretical frameworks are equally welcome, as is work done in analytical
frameworks developed in typology or field linguistics.

Invited Speakers: 
Jonathan Bobaljik (University of Connecticut) 
Greville Corbett (University of Surrey) 
Alice Harris (Stony Brook University) 
Larry Hyman (University of Berkeley) 
Martin Haspelmath (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) 
Andrew Nevins (Harvard University) 
Andrew Spencer (University of Sussex) 
Dieter Wunderlich (Center for General Linguistics, Berlin)

Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:
-  The Structure of Syncretism
-  Productivity in Derivation and Compounding
-  Nonconcatenative and Prosodic Morphology
-  Systematic and Idiosyncratic Aspects of Allomorphy
-  Affix Order
-  Boundaries of Morphology to Phonology and Syntax

Papers that adopt a diachronic/historical-comparative perspective or that
discuss language-contact effects are also welcome, as are papers which study the
morphology of understudied languages from the psycholinguistic or
neurolinguistic side.

We invite abstracts for 40 minutes presentations (including discussion).
Abstracts should be anonymous, at most one page long (with an optional second
page for data and references), and should be sent as a pdf attachment to:
doreengeorgi@gmx.de

Deadline for Abstracts: February 8 2008
Notification of Acceptance: February 28 2008

Meeting Description:

ACL 2009 NLPIR4DL: Workshop on text and citation analysis for scholarly digital
libraries 

Call for Papers

In recent years, interest in scholarly publications in electronic forms has
boomed, and several large-scale electronic digital libraries and citation
indices are now used everyday by researchers. Current digital libraries collect
and allow access to digital papers and their metadata (including citations), but
largely do not attempt to analyze
the items they collect.

The goal of this workshop is to investigate how developments in natural language
processing and information retrieval techniques can advance the state-of-the-art
in scholarly document understanding, analysis and retrival. Full document text
analysis can help design automatic summarization and sentiment detection
methods, automated recommendation and reviewing systems, and may provide data
for visualizing scientific trends and bibliometrics. Citation analysis takes
this a step further, adding scientific social network analysis as another strand
of evidence to enhance solutions to the above challenges. Web based digital
libraries add download counts and Web 2.0 information such as tagging.

Aside from researchers, this workshop hopes to interest other stakeholders,
namely implementers, publishers and policymakers. Even within computer science,
many different scholarly sites exist- ACM Portal, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar,
PSU's CiteSeerX, MSRA's Libra, Tsinghua's ArnetMiner, Trier's DBLP, UMass' Rexa,
Hiroshima's PRESRI- and with this workshop we hope to bring a number of these
contributers together. Today's publishers continue to seek new ways to be
relevant to their consumers, in disseminating the right published works to their
audience. The fact that formal citation metrics have become an increasingly
large factor in decision-making by universities and funding bodies worldwide
makes the need for research in such topics and for better methods for measuring
the impact of work more pressing.

We invite stimulating and unpublished submissions on topics including but not
limited to) full-text analysis, multimedia and multilingual analysis and
alignment as well as citation-based NLP or IR. Specific examples of fields of
interests include:
- new information access methods for scientific papers 
- automatic creation of reviews 
- automatic qualitative assessment of submissions   
- summarisation of scientific articles 
- navigation, searching and browsing in scholarly DLs 
- techniques for suggesting and recommending scholarly papers, reviewers,
citations and publication venues 
- information retrieval for scholarly text, e.g. citation-based IR 
- topical modeling analysis 
- network analysis and citation analysis in scholarly DLs 
- citation function/motivation analysis 
- novel bibliographic metrics 
- niche search in scholarly DLs, e.g., survey paper finding and provenance
tracing of algorithms)  
- knowledge discovery and analysis of the ancestry of ideas 
- analyses of writing style in scholarly publications 
- multilingual and multimedia analysis and alignment of scholarly works 
- managing digital archives of linguistic corpora; federated access 
- metadata and controlled vocabularies for resource description and discovery 
- automatic metadata discovery, e.g., language identification 
- data cleaning and data quality 
- disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs using NLP or IR techniques.
