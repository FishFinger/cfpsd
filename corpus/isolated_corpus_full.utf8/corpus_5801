Call Deadline: 23-Nov-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an integr=
al part of the FLAIRS conference. They provide researchers in focused areas=
 the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for inte=
raction among the broader community of artificial intelligence researchers.=
 Topics of interest are in all areas of artificial intelligence and linguis=
tics as they relate to AI.

The 23rd Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference (FLAIR=
S-23) will be held May 19-21, 2010 in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA. FLAIRS-2=
3 continues a tradition of presenting and discussing artificial intelligenc=
e research in a convivial atmosphere within a beautiful setting. Events wil=
l include invited speakers, special tracks, discussion panels, and presenta=
tions of papers and posters.=20

What is ANLP?

The amount of information that humans have gathered and made available to o=
ther humans is, of course, phenomenal. And however large this repository of=
 knowledge is, we know that by this time tomorrow, it will larger still. Bu=
t perhaps what is most important about this information is that most of it =
appears in textual form; and that if we are ever to manage it, understand i=
t, assess it, evaluate it, summarize it, or even find it; then a broad rang=
e of natural language processing tools, systems, algorithms, models, theori=
es, and techniques will have to be applied to it. Applied Natural Language =
Processing (ANLP) is dedicated to this venture.

What is the GOAL of the track?

The goal of the ANLP track is to inform researchers as to current project a=
nd studies that identify, investigate, and (begin to) resolve issues that r=
elate to human/computer language interaction.

Who might be interested?

The track of Applied Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers=
 working in natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (C=
L), linguistics, cognitive science, AI, and related areas.=20

Call for Papers:

Paper submission deadline: Monday, November 23rd, 2009.

FLAIRS encourages student authors to submit papers. In addition to a Best P=
aper award, there will be a Best Student Paper award for the best paper wri=
tten primarily by students.

All accepted papers will be published as FLAIRS proceedings by the AAAI. Le=
ading papers will also be considered for publication as chapters in forthco=
ming book Applied Natural Language Processing and Content Analysis: Advance=
s in Identification, Investigation, and Resolution.

Note: We invite original papers (i.e. work not previously submitted, in sub=
mission, or to be submitted to another conference during the reviewing proc=
ess).=20

Submission Guidelines for the ANLP Track:

Interested authors (for the general ANLP track or the special topic) should=
 format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The papers sh=
ould be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to =
another conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages (2 pa=
ges for a poster) and are due by November 23rd, 2009. For FLAIRS-23, the 20=
10 conference, the reviewing is a double blind process. Fake author names a=
nd affiliations must be used on submitted papers to provide double-blind re=
viewing. Papers must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference s=
ystem, which can be accessed through the main conference web site (http://w=
ww.FLAIRS-23.info). Note, do not use a fake name for your EasyChair login -=
 your EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers. Authors shoul=
d indicate the special track of ANLP for submissions. The proceedings of FL=
AIRS will be published by the AAAI. Authors of accepted papers will be requ=
ired to sign a form transferring copyright of their contribution to AAAI. A=
n author of each accepted paper is required to register, attend, and presen=
t the paper at FLAIRS.
