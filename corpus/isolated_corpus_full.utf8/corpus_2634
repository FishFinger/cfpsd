Meeting Description:

We invite papers reporting on biomedical resources specifically used to
facilitate biomedical text mining and the process of designing, building,
updating, delivering, evaluating and disseminating them. A focus of the
workshop is on lexical and knowledge repositories (e.g. controlled
vocabularies, terminologies, ontologies, factual databases) and annotated
corpora. Another focus is on design guidelines, standards for building
resources, storage and exchange format, interoperability of resources and
last, on exploring new directions for their dissemination.

Workshop on Multilingual and Comparative Perspectives in Specialized Language Resources 26 May 2008 (Afternoon session)
To take place within the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2008) Marrakech, Morocco, http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/ 

Call for Papers

New Deadline: February 16, 2008

Background:
We are currently witnessing an increasing interest in multilingualism in many different fields including IR (CLEF: Cross language Evaluation Forum, annual), summarization (DUC), semantic aspects (SemEval 2007 Task 1: Evaluating WSD on Cross-Language Information Retrieval), textual corpora, etc. Although issues related to multilingualism have been debated in different workshops (as those listed above), they are often considered from a computational perspective and for specific applications. Seldom have multilingual resources and the different problems related to their development and modelling have been considered as such.  

Also, the importance of assessing the quality of language resources is increasingly recognized as far as monolingual resources and tasks are concerned. Regarding specialized language resources the usual emphasis put on scale is gradually shifting towards a concern about quality of corpora and language resources. Also, as we start emphasizing the need to assess the quality of multilingual resources, a set of new issues arises, such as quality criteria, more detailed classification of factors that apply to monolingual as well as multilingual resources, typologies of specialized corpora, terminological characteristics that may appear in a language but not in another. There is an acute need for addressing these issues and to explore multilingual and comparative approaches in specialized language resources. These approaches will come from different fields, including - but not limited to - linguistics, terminology, information science and computational linguistics.

This workshop aims at bringing together experts from different backgrounds concerned by the acquisition and modelling of multilingual specialized information. The workshop will provide an opportunity to share experience on multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized information. It will also be a forum for discussing issues of a more fundamental nature.

Topics:
- Equivalence in specialized resources and specialized corpora;
- Multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized corpora;
- Corpus-based approaches to multilingual modelling of terminological data;
- Multilingual resources for terminology processing;
- Linguistic evidence for multilingual NLP such as identification of cognates, transliteration, morphological evidence, etc.
- Comparative approaches to terminological variation and semantic relationships;
- Comparative approaches to discourse analysis;
- Comparative and multilingual approaches to document characterization;
- Modelling of multilingual data in ontologies or other terminological resources;
- Evaluation of multilingual resources and methods for acquiring them.

Submissions:
Abstracts should be 5 pages long and submitted in PDF format at the following address: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/MCPSLR/submit.html. Authors are requested to send an anonymized version of their abstract. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and should adhere to the stylesheet that will be adopted for the LREC Proceedings (to be announced later on the conference web site).

Important Dates:
Submission of abstracts: 16 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 10 March 2008
Final version for the proceedings: 12 April 2008
