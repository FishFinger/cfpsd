The Ken Hale Prize
DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF NOMINATIONS: May 1, 2009
 
The Ken Hale Prize is presented in recognition of outstanding
community language work and a deep commitment to the documentation,
maintenance, promotion, and revitalization of indigenous languages in
the Americas. The prize, which usually carries a $500 stipend, honors
those who strive to link the academic and community spheres in the
spirit of Ken Hale. Recipients can range from native speakers and
community-based linguists to academic specialists, and may include
groups or organizations. No academic affiliation is necessary.
 
Nominations for the prize may be made by anyone, and should include a
letter of nomination stating the current position and affiliation, if
appropriate, of the nominee or nominated group (tribal,
organizational, or academic), and a summary of the nominee's
background and contributions to specific language communities. The
nominator should also submit a brief portfolio of supporting
materials, such as the nominee's curriculum vitae, a description of
completed or on-going activities of the nominee, letters from those
who are most familiar with the work of the nominee (e.g. language
program staff, community people, academic associates), and any other
material that would support the nomination. Submission of
manuscript-length work is discouraged. The deadline for receipt of
nominations is May 1st.
 
The award is presented at the annual winter meeting. Nominations will
be kept active for two subsequent years for prize consideration and
nominators are invited to update their nomination packets if so
desired.
