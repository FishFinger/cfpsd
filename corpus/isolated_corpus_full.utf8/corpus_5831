Dear Colleagues,
We recieved several letters asking for paper submission deadline
extension.

Due to the arrangement with the Publishers of confernce proceedings we
are now in possibility to extend the deadline.
The new deadline is September 6. Any further extension will not be
possible because of obvious technological constraints. As many authors
succeeded to send us their submissions within the initially fixed
deadline, we will start the evaluation procedure now.

Please visit time to time the conference www site (www.ltc.amu.edu.pl)
where new, important information about the conference and related
events will sistematically appear.

We hope to see you in Pozna=C5=84.
Best regards
Zygmunt Vetulani, LTC 2009 Chair

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language
Technologies as a Challenge
for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC 2009), a meeting organized
by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz
University, Pozna=C5=84, Poland in cooperation with the Adam Mickiewicz
University Foundation (co-organizer), will take place on November 6-8,
2009.

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for
computer science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become
an ever more essential element of our everyday technological
environment. Since the very beginning of the Computer and Information
=C2=A0Age these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. The
European Union strongly supports HLT under the 7th Framework
Program. These efforts as well as technological, social and cultural
globalization have created a favorable climate for the intensive
exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across initially
distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange
and invite you to join us at LTC in November 6-8, 2009, as well as at
the FlaReNet workshop (LRL 2009, on November 5, 2009) on the theme
"Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!".

Zygmunt Vetulani
LTC 2009 Chair
vetulani@amu.edu.pl

   between columns (gutter).

3. The paper size is 5 pages formatted according to (1) and (2) above.

4. The use of PDF format is strongly recommended, although MS Word
   will also be accepted.

Detailed guidelines for the final submission of accepted papers will
be published on the conference Web site no latter then September 27,
2009 (acceptance notification date).


All submissions are to be made electronically via the LTC 2009 web submissi=
on=20
system. Acceptance/rejection notification will be sent no later then=20
September 27, 2009.

PUBLICATION POLICY


Acceptance will be based on the reviewers' assessments (anonymous
submission model). The accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings (hard copy, with ISBN number) and on
CD-ROM. The abstracts of the accepted contributions will also be made
available via the conference page (during its lifetime). Publication
requires full electronic registration and payment of the conference
fee (full registration) by at least one of the co-authors by October
1, 2009. (In case of more than one accepted paper a special regulation
will be applied. This regulation will be announced later on.)

A post-conference volume with extended versions of selected papers
will be published. It is planed to publish them in the =C2=A0Springer
series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence =C2=A0(final approval
pending).

The LTC 2005 post conference selection appeared in form of Special
Issue of Archives of Control Sciences (2005, Volume 15, nb. 3 and 4)

The LTC 2007 post-conference volume (extended papers) is going to
appear in the Springer Verlag series LNAI (vol. 5603).

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 =E2=80=93 18h00) + cocktail

Theme:
Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the
challenge of Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is
necessary to have access to Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT
performances. To this regard, the situation is very different across
the different languages. Little or sparse data exist for languages in
countries or regions where limited efforts have been devoted to such
issues in the past, also known as Less-Resourced Languages (LRL). The
workshop aims at reporting the needs, at presenting achievements and
at proposing solutions for the future, both in terms of LR and of LT
evaluation, especially in the European, Euro-Mediterranean and
regional frameworks. This will allow to identity the factors that have
an impact on a potential and shared roadmap towards supplying LR and
LT for all languages.

Topics:=20

- Experience in the production, validation and distribution of LR for
  less-resourced languages

- Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced languages

- Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in less-resourced
  languages

- Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages,
  language clustering)

- To be completed


Co-Chairs: Joseph Mariani (LIMSI-CNRS & IMMI-CNRS), Khalid
Choukri(ELRA & ELDA), Zygmunt Vetulani (Adam Mickiewicz University,
Poznan)

Paper submission deadline: September 6.

Sponsors: FLaReNet, ELRA

Inscriptions: as for the general LTC (+ cc to workshop chairs)=20

their papers to a larger audience at the main LTC conference.
