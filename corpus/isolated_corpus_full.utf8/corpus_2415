Meeting Description

The Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University will host a
symposium entitled Linguistic Variation Across the Lifespan on May 2-3,
2008. The symposium will bring together scholars from linguistics and
related disciplines, including psychology, speech and hearing sciences, and
anthropology, to examine variability as a fundamental property of human
language at all life stages. The symposium will focus on questions about
the sources of linguistic variability at each life stage and the
implications of these sources of variability for language processing,
acquisition, perception, and social identity construction. For example, in
early childhood, how does variability relate to the acquisition process? In
adulthood, how does stylistic variation mark membership in communities
centered around work or leisure? In later life, how do physical changes in
the vocal tract contribute to linguistic and social sources of variability?
By bringing together scholars interested in acquisition, stylistic
variation, and aging, this symposium will also provide the opportunity to
extend research questions beyond their typical life stage. For example, how
does language acquisition continue beyond childhood? How could we view
adulthood as characterized as much by variability and transition as other
life stages?

The symposium will include invited talks by:
Penelope Eckert, Stanford University
Carla Hudson Kam, University of California, Berkeley
Benjamin Munson, University of Minnesota
Gillian Sankoff, University of Pennsylvania 

Web Site: http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~springsym/ 

We invite abstracts for contributed talks on research examining variation at all
levels of linguistic representation in infants, children, adolescents, and
adults.  We hope that the final symposium program will represent a wide range of
approaches to linguistic variability from infancy through late life, including
formal, experimental, computational, sociolinguistic, developmental, and
historical perspectives.

Contributed talks will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions.

Abstracts of at most 500 words should be submitted as an email attachment to
springsym@ling.osu.edu in pdf (preferred) or Word format by January 18, 2008. 
Please include only the title and text of the abstract in the attachment. The
authors' names, affiliations, and postal and email addresses should be included
in the text of the email.

Meeting Description

One of the problems in Natural Language Processing and related fields is that
the sustainability of language resources and of language technology tools are
neglected. The very complex question of how to ensure or maybe even guarantee
sustainability is a multi-faceted one and depends on different individual
subtasks. Several of these tasks will be addressed by contributions of this
workshop.

Sustainability of Language Resources and Tools for Natural Language Processing

One of the problems in Natural Language Processing and related fields is that
the sustainability of language resources (e.g., corpora) and of language 
technology tools (e.g. annotation or query tools) are neglected on a regular 
basis.

This results in, for example, tools whose algorithms and data structures 
are poorly documented and whose area of application is evident only to 
the people who built the software. Similar issues arise with regard to 
language resources: often, these are tailored to the needs of an individual
application or of a project with a very specific research question. When 
the project is finished it becomes next to impossible (especially for 
third parties) to gain access to the resource that may have taken several 
months or even years to create.
 
The very complex question of how to ensure or maybe even guarantee
sustainability is related to several key issues spanning a broad spectrum
across several closely related fields: in the area of language documentation,
seven dimensions of portability (content, format, discovery, access, citation,
preservation, rights) have been suggested. Another area of research is primarily
concerned with annotation technology, especially the problem of building generic
annotation frameworks as well as representing several different layers of
linguistic annotation referring to one specific set of primary data by means of
standoff annotation. Closely related work deals with the
standardisation of annotation frameworks, especially with regard to the level of
impact a specific linguistic theory has on their vocabularies and markup
grammars. A last area concerns the fostering of sustainability through specific

Providing sustainability for linguistic tools and language resources 
becomes increasingly important for the research community. Nowadays, this 
is also acknowledged by funding organisations - they often encourage 
research projects to make sure that language resources will still be 
accessible and (re-)usable in ten, 15, or 20 years time.

The problem of ensuring sustainability is a multi-faceted one and depends 
on several individual subtasks. At least one of these tasks should
be addressed by contributions to this workshop. The topics of interest 
include but are not limited to:

- Archiving linguistic data and resources
- Annotation technology, e.g., generic corpus annotation frameworks; the
relationship of linguistic theories to corpus annotation; metadata annotation
schemes, and related tools and applications
- Reusability of treebanks, e.g., annotations according to one specific
linguistic framework should be applicable to NLP tasks that are based on
different linguistic paradigms
- Sustainability in Software Engineering for Computational Linguistics
- Copyright issues, e.g., legal restrictions, copyright of web pages (for
example, in a web as corpus approach), software patents, intellectual property,
national and international issues etc.
- Privacy protection, e.g., automatic anonymisation of language data
- Sustainability, maintenance, and adaptability of NLP applications and tools,
e.g., to new domains, to new linguistic resources, or even to new linguistic
frameworks or theories
- Querying linguistic data, e.g., the usability and adaptability of query
interfaces or query toolboxes
- Usability and acceptance of NLP software, e.g., corpus query interfaces
