We plan to submit a workshop proposal to the 2010 SLE Meeting, and invite p=
apers
from prospective participants interested in crosslinguistic research on
partitives. Please send draft abstracts to both of us no later than Novembe=
r 8,
2009.

Workshop Description=20
Some languages, notably Baltic Finnic and Basque, have a partitive case, wh=
ich
is usually said to indicate partial affectedness of patients. Such function=
 is
also attributed to other cases in languages that do not have a separate
partitive, as the Hungarian partitive/ablative, and the partitive/genitive =
of
various Indo-European languages. Indeed partitivity is not only a possible
feature of patients: in Finnish existentials,  even agentive intransitive v=
erbs
such as  opiskella 'study' take partitive subjects. Moravcsik (1978: 272)
summarizes typical semantic correlates of partitives as follows:

a. the definitness-indefinitness of the noun phrase;
b. the extent to which the object is involeved in the event;
c. the completedness versus non-completedness of the event;
d. whether the sentence is affirmative or negative.

Moravcsik further remarks that marking difference brought about by the part=
itive
"does not correlate with any difference in semantic case function". Thus, t=
he
use of the partitive seems to be at odds with the basic function of cases, =
that
is "marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their
heads" (Blake 2001: 1). In fact, several authors have remarked that the fun=
ction
of the partitive is similar to the function of a determiner in Basque and
Finnish. In this connection, one must mention the so-called partitive artic=
le of
some Romance varieties, which derives from the preposition which has substi=
tuted
the Latin genitive (Latin de), and is clearly a determiner and not a case
marker, as shown by its distribution. In spite of striking similarities amo=
ng
across languages, research on partitives is mostly limited to individual
languages. In this workshop we would like to bring together and compare dat=
a
from different languages in which a case (or an adposition, as in French) a=
re
classified as partitive.=20

Possible topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to, the follo=
wing:
(a) The distribution of partitives in different syntactic positions (object=
s,
subjects, other roles) and across constructions;
(b) Partitives as determiners;
(c) The diachrony of partitives: what are the sources of partitive markers?=
 What
is the diachronic relation between ablative, genitive, and partitive?=20
(d) Finnish partitive subjects and objects have been treated under the head=
ing
of 'non-canonical marking'. However, it is highly questionable that partiti=
ve
subjects and objects marked by a partitive article, as in French, should al=
so be
considered under this heading. Is the change from case marker (including
adpositions) to determiner a grammaticalization process and at what stage s=
hould
a morpheme start to be considered a determiner, rather than a case marker?=
=20
(e) Discourse functions of partitives: Since partitives indicate indetermin=
acy,
it might be expected that they are not topical elements in discourse. Refer=
ents
of Finnish partitive subjects are typically not tracked in discourse. What =
is
the discourse function of partitives crosslinguistically?=20
(h) Semantic roles and referential functions of partitives.=20
(i) Partitives, aspect and quantification: The Baltic Finnic partitive obje=
ct
may indicate aspectual unboundedness. Other BF partitives (existential,
copulative) do not share the aspectual function proper but often indicate a=
n
incremental theme, which gives rise to unbounded nominal aspect. What are t=
he
aspectual and quantificational functions of partitives crosslinguistically?
