Meeting Description:

The Surrey Morphology Group (University of Surrey, UK) and the Department of 
Linguistics at Harvard University will host a one-day workshop entitled
'Morphological Complexity: Implications for the Theory of Language', as part of
a European Research Council project (grant number: ERC-2008-AdG-230268 MORPHOLOGY). 

The workshop will be held on January 22, 2010 (Friday), on the Harvard Campus in
Cambridge MA. The conference is organized by Matthew Baerman, Greville Corbett
and Dunstan Brown (Surrey) and Maria Polinsky (Harvard). 

Call for Papers

By the term 'morphological complexity', we understand the extra layer of
structure that morphological systems may introduce in between meaning and its
expression. This layer may operate at cross-purposes to functional distinctions,
attaining in some languages an astonishing degree of complexity. Such apparently
arbitrary distinctions in form (inflection classes, irregularity and similar
phenomena) are the particular focus of the project. They are a key resource for
understanding mental processes as they represent an unconscious and yet highly
structured autonomous system. This will be the first in a series of workshops,
to be held in various locations, addressing the implications that morphological
complexity has for (i) general linguistic theory, (ii) psycholinguistics, (iii)
historical linguistics and (iv) computational linguistics. The present workshop
will focus on question 'i'; that is, the ramifications that morphological
complexity has for linguistic theory and models of grammar. The theme of the
workshop is laid out in more detail in the position paper which is available at
 http://www.morphology.surrey.ac.uk/Workshop.htm.

The workshop will involve a mixture of invited papers and those selected by
abstract.  Abstracts are invited for 20 minute presentations (plus a 10-minute
question period), within the theme of the conference as outlined in the position
paper. Anonymous abstracts should be no more than one page, and should be sent
as an e-mail attachment (in PDF or Word) by October 31, 2009 to the Email
address given in the announcement (morphological complexity...). (Any questions
may also be sent to this address.)
