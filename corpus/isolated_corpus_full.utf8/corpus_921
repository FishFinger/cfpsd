                        6 - 10 August, 2007
                       organized as part of
                   the European Summer School on
                  Logic, Language and Information
           ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007
                   6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin
*******************************************************************

ORGANIZERS:

Torben Bra=FCner (Roskilde University, Denmark, torben@ruc.dk) - Chair
J=F8rgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark, jv@imm.dtu.dk)=20

WORKSHOP PURPOSE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct reference=20
to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest in hybrid=20
logic on the grounds of applications as the additional expressive=20
power is very useful. In addition, hybrid-logical machinery improves=20
the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism. For example, it=20
becomes considerably simpler to formulate modal proof systems, and=20
one can prove completeness and interpolation results of a=20
generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.

The topic of the HyLo workshop of 2007 is not only standard=20
hybrid-logical machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and=20
the downarrow binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that=20
increase its expressive power.

The workshop HyLo 2007 will be relevant to a wide range of people,=20
including those interested in description logic, feature logic,=20
applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction. The=20
workshop continues a series of previous workshops on hybrid logic,=20
most recently the LICS-affiliated HyLo 2006=20
(http://hylomol.ruc.dk/HyLo2006/). The workshop aims to provide a=20
forum for advanced PhD students and researchers to present and=20
discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who work in the=20
broad subject areas represented at ESSLLI.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key=20
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/).=20

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

We invite the contribution of papers reporting new work from
researchers interested in hybrid logic. Details about the=20
submission procedure will be announced in the second call for=20
papers. The accepted papers will appear in the workshop=20
proceedings published by ESSLLI. One author for each accepted paper=20
must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. It is=20
planned to publish revised versions of the accepted papers in a=20
special issue of Journal of Logic, Language and Information.

WORKSHOP FORMAT:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI=20
participants. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over=20
five consecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be=20
2 or 3 slots for paper presentation and discussion per session.=20
On the first day the workshop organizers will give an introduction=20
to the topic.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Balder ten Cate (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
Ian Hodkinson (Imperial College, UK)

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

Carlos Areces (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Patrick Blackburn (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Thomas Bolander (Technical University of Denmark) - Co-Chair
Torben Bra=FCner (Roskilde University, Denmark) - Chair
Mai Gehrke (New Mexico State University, USA)
Valeria de Paiva (PARC, USA)
J=F8rgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark)=20

IMPORTANT DATES:

Deadline for submissions: March 8, 2007
Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2007
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2007
ESSLLI early registration: May 1, 2007
Deadline for final versions: May 17, 2007
Final programme: June 21, 2007
Workshop dates: 6 - 10 August, 2007

LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS:

All workshop participants including the presenters will be required=20
to register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting=20
a paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker=20
registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants=20
will be made available by the ESSLLI local organizing committee on=20
a competitive basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply=20
for those. There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and=20
accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding=20
funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for=20
the possibilities for a grant.
