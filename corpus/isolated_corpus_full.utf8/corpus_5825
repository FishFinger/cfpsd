Meeting Description:

Logic and Engineering of Natural Language Semantics 6 (LENLS 6) 

LENLS is an annual international workshop focusing on formal semantics and pragmatics. In the past it has been a satellite of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence conference; this year it will be part of a special workshop session to be held in November, distinct from the conference though still sponsored by JSAI.

Invited Speakers: 

Reinhard Muskens (Tilburg University) (confirmed) 
Takashi Iida (Keio University) 

Workshop Site: Campus Innovation Center Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 

Dates: November 19-20, 2009 

Workshop URL: http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~bekki/lenls/

Chair: Daisuke Bekki (Ochanomizu University) 

Call for Papers:

We invite submissions to this year's workshop on topics in formal semantics and pragmatics, and related fields, including but in no way limited to the following: 

- Dynamic syntax/semantics/pragmatics of natural language 
- Categorical/topological/coalgebraic approaches for natural language syntax/semantics/pragmatics 
- Logic and its relation to natural language and linguistic reasoning (especially dynamic logics) 
- Type-theoretic approaches to natural language 
- Philosophy of language 
- Formal pragmatics (especially game- and utility-theoretic approaches) 
- Substructural expansion of Lambek Lambda Calculi 
- Many-valued/Fuzzy and other non-classical logics and natural language 

This year we especially welcome submissions related to the interplay between logic, philosophy of language, and formal semantics and pragmatics. 

Submissions: 

Abstracts should be between 2 and 4 pages in length and in pdf format. Submissions should be sent to: 

lenls6submission@gmail.com 

The proceedings of the workshop will be available at the conference site for registered persons. We also plan to publish a selection of the accepted papers as a portion of a volume in the ''Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence'' series (Springer Verlag). 

Important Dates: 

Abstract submission deadline: August 15, 2009 
Notification of acceptance: September 15, 2009 
Deadline for camera-ready copy: October 15, 2009 
LENLS 6: November 19-20, 2009 
Tutorial lecture: November 21, 2009 

On the 21st, there will also be a special tutorial lecture by Professor Muskens on the topic of ''True Intensionality in Higher Order Logic,'' at a location to be announced (near the conference site).
