PIONIER Workshop on Locative Case 

Call for papers (Reminder)

PIONIER Workshop on Locative Case

Nijmegen University, August 25-26, 2008

Organized by Helen de Hoop, Kees de Schepper, and Sander Lestrade

Structural case has played a major role in the development of formal theories of
language. So far, however, locative case has not been looked at in so much
detail. The incorporation of the latter in the study of case might well change
the way in which we have to think of this phenomenon. In this workshop we wish
to fill this gap and collect insights from formal and typological linguistics on
the syntax and semantics of locative case.

Invited Speakers: 
Miriam Butt (Universit√§t Konstanz)
Marcus Kracht (UCLA) 
Joost Zwarts (Universiteit Utrecht, UIL-OTS)

Possible topics of the conference include, but are not restricted to:
- 'case studies' on locative case;
- the relation between locative and structural case;
- the relation to other spatial systems;
- principles at work in the domain of locative case (compositionality, economy,
iconicity);
- non-locative use of locative cases;
- typological generalizations


Submission Details:
Abstracts for talks can be sent to s.lestrade@let.ru.nl. Abstracts must be
anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references, figures and data.
The body of the message should include: name, title, affiliation, and e-mail.
The subject of the message should include ''abstract locative case''.

Meeting Description:

The 39th Pozna? Linguistic Meeting (http://ifa.amu.edu.pl/plm/), to be held in
September 2008 in Gniezno, Poland, will feature a session that focuses on
'Variable Shape Templates in Morpho-Syntax and Phonology' 

Call for Papers

Deadline for submission is April 15th, 2008.
Please direct an abstract no longer than two pages (not including references and
examples) to the organizers:
Tobias Scheer (CNRS, Nice) scheer@unice.fr
Grzegorz Michalski (Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna?) grzegorz@ifa.amu.edu.pl

Notification of acceptance will reach authors by May 1st.

Session Description:
The question addressed is how phonology and morpho-syntax interact in the
management of templates that do not impose a fixed shape. Typical Semitic
templates impose a rigid sequence of consonants and vowels for a given
morpho-semantic category (e.g. [CVCCVC] is the invariable shape of form II).
However, templatic restrictions may also be global, which means that they may be
satisfied by variable shapes. For example, a number of Germanic languages
display restrictions on the (end of) the root, which must weigh 3 morae; this
restriction can (at least) be satisfied by a short vowel and two consonants
(VCC) or a long vowel and one single consonant (VVC). 
Contributions are invited which examine where exactly the templatic restriction
is stored, how morpho-syntax ''knows'' that it is related to a specific
morpho-syntactic category, how it is transmitted to the phonology, and how
phonology enforces its execution.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
