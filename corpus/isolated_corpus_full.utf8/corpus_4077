Call for Papers
ECIR 2009, Workshop on Geographic Information on the Internet  (WGII)
Toulouse, France, April 6, 2009


Context & Topics of Interest

Finding geographically-based information constitutes a common use of Web
search engines, for a variety of user needs. With the rapid growth of =
the
volume of geographically-related information on the Web, efficient and
adaptable ways of tagging, browsing and accessing relevant documents =
still
needs to be found. Structuring and mashing-up geographic information =
from
different Web data sources is one appealing alternative to long term =
efforts
of manually creating large scale geographic resources such as The =
Alexandria
Digital Library  or Geonames , whose constructions are costly and not
necessarily adapted to specific applications.
Efficient automatic geographical information structuring methods involve
coping with a wide diversity and huge volumes of geographically relevant
documents. Consider Wikipedia (over 200,000 geo-referenced articles for =
the
English version), or Flickr (over 50 million geo-referenced pictures) or
Yahoo! Trip Planner (over 159,000 publicly available trip descriptions).
These sites include disparate text, images and geo-localisation =
information.
Exploiting this information requires mixing different competences:
information retrieval and ranking, natural language processing, image
processing, geographic information extraction=85
Past events, such as the GIR workshops or the LocWeb workshops series,
focused on geographic information retrieval (GIR), but many hard =
research
questions related to GIR remain unsolved. We will address the following =
in
this workshop:
=95	How to move from raw data to structured knowledge? How can we
identify, disambiguate, localize, categorize and rank geographic names?
=95	What are the best ways to process geographically relevant multimedia
documents? How to combine text, image and/or video analysis in coherent
frameworks?
=95	How to exploit user contributed information? How to filter out noise
introduce and how to leverage information at a community level?
=95	How to adapt and/or personalize the presentation of results?
This workshop brings elements of answers to these research questions and =
is
a meeting point for different disciplines interested in geographic
information. It focuses on combining analysis skills to improve =
geographic
information processing. We welcome researchers from communities as =
diverse
as geographic information extraction and retrieval, context aware =
devices,
geographic information systems or image processing to discuss their =
ideas in
a challenging and interactive forum. =20
We solicit submissions addressing the following topics:=20
=95	Web-scale geographic information retrieval frameworks
=95	Geo-referenced image and video annotation and retrieval
=95	Ranking for geographical search
=95	Semi-automatic or automatic structuring of geographic information
=95	Location based services
=95	Indexing of geographically relevant multimedia documents
=95	Visualization of geographic information
=95	User studies in geographic information search
=95	Domain specific applications=20
We target the edition of a journal Special Issue or of a book as a =
result of
the workshop.

Submission Instructions=20
Submissions must be written in English following the LNCS guidelines and
must not exceed 12 pages (for long papers) and 6 pages (for short =
papers)
including references and figures. All papers and posters will be =
refereed by
at least two reviewers.
LNCS guidelines: =
