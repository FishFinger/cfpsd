Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis 

Call Deadline: 30-Oct-2009 

Meeting Description:

ICCA10 is an international multidisciplinary meeting on conversation analysis, which focuses on talk-in-interaction in everyday conversation, institutional and mediated interaction.

Panel/Session: Multimodal Perspectives on Explaining 

Panel organizers: Janet Spreckels & Christiane Hohenstein

With life-long learning becoming the educational norm in many societies, explaining as a competence is highly in demand. Whereas previous studies have already shed light on certain forms of explaining within professional discourse scenarios - e.g. in the context of academic presentations (Hohenstein 2006) and doctor-patient interactions (Rehbein 1994, Hartog 1996) - we will expand this investigative focus to include both institutional and non-institutional scenarios. We will look at settings with different knowledge distribution (instructor-student relationship, group learning, etc.) and the various forms of interactivity and co-operation that develop during practically every process of explaining (cf. Spreckels 2009). In all settings, our concern is especially with the multimodality of explanation as determined by: 

1) Institutional and environmental factors such as training centres, classrooms, family homes etc. 
2) Equipment such as the combination of white boards, overhead projectors, books, student notes as found in many high schools; see Pitsch/Ayass 2008;
3) Multimodal practices and communicative resources such as gestures, mimics, gaze;
4) Multimodal practices and communicative resources in intercultural settings. More specifically - and in line with the conference theme of next year's ICCA - we aim to describe and illuminate the interplay between these multimodal factors and their relative effects on the explaining process as a whole. 

Call for Papers:

Submission of contributions for the 2010 International Conference on Conversation Analysis (ICCA10), to be organized by the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in Mannheim (Germany), July 4-8, 2010, starts on August 17, 2009. 

This is a call for scholarly papers which can relate to the full range of topics within the scope of conversation analysis. Particularly welcome are papers on the conference theme ''Multimodal Interaction,'' i.e. papers which deal with the close sequential analysis of the organization of bodily interaction in its full audio-visual detail, attending to the simultaneity of different modalities of interaction and their interactive co-ordination.

In addition to submitting abstracts for individual lectures (20 min. presentation + 10 min. discussion), researchers are invited to submit abstracts for data sessions, posters, and workshops via the online abstract submission system on the conference homepage: www.icca10.org. Here, you will also find information regarding registration and guidelines for submission.

Abstracts must not comprise more than 2000 characters and have to be submitted until October 30, 2009. Notifications of acceptance will be sent out at the end of January 2010.

The main conference language is English. Contributions in German and in French are also welcome.

For additional information, please visit: www.icca10.org.
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions: icca10@ids-mannheim.de.

We would be very pleased to receive your abstract and to welcome you to ICCA10 in Mannheim in July 2010.
