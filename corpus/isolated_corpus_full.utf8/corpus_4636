Meeting Description:

The inaugural conference of Pronunciation in Second Language Learning and
Teaching, September 17-19, 2009

To be held in conjunction with the Technology for Second Language Learning
(TSLL), 7th Annual Conference
Hosted by the programs in TESL/Applied Linguistics, Iowa State University
Ames, IA USA 

Call for Papers

Invited Speakers
Wayne Dickerson, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Tracey Derwing, University of Alberta

The importance of pronunciation in language learning and teaching is widely
recognized, yet there is far less agreement on which elements of pronunciation
are most critical for promoting intelligible speech and how these elements
should be addressed through instruction. There are also many questions about
how instruction in pronunciation should interface with speaking and listening
skills.  Finally, the rise of new technologies promises to change the future of
pronunciation teaching, with developments in speech recognition and speech
synthesis supplementing traditional uses of technology for self-directed learning.

This inaugural conference invites paper proposals or poster presentations on any
aspect of pronunciation teaching and learning, especially those related to how
pronunciation can be taught in relation to listening and speaking, and related
to innovative uses of technology in teaching pronunciation.  Papers will be
given in English, but papers addressing the teaching and learning of
pronunciation for any language are encouraged.

Please submit a 250-word abstract to Kimberly LeVelle (klevelle@iastate.edu) by
May 1, 2009 if you wish to present a paper or a poster at the conference. 
Acceptances will be sent out by May 15.  Please specify whether you would like
your abstract to be considered as a paper or a poster.  Include the name of the
presenter(s), affiliation, type of presentation, and contact information (email
address preferred).
