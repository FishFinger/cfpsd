Linguistic Field(s): Forensic Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 16-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

LINGUA, the scientific unit for linguistic analyses within the Swiss Federal office for Migration, organizes a Workshop on 'Linguistic analyses within the asylum procedure' in Lausanne/Switzerland in July 2008. 

The academic world has, for a couple of years now, taken interest into the linguistic analyses carried out and used by different asylum authorities. In 2004, a group of linguists edited a set of Guidelines designed for all practitioners in this field. Its concern is to ensure and guarantee a sufficient quality level. Its focus lies particularly on the profile required by people who carry out such analyses. 

The different units across Europe who carry out linguistic analyses within the asylum procedure have all different methods and requisites. Discussions among them and with the scientific world are therefore necessary in order to 1) explain the different procedures and frameworks that determine the units' working methods and 2) establish the criteria necessary from a scientific point of view to define the possibilities and the limits of such analyses since they can have important consequences on people's lives. 

During the Workshop - which will take place on 23rd-24th July, immediately following the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA) conference - different European units carrying out linguistic analyses for the asylum authorities will be presenting themselves. Also, LINGUA would like to invite different external presentations by people who are, in some way or other, involved with this kind of forensic analysis. For this, a call for papers is being opened. 

Call for Papers
 
Abstracts on different topics related to linguistic analyses for the determination of origin (LADO) within the asylum procedure are welcome. Topics related to LADO are listed below and, for each topic, a series of exemplary questions is given: 

- interviews done for LADO 
How should interviews be carried out in order to ensure sufficient data basis for a scientific report? What interview technique should be applied? Which interlocutors should be involved? What topics should be discussed? What influence does the presence of an interpreter have on the interview? 

- forensic sciences 
What kind of research has been done since the editing of the Guidelines? What is currently being done on LADO? What developments are possible in this field? What other aspects of forensic linguistics could/should LADO bring into its daily work in order to increase its quality? 

- editing of scientific reports How should a LADO report look like? What kind of answers can a LADO report furnish? What information is needed by the case officers/lawyers/courts in order to be able to reach a sound decision on an asylum case (e.g. minimal criteria, domains, linguistics analysis, country knowledge, result categories)? 

- profile of the experts carrying out LADO 
Who has to carry out LADO? What competences are necessary to lead an interview/to write a report/to make a linguistic analysis/to evaluate the country knowledge/etc.? To what extent does an analyst need/want assistance? To what extent does the staff of the linguistic analyses units have to be involved? 

- involvement of native speakers in the process 
What role can/should native speakers (not) play in LADO? What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a native speaker vs. a linguist or of being a member of the community under analysis vs. an outsider. 

- technical aspects 
How to ensure the best possible quality of recordings? What technical possibilities are at hand to ensure the analysts anonymity? How to transfer recordings to analysts all over the world? How to ensure protection of sensitive personal data on the recordings and the reports we deal with? 

- setting 
LADO is carried out within a very specific setting, namely that of the asylum procedure. What role does this setting play on the whole LADO procedure? How much do the analysts need to know about the setting in order to do a thorough job? Should legal aspects be considered when writing a LADO report? 

Presentation slots will be 20 minutes long + 10 minutes for questions. Longer slots for discussion will be planned during the workshop. Abstracts should have a maximal length of 250-300 words and should be submitted by email as an attachment (using Microsoft Word or, preferably, pdf) to Simonette Favaro at the following address: Simonette Favaro-Buschor@bfm.admin.ch

Abstracts should contain: 

Title of the presentation 
Name(s) of the author(s) 
Affiliation of the author(s) 
Both e-mail and postal addresses 
Any special audio-visual/IT requirements (OHPs, PowerPoint, video, DVD etc.) 
Deadline for the submission of abstracts: May 16th, 2008 
Notification of acceptance: end of May 2008 

The workshop is free of charges, except for a small fee covering lunches.

Full Title: Workshop on Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instrument(al)s 

Date: 03-Jul-2008 - 03-Jul-2008
Location: Sydney, Australia 
Contact Person: Mark Donohue
Meeting Email: instruments08@gmail.com
Web Site: http://www.unr.edu/~donohue/instruments08 

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of instruments and instrumentals, the insights that such studies provide and how they inform theoretical models. We would be particularly interested in papers that investigate the impact of studies of instrumentals on theories of syntax and case marking. 

This workshop is being held in conjunction with LingFest taking place in Sydney during July. Other neighbouring events include AFLA15, LFG2008, ALS 2008 and ALI 2008. 

Final Call for Papers

Workshop on Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instruments and Instrumentals

Organisers: Mark Donohue and Cathryn Donohue 

The phenomena we plan to focus on include: 
- syncretisms involving the coding of instruments; this might involve syncretisms with structural or other semantic cases, or syncretisms with other functions entirely; 
- overlaps in syntactic behaviour between instruments and subjects, or instruments and objects; 
- discussion of the termhood of instruments cross-linguistically or in language-specific settings. 

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks relevant to the workshop theme. All material is to be submitted in .pdf format. Applicants are limited to one single-authored and one joint-authored abstract. 

Abstracts should be anonymous and should not exceed one A4 page with a 1in/2.5cm margin on each side and in 12 pt font. A second page (in a separate file) should be submitted with the title of your paper and names, affiliations, and preferred contact details of the author(s). 

Abstracts are to be submitted via email to the conference address (instruments08@gmail.com). 

Submission Deadline: May 1, 2008. Notifications of acceptance will be circulated by May 15, 2008 

This workshop will be held in conjunction with a group of linguistics events being held at the University of Sydney in July under the general name of LingFest2008. Other events include AFLA15, ALI 2008, ALS 2008, LFG 2008 and ALAA 2008. For more information on any of these events, please visit the LingFest website at http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au
