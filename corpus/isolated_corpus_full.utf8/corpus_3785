2nd Call for Papers

EACL 2009 Workshop on COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF COMPUTATIONAL LANGUAGE =

ACQUISITION

30 or 31 March 2009
Athens, Greece

http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cognitive/

-----------------------------------------------

Workshop Description
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This workshop is focused on the relevance of computational learning methods =

for research on human language acquisition. Developing and applying such =

computational techniques that can improve our understanding of human =

language acquisition will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general, =

but will also reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to =

develop useful language models.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of =

NLP, machine learning, artificial intelligence, (psycho)linguistics, etc. =

who are interested in the relevance of computational techniques for =

understanding human language learning.

The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational and =

cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help =

initiate interdisciplinary research projects. Success in this type of =

research requires close collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. =

To this end, interdisciplinary workshops can play a key role in advancing =

existing and initiating new research. This was demonstrated by some =

successful events like the previous edition of this workshop held at ACL =

2007.


Areas of interest
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning

- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language =

acquisition

- Computational models of various aspects of language acquisition, and =

their interaction with each other

- Computational models of the evolution of language

- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human =

language acquisition

- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its =

impact on the acquisition task

- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information =

(related to e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and =

discourse) and their relevance to research on human language acquisition

- Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and =

weakly-supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, =

symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) =

from the cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of =

completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with =

previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be =

judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of =

presentation, usability, and significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the EACL 2009 =

main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, =

including references. We strongly recommend the use of either the LaTeX =

style file or the Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be found at =

http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the =

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and other =

references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted =

papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than December 19, =

2008 using the submission webpage that will be available soon.

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. Authors =

of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce =

camera-ready versions of their papers for inclusion in the EACL workshop =

proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.
