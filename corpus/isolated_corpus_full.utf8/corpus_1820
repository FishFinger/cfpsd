Human Issues in Interaction and Interactive Interfaces

http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2007/hi4workshop

-----------
HCSNet (www.hcsnet.edu.au) and HxI (www.hxi.org.au) are organising a joint workshop on Human Issues in Interaction and Interactive Interfaces. This workshop is designed to bring together researchers interested in a range of issues, with a focus on the non-technical, related to human-machine interaction and computer-mediated human-human interaction. A specific sub-theme will be mediating collaboration and community between humans in distributed environments, in particular as targetted by HxI's Bracetto project. The aim is to identify shared interests, understand different perspectives, and to take first steps towards developing future collaborations. HCSNet will fund travel for a number of Australian participants from outside the Sydney area.

Participation and Format

We welcome participation from a range of disciplines and perspectives, as outlined above, from both academia and industry, and we would like to involve as many as possible in discussion.

    * Attendees are asked to submit a short abstract of up to about 250 words. Submissions should contain:
          o research interests pertinent to the workshop theme; and/or
          o thoughts on issues deemed to be important and potential points of interaction with other disciplines.
    * Attendees should indicate whether they wish to give a SHORT presentation of 5-10 minutes, or a LONGER presentation of 10-15 minutes. A longer presentation should contain a strong position statement, discussion issue, or an interesting minor result.

Please submit abstracts to Lawrence Cavedon, lcavedon@cs.rmit.edu.au, by the date indicated below.

The format of the workshop will be designed to promote interaction and collaboration. As well as presentations, we plan panels, discussion issues raised by industry/user groups, and break-out sessions.

Invited Speakers

Gloria Mark of the University of California at Irvine is confirmed as an invited speaker.
