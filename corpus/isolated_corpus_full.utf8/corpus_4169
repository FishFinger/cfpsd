FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

FIRST VIGO-NEWCASTLE-SANTIAGO-LEUVEN
INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON
'THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOUN PHRASE IN ENGLISH:
SYNCHRONIC AND DIACHRONIC EXPLORATIONS' (NP1)

Vigo, 2-3 October 2009

We are pleased to announce the First Vigo-Newcastle-Santiago-Leuven
International Workshop on 'The structure of the noun phrase in
English: synchronic and diachronic explorations' (NP1), to be held at
the University of Vigo (Spain) on 2-3 October 2009.

Although there exists an enormous literature on many aspects of nouns
and noun phrases (NPs) in English, there are still fundamental issues
in their structure and distribution that remain unsolved. These
involve matters like the structural relations between different types
of NP elements, the relation between internal and external properties
of NPs, the parallels (or lack thereof) between verbal and nominal
constituents, the factors responsible for the textual frequencies of
various NP-related phenomena, and the contribution of different types
of NPs to the information structure of texts. This workshop aims at
bringing together researchers who are currently looking at the English
NP from different points of view (theoretical, structural, functional,
textual and descriptive).

We would therefore like to invite presentations concerned with any
topic involving NPs, including the following:
- NP complexity: the relationship between grammatical function and NP compl=
exity
- NP types, including binominal phrases, discontinuous NPs and
possessive constructions
- the structural representation of NPs and their constituents
- strategies of premodification, postmodification and complementation in th=
e NP
- apposition in the NP
- headedness and NPs
- the exploration of the implications of particular theoretical
frameworks for NP structure: diachronic, syntactic,
construction-based, cognitive perspectives on all of the above

Invited speakers:
- Douglas Biber (Northern Arizona University)
- Evelien Keizer (Universiteit van Amsterdam)
- John Payne (The University of Manchester)

Abstracts must be submitted in MS Word or RTF format as an e-mail
attachment to np1@uvigo.es by 30 March 2009. The e-mail should use the
subject header 'NP1 abstract'. Abstracts should be one page in length
(single-spaced), excluding references, and be written in standard
12-point font. The page should be headed only by the title of the
paper and not mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or
addresses. The accompanying e-mail should include:
(a) Title of the paper
(b) Name(s) of the author(s)
(c) Institutional affiliation(s)
(d) E-mail address(es)
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 30 April 2009.

Publication:
Authors of papers accepted for presentation will be invited to submit
their papers for publication in a special journal issue or volume with
an international publisher. Papers will be subjected to refereeing.

Important dates:
30 March 2009: Deadline for abstract submission
30 April 2009: Notification of acceptance or rejection
1 September: (Re-)Submission of 1-page abstract for conference booklet
2-3 October: Workshop at Vigo, Spain

Workshop organisation: NP1 is organised by the Language Variation and
Textual Categorisation (LVTC) research group at the University of Vigo
(http://lvtcuvigo.blogspot.com), in cooperation with:
- the School of English at the University of Newcastle
- the VLCG Research Group at the University of Santiago de Compostela
- the Functional Linguistics Leuven (FLL) Research group at the
University of Leuven.
Providing there is sufficient interest, we anticipate having follow-up
workshops in later years.

Contact person: Javier Perez-Guerra (jperez@uvigo.es)

Workshop webpage: http://webs.uvigo.es/np1

This workshop is sponsored by the English Linguistics Circle (ELC), a
network coordinated by Professor Teresa Fanego involving four research
groups based at the Universities of Santiago de Compostela and Vigo
(http://elc.org.es).
