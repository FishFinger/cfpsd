Full Title: Colloquium on the Typology of Creole Languages 

Date: 20-Aug-2008 - 23-Aug-2008
Location: Toronto, Ontario, Canada 
Contact Person: Parth Bhatt
Meeting Email: parth.bhatt@utoronto.ca

Linguistic Field(s): Typology 

Language Family(ies): Creole 

Call Deadline: 12-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this colloquium is to further our understanding of the linguistic properties of Creole languages. More specifically, this colloquium will seek to examine the typological status of Creoles by examining empirical evidence concerning the morphological, phonological, syntactic and semantic properties found in Creole languages. The possibility of establishing sub-groups of Creole languages and the relation between the linguistic features found in Creole languages and the linguistic features of the languages in the contact situation that gave rise to the Creole will also be studied. Overall the contributions will further our understanding of the typological characteristics of Creole languages. 

2nd Call for Papers

Colloquium on the Typology of Creole languages

August 20th-23rd 2008

University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

Papers with a cross-linguistic perspective (i.e. involving more than a single Creole or other language) dealing with the following topics are encouraged:

a) Comparisons of the linguistic properties of Creole languages in general;
b) Comparisons of the linguistic properties of Creole languages sharing a common lexifier language;
c) Comparisons of the linguistic properties of Creole languages with different lexifier languages;
d) Comparisons between linguistic properties of Creole languages and those of other language families;
e) Investigations of the possible sub-groupings of Creole languages based on linguistic properties;
f) Contrasts between Creole languages and non-Creole languages.
 
All those participants whose papers are accepted by the selection committee will have free accommodation at the Sutton Place Hotel in Toronto during the colloquium. Space is, however, limited to a total of fifteen participants and seven invited speakers.
