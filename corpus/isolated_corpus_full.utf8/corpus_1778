Dear HCSNet Member,
 
As the year rolls on we get ever closer to SummerFest '07!
 
This year's SummerFest will be held from 3-7 December at The University of New South Wales. Registration will open on Monday 17 September so book early to avoid missing out.

We are currently calling for submissions for two components of SummerFest '07: the speed papers session and the student poster session. 

The student poster session is designed to help students get to know one another and to hear about research and hot topics in a range of disciplines. The poster session will feature plenty of food and drinks to keep the atmosphere lively, informal and social and along the way we hope youâll get to know your peers and receive useful feedback on your own research ideas.  If you would like to participate in the student poster session please submit a title and 200 word abstract by 24 September 2007. More details can be found on our website at http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest07/posters

The speed papers session is a fun, fast-paced way to get to know others at SummerFest. The speed paper concept is somewhat like speed dating - you get 4 slides and just 4 minutes to tell the assembled audience about a project you are already doing, or would like to do. Everyone in the audience has a form on which they can scribble relevant comments and feedback on your project. You then get to do the same for the other speed papers.  If you would like to participate in the speed papers session please submit a title and 200 word abstract by 24 September 2007. More details can be found on our website at http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest07/speedpapers
 
Travel subsidies* to attend SummerFest '07 will be available to individuals who present either a student poster or speed paper.
 
If you require further information please contact Kym Buckley at HCSNet ky.buckley@uws.edu.au. We look forward to having your involvement in SummerFest '07.

* Travel subsidies will be available for Australian-based participants living outside of Sydney only.
