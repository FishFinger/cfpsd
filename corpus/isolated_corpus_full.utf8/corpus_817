CALL FOR PAPERS

STUDENT RESEARCH WORKSHOP at ACL-07

June 25th-27th, 2007

Prague, Czech Republic

Submission deadline: January 23, 2007

*********************************************************************

 

1. General Invitation for Submissions

 

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the
general audience and from selected panelists - experienced researchers who
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

 

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop. As
the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis is on
work in progress. Original and unpublished research is therefore invited on
all aspects of computational linguistics including, but not limited to, the
following topic areas:

 

. pragmatics and discourse

. semantics and lexicons

. syntax and grammars

. phonetics, phonology, and morphology

. linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language

. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering

. summarization and paraphrasing

. speech recognition and speech synthesis

. corpus-based language modeling

. multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids

. spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems

. multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems

. narrative understanding systems

 

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos. More
information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page,
http://www.acl2007.org/.

 

2. Submission Requirements

 

The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with the
opportunity of presenting their work in a formal setting. Submission will
therefore normally be open only to students who have settled on their thesis
direction but who still have significant research left to do; those students
in the final stages of their thesis and those who have already presented at
an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop should submit to the main
conference instead.

 

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers should
clearly indicate directions for future research wherever appropriate. The
papers may have more than one author; however, all authors MUST be students
(graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted are eligible only if they have
not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the submission page.

 

3. Submission Procedure

 

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly recommend
the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for
this year's conference. These will be available from the web pages of
ACL-07. A description of the format is also available in case you are unable
to use these style files directly. Submission must be electronic. The only
accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. More details regarding
the submission procedure will be posted on the workshop website.

 

4. Reviewing Procedure

 

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by the
Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewers. Each
submission will be matched with a mixed panel of  student and senior
researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on the
results of the review.

 

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make sure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should likewise
not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the paper submitted for
review. For example, rather than this: "We showed previously (Smith, 2001),
...", use citations such as: "Smith (2001) previously showed ...".

 

5. Schedule

 

The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time January 23,
2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be automatically
disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after receipt.
Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by e-mail) on March 23,
2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final
camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance notice.

 

Important Dates:

 

Paper submission deadline: January 23, 2007

Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007

Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007

Conference date: June 25-27, 2007

 

6. Travel Grants

 

Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to the
Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel grants, please
contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Research Workshop.
