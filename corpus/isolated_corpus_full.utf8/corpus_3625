Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

Within language studies we are constantly confronted with boundaries and
interfaces: for example between languages, between countries, between dialect
areas, and between various aspects and components of linguistic study. This
conference aims to examine where these occur, to see whether boundaries can and
need to be drawn or grey areas declared, and to map out further areas of
investigation. 

Call for Papers


Proposals are requested for papers investigating the interplay of traditionally
identified elements of linguistic study under the general rubric of interfaces.
It was our dissatisfaction with some of the boundaries imposed by linguists
which led us to propose this conference on how they might be reassessed or
challenged. 

To give a couple of simple examples: the traditional division between 'syntax'
and 'morphology' which is central to much modern linguistic thinking is
difficult to apply to French, where non-orthographic definitions of 'words'
prove elusive. Likewise, a boundary between pragmatics and sociolinguistics is
in practice extremely difficult to draw, rendering the analysis of a number of
common linguistic phenomena problematical. Expanding on the success of the
inaugural conference in April 2008, we invite topics dealing with: 

- Categories and orthodoxies (investigations into the validity of accepted
grammatical categories)
- Contact and conflict (how are our conceptions of individual languages, e.g.
English, Scots, affected by contact with other varieties?)
- Language and cognition (how does extralinguistic knowledge affect linguistic
competence, and how reliably can such knowledge be labeled sociolinguistic,
psycholinguistic, pragmatic etc.?)

This list is not exclusive and we welcome papers covering other areas of
interface which are not mentioned here.

Time allotted to papers is 20 minutes plus 10 minutes discussion time.
Presenters will also get the opportunity to publish their papers in a special
volume after the conference. 

For each submission, provide a title and an abstract between 150 - 200 words.
Please send abstracts as an MS-Word attachment to the following email address:
K.D.Kuttig (at) kent.ac.uk

Deadlines:
For all abstracts: 31st January 2009

Meeting Description:

European Second Language Association 19th Annual Conference 


Call for Papers

EUROSLA 19 invites proposals for presentations in the form of conference papers
in parallel sessions, posters, and thematic panels, as well as presentations as
part of a Doctoral Workshop. 

Conference Papers and Posters
Abstracts are welcome in any area of Second Language Acquisition. Abstracts of
400-500 words (including the title and references) should be sent as an e-mail
attachment in Word to eurosla19@ucc.ie  2 copies of the abstract should be
submitted: one copy should be anonymous, while the other should include your
name, academic affiliation, and postal and e-mail addresses. Please indicate in
the abstract whether you wish it to be considered as a conference paper for
presentation during the parallel sessions or as a poster.

Thematic Panels
Proposals for thematic panels are also welcome, in which case the organizer of
the panel should follow the same guidelines as above in their proposal which
should include a general abstract about the theme of the panel, a list of the
proposed speakers in the panel, and the abstracts for their individual papers.
The number of thematic panels and the amount of time available for each will be
dependent on the final conference programme.

Doctoral Workshop
A Doctoral Workshop will also form part of the conference. This workshop offers
students the opportunity to receive constructive feedback on their work from
established researchers in the field. In particular, the workshop will focus on
issues to do with methodology such as in relation to data analysis and research
design. Proposals for short presentations during the workshop should follow the
same guidelines as above. The aim and theoretical framework of your work should
be clearly indicated, along with the methodological questions on which feedback
would be welcome. Please indicate 'Doctoral Workshop' in your abstract.
