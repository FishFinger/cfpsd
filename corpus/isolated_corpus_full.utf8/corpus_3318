Meeting Description:

Translating Beyond East and West

The 11th Prague International Conference in Translation and Interpreting Studies

14 - 16 October 2009

?pork Palace
Hybernsk√° 3
Prague, Czech Republic

Organized by:
The Institute of Translation Studies
Faculty of Philosophy and Arts
Charles University in Prague 

Call for Papers

The notion of ''East and West'' has been used in a variety of contexts in the
past to account for or to even rationalize political, social, and cultural
differences. In many cases, this has led to misunderstanding and conflict. One
typical example is Central Europe and the Iron Curtain. Another fitting example
on the occasion of this conference is Prague. 

Owing to its position in the middle of Europe, Prague, and Czech society as a
whole, has always struggled with its identity in relation to ''East and West''
and has been strongly influenced by foreign cultures and political regimes
throughout its long history.

Accordingly, Prague has often been referred to as a crossroads of Europe between
the East and the West, between Capitalism and Socialism, between Catholicism and
Protestantism, and between Slavonic and Germanic culture.
However, are traditional, bipolar world views such as ''East and West'' valid
and acceptable today?

In a world of high-tech communication, globalization, and change, we need,
rather, to look beyond traditional, narrow world views, such as ''East and
West'', and open channels up to more productive modes of discourse. Undoubtedly,
the activities of translators and interpreters play a crucial role in this
ongoing process of change and in shaping our understanding of the world.

This conference aims to bring together researchers and PhD students not only to
discuss these ideas but also to question the traditional frameworks associated
with such concepts as ''East and West''. Our attention will be focused on
translation and interpreting as a means of reaching a better understanding of
the world, breaking the barriers and stereotypes underlying certain traditional
views, and moving beyond... or translating beyond ''East and West''.

We are currently accepting abstracts for papers.

Researchers, scholars, and PhD students interested in presenting at the
conference should send their abstract to the following e-mail address:
prague@ff.cuni.cz 

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 30 March 2009.

Abstracts may be a maximum of 300 words and are to be written in English. 

You will be informed of whether your abstract has been accepted by 15 May 2009
at the latest.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Examining and critically assessing traditional world views/paradigms (e.g.
East and West) with respect to translation
- Innovative or provocative theories and/or methods in translation and
interpreting studies
- Translation history: documenting and narrating past world views/paradigms
(e.g. East and West) through translation
- Translation studies from the viewpoint of philosophy, literary theory,
sociology, cultural studies, gender studies, etc.
- Russian Formalism/Prague Structuralism as a source of western translation
studies concepts and theory
- Interpreting in teams at EU institutions: interpreters from the East and the
West - challenges, knowledge gained, new research in the profession, and
translator training
- Community interpreting and its role in assisting foreign nationals, immigrants
and asylum seekers
- Issues relating to localization, globalization and internationalization

We reserve the right not to accept abstracts received after the deadline or
abstracts longer than 300 words.

Following the selection procedure, the papers will be grouped according to
themes and placed in special panels or sessions at our discretion.

Regular papers should be presented in English.

Plenary session presentations may be in English, Czech, German, French, Spanish,
or Russian. Interpreting services into English are available for the plenary
session. If you would like to have your presentation interpreted for the plenary
session, please contact our interpreting team at the following address:
prague@ff.cuni.cz

Workshop 2008

Workshop: Corpus Profiling for Information Retrieval and Natural Language
Processing 
(at IIiX 2008)

18 October 2008
London
Submission deadline: 15 August 2008
http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/corpus-profiling/index.php

Purpose:
We aim to bring together people from different research communities interested
in exploring how corpus characteristics affect the behaviour of techniques in
information retrieval and natural language processing, and to set out a roadmap
for a shared research agenda.

It is well known in NLP and IR that the effectiveness of a technique depends on
both the data on which it is deployed and its match with the task at hand. In
1973, Sp√§rck-Jones attributed differing degrees of success at automatic
classification to differences in dataset characteristics. Since Croft and Harper
(1979), IR performance has repeatedly been related to collection size and other
features, though no upper bound has been found.

The importance of data and task dependencies has been highlighted in IR,
anaphora resolution, automatic summarization and recently, in word sense
disambiguation. Many web/enterprise web retrieval systems rely on URL
properties, link graph properties, click streams, and so on, with performance
dependent on the degree to which this evidence is present and meaningful in a
particular corpus.

Systematically exploring features that can be used effectively to characterise
corpora, has been missing from IR/NLP research. This creates problems with
replicability of experimental results and the development of applications.

The time is right to pursue this dependence systematically to address topics in
tracking the effect of dataset profile on technique performance. Over the past
15 years, the approaches of several subject areas have converged with IR, as
large corpora and test collections assume central importance in research
methodologies. These areas have highlighted issues surrounding the role of data. 

Workshop Format:
The workshop will be a day long, in conjunction with the Information Interaction
in Context (IIiX'2008, http://irsg.bcs.org/iiix2008/). The workshop will have
three components:

(1)  invited talks in the morning, introducing the background from different
perspectives
(2) two afternoon sessions, presenting peer-reviewed papers
(3) a panel discussion (panel composed of presenters and the organizers).

Topics of Interest:
We welcome original research or position papers. We particularly encourage
postgraduate students or postdoctoral researchers to submit papers. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

- Suitable features to characterise text/language variety, capturing known
effects on technique performance with respect to a task;
- Tasks that depend on aspects of corpus profiles, (e.g., the positive
correlation of QA performance with fact frequency in a corpus);
- Limitations of context-independent frequency-based measures, and exploration
of measures that highlight complex dependencies;
- Tools/techniques for characterising a feature or the extent to which it is
manifested in a corpus;
- Evaluation methodologies for testing feature candidates relative to
task/technique;
- Learnability of features (cf. meta-level learning for classification algorithms).

Important Dates:
15 August 2008: Paper submission due
12 September 2008: Notification of acceptance/rejection
26 September 2008: Camera-ready due
18 October 2008: Workshop

Submission Guidelines:
Original technical papers, short papers and position papers are all welcome.
Please ensure that your submission does not exceed 5,000 words in length. Use 10
point font size, double column for body text, and 12 point bold for headings.
Please send your submission in PDF to all the three organizers
(A.Deroeck@open.ac.uk; d.song@open.ac.uk; udo@essex.ac.uk) with subject ''Corpus
Profiling workshop submission''.

We will publish the accepted papers electronically through BCS's Electronic
Workshops in Computing (eWiC), together with the extended abstracts of invited
talks, a summary of the panel discussion. We will seek to pursue the research
thread through further workshops at relevant conferences. We plan to organize a
post-workshop special issue on a suitable IR or NLP related journal.
