Location: Seoul, Korea, South 
Contact Person: Henry Y. Chang
Meeting Email: henryylc@gate.sinica.edu.tw
Web Site: http://cil18.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:
Although substantial progress in argument realization has been achieved within
Indo-European languages (Levin 2005, Goldberg 2006, among others), it is
relatively less known how semantic arguments realize in syntactic structures in
Asian languages. It also remains to be seen what impacts the findings from the
study of Asian languages have on the theory of argument realization. This
workshop aims to fill this gap by bringing together researchers who work on
Asian languages. The workshop will be focused on but not limited to the
following issues: 
1. What are the principles and the constraints governing argument realization?
Specifically, what role does the Thematic Hierarchy play in determining argument
realization (Jackendoff 1990, Bresnan and Kanerva 1989, Grimshaw 1990, Van Valin
and Lappola 1997, and others)? 
2. How does argument realization vary across languages? How is the variation
captured in principled way? 
3. How are peripheral semantic arguments such as location, time, and beneficiary
grammatically represented? 
4. How are causer and causee grammatically represented? 

Please be advised that the deadline has been extended to August 31, 2007.
