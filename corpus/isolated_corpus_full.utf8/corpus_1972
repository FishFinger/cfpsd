Meeting Description

CUNY Phonology Forum Conference on the Syllable in Phonology

Sponsored by the MA/PhD Program in Linguistics at the City University of New
York and the CUNY Phonology Forum

January 17th-18th, 2008 at the CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
City 

Call for Papers

We invite papers from any subdivision of cognitive science such as formal
linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, philosophy, psychology,
etc. We also encourage diversity in methods so we welcome both formal and
experimental approaches to the topic of syllables.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to throw the field of discussion to all matters related
to the syllable in phonology or phonetics.

Do syllables exist?

Are syllables derived? Is syllable structure ever lexically distinctive?

What is the internal structure of the syllable? 

Are syllables hierarchically dominated by other prosodic categories?

What principles guide the syllabification of a string of phonemes?

What aspects of syllables are referred to by morphological and phonological
rules/constraints?

How do phonetic syllables relate to phonological syllables (and vice versa)?

What is the role of sonority for syllables?

Invited Speakers:
Harry van der Hulst, University of Connecticut
Paul Kiparsky, Stanford University
Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, MIT
Donca Steriade, MIT
Bert Vaux, University of Cambridge

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts should consist of a one page description of the paper (12pt font) with
a second page for references, data and/or illustrations. Talks will be 20
minutes with 10 minutes for discussion. Abstracts should be emailed as an
attachment (PDF format) to syllable@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than
midnight, November 10, 2007. Authors should include title of the paper, name of
the author(s) and affiliation in the body of the email.

Important Dates and Information:
November 10, 2007 deadline for abstracts submission
December 1, 2007 notification of acceptance
January 17-18, 2008 Conference on the syllable in phonology

Full Title: International Conference on Practical Linguistics of Japanese 
Short Title: ICPLJ6 

Date: 01-Mar-2008 - 02-Mar-2008
Location: San Francisco, CA, USA

Subject Language(s): Japanese (jpn)

Call Deadline: 02-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description
- ICPLJ6 is intended to bring together researchers on the cutting edge of
Japanese linguistics and to offer a forum in which their research results can be
presented in a form that is useful to those desiring practical applications in
the fields of teaching Japanese as a second/foreign language and
computer-assisted language learning (CALL) technology.
- All topics in linguistics will be fully considered, including: phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, lexicon, pragmatics (discourse analysis), and
second language acquisition (bilingualism).
- Abstracts submitted must represent original, unpublished research. 

Submission Guidelines
All submissions should be received by November 2, 2007.
(We regret that we cannot accept submissions by fax or e-mail.)
- Please send us three copies of a clearly titled one-page summary, on which the
author is not identified (on A4 or letter-size paper, in 12 point type, with at
least 1.25 inch [approximately 3 cm] margins on all sides). This summary will be
used for review; we may ask the submission of longer summaries for inclusion in
the conference program book if your abstract is accepted. Examples, figures,
tables, and references may be given on a second page. Please note the following:
(1) All conference papers will be selected on the basis of submitted summaries.
Thus, any information that may reveal your identity should not be included in
the summary.
(2) Summaries either in Japanese or English will be accepted. However, if the
language in which you would like to give your presentation differs from the
language of your written summary, please let us know.
(3) No changes in the title or the authors' names will be possible after acceptance.
- For each author, please attach one copy of the information form printed at the
bottom of this sheet.

Deadline
All submissions must be received by Friday, November 2, 2007.
(Please do not send summaries by e-mail or fax. Information regarding the
previous conferences may be accessed at: http://www.sfsu.edu/~japanese/conference/.)
