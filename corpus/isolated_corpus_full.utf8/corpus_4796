As a result of new circumstances, the Conference Committee is welcoming a second
round of proposals for what will be a very limited number of accepted papers on
historical and contemporary topics that explore the connections between
linguistic and political patriotism. Very special consideration will be given to
papers presented in French on questions relating to French Canada.

Les circonstances nous permettent maintenant d'accueillir une deuxième série de 
propositions de communications sur des thèmes historiques et contemporains qui 
examinent les rapports entre le patriotisme linguistique et le patriotisme
politique. Le nombre de place étant très limité, une considération particulière
sera accordée aux propositions qui porteront sur le Canada français et qui
seront présentées en français. 

Date limite: le 27 mars 2009

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
