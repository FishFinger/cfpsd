> Purpose / History:
>
>    This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
>    researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
>    computing.  Many of the 24 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
>    premier conferences for presentation of advances in their  
> respective
>    fields.  Most of these conferences have been evaluated and  
> determined
>    to be top tier research conferences
>    (see http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/index.html for an  
> example).
>    We anticipate to have 2000 or more attendees from over 75 countries
>    participating in the 2007 joint conferences.
>
>    The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
>    conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
>    place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
>    exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
>    model used to form these annual conferences facilitates  
> communication
>    among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
>    computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
>    inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering)  
> and
>    outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
>    applications) will be covered during the conferences.
>
> Proposal for Organizing Sessions/Workshops:
>
>    Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from  
> different
>    authors (12 papers in the case of workshops).  The session chairs
>    will be responsible for all aspects of their sessions; including,
>    soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...  The names of session
>    chairs will appear as Associate Editors in the conference  
> proceedings
>    and on the cover of the books.
>
>    Proposals to organize sessions should include the following  
> information:
>    name and address (+ email) of proposer, title of session, a 100- 
> word
>    description of the topic of the session, the name of the  
> conference the
>    session is submitted for consideration, and a short description  
> on how
>    the session will be advertised (in most cases, session proposers  
> solicit
>    papers from colleagues and researchers whose work is known to the
>    session proposer).  E-mail your proposal to H. R. Arabnia  
> (address is
>    given above).  We would like to receive the proposals by  
> December 29, 2006.
>
> Submission of Papers:
>
>    Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft/full paper
>    (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
>    H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 20, 2007. E-mail submissions in MS  
> document or
>    PDF formats are preferable (Fax or postal submissions are also  
> fine.)
>    All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the  
> authors
>    of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting
>    format to prepare their papers for publication.)
>
>    The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be  
> limited to
>    7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously  
> published
>    or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The first  
> page of
>    the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name,  
> affiliation,
>    postal address, email address, and telephone number for each  
> author.
>    The first page should also identify the name of the author who will
>    be presenting the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical
>    keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.   
> Finally,
>    the name of the conference that the paper is being submitted to  
> must be
>    stated on the first page.
>
>    Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,  
> impact,
>    and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts in  
> the field
>    who are independent of the conference program committee.  The  
> referees'
>    evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of the program
>    committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of the  
> track that
>    the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make the final  
> decision.
>    Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one member  
> of the
>    program committee.
>
> Members of Program and Organizing Committees:
>
>    The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy
>    of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing;  
> artificial
>    intelligence; imaging science; databases; simulation; software
>    engineering; embedded systems; internet and web technologies;
>    communications; computer security; and bioinformatics.) The Program
>    Committee for individual conferences is currently being  
> compiled. Those
>    interested in joining the Program Committee should email H. R.  
> Arabnia
>    (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation and
>    position, complete mailing address, email address, tel/fax numbers,
>    a short biography together with research interests and the name of
>    the conference offering to help with.
>
> Location of Conferences:
>
>    The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort hotel,  
> Las Vegas,
>    Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by hotels).  The  
> Monte
>    Carlo Resort is a mega hotel with excellent conference  
> facilities and
>    over 3,000 rooms.  The hotel is minutes from the airport with 24- 
> hour
>    shuttle service to and from the airport.  This hotel has many
>    recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools,  
> sunning
>    decks, Easy River water ride, wave pool, lighted tennis courts,
>    health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool, sauna, ...),
>    nightly shows, snack bars, many restaurants, shopping area,  
> bars, ...
>    Many of these attractions are open 24 hours a day and most are  
> suitable
>    for families and children.  The negotiated room rate for conference
>    attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within walking distance
>    from most other attractions (major shopping areas, night clubs,  
> free
>    street shows, Golf courses, ...).
