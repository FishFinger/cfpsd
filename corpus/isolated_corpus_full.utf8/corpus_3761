Meeting Description:

Praxiling UMR 5267 CNRS (Université Paul Valéry, Montpellier 3), and the
Laboratoire des Sciences de la Parole, Académie Universitaire Wallonie-Bruxelles
(Université de Mons-Hainaut), co-organize an international workshop on nasals
and nasalization in phonetics and phonology. 

The workshop will be held on Friday June 5th 2009 from 9 AM to 6.30 PM, Grand
Amphithéâtre de la Délégation régionale du CNRS, 1919, route de Mende, F-34293
Montpellier cedex 5. 

Call for Papers

From the first linguistic descriptions mentioning nasal sounds (as old as
Panini's, 5th century BC) to the phonetic and phonological studies in the 20th
and 21st century, passing by the work of comparative grammarians in the 19th
century, nasalization has always been a topic of investigation for those who are
interested in human language and speech. With the beginnings of experimental
phonetics, from the end of the 19th century, essential steps were taken towards
a better comprehension of nasal phenomena, via the development of inventive
instrumentation devices (Rousselot, 1897). From the middle of the 20th century,
the basic principles of the acoustics and perception of nasalization were
determined (Delattre, 1954, House & Stevens, 1956, Fant, 1960). Approximately at
the same moment, several physicists investigated the specific disabilities of
cleft palate speakers, particularly hypernasality (Warren et Dubois, 1964). 

Phonetic studies in the 60's and the 70's yielded important findings concerning
the production of nasal sounds, including in pathological speech. A variety of
data and techniques were used, such as (cine)radiography, electromyography,
fiberoscopy, aerodynamics (Björk, 1961, Fritzell, 1969, Bell-Berti , 1976,
Benguerel et al., 1977, Weinberg et al., 1968), and devices specifically
dedicated to the study of nasalization were designed (e.g. the nasograph: Ohala,
1971). Nasal studies much contributed to the elaboration of coarticulation
theories and models (for a review, see Chafcouloff & Marchal, 1999). More
recently, in the 80's and the 90's, our understanding of the perception of
nasalization has made much progress with the development of synthesized speech
and modelling (Beddor, 1993, Kingston et MacMillan, 1995, Krakow et al., 1988,
Maeda, 1993). 

Despite these progresses, nasalization is one of those phenomena still resisting
to extensive linguistic knowledge. Nasalization processes can only be described
in linguistic terms using a rare complexity in instrumental techniques, as well
as in methods and concepts, and they are hard to integrate with the most
powerful models and theories. Although there have been numerous studies on
various aspects of the production of nasal sounds, we still lack a fully
operational data-driven model of nasal production including the non linearities
between the articulatory, aerodynamic and acoustic phase. Moreover, despite the
first advances made on articulatory modelling (Maeda, 1982, 1993), it remains
unclear how exactly the spatial extent of the nasal gesture is related with the
percept of nasalization. Also, the issue of the realization of nasalization in
the time domain still remain vastly unresolved. Each language has its own
coarticulation patterns, involving specific gestural adjustments and
coordination patterns, but the phonetic and phonological constraints that limit
(or determine) these patterns still need to be established, e.g. the role of
prosodic structure (Vaissière, 1988, Fougeron, 2001), the relationships within a
given phoneme inventory, the covariation between nasalization and other
features/gestures (Solé, 2007) such as voicing and frication for consonants and
tongue height and place of articulation for vowels, etc. The perception of nasal
coarticulation across languages is among the most promising directions of
research towards a better understanding of nasal phenomena (Beddor, 2007). 

Finally, the diversity of human languages generates undefinite variability. Many
languages of the world still remain poorly described, and some of them host
intriguing nasal phenomena. Whether on pre-nasalized nasal fricatives in
kinyarwanda (Demolin, 2005) or on pre and post-oralized nasal stops in karitiana
(Storto & Demolin, 2008), the most recent work on the world's languages nasal
variants allows researchers to test previous hypotheses and modelling proposals. 

Indeed, although nasals and nasalization challenge the researcher in speech and
language sciences, at the same moment they provide a valuable opportunity to
investigate the core of the language faculty, in both its functional and
cognitive dimensions. Nasalization processes give us an opportunity to
investigate what is universal, and what is language-specific, in the sound
patterns we work on describing and explaining (e.g. Maddieson, 2007). Similarly,
nasal studies have contributed, and will undoubtedly contribute again, in
designing and developing tools, theories and models on basic issues in phonetics
and phonology such as acoustic and articulatory modelling, coarticulation
theories, foreign language acquisition models, etc. Nasal studies can play a
central role in our quest towards a better understanding of human spoken language. 

The aim of this international workshop is to allow researchers around the world
to meet and exchange about their recent work on nasals and nasalization. We
welcome every submission concerning nasalization, in particular those concerning
: speech production (articulatory measurements, aerodynamic studies, acoustic
analysis, etc.), perception of nasalization, phonological studies, phonetic
universals, modelling, poorly described languages, pathological and clinical
aspects of nasalization, language acquisition, L2 learning, etc. We are
specifically interested in proposals aiming at interconnecting these discipline
subfields: relationships between production and perception, cross-linguistic
studies, multiinstrumentation, links between phonological patterns and phonetic
constraints, convergences and divergences between L1 acquisition and L2
learning, etc.
