Meeting Description:

Panel at the International Conference on Conversation Analysis 
Mannheim University, Germany, July 4-8, 2010, http://www.icca10.org/

Panel theme: Vocal and Visual Practices of Minimal Response

Panel organizers: Dagmar Barth-Weingarten (IDS Mannheim), Elisabeth Reber
(University of Potsdam)

This panel will focus on the forms and functions of practices of minimal
response in multimodal talk-in-interaction. Particular emphasis will be placed
on the interplay of vocal and visual minimal responses and the potential
constraints on their forms and functions in their various interactional habitats. 
Following their early uptake in Conversation Analysis (e.g. Heritage 1984,
Jefferson 1984, Schegloff 1982), response tokens have, in recent years, enjoyed
increasing attention (e.g. Sorjonen 2001). They have been acknowledged to be
among the essential resources for organizing sequential and interactional
aspects of talk-in-interaction as they can indicate how prior talk is receipted.
Yet, most systematic studies have so far neglected the relevance of the
prosodic-phonetic contextualization of vocal responses for meaning-making (but
cf. e.g. Gardner 2001, Reber 2008). In addition, they have rarely incorporated
visual response forms in their account (but cf. e.g. Stivers 2008, Tanaka to
appear). 

This panel attempts to take stock of multimodal approaches to minimal practices
of response to induce the systematic analysis of the interplay of and
constraints on vocal and visual minimal responses. Among the questions
potentially to be dealt with are:

-Which vocal and visual minimal responses can be observed to play a systematic
role in interaction? What are their forms and functions?

-Are there systematic differences in sequential positioning between vocal and
visual response tokens?

-Does the production of visual responses influence the make-up of co-occurring
vocal response tokens?

-Are there differences in the forms and uses of response activities between,
for instance, different registers, language users or across different languages
or language varieties?

The panel welcomes contributions based on qualitative analyses as well as
attempts to generalize on the basis of qualitatively well-founded quantitative
studies.
