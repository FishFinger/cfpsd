Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 28-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

6th Journées d'Études Linguistiques, (dis)continu. Nantes University, France.
June, 18th-19th 2009. This conference has taken place regularly since 1998 in
order to get together phoneticians, phonologists, psycholinguists, computer
scientists and any other scholars interested in the relationships between speech
and language in order to discuss a predefined subject of interest. The preceding
conferences have focused on the following subjects : sound universals, vowels,
syllables, domains, schwa(s).

The JEL'2009 will be organized by Olivier Crouzet and Ali Tifrit (Laboratoire de
Linguistique de Nantes, LLING - EA3827). In the historical (and friendly)
context of discussion that has taken place regularly in Nantes between
phoneticians and phonologists, the theme and title of this workshop will be :
'(dis)continu' (eng.: (dis)continuous). 

Call for Papers

JEL'2009 - (dis)continu - (eng. (dis)continuous)

The relationship between form and substance is at the heart of the dialogue
between phonetics and phonology. If these disciplines have always been mutually
enriched by this dichotomy, their dialogue is nowadays renewed by the emergence
of theoretical approaches that may profoundly modify their relationships.
Indeed, from the phonological side (continuous vs. discontinuous nature of
phonological forms, probabilistic vs. symbolic mechanisms, interrogations
concerning the distinction between form and substance) as well as from the
phonectics side (articulatory-acoustic and acoustic-perceptual discontinuities,
exemplar-based processes aimed at accounting for phonological mechanisms...),
the boundaries between continuity and discontinuity sometimes seem to vanish.

You're invited to submit summaries (maximum 2 pages, including references, A4
paper) addressing any issue related to the relationship between continuity and
discontinuity in the sound structure of language:

- Continuity in phonology, discontinuity in phonetics;
- Relationship between form and substance in speech production and perception;
- Prosodic substance and linguistic interpretation;
- Acquisition, Development, Learning;
- Structure of the lexicon, Relationships between phonology and the lexicon,
exemplar-based models;
- Automatic speech processing, Speech synthesis;
- etc.

(this list is not restrictive).

All information concerning the conference and the submission process will be
available on the conference website from October, 1st 2008:

http://www.lettres.univ-nantes.fr/lling/jel2009/

Schedule:
- Submission deadline: November, 28th 2008
- Notification of acceptation: March, 26th 2009
- Reception of final papers for inclusion into the proceedings: May, 21st 2009
- Final programme: June, 4th 2009
- Conference (JEL'2009): June, 18th-19th 2009.
