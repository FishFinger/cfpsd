resources in order to fill the gap between language resources and practical
applications

information extraction, question answering, machine translation, etc.
- Text corpora
- Lexicons
- Grammars
- Machine-readable dictionaries
- Ontology
- Strategies and priorities for EU-US and Asian cooperation
- Strategies for collaboration with international/regional public organizations,
such as UNESCO, ACCU, etc.

resource reports should include the precise description of the existing
resources or resources under development. For attributes of the resource
description, refer to http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/LRCatalogue/. The workshop
will be comprise of two parts, the presentation of technical papers, and an open
discussion based on the resource reports aiming at introducing language
resources of less computerized languages, and exchanging the experiences,
resources and tools.
