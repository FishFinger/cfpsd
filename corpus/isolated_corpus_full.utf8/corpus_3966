The 6th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2009)   	 
31 May - 4 June 2009, Heraklion, Greece
www.eswc2009.org

The vision of the Semantic Web is to enhance today's Web by exploiting
machine-processable metadata. The explicit representation of the semantics
of data, enriched with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that
provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together a
large network of human knowledge and makes this knowledge
machine-processable. Various automated services will help the users to
achieve their goals by accessing and processing information in
machine-understandable form. This network of knowledge systems will
ultimately lead to truly intelligent systems, which will be employed for
various complex decision-making tasks. Semantic Web research can benefit
from ideas and cross-fertilization with many other areas: Artificial
Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Databases and Information
Systems, Information Retrieval, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social
Networks and Web Engineering. Many advances within these areas can
contribute towards the realization of the Semantic Web.

The 6th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2009) will present the
latest results in research and applications of Semantic Web technologies.
ESWC2009 will also feature a tutorial program, system descriptions and
demos, a posters track, a PhD Symposium and a number of collocated
workshops. The calls for these events are separate and can be found on the
conference Web site (http://www.eswc2009.org/calls).

ESWC2009 is sponsored by STI International, Semantic Technology Institutes
International. For more information on STI International, please visit
http://www.sti2.org.

**Topics of Interest**

reconciliation)
- Ontology Learning and Metadata Generation (e.g., HLT and ML approaches)

2. Semantic Web Services

Portals)
- Semantic Web for e-Business, e-Science, e-Health, e-Culture, e-Government,
e-Learning and other application domains
- Social networks and processes on the Semantic Web
- Semantic web technology for collaboration and cooperation

5. Design and Evaluation of Semantic Web Applications and Technologies

**Submissions**

ESWC2009 welcomes the submission of original research and application papers
dealing with all aspects of the Semantic Web. We particularly encourage the
submission of papers on industrial efforts and experiences with Semantic Web
projects. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and
applications papers.

The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series. Paper submission and reviewing for
ESWC2009 will be electronic via the conference submissions site. Papers
should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be formatted
according to the information for LNCS authors.

Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format
and will *not* be accepted in any other format. Papers that exceed 15 pages
or do not follow the LNCS guidelines risk being rejected automatically
without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide
semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission -- details of this
process will be provided on the conference Web page at the time of
acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the
conference.

For more information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) please visit:
