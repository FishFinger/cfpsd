Linguistic Field(s): History of Linguistics; Lexicography 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2006 

Meeting Description:

The primary objective of this conference is to bring together specialists from different parts of the world to present and discuss the results of research on the production and content of grammars, vocabularies, doctrinal texts and other materials on and in languages previously unknown to Europeans who ventured to distant lands in Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas and for whom such languages were often considered to be exotic. The OsProMil Conferences concentrate on linguistic works from the period 1492-1850/1900. 

On this occasion, the central theme of the conference will be Lexicography. However, proposals in the fields of syntax, semantics, translation, morphology, phonology, etc. will also be welcome and evaluated by the Organizing Committee.

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description:

Berkeley Linguistics Society (BLS) 33 

Call for Papers

The 33rd meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics society will take place at the University of California, Berkeley, on the 9th through 11th of February, 2007. The meeting will consist of a general session, a parasession, and a special session.

Invited Speakers:

Sasha Aikhenvald, La Trobe University
Joan Bresnan, Stanford University
Nick Enfield, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics
Nora England, University of Texas
Jane Hill, University of Arizona
Roberto Zavala, CIESAS-Sureste

General Session:

The General Session will cover all areas of linguistic interest. We encourage proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks and also welcome papers on language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology, cognitive science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology.

Parasession: Multilingualism and Fieldwork

Linguistic research is often based on an assumed monolingualism; however most of the world is bi- or multilingual. This session will deal with topics relating to fieldwork within bi- and multilingual communities: their implications, both analytical and methodological, and their relevance to issues in general linguistic theory. We welcome submissions on documenting a single language in a multilingual community, working with multilingual speakers, theoretical models of multilingualism, and similar issues related to fieldwork and language contact.

Special Session: Languages of Mexico and Central America

This session will focus on languages of Mexico and Central America. Despite cultural, linguistic, and historical similarities that exist in this region, there are few opportunities for scholars of these languages to share their research with one another. The goals of this session are to provide a forum for discussion between Mesoamerican linguists and specialists in other languages of Mexico and Central America, and to give all linguists working in this region an opportunity to become more familiar with each others' work. In addition to papers on indigenous languages, we also welcome submissions dealing with contact between indigenous and colonial/immigrant languages of these regions. We especially encourage submissions on languages from areas of Northern Mexico and Central America that are not commonly considered to be part of Mesoamerica.

Submission Guidelines:

Deadline: Abstracts must be received electronically by:

5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time
Thursday, 9 November 2006.

No late submissions can be accepted. Authors will be notified of (non)acceptance by mid-December.

Guidelines: An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. In the case of joint authorship, one address should be designated for communication with BLS. Abstracts should be as specific as possible, with a statement of topic, approach, and conclusions, and must fit on one page in 12-point font with 1'' margins. So that the review process may remain anonymous, authors should not include their names or otherwise reveal their identity anywhere on this page. Data and examples must be given within the body of the text rather than at the end, though references may be included on a separate page if necessary.

Submissions: All abstracts must be submitted electronically as PDF documents. Further instructions for electronic submissions are available on the BLS website: http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/BLS/

Presentation and Publication: Presentations are allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. Presented papers are published in the BLS Proceedings. Authors agree to provide camera-ready copy (up to 12 pages) by 15 May 2007.

Registration Information: All attendees, including presenters, must register for the conference. For advance registration, we can accept only checks or money orders drawn on US banks in US dollars, made payable to the Berkeley Linguistics Society.
