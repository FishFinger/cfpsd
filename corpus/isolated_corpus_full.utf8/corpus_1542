Going Romance 2007

Twenty First Symposium on Romance Linguistics
Universiteit van Amsterdam, The Netherlands

Papers on all areas of Romance linguistics from all theoretical perspectives are
welcome. The presentations will take thirty minutes, with an additional ten
minutes for discussion.

A one-day thematic workshop will take place on Saturday, 8 December, with Marina
Nespor as guest speaker. The subject of the workshop will be the L1/L2
acquisition of word order and information structure in Romance languages. The
focus will be on interface phenomena in this domain. Comparative aspects across
Romance varieties will be addressed. We welcome papers from different
theoretical perspectives.

Abstracts should be anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references
and examples, with margins of at least 1 inch, font size 12, single-spaced.
Submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract
per author. Please indicate clearly in your submission details whether your
abstract should be considered for the main session or the workshop.

The abstracts should be sent by e-mail to goingromance2007@uva.nl no later than
10 September 2007. Only PDF files will be accepted. These should be anonymous
both in the body of the text and the filename. Please make sure all fonts and
figures are correctly rendered. Attach a separate file containing: title, author
name and address, affiliation and e-mail address. Please indicate whether you
would like to present your paper during the general sessions on Thursday or
Friday, or during the workshop on Saturday, by mentioning 'main session' or
'workshop'. Papers not conforming to these requirements will not be taken into
consideration.

All authors who present their work at the conference will be invited to submit
their paper for a volume of selected contributions to be published by John

Location: Guimarães, Portugal 
Contact Person: Joaquim Silva
Meeting Email: jfs@di.fct.unl.pt
Web Site: http://epia2007.appia.pt/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:
TeMA-2007 will be held at the 13th Portuguese Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (EPIA 2007), in Guimarães, Portugal, 3-7 December 2007.

Pure symbolic methods for Language Processing alone are unable to address
human languages complexity. Text Mining and Machine Learning techniques
applied to text, raw or annotated, brought up new insights and completely
shifted the approaches to Human Language Technologies. Both approaches,
when duly integrated, bridge the gap between language theories and
effective use of languages, and enable important applications. Our aim,
with this workshop, is to bring together innovative contributions to fill
in this gap.
Authors are invited to submit their papers on any of the issues identified
below. Papers will be blindly reviewed by three members of the Programme
Committee. Best papers will be published at Springer, in LNAI series. If
there are additional papers whose quality is sufficiently high for deserving to
be presented at TEMA'07, those other accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings. More information is available at http://epia2007.appia.pt
