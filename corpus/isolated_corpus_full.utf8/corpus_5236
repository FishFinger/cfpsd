                 WORKSHOP ON CHILD, COMPUTER AND INTERACTION
                              NOVEMBER 5, 2009


                            http://wocci2009.fbk.eu

                   post-conference workshop of ICMI/MLMI 2009
                            http://icmi2009.acm.org/


                             CALL FOR PAPERS


The  Workshop on  Child,  Computer  and Interaction  will  be held  in
Cambridge,  Boston  area, on  November  5,  2009.  The Workshop  is  a
satellite event  of the  Tenth International Conference  on Multimodal
Interfaces,  this  year  jointly  with  Machine  Learning  multi-modal
interaction (ICMI-MLMI 2009) that will take place in the same venue on
November  2-4, 2009.  This edition  follows the  first edition  of the
Wocci Workshop which was held in Crete in October 2008.

This Workshop aims at  bringing together researchers and practitioners
from universities  and industry working  in all aspects  of multimodal
child-machine interaction with particular emphasis on, but not limited
to, speech interactive interfaces.

Children are special both at the acoustic/linguistic level but also at
the interaction level. The Workshop provides a unique opportunity for
bringing together different research  communities  to  demonstrate
various  state-of-the-art  components  that   can  make  up  the  next
generation of child  centred computer interaction. These technological
advances are increasingly necessary  in a  world where  education and
health  pose growing  challenges  to  the  core   well being  of  our
societies.  Noticeable examples are  remedial treatments  for children
with or without  disabilities,   and  first  and   second  language
learning. The Workshop should serve for presenting recent advancements
in all  core technologies for multimodal  child-machine interaction as
well as experimental systems and prototypes.

TECHNICAL SCOPE

The technical  scope of the Workshop  includes, but it  is not limited
to:

- Speech  Interfaces: acoustic and  linguistic analysis  of children's
   speech,  discourse  analysis  of  spoken language  in  child-machine
   interaction,  age-dependent   characteristics  of  spoken  language,
   automatic  speech  recognition  for  children  and  spoken  dialogue
   systems.

- Multi-modality and  Robotics: multi-modal child-machine interaction,
   multi-modal   input  and   output   interfaces,  including   robotic
   interfaces, intrusive, non-intrusive  devices for environmental data
   processing, pen or gesture/visual interfaces.

- User  Modelling: user  modelling and  adaptation,  usability studies
   accounting   for  age   preferences  in   child-machine  interaction
   Cognitive  Models:  internal  learning  models,  personality  types,
   user-centred and participatory design.

- Application  Areas: training  systems, educational  software, gaming
   interfaces, medical conditions and diagnostic tools.


SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited  to submit papers in any  technical areas relevant
to  the  Workshop. The  technical  committee  will  select papers  for
oral/poster-presentation. Accepted papers will  be included in a CDROM
with proceedings of the Workshop.  Proceedings of the Workshop will be
published by ACM. Instructions  for paper submission will be available
at  the Workshop  website. The  official language  of the  Workshop is
English. Demos are especially welcome.
