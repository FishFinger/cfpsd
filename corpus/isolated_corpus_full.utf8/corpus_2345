Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 25-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description

The annual MSCL was first held in 2006. The aim of the conference is to give
young researchers an opportunity to present their work, exchange ideas and
receive feedback from more experienced colleagues. 

Abstracts are solicited from all areas of formal linguistics including but not
limited to Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, and Semantics. The main topic of this
year's conference is Perspectives on the Syntax-Semantics Interface. Although
submissions on the conference's main topic are especially encouraged, all other
abstracts will be given equal consideration.

Abstracts should be anonymous and may not exceed two pages, including data,
references and diagrams. Abstracts should be typed in at least 11-point font,
with one-inch margins. Only abstracts from students (i.e., those not having
defended a PhD by January 28, 2008) will be considered. Accepted papers will be
allotted 20 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.

The deadline for submissions is January 25, 2008. Note that submissions are
limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author, or 2 joint abstracts
per author. To submit an abstract send an e-mail to mscl.organizers@mail.ru with
a PDF-copy of your abstract attached to the message. In the body of the message
specify the following information:

title of the paper
name(s) of author(s)

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 04-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished research 
on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural language and speech
processing, including, but not limited to:
- Pragmatics, Discourse, Semantics, Syntax, and the Lexicon
- Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology
- Speech Recognition
- Speech Synthesis
- Natural Language Generation
- Ontologies, Semantic Networks, and Lexical Resources
- Corpus Linguistics
- Linguistic, Mathematical, and Psychological Models of Language
- Anaphora Resolution
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Corpus-based Language Modeling
- Machine Translation and Translation Aids
- Text and Speech Interfaces
- Dialogue systems
- Language Learning and Therapy
- Simulation and Visualization
- Knowledge Acquisition and Representation
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Text and Speech Classification
- Systems Evaluation 

We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic that is
of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging research 
emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay between 
linguistics, computer science and application domains such as biomedicine, 
communication systems, public services, and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or 
well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of 
the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results 
should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance 
for quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should contain original 
material that has not been previously presented to the scientific community. 
A parallel submission to other publication fora as well as a significant 
overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly 
indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. 
The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical quality, 
and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories: 
- full papers, describing substantial research with well-evaluated results 
- short papers, typically describing ongoing research and preliminary results

All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference 
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk 
and short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions will be made using EasyChair. The URL will be given here as soon as
the GoTAL submission service opens (in January). Also the lengths and styles of
submissions will be specified then.

Proceedings

The previous three TAL conferences had proceedings published in LNCS/LNAI.
For GoTAL, this has not yet been confirmed (as of 20 December 2007).

Keynote Speakers

There will be three keynote speakers, whose names will be announced here
later.
