Meeting Description:

The second international conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools is
organised by the MEDAR consortium in Cairo, Egypt. MEDAR (Mediterranean Arabic 
Language and Speech Technology)  is a follow-up of NEMLAR, and is supported by
the European Commission. The conference focuses on all aspects of Arabic
resources and tools. 

Call for Papers

Language Resources (LRs) are a central component of the linguistic
infrastructure, necessary for the development of HLT applications and products,
and therefore for industrial development. In this conference we will focus on
Arabic language technology and on the necessary language resources and tools for
both research and commercial development of language technology for Arabic. 

Multilingual language technology is a particular focus, as well as general
methodologies. The other important aspect for the promotion of Arabic language
technology is cooperation: Cooperation is extremely important for the
advancement of the field, be it cooperation between European, Arabic and
American partners, cooperation between Arabic partners, cooperation between
research and industry etc. 

MEDAR will present its first proposal for a Cooperation Roadmap, and will seek
discussion and collaboration for its final version. The aim of this conference
is to provide a forum for the discussion of the state-of-the-art for Arabic
resources and tools, in particular for machine translation and multilingual
information retrieval, discuss problems and opportunities, exchange information
regarding LRs and tools, their applications, ongoing and planned activities,
industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the new e-society, both with
respect to policy issues and to technological and organisational ones. The
roadmap discussions will in particular bring in policy issues and collaboration
and organisation issues.
