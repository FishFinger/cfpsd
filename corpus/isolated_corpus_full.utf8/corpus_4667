Meeting Description:

It is with great pleasure that the Language Institute of Thammasat University
announces its first International Conference on Foreign Language Learning and
Teaching, 16-17 October 2009 at the Asia Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. Aiming to
narrow the gap between theory and practice, the conference brings together SLA
theorists with classroom teachers to engage in a productive sharing of research
findings and an exchange of ideas. While there are many worthy international
conferences that are of great value to researchers and theorists, on the one
hand, and EFL teachers, on the other, there is an ever-increasing need to bring
both sides of the expertise continuum together. The FLLT-2009 conference serves
precisely that need. 

Call for Papers

About the Conference
The Language Institute of Thammasat University will host its first conference on
foreign language learning and teaching on October 16 and 17, 2009 at the Asia
Hotel Bangkok, Thailand. The conference intends to provide a forum for academics
in the fields of foreign language learning and teaching to report theoretical
and empirical developments in their areas of specialty and to exchange ideas
through paper presentations. The conference aims particularly to promote
collaboration between researchers in foreign language learning and classroom
practitioners, both of whom can significantly inform and enrich each other
through dissemination of their research findings. 

Keynote Speakers:
Prof. Anne Burns, Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University, Australia
Prof. Gita Martohardjono of the City University of New York Graduate Center
Prof. Shelly Wong, President of TESOL (USA) from George Mason University

Invitation to submit:
Papers from all theoretical frameworks are welcome. The language for paper and
poster presentations is English. Abstracts will be reviewed for clarity of the
theoretical framework and methodology, originality and significance, and overall
presentation and organization. Each paper is allotted 20 minutes for the oral
presentation and 10 minutes for questions. For posters, please consult the
guidelines for poster submission.

We welcome abstracts of approximately 300-450 words in any of the following areas:
- The Acquisition of Foreign Language Syntax/Phonology/Pragmatics/Syntax-
