NAACL-HLT 2007 Workshop
Rochester, New York, 26 April 2007
http://cenlp.iltevents.org/


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Description:

Confidence estimation (CE) is a method for automatically estimating the =
reliability of output generated by NLP systems. It is useful in =
scenarios where the underlying systems make errors, especially when =
human users are involved. This is the case in many areas of NLP, because =
systems are known to be imperfect. Applications can exploit knowledge of =
likely mistakes to improve their interactions with users and thereby =
enhance their overall effectiveness. The workshop aims at bringing =
researchers from different NLP fields together. We would like to provide =
a forum for sharing ideas, techniques, and experience on common aspects =
of CE across different areas of NLP. We hope to provide an opportunity =
for researchers to learn from previous and ongoing work in other fields.

Main topics:

The workshop invites technical papers related to confidence estimation =
for natural language processing. Possible topics include, but are not =
limited to:
* CE techniques for different NLP areas
* Design and training of CE models; machine learning
* Confidence features exploring different knowledge sources
* Evaluation and calibration of CE
* CE with imprecise or unreliable references
* Applications of CE in NLP
* Lessons learned from CE systems deployed in applications

Submission instructions:

Researchers interested in presenting their work at the workshop should =
prepare a PDF (or postscript) version of their paper, maximum 8 pages =
(including references) in the NAACL/HLT 2007 format.
Reviewing will be double-blind. Submissions will be handled =
electronically using the START system. The dates are given below.
