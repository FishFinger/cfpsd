OZCHI is Australiaâs leading forum for research and development in all areas of Human-Computer Interaction. OZCHI attracts an international community of practitioners, researchers, academics and students from a wide range of disciplines including user experience designers, information architects, software engineers, human factors experts, information systems analysts, and social scientists.

The main conference will be from Wed 25 to Fri 27 Nov 2009, and will be preceded by two days of Workshops, Tutorials and a Doctoral Consortium on Mon 23 and Tue 24 Nov 2009. OZCHI will take place back-to-back with HFESA 2009: http://www.hfesaconference.org.au/ scheduled to run from 22-25 Nov 2009. The venue for both conferences is the ICT building of the University of Melbourne, 111 Barry St, Parkville.

We are very excited to announce the following keynote speakers for this year's OZCHI conference:

..  Bill Moggridge, Co-founder of IDEO.com
..  Patrick Hofmann, Head of User Experience, Google Australia
..  Yvonne Rogers, Director, Pervasive Interaction Lab, Open University, UK

We look forward to welcoming you to an exciting conference in Australiaâs design capital.

Conference Theme

The 2009 conference theme is Design: Open 24/7. Accessibility, inclusivity and dissolving boundaries are core to the Open 24/7 theme for the design of human interaction with and through digital technologies. The integration of digital technologies into our everyday life allows for a seamless transitioning between open and closed, work and leisure, public and private. Open implies participation and collaboration across traditional borders between individuals, organisations and disciplines. OZCHI 2009 provides a forum to discuss all aspects of openness, open borders, open participation, open source and open architecture. Theme-related submissions may address these topics:

Open always-on real-time ubiquitous and pervasive designs
Open design and universality versus situatedness, contextualisation and personalisation
Open source for design â design for open source
Open mind â new ideas, concepts and approaches from outside HCI
Beyond open â never closed: design for escapism


Conference Topics

Submissions in all areas of HCI are encouraged. In addition, we particularly invite authors to address any of the following topics:

Augmented Reality
Context and Location Awareness
Education and HCI
Health Care and HCI
Innovative Design Methodologies
Smart Service Delivery
Sustainability
Universal Usability and Accessibility
Urban Informatics
Tangible User Interfaces
Visualisation Techniques
Working across Cultures


Submissions

All submissions must be written in English. Both long and short papers will undergo a double blind review process by an international panel and evaluated on the basis of their significance, originality, and clarity of writing. Accepted long papers and short papers will be available in the published proceedings. At least one author of any accepted submission must register and attend the conference and present the paper for publication in the proceedings. All submissions must use the two column OZCHI proceedings template:http://www.ozchi.org/mediawiki/ozchipaper_template2009.doc

Paper submission site now open: http://precisionconference.com/~ozchi


Long Papers

Full length papers, up to 8 pages, on original and substantive new work in any area of HCI are invited. Long papers should describe work that makes a significant contribution to HCI or describe broad insights gained from practical applications of HCI.

Jesper Kjeldskov & Jeni Paay, CSIRO User Experience Group
Technical Program Chairs
program@ozchi.org


Short Papers

Short length papers, up to 4 pages, should present ideas that could benefit from discussion with members of the HCI community. These papers may include work-in-progress, experiences of reflective practitioners, and first drafts of novel concepts and approaches.

Stephen Viller, UQ & Rebecca Schultz, WorkSafe Victoria
Short Papers Chairs
shorts@ozchi.org


Industry Case Studies

Industry Case Studies demonstrate how user experience professionals have applied human-computer interaction to create practical solutions to commercial situations. Presentations may include areas such as: challenges faced in implementing methods and techniques; development of new or improved techniques; or incorporating usability into an organisation. Submissions should contain:
A 250 word summary for the conference program including: the issue addressed; what will be presented; and relevance to the HCI community.
A proposal outlining the presentation and the rationale behind it, including:
.. Session title
.. Presenter(s) name and organisation
.. A brief background of the presenter(s) and organisation
.. The business problem addressed
.. The approach and/or solution
.. Challenges and issues that emerged throughout the project
.. Benefits and limitations
.. If applicable, how a similar approach or solution could be used in other contexts
.. Relevance of the case study to other HCI professionals
.. Technical requirements for delivering the presentation

Industry Chairs

Demos & Posters

Demonstrations and posters provide an attractive way to showcase real outcomes of human-computer interaction research and development. These sessions offer a platform to share ideas, concepts and work-in-progress face-to-face with the OZCHI community in a way that a paper presentation cannot. Proposals for demos and posters should be submitted on 2 pages using the OZCHI proceedings template.

Ben Kraal, QUT & Ricky Robinson, NICTA
Demos & Posters Chairs
demos@ozchi.org


Workshops & Tutorials

Workshops and tutorials are half day or full day sessions prior to the main conference program on 23 and 24 Nov 2009. Proposals (max of 2 pages, OZCHI format) should be aimed at a community with a common interest. A tutorial proposal should provide participants with clear outcomes. The workshop and tutorial program is not included in the main conference fee.

Workshops are a chance for people with common interests to meet for a focused and interactive discussion. If you are working in an emerging area in HCI, consider organising a workshop as an opportunity to advance the field and build momentum. OZCHI workshops might address basic or applied research, HCI practice, new methodologies, emerging application areas, design innovations, management and organisational issues, or HCI education.

Each workshop should generate ideas that give the HCI community a new, organised way of thinking about the topic, or ideas that suggest promising directions for future research. Some workshops result in edited books or special issues of journals; you may consider including this goal in the your workshop proposal.

Tutorials are full day or half day events designed to offer participants the opportunity to learn about specific HCI related concepts, methods and techniques. They are one of the best means of conveying introductory and advanced instruction on specific topics to an interested audience. Tutorials are a significant attraction to delegates and provide exposure in depth and breadth to HCI topics. We welcome both research and industry tutorial submissions. Tutorial submissions (max of 2 pages, OZCHI format) should include a clear list of outcomes for participants.

Workshops, Tutorials and Panels Chairs

Doctoral Consortium

The Doctoral Consortium is scheduled prior to the main conference program on 24 Nov 2009. The Doctoral Consortium offers PhD students a special forum where they can present, discuss and progress their research plans with peers and established senior researchers. PhD candidates wishing to attend the consortium should submit a research proposal in the format given on the OZCHI website. Positions at the consortium will be offered based on a review of the submitted proposals.

Margot Brereton, QUT
Doctoral Consortium Chair

Volunteers

OZCHI actively encourages students to volunteer at the conference. Being a student volunteer is a great way to support the HCI community, meet other students in the field, and attend the premier HCI conference Australia. You will help the conference organisers with the running of the conference and support the setting-up of presentations and workshops. You will see the latest in HCI, and have fun while learning about running the conference. In return, you will get free registration. To apply, email volunteers@ozchi.org with your contact details (email, phone, university), an abstract of your research project, a resume, and the reasons why you would like to be a student volunteer. Applications close on 28 Aug 2009.
