Meeting Description:

Frequently Asked Concealed Questions 

Call for Papers

The aim of the meeting is to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion
of original work on concealed questions. We welcome the submission of papers on
different languages clearly articulating empirical and formal issues, including
but not limited to the following:
- Do we have strong evidence to decide on the semantic type of a DP-CQ?
(Should it be a property? an individual concept? a question? a proposition?)
- What is the best way to characterize the class of predicates that take DP-CQ
complements?
- Why do only certain nouns make good DP-CQs? Which theory on the market is best
suited to account for this fact?
- Why do certain kinds of nominal modifiers (relative clauses, superlatives)
help in recovering CQ-readings?
- What is the role of de re belief ascriptions in the derivation of CQ-readings?
- What do DP-CQs share with other DPs in intensional positions (eg, the object
DP in 'John seeks a unicorn' or the subject DP in'The temperature is rising')?
- Do we want a unified account of concealed questions and concealed exclamatives
(eg.'It's amazing the price you had to pay for that')?

Abstracts are invited for 30-minute talks (20 minute presentations plus 10
minutes for discussion). Abstracts should be anonymous and confined to two pages
