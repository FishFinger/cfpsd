                                           CALL FOR PAPERS

OVERVIEW

Since its inception less than seven years ago, Wikipedia has become one of =
the
largest and fastest =

growing online sources of encyclopedic knowledge. One of the reasons why
Wikipedia is =

appealing to contributors and users alike is the richness of its embedded
structural information: =

articles are hyperlinked to each other and connected to categories from an =
ever
expanding =

taxonomy; pervasive language phenomena such as synonymy and polysemy are
addressed =

through redirection and disambiguation pages; entities of the same type are
described in a =

consistent format using infoboxes; related articles are grouped together in
series templates.

As a large-scale repository of structured knowledge, Wikipedia has become a
valuable resource =

for a diverse set of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Major
conferences in natural language =

processing and machine learning have recently witnessed a significant numbe=
r of
approaches that =

use Wikipedia for tasks ranging from text categorization and clustering to =
word
sense =

disambiguation, information retrieval, information extraction and question
answering. On the =

other hand, Wikipedia can greatly benefit from numerous algorithms and
representation models =

developed during decades of AI research, as illustrated recently in tasks s=
uch
as estimating the =

reliability of authors' contributions, automatic linking of articles, or
intelligent matching of =

Wikipedia tasks with potential contributors.

The goal of the workshop is to foster the research and dissemination of ide=
as on
the mutually =

beneficial interaction between Wikipedia and AI. The workshop is intended t=
o be
highly =

interdisciplinary. We encourage participation of researchers working on
Wikipedia from different =

perspectives, including (but not limited to) machine learning, computational
linguistics, =

information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, knowledge
representation, and =

others. We also encourage participation of researchers from other areas who
might benefit from =

the use of a large body of machine-readable knowledge. =


TOPICS

We invite submissions of papers addressing the following or related topics::
- Using Wikipedia as a source of training data for AI tasks (both supervise=
d an
unsupervised)
- Automatic methods for improving the quality of Wikipedia pages
- Integrating Wikipedia with existing ontologies (e.g. WordNet, CYC, ODP)
- Extracting annotated data from Wikipedia
- Enriching Wikipedia with new types of structural information
- Wikipedia and the Semantic Web / Web 2.0
- Automatic extraction and use of cross-lingual information from Wikipedia
- Computerized use of satellite projects such as Wiktionary, Wikibooks or
Wikispecies

WORKSHOP FORMAT

The day long workshop will consist of presentations, invited talk, demos
showcasing work =

presented in the research papers, and a panel session.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We invite submissions of regular full papers (up to 6 pages), short papers
reporting on late-
breaking results (up to 3 pages), and descriptions of system demonstrations=
 (up
to 1 page) using =

the AAAI style. Submissions that have been accepted for publication elsewhe=
re or
are under =

review for another conference must clearly state so on the front page of the
paper.

IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for long papers submission         March 21, 2008
Deadline for short papers and system demos  April 7, 2008
Notification of acceptance                  April 21, 2008
Camera-ready papers due at AAAI             May 5, 2008
