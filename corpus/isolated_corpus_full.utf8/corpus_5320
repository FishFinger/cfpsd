The conference will take place August 3-5, 2009. The program on August 3 will take place in Pablo at Salish Kootenai College (www.skc.edu/), with the conference dinner to follow in the evening. The program on August 4-5 will take place in Missoula at the University of Montana campus (www.umt.edu). 

Second Call for Papers

Papers on all aspects of the study, preservation, and teaching of Salish and neighboring languages are welcome.

Travel and accommodation information is available at http://www.umt.edu/ling/ICSNL44/.

Please note that registration will be on-site only. However, we would appreciate you letting us know by e-mail ICSNL44@umontana.edu whether you plan to attend prior to the conference so that we can make dinner, refreshments and transportation arrangements. Further information on registration costs will be posted as soon as it is available.

Salish Kootenai College is located in Pablo, Montana, which is approximately 60 miles north of Missoula. For those of you without a car, we are planning to arrange transportation to and from Pablo/Missoula. We ask that you contact us as soon as possible at ICSNL44@umontana.edu with your travel plans so that we can try to accommodate all transportation needs.

Abstract guidelines: abstracts should be 150-200 words and should include the paper title, author(s), affiliation, and e-mail address. Abstracts should be sent by e-mail to ICSNL44@umontana.edu as a pdf attachment. If you anticipate any problems sending your abstract in this way, please contact the organizing committee. Please include the primary author's snail mail address and phone number in your e-mail.

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is June 15, 2009. The program will be announced early July.

Following recent changes in the structure of ICSNL conferences, papers will be published after the conference as a University of British Columbia Working Papers in Linguistics (UBCWPL) proceedings volume (and not as preprints as had been done in the past). Details regarding the preparation and submission of papers will be available at the conference.

Questions about the conference can be forwarded to ICSNL44@umontana.edu. We look forward to seeing you this summer in Montana!
