Full Title: Language Research 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

The journal Language Research was first published in 1965 by the Language
Education Institute (formerly, the Language Research Institute) of Seoul
National University in Seoul, Korea. It is one of the oldest and most
prestigious linguistic journals published in Korea. It has continually
published important papers in diverse areas of theoretical and applied
linguistics as well as language teaching.

The new editorial policies for the journal effective with volume 42.2 are
as follows: 

(1) The journal publishes two issues per year, instead of four. Submitted
papers to the first issue may be in English or Korean. All papers submitted
to the second issue will be in English.

(2) The journal no longer accepts papers whose focus is on language
teaching. Submitted manuscripts should have a focus on linguistics. In
addition to all subfields within general/theoretical linguistics, papers
addressing topics in psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics,
historical/comparative linguistics, and computational linguistics are
welcome. Though we see topics in Korean linguistics as the main area of
concentration for the journal, papers need not be restricted to issues
related to Korean.

(3) Manuscripts may be submitted to either the domestic editor/associate
editor or the international editor/associate editor. Paper or electronic
submissions (in MS-Word files) are welcome, though we prefer electronic
submissions where possible

(4) No page charges will be levied on submitted manuscripts. The journal
will offer editorial assistance with the preparation of final drafts.

The editors and the editorial board are as follows:

Editors:
Domestic - Hyeon-hie Lee (Department of Korean Language and Literature,
Seoul National University; hhlee@snu.ac.kr)
