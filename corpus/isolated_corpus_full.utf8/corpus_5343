IWPT 2009

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
11th International Conference on Parsing Technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponsored by ACL/SIGPARSE

October 7 - 9, 2009

Paris, France

~~~
http://alpage.inria.fr/iwpt09
~~~

ACL/SIGPARSE will host the 11th International Conference on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'09) on October 7 - 9, 2009 in Paris, France, at
the University of Paris 7.

IWPT'09 continues the tradition of biennial workshops on parsing
technology organized by SIGPARSE, the Special Interest Group on
Parsing of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The
first workshop, in Pittsburgh and Hidden Valley, was followed by
workshops in Cancun (Mexico) in 1991; Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy
(Belgium) in 1993; Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) in 1995;
Boston/Cambridge (Massachusetts) in 1997; Trento (Italy) in 2000;
Beijing (China) in 2001; in Nancy (France) in 2003; in Vancouver
(Canada) (2005); and in Prague (Czech Republic) in 2007.


Topics of interest for IWPT'09
------------------------------
Topics of interest for IWPT'09 include, but are not limited to:

theoretical and practical studies of parsing and transduction
algorithms for natural language sentences, texts, fragments,
dialogues, ill-formed sentences, speech input, multi-dimensional
(pictorial) or signed languages, multimedia (web) documents; parsing
issues arising or viewed in a multimodal and multilingual context;
parsing in relation to semantic and pragmatic information and
communication; cognitive aspects of grammar and their impact on
parsing.
Knowledge-based and data-driven approaches are equally welcome.


Time schedule: (full paper deadline has been extended to the 29 May)
--------------
Deadline for full paper submission: 29 May, 2009
Full papers notification of acceptance: 1 July, 2009
Deadline for short paper submission: 8 July, 2009
Short papers notification of acceptance: 15 July, 2009
Final papers due: 15 August, 2009
Conference: 7 - 9 October, 2009


Submitting Papers
-----------------
Two types of submissions are invited:
- full papers, to be presented as such during the conference and to
be published in the conference proceedings (maximally 12 pages);
- short papers, to be presented at the conference in the form of a
poster plus a summary oral presentation in a short-paper session;
four-page summaries will be published in the conference proceedings.

Submissions of either type should describe original work. Full papers
should be concerned with completed work or intermediate results of
ongoing work, rather than with intended work, and should indicate
clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Short papers
may describe planned or starting research or untested ideas.

A paper accepted for presentation at IWPT 2009 cannot be presented or
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must
papers that contain significant overlap with previously published
work.

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. The paper should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-citations and other references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or
software) that could reveal the author's identity should be
avoided. For example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)
...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".


Instructions for authors
------------------------
Prospective authors are invited to send their submissions
through the electronic submission page of the conference. The only
accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Full papers should not
exceed 12 pages; short papers should not exceed 8 pages.


Detailed formatting and submission instructions for authors will be
available through the IWPT'09 home page at:

Subject: [Corpora-List] PASSAGE 2nd French Parsing Evaluation Campaign
To: corpora@uib.no


-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------
Call for Participation to the Second PASSAGE French Parsing Evaluation=20
Campaign
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

We invite the developers of parsers for French both from academia and
industry to participate to the second PASSAGE evaluation campaign. In
the course of achieving the two main objectives of the PASSAGE
project (http://atoll.inria.fr/passage):

1. building a large sized Treebank for French and making it available
to the community

2. and investigating lexical acquisition for Parser improvement by
parser outputs merging,

we offer to parser developers the opportunity to test and compare
their system on the PASSAGE corpus. Historically this evaluation
campaign comes after the first evaluation campaign of PASSAGE that
took place in 2007 and the EASY evaluation campaign (2006) of EVALDA
project in the TECHNOLANGUE program.

Participation is free (after registering, see below) on a voluntary
basis and gives access to all the resources that PASSAGE has built
(corpora, annotation editors, evaluation toolkits). To have a look at
the PASSAGE annotations, you can test EasyRef
(http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefpub/), the WEB interactive annotation
editor now freely open to all potential participants.

--------
The data
--------
The corpus that we propose you to parse is a 100 Million words
collection of material freely available from the WEB completed with a
small amount of copyrighted newspaper material. Word and sentence
segmentations are not imposed. The participant data will be mapped
onto the reference data using a dynamic programming algorithm.

---------------------
Syntactic Annotations
---------------------
The syntactic annotations that we used in PASSAGE are derived from the
one used during the EASY campaign. The annotations are described in
various papers
(http://atoll.inria.fr/passage/articles.en.html). Documentation and
software support is available on the PASSAGE site along with EasyRef
(http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefpub/), an open WEB annotation editor and
an evaluation server enabling an automatic comparison of one's parser
against the PASSAGE development data (app. 85,600 words) issued from
previous PASSAGE campaign and the EASY campaign.

--------
Schedule=20
--------
Both the development corpus resulting from the EASY evaluation
campaign and the PASSAGE-2 test corpus of 100 million words are now
available. They will be communicated to the participants as soon as
they are registered. Participants to PASSAGE-2 are expected to return
the PASSAGE-2 corpus completely parsed with the PASSAGE annotations
between August 31 2009 and October 15 2009.

-----------------
Evaluation Tracks
-----------------
PASSAGE-2 will have 2 evaluation tracks:

1. the manual reference track with its gold standard of 400,000 words
that have been hand-annotated

2. the automatic reference track, where the gold standard will be the
results of combining the ouputs of the participating parsers.

For all registered participants, performance results of the first
track will be published with the participant identified, while
performance results of the second track will be published anonymously
because of the exploratory nature of the reference data.

-----------------------------------------
Link with EVALITA dependency parsing task
-----------------------------------------
For exploring possible links with Parsing evaluation for other
languages, PASSAGE-2 campaign has a tiny development and test corpus
shared with the EVALITA (http://evalita.fbk.eu/) campaign on
dependency parsing (http://evalita.fbk.eu/parsing.html) . Aligned data
both in French and Italian have been hand-annotated (200 sentences of
developement and 50 sentences for test) both with PASSAGE annotations
for the French part and the TUT annotations for the Italian one.

----------------------------
Conditions for participation
----------------------------
Registration is now open and necessitates signing a participation
agreement available at ELDA. Participants are required to return the
test corpus parsed according to the schedule above and agree to the
publication of their identified performance results by the PASSAGE-2
organizer. Please contact Olivier Hamon at ELDA for obtaining the
participation agreement.

Subject: [Corpora-List] Analysing Parent-Medical Corpora?
To: "corpora@uib.no" <corpora@uib.no>


Dear members,


I'm currently trying to undertake an analysis of medical texts written
for and about the interactions between parents of a premature child in
neonatal care and medical staff (Nurses and Consultants). In
particular, there are four sets of corpora I'm trying to analyse. The
first is text written by medical consultants that is usually written
for the parents about prior verbal consultations that the two parties
have had. The other three corpora sets are that written by nurse about
their interactions  with parents and their observations of the
parents. What I have noticed informally is that the nature of text
written by both consultants and nurses changes if the condition of the
premature in neonatal care deteriorates and/or if the parents are
emotionally distressed. In particular, the most noticeable result is
that the simplification of the language used and the increasing use of
phrases to build reassurance. However, I was wondering what tools are
available for me to observe aspects of this phenomena in a
quantitative manner? I have used readability metrics such as Fog,
Flesch, and Flesch-Kincaid scores. Is there any other metrics that I
should be exploring?

Many Thanks,

Saad Mahamood.

Subject: [Corpora-List] PASSAGE 2nd French Parsing Evaluation =
Campaign<BR>
To: corpora@uib.no<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------<BR>
Call for Participation to the Second PASSAGE French Parsing =
Evaluation<BR>
Campaign<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------<BR>
<BR>
We invite the developers of parsers for French both from academia =
and<BR>
industry to participate to the second PASSAGE evaluation campaign. =
In<BR>
the course of achieving the two main objectives of the PASSAGE<BR>
project (http://atoll.inria.fr/passage):<BR>
<BR>
1. building a large sized Treebank for French and making it =
available<BR>
to the community<BR>
<BR>
2. and investigating lexical acquisition for Parser improvement by<BR>
parser outputs merging,<BR>
<BR>
we offer to parser developers the opportunity to test and compare<BR>
their system on the PASSAGE corpus. Historically this evaluation<BR>
campaign comes after the first evaluation campaign of PASSAGE that<BR>
took place in 2007 and the EASY evaluation campaign (2006) of EVALDA<BR>
project in the TECHNOLANGUE program.<BR>
<BR>
Participation is free (after registering, see below) on a voluntary<BR>
basis and gives access to all the resources that PASSAGE has built<BR>
(corpora, annotation editors, evaluation toolkits). To have a look =
at<BR>
the PASSAGE annotations, you can test EasyRef<BR>
(<A =
HREF=3D"http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefpub/">http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefp=
ub/</A>), the WEB interactive annotation<BR>
editor now freely open to all potential participants.<BR>
<BR>
--------<BR>
The data<BR>
--------<BR>
The corpus that we propose you to parse is a 100 Million words<BR>
collection of material freely available from the WEB completed with =
a<BR>
small amount of copyrighted newspaper material. Word and sentence<BR>
segmentations are not imposed. The participant data will be mapped<BR>
onto the reference data using a dynamic programming algorithm.<BR>
<BR>
---------------------<BR>
Syntactic Annotations<BR>
---------------------<BR>
The syntactic annotations that we used in PASSAGE are derived from =
the<BR>
one used during the EASY campaign. The annotations are described in<BR>
various papers<BR>
(<A =
HREF=3D"http://atoll.inria.fr/passage/articles.en.html">http://atoll.inri=
a.fr/passage/articles.en.html</A>). Documentation and<BR>
software support is available on the PASSAGE site along with EasyRef<BR>
(<A =
HREF=3D"http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefpub/">http://atoll.inria.fr/easyrefp=
ub/</A>), an open WEB annotation editor and<BR>
an evaluation server enabling an automatic comparison of one's =
parser<BR>
against the PASSAGE development data (app. 85,600 words) issued from<BR>
previous PASSAGE campaign and the EASY campaign.<BR>
<BR>
--------<BR>
Schedule<BR>
--------<BR>
Both the development corpus resulting from the EASY evaluation<BR>
campaign and the PASSAGE-2 test corpus of 100 million words are now<BR>
available. They will be communicated to the participants as soon as<BR>
they are registered. Participants to PASSAGE-2 are expected to =
return<BR>
the PASSAGE-2 corpus completely parsed with the PASSAGE annotations<BR>
between August 31 2009 and October 15 2009.<BR>
<BR>
-----------------<BR>
Evaluation Tracks<BR>
-----------------<BR>
PASSAGE-2 will have 2 evaluation tracks:<BR>
<BR>
1. the manual reference track with its gold standard of 400,000 =
words<BR>
that have been hand-annotated<BR>
<BR>
2. the automatic reference track, where the gold standard will be =
the<BR>
results of combining the ouputs of the participating parsers.<BR>
<BR>
For all registered participants, performance results of the first<BR>
track will be published with the participant identified, while<BR>
performance results of the second track will be published =
anonymously<BR>
because of the exploratory nature of the reference data.<BR>
<BR>
-----------------------------------------<BR>
Link with EVALITA dependency parsing task<BR>
-----------------------------------------<BR>
For exploring possible links with Parsing evaluation for other<BR>
languages, PASSAGE-2 campaign has a tiny development and test corpus<BR>
shared with the EVALITA (<A =
HREF=3D"http://evalita.fbk.eu/">http://evalita.fbk.eu/</A>) campaign =
on<BR>
dependency parsing (<A =
HREF=3D"http://evalita.fbk.eu/parsing.html">http://evalita.fbk.eu/parsing=
.html</A>) . Aligned data<BR>
both in French and Italian have been hand-annotated (200 sentences =
of<BR>
developement and 50 sentences for test) both with PASSAGE =
annotations<BR>
for the French part and the TUT annotations for the Italian one.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
Conditions for participation<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
Registration is now open and necessitates signing a participation<BR>
agreement available at ELDA. Participants are required to return the<BR>
test corpus parsed according to the schedule above and agree to the<BR>
publication of their identified performance results by the PASSAGE-2<BR>
organizer. Please contact Olivier Hamon at ELDA for obtaining the<BR>
participation agreement.<BR>

Subject: [Corpora-List] Analysing Parent-Medical Corpora?<BR>
To: &quot;corpora@uib.no&quot; &lt;corpora@uib.no&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear members,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm currently trying to undertake an analysis of medical texts =
written<BR>
for and about the interactions between parents of a premature child =
in<BR>
neonatal care and medical staff (Nurses and Consultants). In<BR>
particular, there are four sets of corpora I'm trying to analyse. =
The<BR>
first is text written by medical consultants that is usually written<BR>
for the parents about prior verbal consultations that the two =
parties<BR>
have had. The other three corpora sets are that written by nurse =
about<BR>
their interactions&nbsp; with parents and their observations of the<BR>
parents. What I have noticed informally is that the nature of text<BR>
written by both consultants and nurses changes if the condition of =
the<BR>
premature in neonatal care deteriorates and/or if the parents are<BR>
emotionally distressed. In particular, the most noticeable result is<BR>
that the simplification of the language used and the increasing use =
of<BR>
phrases to build reassurance. However, I was wondering what tools =
are<BR>
available for me to observe aspects of this phenomena in a<BR>
quantitative manner? I have used readability metrics such as Fog,<BR>
Flesch, and Flesch-Kincaid scores. Is there any other metrics that I<BR>
should be exploring?<BR>
<BR>
Many Thanks,<BR>
