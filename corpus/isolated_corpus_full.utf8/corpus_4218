Second Call For Papers

NAACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Creativity
(CALC 2009)

Boulder, Colorado
June 4, 2009

http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=3DCALC-09

It is generally agreed upon that "linguistic creativity" is a unique =

property of human language. Some claim that linguistic creativity is =

expressed in our ability to combine known words in a new sentence, others =

refer to our skill to express thoughts in figurative language, and yet =

others talk about syntactic recursion and lexical creativity.

For the purpose of this workshop, we treat the term "linguistic =

creativity" to mean "creative language usage at different levels", from =

the lexicon to syntax to discourse and text (see also topics, below).

The recognition of instances of linguistic creativity and the computation =

of their meaning constitute one of the most challenging problems for a =

variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation, =

text summarization, information retrieval, question answering, and =

sentiment analysis. Computational systems incorporating models of =

linguistic creativity operate on different types of data (including =

written text, audio/speech/sound, and video/images/gestures). New =

approaches might combine information from different modalities. =

Creativity-aware systems will improve the contribution Computational =

Linguistics has to offer to many practical areas, including education, =

entertainment, and engineering.

Within the scope of the workshop, the event is intended to be =

interdisciplinary. Besides contributions from an NLP perspective, we also =

welcome the participation of researchers who deal with linguistic =

creativity from different perspectives, including psychology, =

neuroscience, or human-computer interaction.

Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We are particularly interested in work on the automatic detection, =

classification, understanding, or generation of:

* neologisms;
* figurative language, including metaphor, metonymy, personification, =

idioms;
* new or unconventional syntactic constructions ("May I serve who's =

next?") and constructions defying traditional parsers (e.g. gapping: "Many =

words were spoken, and sentiments expressed");
* indirect speech acts (such as curses, insults, sarcasm and irony);
* verbally expressed humor;
* poetry and fiction;
* and other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity.

Depending on the state of the art of approaches to the various phenomena =

and languages, preference will be given to work on deeper processing =

(e.g., understanding, goal-driven generation) rather than shallow =

approaches (e.g., binary classification, random generation). We also =

welcome descriptions and discussions of:

* computational tools that support people in using language creatively =

(e.g. tools for computer-assisted creative writing, intelligent thesauri);
* computational and/or cognitive models of linguistic creativity;
* metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware =

systems;
* specific application scenarios of computational linguistic creativity;
* design and implementation of creativity-aware systems.

Related topics, including corpora collection, elicitation, and annotation =

of creative language usage, will also be considered, as long as their =

relevance to automatic systems is clearly pointed out.

Nick Montfort, MIT (http://nickm.com/)

Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers are limited =

to 8 pages. The style files can be found here: =

[http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html]. No author =

information should be included in the papers, since reviewing will be =

blind. Papers not conforming to these requirements are subject to =

rejection without review. Papers should be submitted via START =

[https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/CALC2009/] in PDF format.

We encourage submissions from everyone. For those how are new to ACL =

conferences and workshops, or with special needs, we are planning to set =

up a lunch mentoring program. Let us know if you are interested. Also, a =

limited number of student travel grants might become available, intended =

for individuals with minority background and current residents of =

countries where conference travel funding is usually hard to find.
