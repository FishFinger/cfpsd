Meeting Description:

EACL-2009 will continue the tradition of providing a forum for student
researchers who are investigating various areas related to Computational
Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. Participants will have the
opportunity to get feedback both from a wide audience in general and from
selected panelists -- experienced researchers who prepare in-depth comments and
questions in advance of the presentation. 

Call for Papers

2nd CFP: EACL 2009 Student Research Workshop

1. General Invitation for Submissions
The European Association of Computational Linguistics would like to invite
student researchers to submit their work to the workshop. Original and
unpublished research is invited on all aspects of computational linguistics,
including, but not limited to these topic areas:

- pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
- phonetics, phonology and morphology
- linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
- information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
- summarization and paraphrasing
- speech recognition, speech synthesis
- corpus-based language modeling
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
- spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
- multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
- message and narrative understanding systems

The main conference will also feature tutorials, workshops and research notes.
Further information on these is available at the main conference website:
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/. 

2. Submission Requirements
Seeing that the main mission of the student workshop is to provide the
participants with a wide audience and useful feedback, the emphasis of the
workshop will be on work in progress. It will therefore normally be open to
students who have settled on their thesis direction but who still have
significant research left to do; those students in the final stages of their
thesis are encouraged to submit to the main conference. Papers should clearly
indicate directions for future research where appropriate. The papers can have
more than one author, however all authors must be students.

A paper accepted for presentation at the Student Workshop cannot be presented or
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.
Papers that are being submitted to other conferences must indicate this
immediately after the title material on the first page. Students who have
previously presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL student session will not be eligible
to present again at the student session of any of these conferences. These
students are instead encouraged to submit to the main conference.  

3. Submission Procedure
Submissions should follow the two-column formal of EACL/ACL proceedings. The
maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages of content and one (1)
additional page of references. The page limits have to be strictly observed. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style
files tailored for this year's conference. They will be available at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors. A description of the format will also
be available in case you are unable to use the style files directly. Papers must
conform to the official EACL 2009 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to
reject submissions that do not conform to these styles including font size
restrictions. Submissions should be in PDF format and must include all fonts, so
that the paper will print (not just view) anywhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity,
e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead,
use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. Papers that
do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

The deadline for submission is 23:59 CET on October 24, 2008. Additional
instructions for electronic submission will be posted on the conference website
at http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/submissions.

4. Reviewing Procedure
The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed by the
Student Workshop Co-Chairs and a team of reviewers. Each submission will be
matched with a mixed panel of student and senior researchers for review. The
final acceptance decision will be based on the results of the review.

5. Student Sponsorship
The EACL has a limited number of student sponsorships available to student
participants of the EACL 2009 main conference, the EACL 2009 poster/demo session
and/or the EACL 2009 student research workshop.

Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more generally, to
students from countries with hard currency problems (within the geographical
area covered by EACL).

A request for student sponsorship for EACL 2009 should include the following
information:
- Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of the candidate
- Source and amount of yearly income
- Letter of motivation
- Proof of student status
- Copy of acceptance letter from programme chair / student workshop chair or
poster/demo chair
- Letter of recommendation from supervisor
- Overview of the estimated costs

Requests for student sponsorships can be directed to the EACL at secretary@eacl.org

6. Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: October 24, 2008
Notification of acceptance: December 19, 2008
Camera-ready papers due: February 13, 2008
EACL 2009 Conference: March 30 - April 3, 2009
