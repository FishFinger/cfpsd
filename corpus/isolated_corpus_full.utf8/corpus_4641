Call for Papers

Sintagma (ISSN 0214-9141) is open for reception of contributions (articles
and reviews) for issue number 21, which will be published in December 2009.

Sintagma is a yearly publication founded in 1988. In addition to its
printed edition, the journal is also available online at:
http://www.sintagma.udl.cat.

Sintagma is a journal of linguistics that aims towards promoting the
exchange of knowledge in this area, regardless of any theoretical
framework. Studies in both theoretical and applied linguistics are welcome,
as well as works on any language or language variety, and contrastive
linguistics. The only condition is that all submissions must be original
and must not be under consideration by other journals or have been
published elsewhere.

Notes for Contributors

- Authors should send the originals in electronic format by email to
sintagma@dal.udl.cat. 
- Originals will be sent out for anonymous evaluation to two independent
reviewers.
- Papers should not exceed 5,000 words (including references, tables and
appendixes). 
- The deadline to send contributions for issue number 20 is October 31th,
but it could finish before this date if the number of papers accepted is
enough to close the issue in process.
- Direct references that may help identify the author should be omitted
within the text. Name and affiliation of authors will be indicated in a
separate file.
- Papers can be written in English, French, Spanish, or Catalan.


Review Processes

Authors will be informed about  the result of the anonymous peer review
process within a period of three months after reception of original
manuscripts. 

Final acceptance will require the implementation of any modifications
suggested by the reviewers and the adoption of the norms of publication of
the journal.

All texts published in the journal's print format are also published online
at http://www.sintagma.udl.cat, as well as in any documentary retrieval
system in which this journal is included.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
