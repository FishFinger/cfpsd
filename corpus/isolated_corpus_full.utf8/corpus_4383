Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2009 

RALL is dedicated to the study of African languages. The journal welcomes
original descriptive, historical and typological papers in all aspects of
African languages. Contributions on poorly documented and described
languages or lesser known language areas, as well as those trying to
integrate linguistics into interdisciplinary approaches of the African
past, are highly appreciated. Researchers from Africa are especially
encouraged to contribute. RALL is a peer-reviewed and internationally
oriented journal. All contributions are reviewed by two anonymous assessors
in relevant fields.
RALL is published once a year and accepts papers in English. Authors are
requested to strictly follow the guidelines specified in the journal's
style sheet.
Instructions for Authors/Contributors
RALL adopts the Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics Journals (USSL) with
slight modifications 

Manuscripts: Authors are requested to submit for publication two hard
copies of all manuscripts and one soft copy or e-mail papers as attachment
to oyepaultaiwo@gmail.com
  Manuscript must be typed double-spaced on one side of A4 paper (or
similar) with margins of at least 3.5cm on all four sides of the page. The
first page of the manuscript should carry the title of the article without
the name of the author.
