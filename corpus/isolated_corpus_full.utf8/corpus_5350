CALL FOR PAPERS

The 4nd International Workshop on
Ontology Content

Special tracks on:
Business | Human Resources | eHealth | Web 3.0

OnToContent'09
Nov 6, 2009, Algarve, Portugal
Part of the OTM (OTM'09)
Proceedings will be published by Springer LNCS

Call for Papers
In recent years the expectations of software technology based on =20
social networking and social analysis have increased tremendously. =20
Where the initial interest was focused on the Web community, =20
reflecting the success of Web 2.0 applications and the growth of =20
relevance of social  networks analysis. Today, however, this interest =20=

extends also to include business and government organizations. A major =20=

trend in many areas involves the creation of hybrids incorporating =20
elements of both traditional knowledge management and business process =20=

management techniques. In this context the issues related to the =20
quality of data representation acquire a new relevance. For the sorts =20=

of accurate and timely analysis of data needed by major organizations =20=

demand that data be formulated in ways that are expressive and =20
manipulable at the same time. In this context the role of good quality =20=

ontology (i.e. good quality conceptualizations, encoded in portable =20
and extensible format) is more and more relevant.

This workshop aims to focus on content issues, such as methodologies =20
and tools concerned with modeling good ontologies, approaches to =20
ontology content evaluation, quality measures, ontology content =20
management (e.g. metadata, libraries, and registration), ontology =20
documentation, etc. The workshop also aims to give a special attention =20=

to ontology content issues in: Business, human resources and =20
employment, healthcare and life sciences, and Web 3.0. We welcome =20
papers and (past/planned) project descriptions that discuss ontology =20
aspects, particularly:
Research papers presenting theoretical solutions, but with a clear =20
illustration on how these solutions can be applied in industry.
Position papers presenting opinions on some aspect of ontology =20
practice, or describing work that is still in progress, but =20
sufficiently mature to warrant attention.
Business experience and case studies specifying requirements, =20
challenges, or opportunities of modeling and applying ontologies in =20
industry.

Topics

Web 3.0 Ontologies
Lessons from Web 2.0 for ontology engineering
Experiences with participatory and evolutionary approaches to ontology =20=

engineering (e.g., based on social software)
Lightweight ontology formalisms (e.g., SKOS) and microformats
Experiences/empirical results on lightweight vs. heavy-weight ontologies
Experiences/empirical results on graphical modeling of ontologies
Experimental evidence (e.g., from cognitive science) on conceptual =20
modeling
Challenges/requirements for maintenance and evolution of ontologies
Good, best, and bad practices

Ontologies for Business Process Representation and Management
Ontologies for modeling Business Process.
Ontologies for monitoring Business Process.

Ontologies for Human Resources
Modeling and representation of: Jobs, CVs, Competencies, Skills, =20
Employees, People, Organizations, Social Events, etc.
HR upper level concepts.
Semantics of HR-XML.
Semantic metadata for HR applications.
Semantics in job matching.
Semantics is learning technologies.
Multilinguality in human resources ontologies.
Best practice and semantic patterns in ontology modeling and evaluation.

Ontologies for Healthcare and Life sciences
Ontologies in Biomedicine and bioinformatics.
Ontologies of diseases, nursing, therapeutics, drug, etc.
Upper level concepts of healthcare and life sciences ontologies.
Semantic metadata for Clinical Data Interchange.
Semantics of medical XML standards and vocabularies.
Multilinguality in Biomedicine and bioinformatics ontologies.
Best practice and semantic patterns in ontology modeling and evaluation

Submissions
We invite (A) Research papers describing original studies of no more =20
than 10 pages; (B) Position papers presenting opinions or work in =20
progress of no more than 6 pages; and (C) Business experience and case =20=

studies of no more than 8 pages. All submitted papers will be =20
evaluated by at least three members of the program committee, based on =20=

originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of =20
expression. Detailed formatting instructions can be found at:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
The final proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag as LNCS. =20
Failure to commit to presentation at the conference automatically =20
excludes a paper from the proceedings. The paper submission page is =
