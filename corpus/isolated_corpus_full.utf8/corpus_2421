Location: Keihanna, Japan 
Contact Person: Shuichi Yatabe
Meeting Email: hpsg2008@easychair.org

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

HPSG-2008 will take place in July, 2008 near the historic cities of Nara and
Kyoto in Japan. 

The 15th International Conference on
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar

28-30 July, 2008

http://www2.nict.go.jp/x/x161/en/member/bond/hpsg-2008/

Invited Speakers

Mutsumi Imai (Keio University)
Tibor Kiss (Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum)
Stephen Wechsler (University of Texas at Austin)

Second Call for Papers

Abstracts are solicited for presentations which address linguistic,
foundational, or computational issues relating to the framework of Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar. Each presentation will be allotted 40 minutes, but the
talk itself must be at most 30 minutes long, leaving at least 10 minutes for
discussion.

The last day of the conference will be devoted to a workshop on ''Grammar at the
Interfaces'', whose purpose is to explore not just various problems regarding
grammar-internal interfaces (such as the syntax-semantics
interface and the morphology-syntax interface) but also issues surrounding the
interface between competence grammar and extragrammatical factors.  Papers that
do not utilize the theoretical framework of HPSG will be as welcome as papers
that do.

Submissions

We will use an online submission system. All abstracts should be submitted via
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpsg2008
Abstracts should be in PDF format and should not be more than 5 (five) pages long.

Please direct any questions to the Program Committee Chair:
hpsg2008@easychair.org

Abstracts for the main conference should mention 'HPSG-08' and abstracts for the
workshop should mention 'Workshop-08' in the title. All abstracts will be
reviewed anonymously by at least two reviewers. Abstracts should not include the
authors' names and authors are asked to avoid self-references. The Program
Committee reserves the right to reassign accepted papers from the main
conference to the workshop, and vice versa.

Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: March 1, 2008
Notification of acceptance: April 15, 2008
Conference: July 28-30, 2008

Publication

The conference proceedings will be published online by CSLI publications. A call
for contributions to the publications will be issued after the conference.
Proceedings of previous conferences are available at
http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/HPSG/. The final deadline for receipt of
written versions of conference papers is October 25, 2008.
