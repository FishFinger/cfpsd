Meeting Description:

Perceptual Magnets
Commanding Attention in Contested Time, Space and Thought

Seventh Biennial Graduate Student Conference
Department of Germanic Studies
Indiana University, Bloomington
February 20-22, 2009

Keynote Address by Prof. Lutz Koepnick, Washington University
Plenary Address by Prof. Mike Putnam, Carson-Newman College 

Call for Papers

A perceptual magnet is anything that pulls at our attention and demands to be
noticed. The attraction can be intense enough to reduce all other competing
perceptions to trivial background noise, like a screaming tea kettle, or weak
enough to be just barely noticed, like the color red in "The Sixth Sense". 
Regardless of its intensity, however, a perceptual magnet emits a field of
influence that affects us and how we orient ourselves in the world we occupy.
This influence may be complicated when multiple perceptual magnets compete for
our attention. It may not be easy to identify where the edges of a field begin
and end.
Sometimes magnets are tangible objects. The sun, for instance, perpetually draws
the earth toward itself. Other times a magnet is like a black hole, which we can
only be aware of through evidence of its field.  Perceptual magnets can
themselves be tangible or intangible.  In either case it can be difficult, if
not impossible to identify what a perceptual magnet really is.  This conference
will discuss instances in language, literature, linguistics and culture where
perceptual magnets seem to be present, and try to determine the
who/what/where/when/why and how of them.   

Possible research questions to address this topic include but are not limited to
the following:
- Narrative focalization makes a mind or heart visible in an unempirical way:
how--and with what reliability--does the invisible come into compelling focus?
- Do hyperbole and metaphor mislead or sharpen perceptions?
- When can vagueness in art be more accurate than precision?
- Does an aesthetic pointer (an index) do the same thing as empirical evidence?
- Does the na√Øve, under-interpretive reader perceive qualitatively more or less
than the cautious, over-interpretive reader?  
- Which means have more or less successfully served manipulation of consent and
propaganda in (German) history and culture and how did they work?
- How are discourses of seduction articulated to promote charisma and the cult
of personality? 
- In which way do attention and sensibility as intellectual qualities determine
the intensity of our perceptions as well as how we attempt to understand those
things which are attracting us?
- What distinctions that further our understanding of perceptual magnets result
from an analysis of elements that attract or repel figures within narratives?
- In linguistic interactions, what events or signals set the tone for register,
politeness, or social distance between interlocutors, if any? What cues can be
an impetus for a change in these to be initiated?  How do interlocutors react to
these events and signals?
- How is our understanding of poetry or oratory influenced by rhyme,
alliteration, or dissonance? What about interruptions in such patterns?
- What things are salient in our production, perception and interpretation of
linguistic signals? How do we recognize established phonemes amid the
variability inherent to phonetic production and "noise"?
- (How) do we recognize or react to accents of people from other dialects or
languages? What cues allow the same in digital speech recognition?
- In what ways do intonation, stress, and pitch accent influence our grammatical
or lexical perception?
- By what means do L1 and L2 learners form abstract phonological categories from
the empirically variable acoustic signals they receive?  Do L1 categories
influence the acquisition of L2 phoneme categories?
- How do we form lexemes in L1 or L2 acquisition?  Does one field influence the
other, or vice versa?
- What semantic representation do lexical items with a variety of actual
instantiations have?  Do lexical items have archetypes from which variance can
be measured?

Please submit abstracts electronically (ca. 250 words) by January 1st, 2009 to:
Attn: Christopher Sponsler; germconf@indiana.edu

Location: Amherst, Massachusetts, USA

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 13-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

Recursion: Structural Complexity in Language and Cognition
This interdisciplinary workshop will explore how complex structures are created
and employed in language and other cognitive domains. The workshop will feature
invited speakers from linguistics, biology, psychology, philosophy and computer
science, as well as enhanced poster sessions. 

Call for Papers

Submissions are solicited for "enhanced poster presentations". The posters are
enhanced in that each poster session will be preceded by a session in which the
each of the presenters gives a brief (5-minute) public summary of their poster.
This format allows the audience to get an overview of all posters and helps to
make discussion at the poster session more focused and productive. Although the
formal talks in this conference are by invitation, we hope that the format of
the poster session will enhance the exchange of ideas and active participation
of all who attend.

Abstracts should be submitted in pdf or doc format to:
http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/recursion2008

Abstracts should be no more than one page in length.
Submission deadline: Feb. 13 Notification: March 10.
