Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing - BSNLP 2009
Second International Workshop
Cracow, Poland
15 June 2009
http://erssab.u-bordeaux3.fr/BSNLP

This year BSNLP is co-located with the IIS 2009 (Intelligent Information
Systems) conference. 

Call for Participation

This year BSNLP is co-located with the IIS 2009 (Intelligent Information
Systems) conference.

Topic and Motivation:
The recent political and economic changes in Central and Eastern Europe and the
related on-going enlargement of the European Union brings into focus new
cultures and languages. Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic group
have an outstanding role because of their rich cultural heritage and the
widespread use: over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the
Balto-Slavonic languages. The NLP tasks include, but are not limited to,
morphological analysis and generation, tagging, named-entity recognition,
information extraction, co-reference resolution, question-answering, information
retrieval, text summarisation, machine translation. Research on these topics in
the context of Balto-Slavonic languages is still in its early stage and is
progressing relatively slowly. Due to specific linguistic phenomena, such as
rich inflection and relatively free word order, a construction of language
processing tools for these languages is an intriguing and challenging task.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages. The workshop will give an
opportunity to exchange ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle problems
in this field of research, and to make available resources more widely known.

This workshop is a follow-up to the successful first BSNLP 2007 workshop held in
conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference in Prague. In particular, we would
strongly encourage submissions describing systems, resources or solutions that
are made available to the wider public, as this would help to promote
computational linguistics applications for these languages.

Areas of Interest:

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP in the context of:

-Text segmentation
-Morphological analysis
-Morphology models
-Morpho-syntactic disambiguation
-Named-entity recognition
-Named-entity dissambiguation-
-Named-entity lemmatisation-
-Name variant recognition and merging
-Term and keyword extraction

-Co-reference resolution
-Word sense disambiguation
-Corpus-based knowledge acquisition
-Information extraction
-Question answering
-Machine translation
-Text summarisation
-Text classification
-Information retrieval
-Linguistic processing in search engines 

B. Multilingual frameworks applied to these languages

-Tools and resources (freely available for research purposes will be preferred)
-Experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and processing resources
-Comparative evaluation between languages
-Encoding standards and formats 

Registration: http://iis.ipipan.waw.pl/2009/reg.html
