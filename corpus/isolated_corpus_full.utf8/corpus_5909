New approved policies - plus your chance to have your say

There are 40 policy documents currently being reviewed across the Universit=
y. Not all are policies, some are procedures and others are guidelines, but=
 all are available for input from both staff and students.=0D
=0D
Have your say in these reviews here: http://www.mq.edu.au/policy/under_revi=
ew.html=0D
=0D
Of specific interest might be the discussion around the development of a dr=
aft Grading Policy. This has highlighted the need for discussion on the use=
 and relevance of SNGs (Standardised Numerical Grades) and when (or if) a P=
C grade should be awarded. If you have a specific view or would like to rec=
eive a copy of the draft document, please contact Associate Professor Pamel=
a Coutts at pamela.coutts@mq.edu.au=0D

Below, three new policies which have recently been approved by Academic Sen=
ate:=0D

Academic Honesty (http://www.mq.edu.au/policy/docs/academic_honesty/policy.=
htm)=0D
This Policy will replace the existing Plagiarism policy. It will commence f=
or units with a teaching start date of 1 July 2010 or later. It is broader =
in scope than the existing  Plagiarism policy and will apply to all student=
s and to staff of the University involved in learning, teaching and researc=
h. It will require comprehensive procedures to be developed to ensure the e=
ducative and management requirements are appropriately detailed. Contact Dr=
 Judi Homewood at judi.homewood@mq.edu.au to provide your input into the de=
velopment of these procedures.=0D
=0D
Examination (http://www.mq.edu.au/policy/docs/examination/policy.htm)=0D
This Policy will come into effect for units with a teaching start date of 1=
 July 2010 or later. It will apply to all coursework units offered by or on=
 behalf of Macquarie University. There are a number of implications for sta=
ff in the new policy, not least the requirement for there to be a sample ex=
amination paper available for each unit. Procedures are now being drafted. =
To have your say, please contact Carolynne Paine at carolynne.paine@mq.edu.=
au=0D
=0D
Grade Appeal (http://www.mq.edu.au/policy/docs/grade_appeal/policy.htm)=0D
This Policy will come into effect from 1 January 2010 for all coursework un=
its. It will completely replace the existing grade appeal process. Procedur=
es are now in the process of being developed so that they are available at =
the time the Policy commences. Contact Carolynne Paine for further informat=
ion or to provide your input into the development of these procedures.=0D
