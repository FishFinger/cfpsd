The paper fails to explain in some detail 
* the possible constraints that the framework allows
* the figure of merit used to rank partial parses
whereas this is required to judge the contribution of the paper.

The parse algorithm is not very novel, but very similar to very many parse
algorithms proposed in the past (and the future, presumably) - perhaps apart
from the Star category that can always be used to combine categories.

The "proof" that the optimal solution is found by the algorithm is somewhat
unconvincing because is starts by "Assuming that the merit function has the
adequate properties with respect to optimality". Indeed, for certain
non-monotonic figure of merit functions your algorithm would not find the
optimal result. 

There is no argumentation why the optimal parse ought to be the intended parse
in the case of grammatical errors.

Evaluation part is unconvincing, as the authors are aware of. Except for the
limitations described by the authors, there is another worry. The parser does
not obtain reasonable recall on grammatical sentences. If the parser were to be

improved to have higher recall, then this would (probably) result in a
situation where more apparently ungrammatical sentences receive an alternative
(grammatical) analysis "by chance".  So unless the parser achieves some
state-of-the art accuracy on grammatical sentences, it is not yet very
informative how it deals with ungrammatical ones...

Interesting paper presenting an interesting approach to the problem of
(grammar) error detection. However, you try to achieve too much in this paper
-- state of the art in error detection, overview of Property
Grammar/Model-Theoretic Syntax, description of the Loose Satisfaction Chart
Parsing algorithm, evaluation, discussion of results and conclusion. That is a
bit much for a 10 page paper. You should try to better focus your paper.

The author(s) mention 5 restrictions and suggest that they were introduced to
reduce the
search space. It appears that these constraints impose a tree structure on the
models and
hence make a CKY style algorithm possible. It is surprising that this is not
mentioned in the 
paper because without tree-like models such DP wouldn't have been possible.
Also is assumption 5
necessary, i.e., does it not follow from assumptions 2 and 3? 

I couldn't follow how the evaluation 1 was done when the annotations are only
for partial parses
and this parser is a full parser. If the parser is not meant to provide the
structures expected for
EASY style evaluations then why bother and then claim the result is "same order
of magnitude" (!!!)
as ones for existing parser. Evaluation 2 also leaves much to be desired. a
full page is used to discuss
examples where in actuality the parser is not lacking but rather the underlying
grammar is.
Clearly we can't expect the parser to make up for drawbacks of the grammar, so
why discuss them here
at such detail. But somehow this raises a questions to me about this
work. This example illustrates that the judgement of "correct parse" needs to
take
into account the underlying grammar. Could the parse be determined to be
inappropriate
if there is  no better one available. It doesn't appear that the evaluators
took this into consideration,
if they deemed the tree of Figure 4 to be incorrect. 

Additionally,

there were supposed to be 5 linguists but no mention of inter-annotator
agreement.
DId all 5 have to agree? 

Discussion such as on the 39 rules for VP beg the question whether this is the
right approach to take and whether approaches like mal-rules (that can loosen
the requirements
of VP without head verbs to account for such errors in the input) are better
suited.

As it is the evaluation set is artificially created with a simplifying
assumption of just one
error. So without any form of baseline, the quality of the product is unclear.
So I am unclear
at the end about questions like how good are the heuristics. Would some
heuristic
as an alternate to ones discussed in Section 3.5 have better performance.

There were many typos, spelling and grammar errors.

A little more discussion of PG would have been helpful for those unfamiliar
with it.
For me, it hampered me in my getting a feel for how straightforward it might be
to translate a "parse" to a statement of what the error is (clear in the
competing
approach of mal-rules), a question fundamental to utility in CALL systems.
