BioNLP 2008 =

An ACL 2008 Workshop
Columbus, OH June 19 or 20, 2008
http://compbio.uchsc.edu/BioNLP2008

Submissions due: March 7, 2008

Continuing a successful series of BioNLP workshops at ACL 2002, ACL
2003, NAACL 2004, ACL 2005, NAACL 2006, and ACL 2007, and in accordance
with the ACL BioNLP tradition of presenting work on a broad range of
topics, we invite submissions on any topic of current interest in the
field of Biomedical Natural Language Processing.  We especially
encourage submissions on:

- Entity identification and normalization for a broad range of semantic
categories
- Ontologies and knowledge bases in BioNLP
- Extraction of complex relations
- The economics of text mining and database curation
- Resources and novel strategies for system testing and evaluation
- Shared tasks in the biomedical domain
- Test suites and corpora for BioNLP
- Quantifying utility to end-users
- Portability for non-developers
- Summarization
- Question-answering
- Full text and figures

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: Friday, March 7, 2008
Notification of acceptance: Friday, April 4, 2008
Camera-ready copy due from authors: Thursday, April 10, 2008
Workshop: June 19 or 20, 2008

Submission instructions:

Two types of submissions are invited: full papers and poster abstracts.
Submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST on March 7, 2008.  Submit your paper
or abstract via the ACL BioNLP 2008 site at
https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS05/.

Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.
These are intended to be reports of original research. BioNLP aims to be
the forum for interesting/innovative/promising work involving
biomedicine and language technology, whether or not yielding high
performance at the moment.  This by no means precludes our interest in
mature results, strong performance, and thorough evaluation. Both types
of research and combinations of thereof are encouraged. =


Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages.  Accepted abstracts
will be published in a separate section of the workshop proceedings.
Appropriate poster topics include preliminary results, application
notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format, and should follow the
two-column format of ACL proceedings.  Ensure that you are *not* in A4
format.  Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting
specifications.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or
Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting website
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html).  Submissions
need not be anonymous.  Authors who cannot submit a PDF file
electronically should contact the workshop organizers well in advance of
the submission deadline.  =


Dual submission policy: note that papers may not be submitted to the
BioNLP 2008 workshop if they are or will be concurrently submitted to
another meeting or publication and that other meeting or publication
prohibits dual submissions.  If your paper is also submitted to ISMB,
you should expect it to be rejected by ISMB.  If your paper is or will
be concurrently under consideration by another meeting or publication,
notify us of that fact in a footnote on the first page.  Do not
dual-submit your BioNLP 2008 workshop paper to ISMB.
