SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
5th International Workshop on Constraints and Language Processing
(CSLP2008)
http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2008/
August 11-15, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008 (http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 4-15
August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany

Workshop Organizers:

Philippe Blache (Provence University, France)
Henning Christiansen (Roskilde University, Denmark), co-chair henning@ruc..dk
Veronica Dahl (Simon Fraser University, Canada)
Jørgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark), co-chair jv@imm.dtu..dk

Workshop Purpose:

The CSLP 2008 workshop addresses the question of constraints and
language processing from an interdisciplinary perspective. Constraints
are widely used in linguistics, computer science, and psychology. How
they are used, however, varies widely according to the research
domain: natural language processing, knowledge representation,
cognitive modelling, problem solving mechanisms, etc. The purpose is
to pursue a paradigm, unifying the different approaches into a common
framework capable of explaining how constraints play a role in
representing, processing and acquiring linguistic information, and
this from a formal, technical, and cognitive perspective.

Workshop Topics:

The topics include, but are not limited to, constraint-based
linguistic theories, constraints in human language comprehension and
production, context modelling and discourse interpretation,
acquisition of constraints, probabilistic constraint-based reasoning,
constraint satisfaction technologies and constraint logic programming.

Submission Details:

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 12 pages in PDF
format.
The font size must be at least 10 pt when printed on A4 paper.
It is recommended that the LaTeX "article" style is used.
Previously published papers cannot be accepted.
The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee.
The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published
by ESSLLI.
One author for each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order
to present the paper.
Proceedings are printed as a technical report (with ISSN no.) and made
available online.
Selected and extended papers will be included in a volume of Studies
in Computational Intelligence published by Springer.
Please use the CSLP 2008 submission page handled by the EasyChair
conference system: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=CSLP2008


Workshop Format:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI
participants. 
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive
days in the second week of ESSLLI.
