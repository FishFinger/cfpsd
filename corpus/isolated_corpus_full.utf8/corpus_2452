                 CALL FOR PAPERS

"Collaboration: interoperability between people in the creation of language =

resources for less-resourced languages"

LREC 2008 pre-conference workshop
Marrakech, Morocco:  afternoon of Tuesday 27th May 2008
Organised by the SALTMIL Special Interest Group of ISCA

SALTMIL:			http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/
LREC 2008:			http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/
Call For Papers:	 =

http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/en/activities/lrec2008/lrec-2008-workshop-cfp=
.html
Paper submission:		http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsaltmil2008

Papers are invited for the above half-day workshop, in the format outlined =

below.  Most submitted papers will be presented in poster form, though some =

authors may be invited to present in lecture format.

Context and Focus

The minority or "less resourced" languages of the world are under increasin=
g =

pressure from the major languages (especially English), and many of them la=
ck =

full political recognition.  Some minority languages have been well =

researched linguistically, but most have not, and the majority do not yet =

possess basic speech and language resources which would enable the commerci=
al =

development of products.  This lack of language products may accelerate the =

decline of those languages that are already struggling to survive.  To brea=
k =

this vicious circle, it is important to encourage the development of basic =

language resources as a first step.

In recent years, linguists across the world have realised the need to =

document endangered languages immediately, and to publish the raw data. Thi=
s =

raw data can be transformed automatically (or with the help of volunteers) =

into resources for basic speech and language technology. It thus seems =

necessary to extend the scope of recent workshops on speech and language =

technology beyond technological questions of interoperability between digit=
al =

resources:  the focus will be on the human aspect of creating and =

disseminating language resources for the benefit of endangered and =

non-endangered less-resourced languages.

Topics

The theme of "collaboration" centres on issues involved in collaborating wi=
th:

* Trained researchers.
* Non-specialist workers (paid or volunteers) from the speaker community.
* The wider speaker community.
* Officials, funding bodies, and others.

Hence there will be a corresponding need for the following:

* With trained researchers: Methods and tools for facilitating collaborativ=
e =

working at a distance.
* With non-specialist workers: Methods and tools for training new workers f=
or =

specific tasks, and laying the foundations for continuation of these skills =

among native speakers.
* With the wider speaker community: Methods of gaining acceptance and wider =

publicity for the work, and of increasing the take-up rates after completio=
n =

of the work.
* With others: Methods of presenting the work in non-specialist terms, and =
of =

facilitating its progress.

Topics may include, but are not limited to:

* Bringing together people with very different backgrounds.
* How to organize volunteer work (some endangered languages have active =

volunteers).
* How to train non-specialist volunteers in elicitation methods.
* Working with the speaker community: strengthening acceptance of ICT and =

language resources among the speaker community.
* Working collaboratively to build speech and text corpora with few existin=
g =

language resources and no specialist expertise.
* Web-based creation of linguistic resources, including web 2.0.
* The development of digital tools to facilitate collaboration between peop=
le.
* Licensing issues; open source, proprietary software.
* Re-use of existing data; interoperability between tools and data.
* Language resources compatible with limited computing power environments =

(old machines, the $100 handheld device, etc.)
* General speech and language resources for minority languages, with =

particular emphasis on software tools that have been found useful.
