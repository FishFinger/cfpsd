Second Call for Papers
 
The Southeast Asian Linguistics Society - SEALS - was founded at Wayne State
University (in Detroit, Michigan) in 1990. SEALS holds an annual conference in
diverse locations in the United States, Australia, Southeast Asia and other
countries. This time, SEALS XIX will be hosted in Vietnam by the Faculty of
Vietnamese Studies at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam
National University. Abstracts are invited for papers on any topic related to
the analysis of Southeast Asian languages, such as descriptive, theoretical, or
historical linguistics, linguistic anthropology (ethnolinguistics, language
attitudes and ideology, discourse and conversational analysis, language and
gender, language and politics), language planning, literacy and bilingual education.

Abstract submission deadline is 15 February 2009. Abstracts are preferably
written using a Unicode font and should consist of two or three pages as follows: 
Page 1 
Author's name and Paper's title
Abstract body (maximum 400 words). Be as specific as possible, with a statement
of topic, approach, and conclusions. 
Page 2 
References (if any).

An author may submit one single and one joint abstract. In case of joint
authorship, one author should be designated as the contact person. Presentations
are allotted 20 minutes with 10 minutes for questions. All papers at SEALS are
presented in English. Papers presented at the meeting will be considered for
publication in the Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society. 

Submission
Abstracts can be submitted by one of the following ways:
- By email, as email attachments in two formats, .PDF and .DOC, to Dinh Lu
Giang, at the following address: seals19@vns.edu.vn. Please indicate "Abstract

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 13-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University will host a symposium
entitled Multiple Perspectives on the Critical Period for Language on June 5-6,
2009. 

Call for Papers

The traditional view of the critical period for language - going back to
Lenneberg - is that it is part of a biological process: the decline in language
ability reflects a maturational change in brain development. This view makes two
strong predictions, namely, that children will be better at acquiring language
than adults and that short of some kind of brain disorder, there's no way to
change that fact. This view has been challenged in recent years in a variety of
ways. Work on second language acquisition has found that adults are not always
worse than children in acquiring a language. Moreover, particularly in the
domain of phonology, there is evidence that second language learning can
influence first language representations, suggesting a continuity between the
two processes. In addition, alternative mechanisms to biological maturation have
been suggested as ways to account for differences between adults and children.
Chief among these alternatives are computationally influenced models which
appeal to the radical differences in terms of specific domain knowledge and
processing capacities through development.

We wish to address two related issues in this event: First, to what extent do
language acquisition abilities decline in adulthood? Second, to the extent that
adults are worse than children in acquiring language, what is the mechanism that
causes this decline? The goal of the symposium is to bring together scholars
with a range of views and thereby foster debate and discussion.

The symposium will include invited talks by:
James Flege, University of Alabama, Birmingham
Silvina Montrul, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Ann Senghas, Barnard College
Jason Zevin, Sackler Institute

We invite abstracts for contributed talks on research examining the critical
period hypothesis for language.  We hope that the final symposium program will
represent many different perspectives that include different dimensions of
language (Phonology, Syntax), different empirical approaches (Linguistics,
Psychology, Neuroscience), and different empirical domains (L1 acquisition, L2
acquisition, Computational Linguistics).

Contributed talks will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions.

Abstracts of at most 500 words should be submitted as an email attachment to
springsym@ling.osu.edu in pdf (preferred) or Word format by Friday, February 13,
2009.  Please include only the title and text of the abstract in the attachment.
 The authors' names, affiliations, and postal and email addresses should be
included in the text of the email.

Symposium website: http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~springsym/

Please email springsym@ling.osu.edu if you have any questions.

The Symposium is made possible through the generous support of the Targeted
Investment in Excellence in the College of Humanities, the Department of
Psychology, the Center for Cognitive Science, and the Department of Spanish and
Portuguese at the Ohio State University.
