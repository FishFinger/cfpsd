Doctoral Consortium at NAACL-HLT 2007
 http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/dc/

 April 22, 2007
 Rochester, NY

 Application Deadline: Jan 18, 2007


1. Call for Participation

 Following the success of last year, the Doctoral Consortium at
 NAACL-HLT 2007 will provide an opportunity for a group of senior
 Ph.D. students to discuss and explore their research and career
 objectives with a panel of established researchers in the fields of
 natural language processing, speech technology, and information
 retrieval.  The event is also an opportunity for students to develop
 the skills necessary to effectively communicate one's research in
 preparation for future job talks.

 The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop on April 22, 2007,
 immediately before the start of the main conference.  Students will
 present their work and get feedback from a panel of experienced
 researchers.  The event will also include a panel presentation on
 professional development topics relevant to students pursuing research
 careers in academia or industry.

 Students will participate in a poster session held during the main
 conference and will have a short paper discussing their research
 published in the companion volume of the proceedings.  Each student's
 professional biography, research abstract, and photograph will also be
 included in a face book to be distributed to all attendees of the
 main NAACL-HLT 2007 conference.

 The consortium has the following objectives: (1) to provide feedback
 on participants' research and on the presentation of their work to
 others; (2) to develop a supportive community of scholars; (3) to
 support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on
academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths; and
 (4) to contribute to the NAACL-HLT conference goals through
 interaction with other researchers and participation in conference
 events.

 There is a possibility that students who participate in the Doctoral
 Consortium may be able to receive an allowance for basic conference
registration, travel, and hotel.  The Doctoral Consortium organizers
 are currently applying for funding for such travel support.  Updates
 will be available on the Doctoral Consortium website:
 http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/dc/

 NAACL-HLT 2007 continues the combination of the Human Language
 Technology Conferences (HLT) and North American Chapter of the
 Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) Annual Meetings
 begun in 2003. Human language technology incorporates a broad spectrum
of disciplines working to enable natural language human-computer
 interaction, and providing services such as speech recognition,
 automatic translation, information retrieval, text summarization, and
information extraction. For further information on the main
 conference, please see
 http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/


 2. Eligibility for Participation
 The event is designed for senior Ph.D. students who are in the last
 few years of their doctoral program (who have already settled on a
 research direction and who have likely already submitted a thesis
 proposal).  Students who are conducting research on all aspects of
 human language processing are invited to apply.  Topics include (but
 are not limited to):

   + Computational analysis of language
     - Phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, dialogue,
      discourse, and style

   + Speech processing, including:
     - Speech recognition and speech generation
     - Rich transcription: automatic annotation of information structure
       and sources in speech

  + Information retrieval, text classification, and information
     filtering/recommendation
     - Text data mining, information extraction, text summarization, and
       question answering
   + Multimodal representations and processing

   + Statistical and learning techniques for language, including
     - Corpus-based language modeling
     - Lexical and knowledge acquisition

   + Development of language resources, including
     - Lexicons and ontologies
    - Treebanks, proposition banks, and frame banks

   + Language generation and text planning

   + Multilingual processing, including
     - Machine translation of speech and text
     - Cross-language information retrieval
     - Multi-lingual speech recognition and language identification

   + Intelligent systems for natural language interaction, including
     - Conversational systems for collaboration, tutoring and behavioral
       intervention
     - Embodied conversational agents, virtual humans and human-robot
      conversation
     - Language-enhanced platforms for interactive narrative and digital
      entertainment

   + Evaluation, including
     - Glass-box evaluation of HLT systems and system components
     - Black-box evaluation of HLT systems in application settings


 As part of the application process, students will submit a short paper
summarizing their research goals, completed work, and future
 directions.  This paper should be the basis for the student's
 presentation at the Doctoral Consortium event, which should follow the
 format of an abbreviated job talk.  Thus, the paper should give an
 overview of the student's research and highlight his or her
 contributions; the paper may include citations to previous
 publications that describe more specific aspects of the student's
 research.
 The short papers accepted for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium
 cannot be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with
 publicly available proceedings.  Papers that are being submitted to
 other conferences must indicate this immediately after the title
 material on the first page.

 Students who are submitting papers on specific portions of their work
to the main conference are also invited to apply to the Doctoral
 Consortium.  In this case, the short paper for the Doctoral Consortium
 must give an overview of the student's dissertation research, and the
 paper for the main conference should focus on a specific piece of this
 work.


 3. Application Procedure

 Applications should contain the following four elements:

 (1) A cover letter (under 2-pages) describing the student's progress
 in his or her degree program, expected date of graduation, plans after
 graduation, and what he or she hopes to gain from the Doctoral
 Consortium.  The letter should contain the student's name, department,
 school, contact information, name of advisor, advisor's e-mail
 address, and a short statement affirming that the student meets the
 eligibility requirements specified in Section 2 of this Call for
 Participation.

 (2) The student's Curriculum Vitae (including a list of publications).

(3) A short paper written by the student summarizing his or her
 research goals, completed work, and future directions.  This paper
 should be the basis for the student's presentation at the Doctoral
 Consortium event, and it should give an overview of the student's
 research and highlight his or her major contributions.

 (4) A letter of recommendation from the student's advisor.  The
 student's advisor should produce a PDF file of the recommendation
 letter and e-mail it to naacl-hlt-2007-dc@cs.columbia.edu by
 Jan 18, 2007.

 The student should send email to naacl-hlt-2007-dc@cs.columbia.edu by
 Jan 18, 2007, with three attachments in PDF format: the cover letter,
 the Curriculum Vitae, and the short paper.

 The short paper should follow the format of "short papers" submitted
to the main NAACL-HLT 2007 conference.  It should follow the
 two-column format of NAACL/ACL proceedings and should not exceed four
 (4) pages, including references.  We strongly recommend the use of ACL
 LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's
 conference.  They will be available through the Doctoral Consortium
 homepage (listed below).  A description of the format will also be
 available in case you are unable to use the style files directly.
 Papers must conform to the official NAACL-HLT 2007 style guidelines,
 and we reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to
 these styles including font size restrictions.  Submissions should be
 in PDF format and must include all fonts, so that the paper will print
 (not just view) anywhere.

 Further details on the submission procedure and formatting
 instructions may be found at the Doctoral Consortium homepage:
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/dc/

 If students are accepted to the Doctoral Consortium, they will also be
 asked to submit a short professional biography, research abstract, and
 photograph to be included in the face book to be distributed to all
 participants at the NAACL-HLT 2007 conference.  Detailed formatting
 guidelines for the preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be
 provided to authors with their acceptance notice.


 4. Important Dates

 All application materials must be received by 11:59pm (23:59) PST
 (Pacific Standard Time) on Jan 18, 2007.  Late submissions will be
 automatically disqualified.  Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon
 after receipt.
