ELECTRONIC CORPORA OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES
International Conference

CALL FOR PAPERS

*** APOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE POSTINGS ***

* AIMS OF CONFERENCE

Electronic corpora of ancient languages offer important information =

about the culture and history of ancient civilizations, but at the same =

time they constitute a valuable source of linguistic information. The =

scholarly community is increasingly aware of the importance of =

computer-aided analysis of these corpora, and of the rewards it can =

bring. The construction of electronic corpora for ancient languages is a =

complex task. Many more pieces of information have to be taken into =

account than for living languages, e.g. the artefact bearing the text, =

lacunae, level of restoration, etc. The electronic corpora can be =

enriched with links to images, annotations, and other secondary sources. =

The annotations should deal with matters such as textual damage, =

possible variant readings, etc., as well as with many features specific =

to ancient languages.

Recent years have witnessed a considerable increase in electronic corpus =

construction for ancient languages, with the involvement of many =

institutions across the world. The time is ripe to see whether the =

experiences of scholars working on such projects can profitably be shared.

* SUBMISSIONS

We invite submissions on all aspects of the construction of corpora of =

ancient languages, as well as on their use for different purposes. We =

especially welcome submissions on the linguistic use of these corpora, =

and their linguistic annotation.

* SUBMISSIONS PROCEDURE

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on the topic of =

the conference. Submission of an abstract is required first, for the =

review process. After presentation at the conference, the papers will be =

published. They will be required in final form for publication in =

January 2008.
Abstracts in PDF format should be sent to petr.zemanek@ff.cuni.cz not =

later than September 24th.
