                        CALL FOR PAPERS
      ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing
                       Special Issue on
              Machine Translation of Asian Languages

   In the field of Asian language processing, translation is a
particularly pressing challenge owing to the diversity among the
languages of Asia as well as between Asian and Western languages. Yet
this challenge also affords the opportunity for new breakthroughs in the
search for automatic translation methods that can bridge every language
gap. We invite papers on recent advances in machine translation from and
into Asian languages. Submissions must not have been previously
published, with the exception that substantial extensions of conference
papers will be considered. Topics of interest include:

   * solutions to translation issues particular to Asian languages
   * new translation models, or improvements to translation models,
     motivated by Asian languages
   * general machine translation research applied to Asian languages
   * translation and transliteration of named entities
   * interactions between translation and word-segmentation or
     morphological processing
   * impact of novel resources (parallel corpora, treebanks, linguistic
     tools) on machine translation
   * spoken language translation for Asian languages
   * error analysis and linguistic analysis of problems in Asian
     language machine translation

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:
Papers should be formatted following the style guidelines for the ACM
Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing
(http://www.acm.org/pubs/talip/authors.html#STYLE_GUIDELINES). Please
submit papers in PDF format using the web-based submission system
Manuscript Central (http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/talip). In order to
identify the submission as for the special issue, please indicate "This
paper is being submitted to the Special Issue on Asian MT" on the Cover
Page of the paper.
