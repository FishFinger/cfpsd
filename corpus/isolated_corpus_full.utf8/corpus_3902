Full Title: 13th Ann Conf European Assoc for Machine Translation 
Short Title: EAMT 2009 

Date: 14-May-2009 - 15-May-2009
Location: Barcelona, Spain 
Contact Person: Harold Somers
Meeting Email: eamt2009chairs@talp.upc.edu
Web Site: http://www.talp.cat/eamt09 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics;
Translation 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

The 13th annual conference of the European Association for Machine Translation
is intended to provide a forum for researchers, commercial developers and users
to exchange ideas concerning all aspects of Machine Translation and
translation-related tools and resources. 

Call for Papers

The aim is to present recent research and the current state of the art in the
area, explore emerging R&D trends, provide information about evaluation
techniques and tools and review the translation needs for and uses of
translation technologies on the part of government and industry.

Scientific Programme

This year the central theme of the conference is:
Translation among European languages, especially for languages with smaller
speech communities and limited digital resources.

There are 23 official languages in the EU almost half of which have fewer than
10 million speakers. In addition, there are perhaps as many as 80 additional
recognized languages or dialects spoken within its territory, the majority of
which have fewer than 2 million speakers. The problems faced by government and
industry in providing goods and services to people in their native language, in
many cases a matter of law, is at the very least daunting. At the same time,
current MT development methods require large amounts of human and/or digital
resources. Thus, the focus of this EAMT conference is on methods for developing
translation technologies for and among languages with fewer speakers and more
limited digital resources.
At the same time, contributions are welcome on all topics related to MT or
translation-related technologies including:
MT methodologies and techniques
Speech-to-speech translation
Translation aids (translation memory, terminology databases, etc.)
Practical MT systems (MT for professionals, MT for multilingual eCommerce, MT
for localization, etc.)
Translation environments (workflow, support tools, conversion tools for lexica,
etc.)
MT embedded in other services (web search, eGovernment, etc.)
MT evaluation techniques and tools
Dictionaries and lexica for MT
Text and speech corpora for MT
Standards in text and lexicon encoding for MT 
Human factors in MT and user interfaces
Multilingual technologies (natural language generation, information retrieval,
text categorization, text summarization, information extraction, etc.) 

The two-day programme will include invited talks, oral presentations and poster
sessions.

Workshops will be held on Wednesday, May 20. 

Proposals for workshops should include the title of the workshop, a proposed
schedule (e.g. call for papers, recruitment of speakers), a list of workshop
activities (papers, hands-on activities, shared tasks), technical requirements,
the expected number of participants, and whether this is part of an ongoing
series, or new workshop.

Send submissions to local organizers.  We will evaluate Workshop proposals as
