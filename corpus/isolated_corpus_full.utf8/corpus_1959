Meeting Description

The use of formal ontologies in knowledge systems has many advantages. 
It allows for an unambiguous specification of the structure of knowledge 
in a domain, enables knowledge sharing and, as a result, makes it possible 
to perform automated reasoning about ontologies. In recent years there has been
a worldwide increase in the use of ontologies, both in industry and in research
laboratories. There is a growing community of researchers in Australia and New
Zealand, working on various aspects of ontologies. The primary aim of this
workshop is to bring together ontology researchers in the region.

Topics

The workshop will seek submission of papers on original and unpublished research
on all aspects of ontology research, including, but not limited to 
- ontology models and theories,
- ontologies and the semantic web; 
- interoperability in ontologies; 
- multi-agent systems and ontologies; 
- description logics for ontologies; 
- reasoning with ontologies; 
- ontology harvesting on the web; 
- ontology of agents and actions; 
- ontology visualisation; 
- ontology engineering and management;
- ontology-based information extraction and retrieval

Paper Submission

An electronic copy in PDF format in English should be submitted at the workshop
easychair site (http://www.easychair.org/AOW2007) by 30 September 2007 with
detailed information of author(s). Authors will be notified of acceptance by
October 19, 2007. The camera-ready papers will be due on November 09, 2007. At
least one author of every accepted paper should register for the workshop.
 
Full papers should be a maximum of 10 pages in length in double column format as
per submission instructions posted on the website. The proceedings of AOW-07
will be published by the ACS as Volume 85, ISBN 1-920-68266-X, ISSN 1445-1336,
in the CRPIT Series. The formatting requirements and resources for authors can
be found on the CRPIT Authors Page (http://crpit.com/Authors.html).

The Proceedings of AOW05 was published by the Australian Computer Society in
Volume 58 of the Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology
(CRPIT) series. The proceedings of AOW06 was also published in Volume 72 of the
CRPIT Series (http://crpit.com) with an ISBN. 

Important Dates

Full paper submission due: 30 September, 2007 
Notification of acceptance: 19 October, 2007
Camera-ready copy due: 09 November, 2007

The authors of selected papers from the AOW-06 were invited to submit longer,
extended versions of their papers to a Special Issue on Advances in Ontologies
of Expert Systems: The Journal of Knowledge Engineering published by Blackwells.
We expect selected papers from the AOW-07 will similarly be published in a
special issue of an appropriate journal.

Meeting Description:

GURT 2008
Telling Stories: Building bridges among Language, Narrative, Identity,
Interaction, Society and Culture.

Narratives have been studied in many different disciplines: linguistics,
literary theory, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology,
folklore, anthropology, sociology and history.

The primary focus of GURT 2008 is the linguistic study of narrative, especially
as it has developed within discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.

As our theme suggests, however, studying the language of narrative can take us
far afield to other concerns: the construction of self and identity; the
differences among spoken, written and computer-mediated discourse; the role that
small and big (e.g. life) stories play in everyday social interactions; the
contribution of narrative to social status, roles and meanings within
institutional settings as varied as therapeutic and medical encounters,
education, politics, media, marketing and public relations.

Thus GURT 2008 will be a forum for building interconnections among language,
narrative and social life.

Featured Speakers: William Labov, Jerome Bruner, Richard Bauman 

We invite proposals for presentations related to the conference themes:

- the language of narratives: form, meaning and use
- narrative modalities: spoken, written, computer-mediated
- small/short stories in everyday social interaction
- large/long stories in life stories and oral histories 
- narrative in and of social institutions, e.g. clinical 
- practice (therapy, medicine), education, politics, media, 
- marketing, public relations
- narratives of displacement, resistance and social change

Proposal submission deadline is October 15, 2007. Notification of proposal
acceptance: December 12, 2007. A prize will be awarded to the best student
presentation or poster; no separate application is needed.

Presentation formats include:

(1) Colloquia: Scheduled for 2-hour blocks. Colloquium organizers may divide
time as they choose, but time should be allocated for opening and closing
remarks, presentations, discussion and audience response. Organizers serve as
the liaison between participants and the conference organizers. Organizers may
choose to participate in the panel as a presenter or discussant.

(2) Individual papers: 20 minutes long with a 10-minute discussion period.

(3) Poster presentations: displayed for a 2-hour block of time; an opportunity
to report on work in progress in one-on-one discussions.

Poster and paper submissions will require an abstract of 250 words. Colloquia
submissions will require a 250 word abstract (describing the overall session), a
title and an abstract (250 words) for each paper.

Proposal submission is only through the conference website: 

http://www8.georgetown.edu/college/gurt/2008

More information about the submission procedure is available under Abstract
Submission.
