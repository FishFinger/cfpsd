Meeting Description:

'Accents' is an annual conference continuing the tradition of earlier meetings
of researchers and teachers of phonetics, phonology and EFL interested in the
issue of accent in English spoken as a native or non-native language. The main
theme of this year's conference is accent variability in time and space. We
invite papers in this area, however we hope to continue the discussion of other
issues, including the following  
- Variability in native accents of English
- Variability in non-native accents of English
- Native- non-native accent continuum
- The norm / reference accents in EFL
- The use and acquisition of English speech by non-native speakers
- Socio-phonetics 
- Methodology of accent studies 
- Pedagogical implications 

Call for Papers

Papers related to the above issues and other aspects of accent studies are
invited. Please send  two copies of an abstract of about 400 words (excluding
references) in a .doc format to accents@uni.lodz.pl, with your name and
affiliation written under the title in one copy. Papers will typically last
about 20 minutes with 10 minutes for questions. After the process of
peer-revision, e-mail notifications will be sent
out by  October 11, 2009.
