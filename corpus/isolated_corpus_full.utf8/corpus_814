Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 16-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

Pronouns have been described as substitutes for nouns. They are said to
have a purely syntectic function in the sentence. The Hindi pronouns Tu,
tum and aap have a sociolinguistic importance. Similarly English pronouns
Thou, thee thy, ye, you convey some specific message. 

India has been referred to as ''sociolinguistic giant''. Sociolinguistic
study of three Hindi pronouns and Middle English pronouns reveals some
interesting facts which is a new field of study.

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 16-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

The Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational
Linguistics (PACLING-2007 ) will be held in Melbourne, Australia 
from 2007-09-19 to 2007-09-22.  The theme is 'Deep processing: 
Abstracting away from the Surface', but substantial, original, 
unpublished research is welcome on any topic in computational linguistics. 

Pacling-2007
Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics

University of Melbourne, Australia

September 19-21, 2007

Schedule:

Submission deadline: Apr 16, 2007
Notification of acceptance: Jun 15, 2007
Camera-ready copy due: Jul 22, 2007
Conference dates: Sep 19--21, 2007

Aims:

Pacling 2007 is a high-quality, workshop-style conference whose aim is
to promote friendly scientific interaction relating to computational
linguistics among Pacific Rim countries.  The emphasis of the
conference is on interdisciplinary scientific exchange demonstrating
openness towards high-quality research falling outside current
dominant schools of thought, and on technological transfer within the
Pacific region.  The conference represents a unique forum for
scientific and technological exchange, being smaller than ACL and
COLING, and more regional with extensive representation from the
Pacific.

Topics:

In addition to general computational linguistics, Pacling-2007 will
have a major theme:

Deep processing: Abstracting away from the surface

Submissions referring to the above theme are encouraged.  However,
substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any
topic in computational linguistics, including, but not limited to, the
following:

 - Phonology and Phonetics;
 - Morphology and Morphological Analysis;
 - Syntax and Syntactic Analysis;
 - Semantics and Semantic Analysis;
 - Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis;
 - Spoken Language and Dialogue;
 - Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing;
 - Text and Message Understanding;
 - Text and Message Generation;
 - Machine Translation;
 - Text Summarization;
 - Information Extraction;
 - Information Retrieval and Question-Answering;
 - Language Learning;
 - Natural Language Interfaces;
 - Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontologies.

Submission of Papers:

Authors should prepare anonymous submissions, in English, of up to 8 pages
including references.  Guidelines and style sheets (based on the ACL
styles) are available at the web site: 
(http://mandrake.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pacling2007/).

Papers that are being submitted to other conferences, whether verbatim or in
essence must declare this fact. If a paper appears at another conference, it
must be withdrawn from Pacling-2007. Papers that violate these requirements
are subject to rejection without review.

All papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format, through a web-based
submission system. The link to the submission web site will be made available
on the web site.
