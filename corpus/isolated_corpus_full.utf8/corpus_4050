"Teaching Italian with Technology-based Visual Aids: Issues and Perspectives"
In the last decades, technology has played a key role in language teaching and
has offered an increasing number of userfriendly tools for students and teachers
either inside or outside the classroom. Among the many recent achievements in
technology-based FL instruction, this session intends to focus on the visual
support in learning/teaching a foreign language and the evaluation of its future
possibilities. Topics for consideration may include:
1) theoretical research about pedagogy, methodology, and assessment of
technology-based visual aids in Second Language Acquisition?
2) new experiments with videos: from web-based tools (e.g. YouTube/ TeacherTube,
RAI materials) to more sophisticated programs, from teacher-made ad hoc
materials to films and film excerpts, from student-made short movies to vodcasts
and vlogs?
3) curricular topics or special projects realized with the newest technological
visual aids for any level of instruction (from elementary Italian to more
complex content courses)

Please submit a 300-word abstract plus references for a 20 minute paper. Please
include your affiliation and contact information.

Organizers: Alessandra Seggi and Rita Pasqui (The New School University, New
York) (SeggA328@newschool.edu? PasquiR@newschool.edu)

Meeting Description:

Ways to protolanguage - the initial stages of the evolution of the language faculty 

Call for Papers

We'd like to cordially invite you to taking part in the conference Ways to
protolanguage: the initial stages of the evolution of the language faculty. The
conference will take place Sept21-23, 2009 in Toru?, Poland.

The fascinating and thought provoking subject area of language evolution is all
the more interesting because of the wealth of recently available empirical data
that have been changing its profile for the last two decades. One of the primary
goals of this conference is bringing together researchers representing diverse
areas to gain a multidisciplinary perspective on the range of currently
available evidence relevant to early language evolution.

The focus of the conference is on the early stages of the emergence of symbolic,
language-like communication in hominids. The helpful term protolanguage is
intended in a broad understanding, as (the capacity for developing) the most
primitive communicative system that is nevertheless characterised by certain
language-like features, such as the use of the conventional sign and intentional
transfer of honest information - and thus differing qualitatively from what is
found in present-day communication of nonhuman animals.

The conference shall reflect the inherently interdisciplinary nature of research
into the evolution of language. We invite papers from a wide range of subjects
related to the initial stages of language evolution, including general
evolutionary theory, evolutionary psychology, pleistocene archaeology,
paleoanthropology, genetics of language disorders, cultural anthropology, speech
physiology, gesture studies, neuroscience of speech, primatology, animal
cognition, animal communication.

A central theme will be the importance of bringing together many kinds of varied
evidence for drawing a complex picture of the evolution of language, especially
in its earliest stages. Consequently, papers accessible to audiences across
discipline boundaries are preferred to very specific papers requiring highly
specialised background. Speculative scenarios centred around particular
selective pressures are strongly discouraged; instead, we encourage
presentations discussing latest relevant empirical findings, basic
methodological issues, constraints on scenarios, identifying stages,
synthesising recent findings from a relevant field (e.g. major points of
consensus/controversy), etc.
