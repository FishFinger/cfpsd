Meeting Description
Call for papers - VALS-ASLA Conference 2008 
Changing societies: methodological challenges for applied linguistics

Lugano, USI, Facoltà di Scienze della comunicazione 
7-9 February 2008

At a time when societal changes such as the globalisation of spaces, the
circulation of goods, the mobility of individuals, and the spread of new
technologies occupy increased importance in the spheres of social life
(economic, political, educational), questions arise as to the impact of such
changes on linguistic practices, thus presenting a central challenge to the
field of applied linguistics.

The ever increasing mobility of people and circulation of goods in a globalised
marketplace trigger new language needs and practices. Consequently, new
realities are emerging from the contact between contemporary forms of language
and culture, which are tied to migration and trade, as well as computer-mediated
communication practices. The field of applied linguistics is confronted with
these phenomena today, which constitute methodological challenges for our
discipline and raise fundamental questions about our research practices. 

The VALS-ASLA conference aims to interrogate these ongoing changes by focusing
specifically on concomitant methodological challenges. In this regard, we invite
all interested scholars to submit papers and panel proposals related to the
following domains: 

- Teaching and learning of languages; 
- Globalisation and multilingualism;
- Migration, transnationalism and language practices;
- Languages at work;
- Transfer of knowledge.

Date: 08-Oct-2008 - 11-Oct-2008
Location: Freiburg, Germany 
Contact Person: Christian Mair
Meeting Email: isle2008@anglistik.uni-freiburg.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

ISLE, the International Society for the Linguistics of English, and the
English Department of the University of Freiburg are pleased to announce
the society's inaugural conference. Its aim is both to explore the role
that descriptions of English can play in the development of linguistic
theories and to explore ways in which current theoretical approaches can be
made fruitful for the description of English. We invite linguists of all
theoretical persuasions to submit proposals for papers and poster
presentations which deal with aspects of the structure and the use of English. 

The following keynote speakers have agreed to participate:

Bas Aarts (UCL, London): [title to be announced]
David Crystal (Bangor): ''The public understanding of linguistics''	
Olga Fischer (Amsterdam): ''The importance of analogy in language
acquisition and change''
Raj Mesthrie (Cape Town): ''The sociophonetics of English in post-apartheid
South Africa''	
John Rickford (Stanford): [not yet confirmed]
Elizabeth Traugott (Stanford): Presidential address
Anna Wierzbicka (ANU, Canberra): ''NSM Semantics and corpus linguistics:
Unlocking the meanings of English collocations''

In line with the keynote speakers' research emphases, we envisage a
programme of contributions taking shape around the following major areas of
concern: 

- the study of spoken English: transcription, corpus technology
- new approaches to the study of variation and change
- linguistic theory/ linguistic description
- web-based linguistics: ''caveat googlator''?
- linguistic theory and the history of English
- the linguist and the public: (mis)communication and the popular
understanding of linguistics

We explicitly welcome proposals for further thematic sections, especially
from colleagues willing to take responsibility in organising them.

If you are interested in attending and/ or contributing to the conference,
please return the completed pre-registration form below by 31 October 2007.
You will be notified of the acceptance of your contribution by 30 November
2007, when official registration will start and detailed information about
travel and accommodation will be provided.
