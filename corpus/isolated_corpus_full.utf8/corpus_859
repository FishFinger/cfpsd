CLIP-2007: CROSS-LANGUAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING

Beyond document processing:
from computational linguistics to computational humour


CALL FOR PAPERS
Third international CLIP workshop
July 7-10, 2007 - Camogli (Genova), Italy
http://clip.disi.unige.it/clip2007


Description

The CLIP workshop focuses on computational linguistics in cross-language
contexts. The 2007 edition will also be devoted to making sense out of
texts processing their semantics, sentiments, emotions and humour taking
into account the affective weight of lexicon.

Language technologies have steadily evolved in recent years. However the
issue of language diversity has not been addressed to a similar extent =
as
other aspects. Indeed, many socio-economical environments, of which the
European Union is a prominent example, are inherently based on cultural
diversity. Therefore solving multilingual issues is central to the
development of the Information Society in the EU. On the other hand, =
this
is true in many other instances (we may recall the case of India with =
more
than 20 official languages and several more idioms actually spoken). =
This
means that this topic is of strong European interest, but has a global
relevance.

The final aim of the event is to bring together researchers with =
different
backgrounds to encourage a cross-disciplinary discussion in the
computational linguistics field making emphasis also on recent
computational trends such as sentiment analysis and automatic humour
recognition, the topic of the invited talk.

Topics

Submissions are welcome in areas of computational linguistics with an
emphasis on the multilingual aspect as well as on new trends such as new
trends such as automatic sentiment, emotion and humour recognition.

- Ontologies in linguistics
- Text classification and clustering
- Text mining
- Text summarisation
- Question answering
- Word sense disambiguation
- Sentiment analysis
- Computational humour


Workshop Format and Paper Submission

Submit an extended abstract by e-mail directly to the chair (see below,
and note the anti-spam format) by DECEMBER 15, 2006.

Submitted papers will be judged based on relevance to the
cross-disciplinary dissemination, novelty of the idea, technical =
quality,
clarity of presentation, and expected impact on future research within =
the
area of focus.

CLIP-2007 will be a special session within the WILF2007 workshop, Hotel
Portofino Kulm, Portofino Vetta - Ruta di Camogli, Genova (Italy), July
7-10, 2007. Registration to WILF2007 will be required for participation,
so perspective participants are invited to refer to the main conference
website: http://wilf2007.disi.unige.it/ for all details not covered in =
the
present call.


Invited talk

Rada Mihalcea (http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/) on automatic humour
recognition.
