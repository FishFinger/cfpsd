Special issue of Reading and Writing on "Reading and Dyslexia in Arabic"
Guest Editors: Abdessatar Mahfoudhi, Gad Elbeheri (Center for Child
Evaluation & Teaching, Kuwait) and John Everatt (University of Canterbury, NZ)

The Journal invites submissions of articles to be considered for
publication in a special issue entitled 'Reading and Dyslexia in Arabic'.
Most empirical work in literacy development and reading disorders has been
conducted on alphabetic languages that use the Latin script, especially
English. Arabic, a Semitic language that uses an alphabetic-syllabic
writing system is particularly interesting because of the rather unique
characteristics of its morphology and orthography to inform our
understanding of literacy across languages and orthographies. Because of
the importance of the topic and because of the paucity of research in this
language, we are inviting contributions of original empirical research on
the following general topics: (i) predictors of reading and/or spelling in
Arabic in different age groups; (ii) reading and/or spelling in typical and
dyslexic/at-risk Arabic-speaking readers ; (iii) development of reading
correlates (including, phonological awareness, orthographic awareness,
morphological awareness) in typical and dyslexic or at-risk Arabic readers;
(iv) reading in bilinguals (Arabic as either a first or an additional
language) and (v) intervention studies. 

Articles must be submitted by November 1, 2009. 

General guidelines on manuscript preparation can be found at: 
www.springeronline.com/journal/11145

Please submit papers for this special issue to Abdessatar Mahfoudhi, using
the on-line submission facility (www.springeronline.com/journal/11145) or
as an email attachment to (a.mahfoudhi@ccetkuwait.org or mabessatar@yahoo.com)
