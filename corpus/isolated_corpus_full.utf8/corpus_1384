CALL FOR PAPERS

2nd International Workshop on Multimodal And Pervasive
Services
(M A P S'07 )
http://www.irpps.cnr.it/eventi/maps07.htm
July 15 - 20, 2007, Istanbul, Turkey

at

IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Services 2007
(ICPS'07)
http://icpsconference.org/2007/
July 15 - 20, 2007, Istanbul, Turkey



Aims and Scope

Pervasive services are created by connection of computer, networks, =
devices
and sensors. Computing environment are often difficult to use for people
without technological ability and for people with disabilities.
Multimodality makes easy the access to pervasive services. Multimodal
interaction offers users the freedom to select from multiple modes of
interaction with services.=20
Multimodality and pervasive services permit to break down barriers about
human-computer interaction making communication intuitive and =
spontaneous.
Multimodal pervasive services improve the interaction between human and
system because make characteristics of the systems more analogue to the
paradigm of human-to human interaction. Indeed the human communication =
is
often obtained by the combination of different modes and therefore it is
multimodal.=20
Multimodal interaction improves the accessibility of the pervasive =
services.
The objectives of the MAPS Workshop are to give the state of the art, =
and to
propose new methods, techniques and approaches of multimodal interaction =
for
offering pervasive services and improving a practice access to pervasive
services from mobile devices.


List of topics

The MAPS Workshop invites researchers, engineers, services developers to
propose their research and works in the field of multimodality and =
pervasive
services. Papers may deal on method, models, case studies, practical
experience and technologies. The papers can include topics as:=20
. Accessibility of multimodal interfaces
. Multimodal mobile services
. Methods of multimodal integration
. Advanced multimodal interfaces
. Multimodal web and services
. Multimodal interaction in mobile devices
. Future Pervasive and immersive environments
. Future pervasive and interactive communication system
. Interaction metaphors for pervasive services
. Usability evaluation methodologies for pervasive application
. Environments and algorithms for pervasive application development
. Development tools for flexible and adaptive interaction methods
. Interactive context-aware services on mobile devices
. Affective digital content
. Humanising interfaces
. Design of new services
. User experiences, user studies
. Application and scenarios
