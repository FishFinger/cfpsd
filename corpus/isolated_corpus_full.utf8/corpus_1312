working on Austronesian languages to participate.

Researchers working in any area of Austronesian linguistics are invited to

-    typology;
-    descriptive linguistics;
-    documentary linguistics and language endangerment;
-    historical linguistics;
-    lexicology;
-    applied linguistics;
-    discourse.

Papers will be twenty minutes in length plus ten minutes for discussion.
Submissions should be made by email (subject: ALL3 abstract) to aj4@soas.ac.uk,
and should include:

-    title of the paper;
-    name, affiliation, email address, snail address and telephone

Full Title: Conference on Ditransitive Constructions 

Date: 23-Nov-2007 - 25-Nov-2007
Location: Leipzig, Germany 
Contact Person: Martin Haspelmath
Meeting Email: haspelmath@eva.mpg.de
Web Site: http://email.eva.mpg.de/~haspelmt/confditrans.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Language Description; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This conference will bring together descriptivists and comparativists for an
in-depth discussion of the morphosyntactic, semantic and discourse properties of
ditransitive constructions in the world's languages. 

Conference on Ditransitive Constructions in the World's Languages

Leipzig, 23-25 November 2007

organized by Andrej Malchukov and Martin Haspelmath
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig

Invited speakers:

Balthasar Bickel (U Leipzig)
Bernard Comrie (MPI-EVA Leipzig)
Bernd Heine & Christa König (U Cologne)

Theme:

We especially encourage contributions providing a systematic description of
ditransitive constructions in individual, little-known languages (perhaps guided
by our Questionnaire; see conference website), based on original fieldwork. But
papers dealing with ditransitive constructions in better known languages, or
from a comparative or general theoretical perspective, are also welcome. We are
hoping to publish an edited volume including a position paper and 20-odd
selected surveys of ditransitive constructions in typologically diverse
languages on the basis of conference presentations.
