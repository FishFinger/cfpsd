Call For Papers

IEEE-ICHSL.6: 6th International Conference on Human System Learning
Common Innovation in e-learning, Machine Learning and Humanoid
http://www.ichsl6.org
14-16 May 2008 
Manufacture des Tabacs, University of Toulouse 1
Toulouse, France

Organised by: LAAS-CNRS and the University of Toulouse1

Presentation

Human System Learning International Conferences are organized as a
cross-platform for the study and analysis of the latest research and
developments issues related to Human System Learning. What makes this
conference unique is the interaction of different disciplines with
regard to their approach, methods and techniques for the application
of advanced technologies.  Specifics of disciplines are not only the
subject of the conference but serve as cases.
Cross-platform discussions and interactions help to enhance the scope
of these technologies beyond their existing application
limits. Furthermore, we seek a discussion of terms and conditions for
introducing new concepts and tools (offered by the latest research and
developments results) and new strategies (required by the inevitable
changes of the professional and educational working environments).

Main scope: WHAT IS LEARNING?

The Information Society is burgeoning and new technology is shifting
educational, learning and training paradigms. Virtual Universities,
Cyber-Classrooms, e-Learning, Wireless Based Learning, Humanoid
Robots, Data Mining, Text Mining, Web Semantic, etc. may be cryptic
catch phrases now but will be within the main learning and teaching
norm in a very near future. The sixth ICHSL observes that, Machine
Learning, Humanoid (mainly Human Robot Interaction) and e-Learning
system have in common a real complex challenge: What learning has
become? Whether learning has to occur within Humans, Machines or
Interactions between Humans and Machine, the process of learning is
still perceived as complex.  Learning context has shifted. Learning
paradigms have shifted as well as learning Strategies.  Learning
environment has totally be changed as well as learning assessment,
learning control, learning evolving, learning scheduling, etc

Topics
    * Learning environment
    * Learning Logic
    * Learning paradigm
    * Human and Machine Learning Fuzziness
    * Human Robot Interaction (focused on learning approaches only)
    * Interactive Learning
    * Interactive e-learning
    * Interactive Mining Tools
    * Learning from electronic dynamic documents
    * New Learning Support Systems
    * And ICHSL relevant topics: Cognition, Data Mining, Distributed
      Artificial Intelligence, Ergonomic, Human-System Interactions,
      Humanoid, Knowledge Data Discovery, New Educational Technology,
      System Design, Text Mining, Wireless & Web Based Learning, Web
      Mining.

Instructions to Authors

Papers should be maximum 12 pages in length (a full page of text is
about 500 words), i.e. your contribution might be around 5000 words
long (including references) plus figures.

Submissions should be uploaded using the conference website, in PDF,
or MS-Word Format.  Final papers must be submitted directly to the
conference editor in MS-Word format ichsl6@europia.org.

Reviewing
All papers will be reviewed using a blind refereeing process by at
least two members of the International Advisory Board. The Reviewing
process is completely transparent and electronic.
