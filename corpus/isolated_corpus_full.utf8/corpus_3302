Meeting Description:

e-Humanities - an emerging discipline
Workshop at the 4th IEEE International Conference on e-Science
Indianapolis, USA
December 7-12, 2008 

2nd Call for Papers

Aim of the workshop In the Humanities the availability of new digital technology
and increasing amounts of digitized data has triggered the development of
several novel research methods. The capability of creating and using large
digital collections of structured and unstructured resources and the emergence
of powerful algorithms for processing the data from multiple perspectives is
already affecting all Humanities disciplines. However, to reap the full benefit
of e-Science approaches, a number of issues that are
specific for the Humanities must be addressed. It is the aim of this workshop to
do just this.

In the past many resources have been made available in digital form. These
include texts, multimedia documents, but also a wide range of meta-data, from
annotations of documents, via lexicons and taxonomies to grammatical
descriptions of many natural languages. Since these resources have been created
independently, in the absence of standards for character encoding, file formats,
annotation systems, access rights and IPR, these resources do not interoperate.
Yet, the full benefits of e-Humanities can only be had if independently created
resources can be combined, as if they formed one large resource. Therefore,
substantial work remains to be done to reach a situation in which each scholar
can peruse the combined resources with the same ease as if they formed one
homogeneous resource.

So far only a fraction of the existing documents that are of interest to the
Humanities has been digitized. The same holds for knowledge sources such as
lexicons and grammars. Thus, we are seeing, and we will be seeing, projects
aimed at digitizing additional resources. To avoid the need for expensive repair
measures to enable interoperability after the completion of these projects,
standards for all levels -from character encoding to the semantics of meta-data-
must be developed. Standardization activities are under way, but they are far
from completion.

The distributed character of the resources, in combination with local expertise
that is needed to keep them up-to-date, naturally leads to a Data Grid. The
enormous amounts of computations necessary for advanced automatic pattern
detection and other machine learning techniques gives rise to the need for using
Grid Computing. Both aspects of the Grid-based processing are likely to pose
special requirements related to the type of data, the type of questions that
scientists ask, and the access rights.

The specific questions addressed in the Humanities and the specific types of
data that are of interest require the development of dedicated algorithms. Even
if these algorithms can be adapted from related disciplines, there is still a
large amount of work to be done before the toolbox for e-Humanities research is
reasonably complete and before existing tools can easily be combined to workflow
chains by the humanities scholar who is not an expert.

e-Humanities can only be successful if it is possible to provide computer tools
that support scholars in their research, rather than forces them to spend lots
of time learning how to use new tools, or even worse, developing new tools. To
prepare researchers for using the emerging e-Humanities tools, novel courses
must be developed for undergraduate and graduate programs. However, even the
best possible education cannot compensate for bad design of the tools.
Therefore, the e-Humanities toolbox must come with an excellent user interface.

Papers submitted for presentation on the workshop should report original
research that has not been published elsewhere. In addition, we invite position
papers that make solid contributions to the design of a research roadmap for the
e-Humanities.

All papers submitted for presentation in the workshop will be reviewed by at
least three members of the Program Committee.

Against the background of the general aim of the workshop we invite papers in
all areas indicated above. Thus, the following topics will be covered:
- advanced e-Humanities research scenarios supported by language resources and
technology
- advanced collaboration scenarios for geographically distributed collaborative
research
- text and media integration, interoperability
- advanced computational modelling
- development of novel tools for Humanities research
- flexible knowledge weaving technology
- data and compute Grids
- advanced user interfaces supporting advanced e-Humanities methods
- education and training for e-Humanities researchers
- accessibility, legal and ethical issues involved in e-Humanities scenarios
-- impact of e-Humanities on the research process and changes of the role of the
researcher
- other topics that fit in the general goal of the workshop

The full-day workshop will comprise two invited lectures, oral and poster
presentations. The workshop will conclude with a discussion that should
contribute to the roadmap for future research in the field.

Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. We intend to
publish extended versions of the most interesting papers and the result of the
panel discussion in the form of a book, or as a special issue of a leading
journal in the field.

Important dates
Deadline for Submission of full papers: 22 August 2008
Notification of Acceptance: 5 September 2008
Final submission of camera-ready papers: 10 October 2008
Final Program published on the Web: 10 October 2008
Conference and Workshop: 7-12 December 2008

Submissions of papers with a maximum length of eight pages must use the
conference format instructions and only PDF documents without page numbering
will be accepted.

Organizers:
(CLARIN (http://www.clarin.eu/) and DARIAH (http://www.dariah.eu/) will take
care of continuity)
