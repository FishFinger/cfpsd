SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

  LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008)

endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)


Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Deadline: Friday, 29 February 2008

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/
Paper submission:  https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/MWE2008/submit.html

#################################################################

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for  =

collecting, sharing and exploiting MWE evaluation resources. We have  =

solicited contributions of such resources in a separate call. The new  =

collection of the resources can be downloaded from the Multiword  =

homepage: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/, and contributors have  =

been invited to submit a short paper describing their resource.

An exploratory shared task making use of the collected data sets will  =

be announced in a separate call. Participating teams are invited to  =

submit a short paper with an evaluation of their algorithm on  =

multiple data sets to the workshop. The deadline for shared task  =

papers is Friday, March 14th.

With this call, we invite submissions of REGULAR PAPERS, in  =

particular (but not limited to) research that relates to the  =

evaluation of MWE extraction methods and/or makes use of the new  =

resource collection. Topics of special interest are:

(a) Linguistic analysis of MWEs based on language resources (such as  =

corpora) and the impact that these studies have on NLP applications.  =

We particularly welcome papers that perform a cross-linguistic  =

analysis of MWEs, identify variation across languages, text types,  =

domains, etc. or investigate the variability of MWEs.

(b) Typologies of MWEs: Papers that describe classes of MWEs and  =

their representation in language resources, discuss different  =

approaches to the definition and classification of MWEs, or apply new  =

MWE typologies to the evaluation of computational techniques.

(c) The evaluation and comparison of multiword extraction techniques:  =

Do methods generalise across languages, text types, different classes  =

of MWEs, etc.? How useful and essential is linguistic knowledge and a  =

theoretical understanding of MWEs? Is fully automatic extraction  =

feasible or will manual intervention always be necessary?

(d) Evaluation methodology and the creation of gold standards for  =

MWEs. Papers should address theoretical and technical issues, while  =

descriptions of existing resources may be submitted as short papers  =

for the shared task. Topics of particular interest are novel types of  =

gold standards (such as human ratings from expert and non-expert  =

subjects, language resources derived from the Web, etc.), inter- =

annotator agreement in the manual validation of candidate lists  =

(which is often fairly low) and the task-based evaluation of MWE  =

resources in NLP applications.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Regular papers must adhere to the format of LREC proceedings  =

(preferably using the style files provided on the conference Web  =

site) and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.

As reviewing of regular papers will be blind, the paper should not  =

include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- =

citations and other references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or  =

software) that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.  =

For example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",  =

write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

The papers must be submitted no later than 23:59 GMT on February 29,  =

2008. Papers submitted after that time cannot be reviewed.

Please submit your paper here: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/ =
