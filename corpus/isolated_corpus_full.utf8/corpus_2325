Full Title: Snippets 


Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2007 

The submission deadline for Issue 17 of the syntax/semantics minijournal
'Snippets' is December 31,2007. 

As usual, submissions are to be sent to the address
snippets@unimi.it
Some relevant excerpts from the Snippets editorial statement follow. 

Further details can be found at the Snippets website
(http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/) together with all
published issues.

Excerpts from the Snippets Editorial Statement: 

1. Purpose 

The aim of Snippets is to publish specific remarks that motivate research
or that make theoretical points germane to current work. The ideal
contribution is the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is
not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said. 

2. Content 

We will publish notes that contribute to the study of syntax and semantics
in generative grammar. The notes are to be brief,self-contained and
explicit. They may do any of the following things: 

- point out an empirical phenomenon that goes against
accepted generalizations or that shows that some aspect of a theory is
problematic; 
- point out unnoticed minimal pairs that fall outside the scope of any
existing theory; 
- point out an empirical phenomenon that confirms the
predictions of a theory in an area where the theory has not been tested; 
- explicitly describe technical inconsistencies in a theory or in a set of
frequently adopted assumptions; 
- explicitly describe unnoticed assumptions that underlie a theory or
assumptions that a theory needs to be supplemented with in order to make
desired predictions; 
- call attention to little-known or forgotten literature in which issues of
immediate relevance are discussed. 

We also encourage submissions that connect psycholinguistic data to
theoretical issues. A proposal for a pilot experiment in language
acquisition or language processing could make for an excellent snippet. 

3. Submission details 

We will accept electronic submissions at the address
snippets@unimi.it Electronic submissions may take the form of (a) the text
of an e-mail message, or (b) an attached file. The attached file should be
a simple text file, a Word file (Mac or Windows), or a Rich Text Format
(RTF) file. All submissions must state the name and affiliation of the
author(s), and a (postal or electronic) return address. Submissions are to
be a maximum of 500 words (including examples), with an additional half
page allowed for diagrams, tables and references. Given that we envision
the submissions themselves as footnotes, the submissions may not contain
footnotes of their own. The ideal submission is one paragraph; a submission
of five lines is perfectly acceptable. We will not consider abstracts. 

4. Editorial policy 

Submissions will be reviewed by our editorial board,
and review will be name-blind both ways. While we guarantee a response
within 3 months of the submission deadline, we only guarantee a yes/no
response to the submitter.We will not require revisions (barring
exceptional cases). We allow resubmission (once) of the same piece.
