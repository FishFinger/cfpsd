*****  AUTONOMICS 2009 *****

3nd International ICST Conference on Autonomic Computing and Communication Systems

http://www.autonomics.eu/

September 9-11, 2009, Republic of Cyprus

Sponsored by ICST, technically sponsored by CREATE-NET

*****
In recent years, a plethora of electronic devices embedded into
everyday objects and able to interface with the surrounding
environment have emerged, foreshadowing the deployment of pervasive
context-aware services. Similar to the Internet, these trends will
revolutionize existing paradigms of communication, networking, and
computing. In particular, the complexity hidden in such dynamic
large-scale networks and services calls for self-management and
autonomicity as a necessary condition for obtaining purposeful
systems.

The challenges posed by such a vision cover a wide range of
disciplines and sciences, including computing, communication,
distributed systems, and control systems. Further, these challenges
call for a new, integrated and multidisciplinary approach to pervasive
computing and communication environments, giving rise to a new
converged science, able to work at the junction of systems, computing
and communication sciences. The Autonomics conference provides an
international forum driving the emergent science of autonomic systems,
bringing together research communities in communication and computing,
promoting cross-fertilization among the different disciplines
involved.

*****
Scope: The primary research challenges faced are the communication,
design, programming, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of
autonomic, pervasive, context-aware systems running on top of dynamic,
possibly large-scale, distributed systems.

*****
Authors are invited to submit papers to Autonomics 2009 reporting on
original research
related to the design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, and
deployment of autonomic systems. The conference intends to attract
attendees with diverse backgrounds. We solicit papers in autonomic,
pervasive, and context-aware systems. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

- Theoretical foundations of autonomic systems
- Models and metrics
- Energy-efficient algorithms
- Programming paradigms
- Middleware for pervasive systems
- Software architectures and toolkits
- Positioning and tracking technologies
- Architectures & algorithms for self-* systems
- Privacy, security, dynamic trust and social issues
- Location- and context-awareness
- Tools, languages and platforms
- Applications and systems
- Resource, network and service (self) management
- Enabling technologies for pervasive environments

Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest,
clarity, relevance, and correctness.

IMPORTANT DATES
Full paper due :               May 15, 2009
Notification of acceptance:    July 10, 2009
Final version due:             July 25, 2009
*****

Submission Instructions
Authors are invited to submit full papers of up to 16 pages in LNICST
conference proceedings format through the ICST's Article Submission SYStem
<http://www.assyst-online.org>.

The proceedings will be a Springer Verlang publication and the papers will be reviewed by several indexing servicing including DBLP, ZBlMath/CompuServe, IO-Port, EI, Scopus, INSPEC, ISI Proceedings, the Zentralblatt Math and Google Scholar.

Selected best papers from Autonomics 2009 will be considered for
publication in a special issue of the International Journal of Autonomous
and Adaptive Communication Systems (IJAACS).
