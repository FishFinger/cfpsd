Call for contributions:  LEARNING MACHINE TRANSLATION

Following the NIPS 2006 workshop "Machine Learning for Multilingual
Information Access" (http://mlia.iltevents.org/), we are preparing an
edited volume on the topic of

"LEARNING MACHINE TRANSLATION"

to be published by MIT Press in their "NIPS Workshop Series".

This volume is open to presenters and participants of the workshop but
also to all researchers interested in the use of Machine Learning
techniques in the context of Machine Translation.

Of particular interest are the following topics:
- Mining parallel corpora from the web
- Exploiting comparable corpora
- Word alignment
- Learning parallel syntax
- Paraphrase
- Evaluation of Machine Translation
- Adaptive Machine Translation
- Learning to combine translation systems
- Factored Machine Translation

Other topics related to the use of Machine Learning techniques in the
context of Machine Translation or related tasks would of course be
welcome.  In order to help us ensure the coherence of this volume,
prospective authors wishing to contribute on other topics should send
us (mlia (at) nrc-cnrc.gc.ca) *as soon as possible* an expression of
interest, outlining their proposed contribution (max. 1 page).


Submission:=20
-----------

Contributors should submit a 15-to-20 page chapter by October 1st to
mlia (at) nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.  Further information and templates will be
available at: mlia.iltevents.org/book.html

Submissions will be reviewed and comments will be sent by November 15,
2007.  We are hoping to have final versions ready by the end of 2007,
in order to have the volume published in 2008.
