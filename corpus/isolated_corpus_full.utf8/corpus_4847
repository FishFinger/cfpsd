Subject Language(s): Japanese (jpn)

Language Family(ies): Japonic 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

This two-day international workshop aims at bringing together specialists from
around the world working on the history & reconstruction of (proto-)Japanese
accent. Its foremost goal is to take stock of recent advances in this area and
to see how we can further refine our current understanding of the history of
Japanese accent and of its very nature. 

Second Call for Papers

New deadline for abstract submission

Indeed, recent proposals to treat it as tone at least at the (Early) Middle
Japanese level will be addressed, as will be different interpretations of the
(Early) Middle Japanese tone dot materials and consequently diverging proposals
for the reconstruction of proto-Japanese accent.

Data from the Ryukyus, especially if new & hitherto unpublished, will be most
welcome as it could possibly help clarify & validate proposed reconstruction
models & pathways of diachronic evolution of Japanese (or rather, Japonic) accent.

The working language of the conference will be English.

A second call for papers is hereby issued. Apart from oral presentations (both
long and short, see hereafter), a poster session, whose goal is mainly to
present the work of graduate students, will also be organized.

Presentations may be short (45 min. incl. discussion) or long (60 min. incl.
discussion). Those willing to contribute a presentation dealing with the history
and/or reconstruction of Japanese (and/or Ryukyuan) accent are invited to submit
an abstract in English (2 pages max. incl. references, Times New Roman 12 pt,
single-spaced, pdf format) at the following address until April 30:
http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/HRJA2009 
Authors will be notified of acceptance in early June.

Please note that papers/posters presenting a historically-minded synchronic
description of hitherto understudied Japanese/Ryukyuan varieties are also most
welcome.
