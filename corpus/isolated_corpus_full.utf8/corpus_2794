CALL FOR PAPERS : CogALex-08 (Coling Workshop held in conjunction with =

COLING-2008)


"Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon: Enhancing the Structure, Indexes and =

Entry Points of Electronic Dictionaries"



CONTEXT :
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

What are people looking for when they use a dictionary? What strategies =

do they use for search? What do people know before they start? These =

questions concern the cognitive aspects of the lexicon, and their =

answers should guide the design of online dictionaries.

Many people believe in the virtues of completeness. Yet, the quality of =

a dictionary depends not only on coverage (number of entries) and =

granularity, but also on accessibility of information. Access strategies =

vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the =

knowledge available at the moment of consultation (word, concept, =

sound). Unlike readers who look for meanings, writers start from them, =

searching for the corresponding words. While paper dictionaries are =

static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, =

their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via =

multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse access =

routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual-lexical space, and =

the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (as trees, as lists, =

as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).

Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using =

language technology to build and to maintain the resource. But access to =

the potential wealth in dictionaries remains limited for the common =

user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of =

comfort, speed and flexibility (multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are =

enormous. We have not even realized their full potential yet. More than =

just allowing electronic versions of paper-bound dictionaries, computers =

provide a freedom for rethinking dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedia, =

etc., a distinction necessary in the past for economical reasons, but no =

longer justified anymore. The goal of this workshop is to perform the =

groundwork for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, =

to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well =

as to explore the feasability of taking the user=92s needs, knowledge and =

access strategies into account.



TOPICS :
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

For this workshop, we solicit papers addressing any of the following issues:

1. CONCEPTUAL INPUT of a dictionary user: what is present in =

speakers=92/writers=92 minds when they are generating a message and looking =

for a (target) word? Does the user have in mind conceptual primitives, =

semantically related words, some type of partial definition, something =

like synsets, or something completely different?

2. ACCESS, NAVIGATION and SEARCH STRATEGIES: we would like to be able to =

access entries by word form but also by meaning and sounds (syllables). =

Even if input is given in an incomplete, imprecise or degraded form. The =

more precise the conceptual input, the less navigation should be needed =

and vice versa. How can we create local search spaces, and provide a =

user with the tools for navigating within them?

3. INDEXING words and ORGANIZING the lexicon: Words and concepts can be =

organized in many ways, varying according to typology and conceptual =

systems. For example, words are traditionally organized alphabetically =

in Western languages, but by semantic radicals and stroke counts in =

Chinese. The way how words and concepts are organized affects indexing =

and access. Indexing must robustly allow for multiple ways of navigation =

and access. What efficient organizational principles allow the greatest =

flexibility for access? What about lexical entry standardization? Are =

universal definitions possible? What about efforts such as the Lexical =

Markup Framework (LMF) and other global structures for the lexicon? Can =

ontologies be combined with standards for the lexicon?

4. NLP Applications: Contributors can also address the issue of how such =

enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can =

boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems =

such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation =

problems encountered in the context of summarization, =

question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation.



Goal and target audience
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The aim of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers =

involved in the building of electronic dictionaries to discuss =

modifications of existing resources in line with the users=92 needs (i.e. =

how to capitalize on the advantages of the digital form). Given the =

breadth of the questions, we welcome reports on work from many =

perspectives, including, but not limited to, linguistics, computer =

science, psycholinguistics, language learning, and ergonomics. We =

request that contributions address computational aspects.

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on the topic =

areas of the workshop. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not =

include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, =

self-references that reveal the author's identity, should be avoided.

Submitted papers should be no longer than eight (8) pages, 4 in the case =

of project reports (including data, tables, figures, and references).
Please include a one-paragraph abstract of the entire work (about 200 =

words) and use the Coling 2008 LaTeX or MS Word style sheets =
