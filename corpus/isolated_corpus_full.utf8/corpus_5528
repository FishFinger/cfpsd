Full Title: North American Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 2010 
Short Title: NASSLLI 

Date: 21-Jun-2010 - 26-Jun-2010
Location: Bloomington, Indiana, USA 
Contact Person: Sandra Kuebler
Meeting Email: nasslli@indiana.edu
Web Site: http://www.indiana.edu/~nasslli 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

The fourth NASSLLI (after previous editions at Stanford University, Indiana University, and UCLA) will return to Bloomington, Indiana, June 21 - 26, 2010. The summer school, loosely modeled on the long-running ESSLLI series in Europe, will consist of a number of courses and workshops, selected on the basis of the proposals. 

Call for Papers and Participation:

Proposals are invited that present interdisciplinary work between the areas of logic, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, philosophy and artificial intelligence, though work in just one area is within the scope of the summer school if it can be applied in other fields. Examples of possible topics (adapting from previous NASSLLI courses) would include e.g. logics for communication, computational semantics, game theory (for logic, language and/or computation), dynamic semantics, modal logics, linear logic, machine learning techniques, statistical language models, and automated theorem proving. We encourage potential course or workshop contributors to check out previous programs at:

http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/nasslli04/program.html
http://www.stanford.edu/group/nasslli/
http://www.indiana.edu/~nasslli/2003/program.html

Courses and workshops should aim to be accessible to an interdisciplinary, graduate level audience. Courses may certainly focus on a single area, but lecturers should then include introductory background, try to avoid specialized notation that cannot be applied more widely, and spend time on the question of how the topic is relevant to other fields.  A workshop can be more accessible if its program is bracketed by broader-audience talks that introduce and summarize the week's presentations.

Associated Workshops/Conferences:

In addition to courses and workshops taking place during the main NASSLLI five day session, Indiana University welcomes proposals for 1-3 day workshops or conferences hosted on campus immediately before or after the summer school, thus on the weekends of June 18-20 and June 27-29 2010. Previous such associated meetings have included a Mathematics of Language conference and Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning About Knowledge (TARK).

Submission Details:

Submissions should be by email, and should indicate:

-Person(s) and affiliation
-Type of event (one week course or workshop, 2 hours a day)
-An outline of the course up to 500 words
-An indication of whether special equipment is needed to teach that course (beamer, computer, etc)
-A statement about the instructor's experience in teaching in interdisciplinary settings
-Expected costs (whether you want to be paid hotel and/or travel, and descriptions of funding in hand or for which you will apply)

Financial Details:

A course may be taught by one or two persons. Conference fees are waived for all instructors. However, we are only able to pay for the full travel and expenses of one instructor per course. If two persons are lecturing, they may share a lump sum paid for both. We must also stress that while proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the Summer School can in general guarantee only toreimburse travel costs for travel from destinations within North America to Bloomington, although exceptions can be made depending on the financial situation. Furthermore, we encourage all lecturers to fund their own travel if this is feasible, since this will allow us to use our available funding for student scholarships. 

Workshops are more complicated financially than courses, and a proposal for a workshop should include a plan to obtain some outside funding for the speakers. 

Notifications of Interest:

To give us an idea about the number of submissions, we would like you to email us, ideally within two weeks, in case you are interested in submitting a proposal. This will not commit you to actually submit one (and not emailing in advance does not preclude you from submitting a full proposal). 

Schedule:

Jun 18, 2009: unofficial notifications of intention to submit;
Sep 15, 2009: deadline for submissions;
Nov 1, 2009: course/workshop proposers notified of p.c. decisions;
Nov 15, 2009: official announcement of program;
May 15, 2009: material for courses available for printing;
Jun 21, 2010: Start of NASSLLI 2010 courses.
