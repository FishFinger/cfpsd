Meeting Description:

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is
organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and Information
(FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around Europe.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and
computation. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as
well as workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of
interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500
students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into an important
meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested
in the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.

ESSLLI 2008 will take place in Hamburg, Germany, 4-15 August, 2008. 

20th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2008
Monday, 4 August - Friday, 15 August 2008
Hamburg, Germany

Call for Course and Workshop Proposals
            
The ESSLLI 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 20th annual Summer
School on a wide range of timely topics that have demonstrated their relevance
in the following fields:

- Logic and Language
- Logic and Computation
- Language and Computation

Proposal Submission: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than
Monday July 2, 2007. 

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision no later than
Monday September 10, 2007. Proposers should follow the guidelines below while
preparing their submissions; proposals that deviate cannot be considered.

Guidelines for Submission: Anyone interested in lecturing or organizing a
workshop during ESSLLI-2006, please read the following information carefully.

All Courses: Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers. They consist of five
sessions (a one-week course), each session lasting 90 minutes. Lecturers who
want to offer a long, two-week course should submit two independent one-week
courses (for example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a
more advanced course during the second). The ESSLLI program committee has the
right to select only one of the two proposed courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submissions:

July 2, 2007: Proposal Submission Deadline
Sep 10, 2007: Notification
June 2, 2008: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material (by ESSLLI
Local Organizers)

Foundational Courses: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any
background knowledge. They are intended for people to get acquainted with the
problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow
researchers from other fields to acquire the key competences of neighboring
disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary
research community. Foundational courses may presuppose some experience with
scientific methods in general, so as to be able to concentrate on the issues
that are germane to the area of the course.

Introductory Courses: Introductory courses are central to the activities of the
Summer School. They are intended to equip students and young researchers with a
good understanding of a field's basic methods and techniques. Introductory
courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge
of the component fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational
linguistics should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of
linguistics and computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate
the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the
area (if available).

Advanced Courses: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for advanced courses should specify
the prerequisites in detail.

Workshops: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced Ph.D.
students and other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops
should have a well defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists
in the theme of the workshop. It is a strict requirement that organizers give a
general introduction to the them during the first session of the workshop. They
are also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop including
inviting the submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc.
In particular, each workshop organizer will be
responsible for producing a Call for Papers for the workshop by November 11,
2007. The call must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of
the LLI community. It should also note that all workshop contributors must
register for the Summer School.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions:

July 2, 2007: Proposal Submission Deadline
Sep 10, 2007: Notification
Nov 11, 2007: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers (by ESSLLI PC chair)
Nov 18, 2007: Workshop organizers send out (First) Call for Papers
Mar 17, 2008: Deadline for Papers (suggested)
Apr 28, 2008: Notification of Workshop Contributors (suggested)
June 2, 2008: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of Workshop
Proceedings (by ESSLLI Local Organizers)

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer
School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate to be
determined by the Local Organizers.

Format for Proposals: The web-based form for submitting course and workshop
proposals is accessible at http://www.folli.org/submission.php. You will be
required to submit the following information:

Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)

Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer; where possible,
please include phone and fax numbers)

Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory course, or an
advanced course?)

Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation, Language & Logic or
Logic & Computation? name only one)

Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed contents and
substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)

External funding (will you be able to find external funding to help fund your
travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above
guidelines should be included here; in particular, indicate here your teaching
experience in an interdisciplinary field as the one addressed by ESSLLI.)

Financial Aspects: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware
that all teaching and organizing at the summer schools is done on a voluntary
basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and
organizers are not paid for their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel
and accommodation (up to a fixed, maximum amount that will be notified to
lecturers when courses are accepted). It should be stressed that while proposals
from all over the world are welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full
reimbursement of travel costs, specially from destinations outside Europe.

Please note the following: In case a course is to be taught by two lecturers, a
lump sum is reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses for one
lecturer. The splitting of the sum is up to the lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers and
workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover travel and accommodation
expenses, and such issues might be taken into account when selecting courses.

Meeting Description
Affix ordering in typologically different languages: approaches, problems and
perspectives.
Workshop during the 13th International Morphology Meeting, February 3rd-6th
(Sunday-Wednesday), 2008, Vienna, Austria 

First Call for Papers 

Questions concerning affix ordering and restrictions on affix combinations
belong to the central ones in morphological theory. Proposals put forward thus
far can be classified as:
1) typological (e.g. inflection follows derivation, cf. Greenberg 1963; with
respect to the verb stem, the order of verb inflection morphemes is consistent
across languages, cf. Bybee 1985);
2) phonological (reflecting the idea that morphology and phonology work in
conjunction, i.e. the so-called strata approach, cf. Siegel 1974, Kiparsky 1982,
Mohanan 1986, Giegerich 1999, among others);
3) syntactic (morphological operations in terms of affix ordering 'mirror'
syntactic operations, cf. Baker 1985, and Grimshaw's 1986 criticism of Baker's
proposal);
4) semantic (based on the notion of semantic scope, cf. Rice 2000; see also the
'relevance principle' in Bybee 1985);
5) psycholinguistic (based on the notion of parsability, i.e. what is more
easily parsable follows what is less so, cf. Hay 2003); and 
6) morphological (selectional restrictions encoded in the affix or/and in the
base, including closing suffixes (i.e. suffixes that do not allow addition of
further suffixes) are responsible for affix ordering, cf. Fabb 1988; Plag 1996;
Szymanek 2000; Aronoff and Fuhrhop 2002). 

As is often the case in linguistic theory, all the above approaches work
properly to some extent, but no approach is perfect, which has made linguists
integrate insights from different approaches (e.g. Hay & Plag 2004 who combine
psycholinguistic and morphological arguments). However, an important problem
remains. Some of the proposals have never been tested against data from (a)
language(s) typologically different from that/those for which they have been
originally formulated. For example, the recently suggested (probabilistic)
criterion of parsability has been applied only to English derivational
morphology. Thus although parsability has been claimed to be a universal
restriction on affix ordering working particularly well in combination with
selectional restrictions (Hay & Plag 2004), it remains unclear how this
criterion and proposals in which it participates account for the fact that in
languages with rich inflectional morphology, for example the Slavic ones,
inflectional suffixes are, by rule, vowel initial, often cause stress changes
and palatalizations (i.e. are difficult to parse) but follow derivational suffixes. 
Thus this workshop aims to bring together morphologists working on affix
ordering in languages representing different morphological types. Papers
applying morphological, psycholinguistic and semantic approaches to languages
with rich inflectional morphology, or comparing such languages with English, are
particularly welcome, although the workshop is open to problem-solving papers
based on any language and any approach.
