Reminder: Call for Short Papers for NAACL HLT 2009

http://www.naaclhlt2009.org

May 31 =96 June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado

Deadline for short paper submission =96 Monday, February 9, 2009
Special sessions: Large Scale Language Processing, and Speech Indexing =

and Retrieval

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American =

Association for
Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human Language Technology =

Conference
(HLT) of NAACL. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines =

working
towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using =

natural language, and
towards enhancing human-human communication through services such as speech
recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text =

summarization, and
information extraction. NAACL HLT 2009 will feature full papers, short =

papers, posters,
demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as well as pre- and =

post-conference tutorials
and workshops.

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial, =

original, and unpublished
research in disciplines that could impact human language processing =

systems. We
encourage the submission of short papers that can be characterized as a =

small, focused
contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or =

an interesting
application note. A separate review form for short papers will be =

introduced this year.

NAACL HLT 2009 aims to hold two special sessions, Large Scale Language =

Processing
and Speech Indexing and Retrieval.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are =

understood to be
applied to speech and/or text:

- Large scale language processing
- Speech indexing and retrieval
- Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
- Information extraction
- Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human-robot =

interaction,
education and learning systems, assistive technologies, digital =

entertainment)
- Machine translation
- Summarization
- Question answering
- Topic classification and information filtering
- Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/genre analysis)
- Topic clustering
- Text and speech mining
- Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
- Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
- Language generation
- Speech synthesis
- Speech understanding
- Speech analysis and recognition
- Multilingual processing
- Phonology
- Morphology (including word segmentation)
- Part of speech tagging
- Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
- Word sense disambiguation
- Lexical semantics
- Formal semantics and logic
- Textual entailment and paraphrasing
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Dialog systems
- Knowledge acquisition and representation
- Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
- Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, =

annotated corpora)
- Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information structure and =

sources in speech)
- Multimodal representations and processing, including speech and gesture
