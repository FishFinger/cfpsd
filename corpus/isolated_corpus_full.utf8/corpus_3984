CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

ARCOE-09 at IJCAI-09

July 11-13, 2009
Pasadena, CA, USA
=======================


The IJCAI-09 Workshop on

Automated Reasoning about Context and Ontology Evolution (ARCOE-09)
http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/ARCOE2009

July 11-13, 2009
Pasadena, California, USA

held at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(IJCAI-09)
http://ijcai-09.org


-- Description of the workshop --

Methods of automated reasoning have solved a large number of problems
in Computer Science by using formal ontologies expressed in
logic. Over the years, though, each problem or class of problems has
required a different ontology, and sometimes a different version of
logic. Moreover, the processes of conceiving, controlling and
maintaining an ontology and its versions have turned out to be
inherently complex. All this has motivated much investigation in a
wide range of disparate disciplines "from logic-based Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning to Software Engineering, from Databases
to Multimedia "about how to relate ontologies to one another.

ARCOE-09 aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from
core areas of Artificial Intelligence (Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning, Contexts, and Ontologies) to discuss these kinds of
problems and relevant results. Historically, there have been at least
three different, yet interdependent motivations behind this type of
research: defining the relationship between an ontology and its
context, providing support to ontology engineers, enhancing problem
solving and communication for software agents.

Ontology and Context.  Most application areas have recognized the need
for representing and reasoning about knowledge that is distributed
over many resources. Such knowledge depends on its context, i.e., on
the syntactic and/or semantic structure of such resources. Research on
information integration, distributed knowledge management, the
semantic web, multi-agent and distributed reasoning have pinned down
different aspects of how ontologies relate to and/or develop within
their context.

Ontology Engineering.  Ontology engineers do not succeed right from
the beginning when (individually or collaboratively) developing an
ontology.  Despite their expertise and any assistance from domain
experts, revision cycles are the rule. Research on the automation of
the process of engineering an ontology has improved efficiency and
reduced the introduction of unintended meanings by means of
interactive ontology editors. Moreover, ontology matching has studied
the process of manual, off-line alignment of two or more known
ontologies.

Problem Solving and Communication for Agents.  Agents that communicate
with one another without having full access to their respective
ontologies or that are programmed to face new non-classifiable
situations must change their own ontology dynamically at run-time
"they cannot rely on human intervention. Research on this problem has
either concentrated on non-monotonic reasoning and belief revision or
on changes of signature, i.e., of the grammar of the ontology's
language, with a minimal disruption to the original theory.

ARCOE-09 will provide a multi-disciplinary forum, where differences in
methodologies, representation languages and techniques are over-arched
and hopefully overcome. Accordingly, the workshop will be structured
into four tracks: three of them will focus on specific areas, the
fourth one will foster links and integration.

Track 1:  Context and Ontology
This track will select and present works about Context and Ontology, a
well-established research area that has mainly concentrated on the
relationship between contexts and ontologies for distributed
information and for the enhancement of software agents.

Track 2:  Common Sense and Non-Monotonic Reasoning for Ontologies
This track will select and present works about logic-based Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning, a classic area of AI, which since its
origins has produced remarkable results on logic-based methods for
supporting knowledge engineers and for enhancing software agents.

Track 3:  Automated Ontology Evolution
This track will select and present works about Automated Ontology
Evolution, an area which in recent years has been drawing the
attention of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning on the automation of ontology evolution.

Track 4: Links and integration
This track will foster links and integration by means of invited talks
and (panel) discussions. Topics that are likely to be covered are: the
formalization of software engineering concepts for ontology
development; the relationship between automated reasoning and
information retrieval; relationships between representation languages;
relationships between canonical domains; relationships between
contexts and ontology evolution and between Non-Monotonic Reasoning
and ontology evolution.

ARCOE-09 will bring the participants to position the various
approaches with respect to one another. Hopefully, though the workshop
will also start a process of cross-pollination and set out the
constitution of a truly interdisciplinary research-community dedicated
to automated reasoning about contexts and ontology evolution.

-- Attendance --

Following IJCAI-09 policy, the total number of participants in
ARCOE-09 will be limited to 75 people. This includes organizers, PC
members, invited speakers, authors and attendees. Authors will be
selected on significance of their submission and will be preferred on
simple attendees. Attendees will be selected on a
first-come-first-served basis. Please check http://ijcai-09.org for
application procedure and fees.


-- Submission Requirements and Dates --

ARCOE-09 will accept submissions of long abstracts, for both long
presentations and poster presentations. The distinction during the
selection-phase will be based on the significance and the quality of
submissions as well as oriented towards fostering cross-pollination
and discussions during the event. All selected abstracts will be
included in the IJCAI-09 Working Notes. Authors are kindly requested
to provide keywords upon submission. The format for submissions is the
same as that of IJCAI-09.  Please check http://ijcai-09.org for the
style files. Submissions should be no longer than 3 pages.
