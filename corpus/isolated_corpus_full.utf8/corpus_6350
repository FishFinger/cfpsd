Meeting Description:

The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in Languages
for Specific Purposes(LSP) and Professional Communication in the Asia-Pacific
Rim and beyond to take part in a dialogue on research and collaboration in
academic, professional and workplace contexts. To build a clearer understanding
of communication in the workplace it is crucial to have effective collaboration
between language experts and trainers and institutions specializing in
communication skills. Such collaboration in turn is fundamental to the design
and implementation of effective pedagogy, assessment and curricula. 

Call for Papers

We invite papers on any of the following areas:
- Relationships between LSP theory and workplace practices
- Interconnections between discourse and socio-institutional practices
- Collaboration between language teachers/trainers and institutions/organizations
- Functional variation of language in academic and professional contexts
- Discursive practices of specialists
- Disciplinary, intercultural and cross-cultural variation in professional discourse
- Descriptions of language use in professional contexts
- Workplace communication and curriculum design

Papers focusing on the study of languages other than English are most welcome.
