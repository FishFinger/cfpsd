Meeting Description:

The 4th conference of the International Society for Gesture Studies (ISGS) will
have the following thematic foci: linguistic, semiotic, and pragmatic approaches
to human gestural communication with a special focus on cognitive linguistic
perspectives, possible evolutionary precursors, and neural correlates of
gestures. A major goal is to provide a platform to discuss both specific
research questions within these areas and interdisciplinary approaches
connecting these distinct areas of gesture research.
