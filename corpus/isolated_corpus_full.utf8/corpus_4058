Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop will bring together researchers from both worlds: those using
collaboratively created resources in NLP applications such as information
retrieval, named entity recognition, or keyword extraction, and those using NLP
applications for improving the resources or extracting different types of
semantic information from them. Hopefully, this will turn into a feedback loop,
where NLP techniques improved by
collaboratively constructed resources are used to improve the resources in
exchange.

ACL/IJCNLP-2009 Workshop "The People's Web meets NLP: Collaboratively
Constructed Semantic Resources"

Co-located with Joint conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the Association
for Computational Linguistics and the 4th International Joint Conference on
Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing

6-7 August 2009

Introduction
In recent years, online resources collaboratively constructed by ordinary users
on the Web have considerably influenced the NLP community. In many works, they
have been used as a substitute for conventional semantic resources and as
semantically structured corpora with great success. While conventional resources
such as WordNet are developed by trained linguists [1], online semantic
resources can now be automatically extracted from the content collaboratively
created by the users [2]. Thereby, the knowledge acquisition bottlenecks and
coverage problems pertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources can be
overcome.

The resource that has gained the greatest popularity in this respect so far is
Wikipedia. However, other resources recently discovered in NLP, such as
folksonomies, the multilingual collaboratively constructed dictionary
Wiktionary, or Q&A sites like WikiAnswers or Yahoo! Answers are also very
promising. Moreover, new wiki-based platforms such as Citizendium or Knol have
recently emerged that offer features distinct from Wikipedia and are of high
potential in terms of their use in NLP.

The benefits of using Web-based resources come along with new challenges, such
as the interoperability with existing resources and the quality of the knowledge
represented. As collaboratively created resources lack editorial control, they
are typically incomplete. For the interoperability with conventional resources,
the mappings have to be investigated. The quality of collaboratively constructed
resources is questioned in many cases, and the information extraction remains a
complicated task due to the incompleteness and semi- structuredness of the
content. Therefore, the research community has begun to develop and provide
tools for accessing collaboratively constructed resources [2,5].

The above listed challenges actually present a chance for NLP techniques to
improve the quality of Web-based semantic resources. Researchers have therefore
proposed techniques for link prediction [3] or information extraction [4] that
can be used to guide the "crowds" to construct resources that are better suited
for being used in NLP in return.

Topics
The workshop will bring together researchers from both worlds: those using
collaboratively created resources in NLP applications such as information
retrieval, named entity recognition, or keyword extraction, and those using NLP
applications for improving the resources or extracting different types of
semantic information from them. Hopefully, this will turn into a feedback loop,
where NLP techniques improved by collaboratively constructed resources are used
to improve the resources in exchange.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
- Different types of collaboratively constructed resources, such as wiki-based
platforms, Q&A sites or folksonomies;
- Using collaboratively constructed resources in NLP such as information
retrieval, text categorization, information extraction, etc.;
- Analyzing the properties of collaboratively constructed resources related to
their use in NLP;
- Interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with conventional
semantic resources and between themselves;
- Converting unstructured information into structured lexical semantic
information; tools for mining social and collaborative content;
- Quality issues with respect to collaboratively constructed resources.

We also encourage the submission of short papers describing publicly available
tools for accessing or analyzing collaboratively created resources. During the
breaks, tables can be provided for demonstrations.

Invited Speaker
Rada Mihalcea, University of North Texas

Submission Information
Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009
proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one extra page for
references.  Short paper submissions should also follow the two-column format of
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages, including
references.

Submission will be electronic using a submission software that will be available
later at the conference website. All accepted papers will be presented orally
and published in the workshop proceedings.

Important Dates
Paper submission deadline (full and short): May 1, 2009
Notification of acceptance of papers:June 1, 2009
Camera-ready copy of papers due: June 7, 2009
