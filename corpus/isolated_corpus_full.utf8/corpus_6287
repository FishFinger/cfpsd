Call for Papers

The workshop proposal (including a preliminary list of participants and the
topics of their papers) should be submitted to the SLE organizers before
November 15, 2009. Therefore we ask potential participants to send us the
provisional titles of their presentations (with a draft abstract) no later =
than
November 7.=20

Abstracts should be submitted by the end of December.=20

Workshop Description:
The recent decades are marked with a considerable progress in the study of
grammatical relations (subject, object) and their relationships with
transitivity (see, among others, Hopper & Thompson 1980; Kittil=E4 2002; N=
=E6ss
2007). Impressive results are achieved both in the study of the notion of
prototypical transitive and intransitive clauses, with canonical subject an=
d
object marking (see, in particular, Aikhenvald et al. 2001; Bhaskararao &
Subbarao 2004), and in the research of intermediary, 'quasi-transitive'
('quasi-intransitive') types, often correlating with non-canonical encoding=
 of
the core relations (non-nominative subjects etc.). Meticulous research of
subject properties has discovered an amazing variety of criteria of subject=
hood
that can be used as a powerful tool for detecting (non-canonical) subjects =
and,
virtually, to arrive at a more adequate definition of subject.
=20
Indo-European languages are particularly notorious for their diversity of
non-canonical subject marking, ranking from nominative (standard), to dativ=
e,
genitive, accusative etc., as in Icelandic (1) (see, among others, Bar?dal
2001), Lithuanian (2a), Polish (Holvoet 1991), or Bengali (Onishi 2001):=20

(1) Icelandic
M=E9r     likar                      =FEessi    tilg=E1ta
I:DAT   like:PRES:3SG     this      hypothesis
'I like this hypothesis.'

(2) Lithuanian=20
a. Man    uo lietaus              su?alo                       rankos
    I:DAT  because of rain     freeze:PAST:3SG     hand:NOM.PL
'My hands became frozen because of rain.'=20

While the synchronic study of subject and transitivity in Indo-European
languages (and beyond) has furnished detailed descriptions of syntactic
patterns, inventories of features and types and valuable cross-linguistic
observations, little attention was paid to the diachronic aspects of the
phenomena in question. We cannot yet explain why and how the non-canonical
subject marking emerges and disappears, how does it correlate with changes =
in
the system of transitivity types. Correlations between different transitivi=
ty
types and the status of the syntactic arguments (in particular, their
subject/object properties) can be illustrated with the Lithuanian example i=
n
(2b). In contrast with (2a), it instantiates a higher degree of control of =
the
subject over the situation, and the canonical subject marking is in correla=
tion
with the whole construction becoming more transitive as compared to (2a)
(Ser?ant, forthc.):=20

(2) Lithuanian=20
b. (Kol ?jau ? universitet?,)                    su?alau  rankas,=20
    (While I was going to university)       freeze:PAST:1SG  hand:ACC.PL
    (nes vis? keli? spaud?iau snieg? rankose.)=20
    (because all the way I pressed snow in the hands)
'While I was going to the university, I froze up my hands, because all the =
way I
pressed snow in the hands.'

Thus, of particular interest are such constructions where we observe increa=
se of
transitivity correlating with the increase of subject (and object) properti=
es of
the core argument(s). This is the case with the North Russian 'possessive
perfect' constructions, as in (3), which originates in possessive construct=
ion
of the mihi-est type with the passive participle (cf. Kuteva & Heine 2004),=
 and
attests acquiring subject properties by the oblique 'possessor' noun (Timbe=
rlake
1976):=20

(3) U nego        korov-a   /    korov-u        podojen-o
     at he:GEN   cow-NOM /   cow-ACC     milk:PART.PERF.PASS-SG.N
'He has milked the cow.'

Another issue relevant for a diachronic typological study of subject and
transitivity is the evolution of alignment systems. The developments in the
system of subject-marking and expansion of non-canonical subjects, typicall=
y
accompanied by rearrangements of transitivity types, may open the way to
dramatic changes in the type of alignment - for instance, from
nominative-accusative to ergative-absolutive (as in Indo-Iranian), or from
ergative-absolutive to nominative-accusative (as it was, presumably, the ca=
se in
Proto-Indo-European, according to some hypotheses; cf. Bauer 2001 and Bavan=
t
2008, among others). The relationships between these syntactic phenomenon a=
re
not yet sufficiently studied. In particular, our knowledge of the subject a=
nd
transitivity features of the Indo-European proto-language is still quite li=
mited
(see Bar=F0dal & Eyth=F3rsson 2009).=20

Indo-European languages, with their well-documented history and long tradit=
ion
of historical and comparative research, offer a particularly rich opportuni=
ty
for a diachronic typological study of the above-listed issues (see Bar?dal =
2001
on Icelandic). One of the first research projects concentrating on the
diachronic aspects of these phenomena started in 2008 in Bergen, under the
general guidance of J. Bar?dal (see http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP).=20

The idea of our workshop is to bring together scholars interested in compar=
ative
research on subject and transitivity in Indo-European and to open up new
horizons in the study of these phenomena, paying special attention to its
diachronic aspects. While the workshop concentrates mainly on evidence from
Indo-European, papers on non-Indo-European languages which could be relevan=
t for
a diachronic typological study of the issues in question will also be welco=
me.

The issues to be addressed include, among others:=20
- theoretical and descriptive aspects of a study of subject and transitivit=
y:=20
1. criteria for subjecthood and subject properties in Indo-European=20
2. features of transitivity and transitivity types in Indo-European; how to
define transitivity in constructions with non-canonical subjects and/or obj=
ects?
- mechanisms of the rise or disappearance of non-canonical subject-marking
- evolution of transitivity and changes in the inventory of transitivit typ=
es in
the history of Indo-European
- relationships between subject marking and transitivity types: evolution o=
f
subject-marking with different semantic classes of verbs=20
- the main evolutionary types (from the point of view of subject marking an=
d
transitivity types) attested for Indo-European
- subject and changes in the type of alignment: the emergence of ergativity=
 out
of constructions with non-canonical subject
- voice, valency-changing categories and subject marking: their relationshi=
ps in
a diachronic perspective
