Meeting Description

This year's IWSLT workshop continues the tradition of organizing an open
evaluation campaign for spoken language translation followed by a scientific
workshop, in which both system descriptions and scientific papers are presented. 

First Call for Participation

International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation

IWSLT 2007 - 15-16 October, Trento, Italy

http://iwslt07.itc.it

IWSLT's evaluations are not competition oriented but, on the contrary, their
goal is to foster cooperative work and scientific exchange. In this respect,
IWSLT proposes challenging research tasks and an open experimental
infrastructure for the scientific community working on spoken language translation.

Evaluation  

The IWSLT 2007 Evaluation Campaign will feature two challenges, namely, the
translation of spontaneous conversations in the travel domain from Italian and
Chinese-to English, as well as two classical tasks, that is, the translation of
read speech in the travel domain, from Arabic and Japanese into English. For all
tasks, participants will be provided with training and development data sets,
useful linguistic resources, and links to open software tools for developing
state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems. In contrast with other
MT evaluation campaigns, input for translation is not written text but
transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition systems. Translation
systems able to process multiple input hypotheses will be able to use n-best
lists and word-graphs produced by ASR systems.

Workshop 

The IWSLT 2007 Workshop will take place in the historical centre of
Trento, on 15-16 October. The two-day gathering will include
presentations of systems and research papers, as well as invited talks
and  discussion panels. Submissions of technical papers are highly
encouraged. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-	Text and speech translation systems
-	Word alignment methods
-	MT evaluation
-	Integration of ASR and MT
-	Enriched speech translation output
-	Syntax-based MT
-	Re-ordering models
-	Open source software for MT
-	Search algorithms for MT
-	Language resources for MT
-	Task adaptation and portability in MT


Important Dates

Evaluation Campaign:
-	Training/Dev Data Release: 30 April 2007
-	Test Data Release: 09 July 2007
-	Translations Due: 13 July 2007 
Workshop:

Call Deadline: 26-Mar-2005 

Meeting Description:

ACL/SIGPARSE will  host the 10th International Conference  on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'07)

Topics of interest for IWPT'07 include, but are not limited  to: theoretical and
practical studies of parsing and transduction algorithms for natural language
sentences, texts, fragments, dialogues, ill-formed sentences, speech input,
multi-dimensional (pictorial) or signed languages, multimedia (web) documents,
and parsing issues arising or viewed in a multimodal and multilingual
context. Both knowledge-based and statistical approaches are welcome. 

Call for Papers

IWPT 2007

10th International Conference on Parsing Technologies
   
Sponsored by ACL/SIGPARSE

23rd-24th June, 2007

Prague, Czech Republic

http://www.latl.unige.ch/iwpt2007/index.html
                                

ACL/SIGPARSE will host the 10th International Conference on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'07) on June 23rd and 24th, 2006 in conjunction with
the 2007 Annual  Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (ACL'07; see http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007).

IWPT'07 continues the tradition of biennial workshops on parsing
technology organized by SIGPARSE, the Special Interest Group on
Parsing of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The
first workshop, in Pittsburgh and Hidden Valley, was followed by workshops in
Cancun (Mexico) in 1991; Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy
(Belgium) in 1993; Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech  Republic) in 1995;
Boston/Cambridge (Massachusetts) in 1997; Trento (Italy) in 2000;
Beijing (China) in 2001; Nancy (France) in 2003; and Vancouver
(Canada) (2005).

Topics of interest for IWPT'07:

Topics of interest for IWPT'07 include, but are not limited to:
theoretical and practical studies of parsing and transduction algorithms for
natural language sentences, texts, fragments, dialogues, ill-formed sentences,
speech input, multi-dimensional (pictorial) or signed languages, multimedia
(web) documents, and parsing issues arising or viewed in a multimodal and
multilingual context. Both knowledge-based and statistical approaches are welcome.


Time schedule:

              Deadline for paper submission: 26th March, 2007
              Notification of acceptance: 26th April, 2007
              Final papers due: 7th May, 2007
              Workshop: 23rd-24th June, 2007


Requirements:

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results.

A paper accepted for presentation at IWPT 2007 cannot be presented or
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must
papers that contain significant overlap with previously published work.

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. The paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the
author's identity should be avoided. For example, instead of ''We previously 
showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', write ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.


Submitting Papers:

Two types of submissions are invited:
- full papers, to be presented as such during the workshop and to be
  published in the workshop proceedings (maximally 12 pages);
- short papers, to be presented at the workshop in the form of a poster
  plus a summary oral presentation in a short-paper session; two-page
  summaries will be published in the workshop proceedings.


Instruction for authors:

Prospective authors are invited to send their submissions electronically through
the web page of the conference. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
PDF. Full papers should not exceed 12 pages; short papers should not exceed 8 pages.


Detailed formatting and submission instructions for authors is
available through the IWPT'07 home page at:

       http://www.latl.unige.ch/iwpt2007/index.html


For all inquiries send mail to iwpt2007@lettres.unige.ch
