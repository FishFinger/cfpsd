Literary Education and Digital Learning:
Methods and Technologies for Humanities Studies
A book edited by Willie van Peer, University of Munich, Germany
Sonia Zyngier, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Vander Viana, Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil


Introduction
We live at a time of enormous realignments in the use of media. Each day
more information can be retrieved from the Internet. The world is not one
of knowing how to access and manage information rather than storing and
processing it. In the area of literature, ever more information on literary
production is being disseminated and retrieved in electronic form. This has
considerable consequences for the form and use of such information. It also
has consequences for learning and research environments at educational
institutions. Today's popularization of modern technologies has allowed
scholars in the Humanities, including literature specialists, to access an
array of novel opportunities in the digital medium, which have brought
about an equal number of challenges and questions. In spite of the vast
amount of information now at hand, very little has been provided for the
advance of literary education.

Objective of the book
This volume aims at providing a deep probe into the most relevant issues in
literary education and digital learning. The chapters will be organized
into two categories: research and education. The first group will collect
studies investigating the impact of technologies in literary research. Its
main aim is to understand how computers and other new technologies may help
scholars investigate literary works in novel ways, thus bringing new
perspectives to the area. The second group will look into the potential of
applying distance learning methods/concepts/environments to the field of
literature. In other words, it will collect contributions on how these
resources may be used by scholars and students either inside or outside
regular classrooms, provided that these classroom applications are not
accounts of experience but based on research.  In sum, the volume will
offer a survey of how digital literary education has developed, where it
stands now, how research in this area has progressed, and what the
prospects are for the future.

Target audience
This volume will be of interest to those interested in digital
learning/teaching and/or literature, especially in the university context.
 This book will also interest literature professionals who would like to
see how digital learning works in practice. In addition, the book will be
highly valuable to those researchers in the field interested in keeping
abreast with current developments in the confluence of their fields of
expertise and technological settings.

Recommended topics
The topics to be covered in Parts I (Research) and II (Education) should
encompass literature and one of the following aspects (the list below is
not comprehensive, other topics may be welcomed, and especially those in
which authors are considered specialists):
*Applications in Distance Learning
*Authoring Tools
*Collaborative Learning
*Corpus-based Research
*Empirical Research on Digital Learning/Teaching
*Future Challenges
*Learning Technologies
*Methods in Distance Education Teaching
*Online Education Tools and Technologies
*Online Learning
*Shortcomings of Distance Learning Applications and Technologies
*Web-Based Course Authoring Tools

Submission procedure
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before May 30,
2008, a 2-4 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the mission and
concerns of his or her proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals will
be notified by July 31, 2008 about the status of their proposals and sent
chapter guidelines. Full chapters are expected to be submitted by October
31, 2008. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind review
basis. This book is scheduled to be published by IGI Global (formerly Idea
Group Inc.), publisher of the "Information Science Reference" (formerly
Idea Group Reference) and "Medical Information Science Reference" imprints.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
