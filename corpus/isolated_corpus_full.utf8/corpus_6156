I. General Session

Abstracts from all areas of formal linguistics and from any theoretical
perspective are invited for 20-minute talks in the general session.

II. Special Session: Prosody in Grammar, Acquisition, and Processing

We welcome submissions on these topics, particularly (though not limited to) the
following areas, including approaches from a cross-linguistic perspective:
- The relation between syntactic and prosodic phrasing
- The relation between phrasing and phrasal prominence
- The interaction between prosody, information structure, and word order
- The interaction between syntactically informed prosody at the phrasal level
and lexically informed rhythm at the metrical level
- The role of prosody in determining binding relations, quantifier interaction,
the focus domain of the sentence, as well as the implications of prosody-meaning
relations for the architecture of the grammar
- The role of 'silent prosody' in online parsing
- The processing of informational and contrastive focus

III. Instructions for abstract submission

Abstracts must be at most one page long on a letter-size sheet (81/2 inches by
11 inches) with one-inch margins, or A4-size sheet (210 mm by 297 mm) with 2.5
cm margins, and typed in at least 11-point font. An optional second page is
permitted for data and references. Abstracts longer than 1 page with 1
additional page for data/references will not be considered. At the top of each
page, please include (1) the abstract title and (2) three or four keywords
describing the topics of the paper. Abstracts are anonymous, so all authors'
names must be absent from all pages.

Submitters should also indicate at the top of the page whether the submitted
abstract is intended for the Special Session on Prosody in Grammar, Acquisition,
and Processing, or for the General Session.

Submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author, or 2
joint abstracts per author.

Abstracts must be submitted in one of the following formats:
- PDF format
- Hardcopy (only if absolutely necessary)

We strongly encourage electronic submissions, which can be submitted on our
website at: http://www.linguistlist.org/confcustom/wccfl2010

Please name the .PDF file using a short title that resembles the full title as
closely as possible. No other identifying information (such as authors' names)
should be included in the file name.

Hardcopy submissions should include the information below on a separate sheet,
along with ten copies of the abstract.
- Author information
- Name(s) of author(s)
- Title of talk
- Presentation type (Oral Presentation, Poster, or Either)
