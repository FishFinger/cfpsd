Workshop Topics
Sentiment analysis systems seek to extract emotions and feelings
expressed about people, organisations, nation states, goods and
services, in free natural language texts. This interdisciplinary
workshop will address three related topics:

(a) how metaphor and sentiment interact in everyday communication;
(b) language/conceptual resources properties to support sentiment analysis
(c) evaluation of sentiment analysis programs and evaluation methodologies.
Prof Sam Glucksberg will give the keynote lecture of the workshop entitled

	 Beyond Similarity: How Metaphors Create Categories.

Workshop Aims

This workshop will deal with the recent advances in the processing of
sentiment in arbitrary collections of text. Sentiment can be expressed
about works of art and literature, about the state of financial
markets, about liking and disliking individuals, organisations,
ideologies, and consumer goods. It is necessary to examine what
aspects of emotional experience sentiment analysis aims to capture,
how and in what way this may be evaluated. This workshop focuses on
three strands of research which will serve to enhance the development
of automated sentiment analysis systems of free text for real world
applications.

Firstly, in psychology and computational linguistics, the notions of
emotion and metaphor interact in a number of complex ways. It has been
argued that conceptual metaphors underlie human understanding and
processing of emotion. In addition, it can be argued that the
expression of sentiment and its interpretation can rely critically on
how a speaker or writer uses metaphor. Therefore, an understanding of
how emotion is expressed and perceived in language is not complete
without addressing the role of figurative language and metaphor as
basic scaffolding or tool for modulating affective text content.

Secondly, to date, sentiment analysis typically deals with a specific
domain of ideal objects. In order to build a sentiment analysis
system, one has to understand `what there is' in a given domain,
i.e. the ontology of the domain. In this context, is it possible to
conceive of generic sentiment analysis? Practitioners in this area
need to examine the requirements and challenges of an approach that
could cross boundaries of domain or time or even language where
different communities of use, languages or cultures may express or
even experience sentiments in different ways.

Finally, work in sentiment analysis may be regarded as work in
intelligent information retrieval and success is evaluated in terms of
accuracy in identifying the affective content of information
segments. Yet sentiment analysis has the potential to have a powerful
impact in other domains that require input about emotional
context. Researchers in Human-Computer Interaction, Affective
Computing, Lexicography and Terminography, may become end-users of
work in sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis folks may have much
to learn from how a machine artificially endowed with
emotions/sentiments behaves. It may become feasible to evaluate
sentiment analysis systems in terms of the performance of such
applications.  An examination of alternative end-user systems and
evaluation mechanisms can only serve to enrich the field of sentiment
analysis and present new challenges for researchers to address.
