Meeting Description:

Research in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics began over
50 years ago. Research in the 3 disciplines of controlled languages, machine
translation and data and sense mining has however been done separately for the
most part, and it would be useful to combine these three disciplines. The
primary objective of this conference is to bring together researchers and
practitioners in controlled languages, machine translation and sense mining. 

Call for Papers

Research in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics began over
50 years ago. Research in the 3 disciplines of controlled languages, machine
translation and data and sense mining has however been done separately for the
most part, and it would be useful to combine these three disciplines. The
primary objective of this conference is to bring together researchers and
practitioners in controlled languages, machine translation and sense mining.
Some controlled languages already take into account machine translation but they
have not yet been linked to research done in the field of sense mining. In the
field of controlled languages the objective is to eliminate as much ambiguity as
possible. In contrast, in the field of sense mining, the objective is to
identify the important elements amongst large amounts of texts (sometimes even
badly structured texts), in order to extract their meaning. Machine translation
quality is governed and aided by minimising the representation of utterances. In
consequence, the combination of these approaches could be of considerable use in
creating new machine translation theories. The combination of controlled
languages and machine translation is certainly not new, but there is still much
work to be done. Other combinations are deemed to be of interest too and it
certainly seems to be the case that the separate disciplines can profit from
their mutual interrelation.

In particular, multi-disciplinary contributions are welcomed, especially
concerning these disciplines and related disciplines, whether linguistic or
operational. Particular attention will be given to results where the
applications demand high quality and maximum utility and where orthogonal
constraints intervene. For example in domains such as aeronautics, natural
catastrophes and pandemics, both temporal as well as functional quality
constraints co-exist where these various disciplines and their overlaps are
involved in aids to crisis management (CL & MT: rapid reliable writing of alerts
and their dependable translation with no time for pre- or post-edition; SM:
dependability in decision support scenarios).

Papers are invited in the following areas:
- Controlled Languages
- Machine Translation
- Data and Sense Mining
- Speech Recognition
- Speech Synthesis
- Natural Language Generation
- Anaphora Resolution
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Text and Speech Interfaces
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Corpus Analysis
- Need for normalisation,
- Medical needs and applications,
- Aeronautic needs and applications
- Civil security needs and applications 
- General security needs and applications

Papers for presentation must be submitted before March 31, 2009.
Guidelines for submission will be published at: http://www.ismtcl.org/
