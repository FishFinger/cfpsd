Summer School in Maltese Linguistics

Meeting Description: 

The Institute of Linguistics in collaboration with the Department of Maltese of 
the University of Malta has the pleasure to announce a call for participation 
in the first Summer School in Maltese Linguistics to be held in Malta between 
15-26 June 2009. The Summer School is being organised through the Foundation 
for International Studies and will be held at the Old University in Valletta. 
It is intended to provide participants with a unique opportunity to become 
acquainted with different aspects of the linguistic structure of Maltese and 
is aimed primarily at linguists and students of linguistics but should also 
appeal to practitioners working with Maltese, such as translators and language 
teachers, particularly to teachers of Maltese to adults/foreigners. A parallel 
course in Maltese involving input from lecturers of the University of Malta's 
Skola tal-Malti will also be offered if enough interest is expressed. 

The programme will be divided into three main strands:

1. The sound system of Maltese
This strand will deal with aspects of both the segmental and suprasegmental 
structure of Maltese. An overview of the historical development of Maltese
phonology will also be provided.
2. The Maltese lexicon, grammar and meaning
The second strand will deal with various elements of the structure of Maltese, 
its morphology, inflection and compounding as well as derivation, in both the 
verbal and the nominal systems. It will look, amongst other things, at word 
order, topicalisation, verbless structures and tense and aspect in Maltese, as 
well as at some aspects related to the semantics of Maltese.
3. Maltese in context
The third strand will examine a miscellany of topics intended to demonstrate 
the linguistically rich context within which Maltese continues to thrive. An 
account of the development of Maltese in relation to other languages together 
with an overview of the linguistic situation in Malta will be provided. More 
specific sketches of work in areas such as language planning, Maltese in the 
media and Maltese Sign Language will also be given. A brief examination of 
effects on Maltese of its recently acquired status as an official language of 
the EU will also be made.

An optional course in Maltese for adults/foreigners involving input from lecturers 
of the University of Malta's Skola tal-Malti will be offered at an additional
cost if enough interest is expressed.
