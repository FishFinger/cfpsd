NAACL HLT 2009 Workshop on
Semi-supervised Learning for Natural Language Processing

June 4, 2009, Boulder, Colorado, USA

Call for Papers
(Submission deadline: March 6, 2009)

Machine learning has become an indispensable tool for natural language =

processing (NLP) researchers. Unfortunately, given the limited =

availability of annotated data, progress on supervised learning often =

yields diminishing returns. Consequently, interest in semi-supervised =

learning has grown in the NLP community. Yet, while some promising =

results have been demonstrated to date, we suspect that consistently =

good results might not be easy to achieve across the board. In =

particular, many open questions remain:

1. Problem Structure: What are the different classes of NLP problem =

structures (e.g. sequences, trees, lists) and what algorithms are best =

suited for each class?
2. Background Knowledge: What kinds of NLP-specific background knowledge =

can we exploit to aid semi-supervised learning?
3. Scalability: NLP data are often large. What are the scalability =

solutions for applying existing semi-supervised learning algorithms to =

NLP data?
4. Evaluation and Negative Results: What can we learn from negative =

results? Can we make an educated guess as to when semi-supervised =

learning might outperform supervised or unsupervised learning?

This workshop aims to bring together researchers dedicated to making =

semisupervised learning work for NLP problems. Our goal is to help build =

a community of researchers and foster deep discussions about insights, =

speculations, and results (both positive and negative) that may =

otherwise not appear in a technical paper at a major conference. We =

welcome submissions of 3 types: Technical papers (complete work, ~8 =

pages), Late-breaking papers (work-in-progress, ~4 pages), Position =

papers (perspectives/speculation, ~2 pages). For more information, see =

the workshop website: http://sites.google.com/site/sslnlp/
