Second Call for Papers

Questions concerning affix ordering and restrictions on affix combinations belong to the central ones in morphological theory (see e.g. Spencer 2006 for a useful survey). Proposals put forward thus far can be classified as:

1)	typological (e.g. inflection follows derivation, cf. Greenberg 1963; with respect to the verb stem, the order of verb inflection morphemes is consistent across languages, cf. Bybee 1985);

2)	phonological (reflecting the idea that morphology and phonology work in conjunction, i.e. the so-called stratal approach, based on the principle of Level Ordering; cf. Siegel 1974, Kiparsky 1982, Mohanan 1986, Giegerich 1999, among others);

3)	syntactic (morphological operations in terms of affix ordering 'mirror' syntactic operations, cf. Baker 1985, and Grimshaw's 1986 criticism of Baker's proposal);

4)	semantic (based on the notion of semantic scope, cf. Rice 2000; see also the 'relevance principle' in Bybee 1985);

5)	psycholinguistic (based on the notion of parsability, i.e. what is more easily parsable follows what is less so, cf. Hay 2003); and 

6)	morphological (selectional restrictions encoded in the affix or/and in the base, including closing suffixes (i.e. suffixes that do not allow addition of further suffixes) are responsible for affix ordering, cf. Fabb 1988; Plag 1996; Szymanek 2000; Aronoff and Fuhrhop 2002). 

As is often the case in linguistic theory, all the above approaches work properly to some extent, but no approach is perfect, which has made linguists integrate insights from different approaches (e.g. Hay & Plag 2004 who combine psycholinguistic and morphological arguments). However, an important problem remains. Some of the proposals have never been tested against data from (a) language(s) typologically different from that/those for which they have been originally formulated. For example, the recently suggested (probabilistic) criterion of parsability has been applied only to English derivational morphology. Thus although parsability has been claimed to be a universal restriction on affix ordering working particularly well in combination with selectional restrictions (Hay & Plag 2004), it remains unclear how this criterion and proposals in which it participates account for the fact that in languages with rich inflectional morphology, for example the Slavic ones, inflection!
 al suffixes are, by rule, vowel initial, often cause stress changes and palatalizations (i.e. are difficult to parse) but follow derivational suffixes. 

Thus this workshop aims to bring together morphologists working on affix ordering in languages representing different morphological types. Papers applying morphological, psycholinguistic and semantic approaches to languages with rich inflectional morphology, or comparing such languages with English, are particularly welcome, although the workshop is open to problem-solving papers based on any language and any approach.
