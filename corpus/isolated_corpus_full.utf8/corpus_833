First call for papers
2007 NooJ Conference
Deadline: March 2, 2007

CALL

We invite the submission of papers for the forthcoming NooJ conference, 
to be held in Barcelona, Spain, June 7 - 9 2007 at the Universidad 
Autònoma de Barcelona.

NooJ is a linguistic development environment that includes tools to 
construct and maintain large-coverage lexical resources, morphological 
and syntactic grammars. Dictionaries and grammars are applied to texts 
in order to locate morphological, lexical and syntactic patterns, remove 
ambiguities, tag words, extract semantic entities, perform automatic 
Machine Translation, etc.

NooJ can build lemmatized concordances of large texts from Finite-State 
Automata and Transducers, Context-Free grammars and Recursive Transition 
Networks, and can accordingly perform transformation operations on texts 
in cascade to recusively annotate texts, which gives it the power of a 
Turing machine.

NooJ is based on the Object Oriented "Component Programming" .NET 
framework. Its most exclusive characteristics are:

-- NooJ's linguistic engine uses an annotation system synchronized to 
the text,
that allows morphological, syntactic and semantic grammars to be applied 
to texts without modifying the original text; this allows linguists to 
describe various phenomena independantly, and apply the corresponding 
grammars in cascade;


-- its integration of its inflection & derivation engine into its syntactic
engine allows linguists to program Harris-type transformations.

NooJ includes processes texts and corpora in over 100+ file formats, 
including all variants of UNICODE, ASCII, HTML, MS-OFFICE, etc. ; its 
linguistic engine is multilingual ; it can import information from, and 
export its annotations back to XML documents ; NooJ command-line program 
and direct Object Oriented API make it much easier to integrate any of 
its functionalities into other applications, etc.

NooJ is used as a linguistic development platform, an information 
retrieval system, a terminological extractor, as well as to teach 
linguistics and computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ: www.nooj4nlp.net.

As in previous INTEX/NooJ conferences, this meeting will be the 
opportunity for NooJ users, as well as other researchers interested in 
NLP, to meet and to exchange their experience of development, research 
or teaching, including computational morphology, lexicon and 
quantitative linguistics. It will also be the occasion to present and 
discover the recent developments of NooJ.

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 2, 2007 
to lab.flexsem@uab.es. The abstract, in French or in English, should 
contain the title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail 
and electronic address of each co-author.

All papers will be reviewed by the program committee. Authors will be 
notified whether their papers are accepted or rejected end of april, 
2007. The timeslot is 30 minutes for presentations, including 5 minutes 
for discussions.
