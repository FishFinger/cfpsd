**** FOIS 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS
****
**** The 5th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information=20
Systems
**** http://fois08.dfki.de
****
**** October 31st - November 3rd, 2008
**** DFKI - Saarbr=FCcken, Germany


Conference Description
----------------------
Since its inception ten years ago, the International Conference on=20
Formal Ontology in Information Systems has explored the multiple=20
perspectives on the notion of ontology that have arisen from such=20
diverse research communities as philosophy, logic, computer science,=20
cognitive science, linguistics, and various scientific domains.

As ontologies have been applied in new and exciting domains such as the=20
World Wide Web, bioinformatics, and geographical information systems, it =

has become evident that there is a need for ontologies  that have been=20
developed with solid theoretical foundations based on philosophical,=20
linguistic, and logical analysis. Similarly, there is also a need for=20
theoretical research that is driven by the issues that  have been raised =

by recent work in the more applied domains.

FOIS is intended to be a forum in which to explore this interplay =20
between the theoretical insights of formal ontology and their=20
application to information systems and emerging semantic technologies.

Invited Speakers
----------------
*  Johanna Seibt (Aarhus Universitet, Denmark)
*  Mike Uschold (Boeing Corporation, USA)
*  York Sure (SAP Research, Germany)

Important dates and Further Information
---------------------------------------
*  Electronic abstracts: April 22, 2008
*  Final submissions: April 24, 2008
*  Acceptance Notification: June 18, 2008
*  Submission of camera-ready papers: July 18, 2008

Submitted papers must not exceed 5000 words (including bibliography). =20
Abstracts should be less than 300 words. Papers should be submitted =20
electronically. Information will be provided on the conference web=20
page:  http://fois08.dfki.de

Proceedings will be published and available at the conference.

Chairs
------
Conference Chair
*  Nicola Guarino (ISTC-CNR, Trento, Italy)
Program Chairs
*  Carola Eschenbach (University of Hamburg, Germany)
*  Michael Gruninger (University of Toronto, Canada)
Local Organization: DFKI - Competence Center Semantic Web=20
(http://semanticweb.dfki.de/)
*  Paul Buitelaar (DFKI GmbH, Saarbr=FCcken, Germany)
*  Massimo Romanelli (DFKI GmbH, Saarbr=FCcken, Germany)
*  Michael Sintek (DFKI GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany)

Topics
------
We seek high-quality papers on a wide range of topics. While authors =20
may focus on fairly narrow and specific issues, all papers should =20
emphasize the relevance of the work described to formal ontology and  to =

information systems. Papers that completely ignore one or the other  of=20
these aspects will be considered as lying outside the scope of the =20
meeting.
Topic areas of particular interest to the conference are:

Foundational Issues
*  Kinds of entity: particulars vs. universals, continuants vs.=20
occurrents, abstracta vs. concreta, dependent vs. independent, natural=20
vs. artificial
*  Formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence,=20
constitution, subsumption, instantiation
*  Vagueness and granularity
*  Identity and change
*  Formal comparison among ontologies
*  Ontology of physical reality (matter, space, time, motion, ...)
*  Ontology of biological reality (genes, proteins, cells, organisms, =
...)
*  Ontology of mental reality and agency (beliefs, intentions and other=20
mental attitudes; emotions, ...)
*  Ontology of social reality (institutions, organizations, norms,=20
social relationships, artistic expressions, ...)
*  Ontology of the information society (information, communication,=20
meaning negotiation, ...)
*  Ontology and Natural Language Semantics, Ontology and Cognition

Methodologies and Applications
*  Top-level vs. application ontologies
*  Ontology integration and alignment; role of reference ontologies
*  Ontology-driven information systems design
*  Requirements engineering
*  Knowledge engineering
*  Knowledge management and organization
*  Knowledge representation; Qualitative modeling
*  Computational lexica; Terminology
*  Information retrieval; Question-answering
*  Semantic web; Web services; Grid computing
*  Domain-specific ontologies, especially for: Biomedical science,=20
eBusiness, Enterprise integration, Geography, Law, Library science,=20
Linguistics,...
