Date: 14-Jul-2008 - 16-Jul-2008

Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics; Cognitive Science; Discourse
Analysis; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description:
The main aim of this theme session is to bring together two different approaches
to cultural studies, the study of interpersonal relations in meaning
construction as well as the negotiation of social identity, as considered and
described by discourse analysts, sociolinguists, ethnolinguists and
systemic-functional linguists, and the features associated to (inter-) cultural
communicative competence. Literature in those domains tends to deal with either
one or another perspective but lacks an overall treatment which is necessary in
order to gain deeper insight into the social constraints of meaning construction
and social identity negotiation, including the social values associated to the
communicative competence in a foreign language.
The attention that the construction of a European entity and identity has
received in the last decades involves a consideration of the multiculturality
and multiligualism of the European citizenship. In the domain of FL teaching and
learning, one of the consequences of this awareness of the European
multicultural mosaic is an increase in the interest in the (inter-) cultural
aspects involved in communication, and more precisely, in what is considered a
culturally competent speaker of a foreign language and how the cultural context
exerts an influence on the learning. 

''Bridging the gap in cultural studies: From meaning construction to (inter-)
cultural communicative competence''
Theme Session of the Conference Language, Culture and Mind 3
Odense, 14-16th July, 2008

Domains:
Contributions are welcome which deal with meaning construction and/ or
communicative competence in relation to language users, language use, language
as a social system and/ or practical applications from one or more of the
following perspectives: pragmatics; cognitive linguistics, systemic functional
linguistics; text linguistics, ethnolinguistics, sociolinguistics, corpus
linguistics; discourse analysis and applied linguistics (FL teaching and
translation in particular).

Submission guidelines:
Abstracts of max. 500 words (including references) are to be submitted to both
Theme Session Organizers (iea@usal.es and ovidi@usal.es) before January 1st
2008. Final notice of acceptance will be given by mid March 2008.
Submissions will be evaluated according to their
- Relevance
- Quality
- Coherence
- Originality
- Organization
