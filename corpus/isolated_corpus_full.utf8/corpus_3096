Meeting Description:

Call for Papers

The Portuguese language has been exposed to diverse contacts, due to its
particular historical, geographical and political situation. The resulting
diversification is apparent at the intercontinental, international, national and
local level. Obvious examples are the European, Brazilian and African Portuguese
variants. On another level, Portugal has changed from an emigrating society into
an immigrating one in the last few decades, motivating new situations of
language contact. Therefore, Portuguese, as a language in contrast with other
languages, can be studied in various domains:

- Comparison of the European, Brazilian and African varieties
- Linguistic fixation and standardization (cf. orthographic norms, language
politics, etc.)
- Linguistic minorities of the Lusophone world
- Language contact inside the Lusophone area 
- Evolution of Portuguese contrasted with other (Ibero-)Romance languages
- Contrastive syntactic, semantic and/or pragmatic analysis of Portuguese
compared to other (Ibero-)Romance languages 

Interested researchers are invited to present their work relating to the
above-mentioned study domains. 

Papers can be presented in Portuguese, Spanish, French or English. The talks
will be about 20 minutes (plus 10 minutes of discussion). Abstracts should be
about 300-400 words long and must be submitted as an attached file to the
following e-mail address, before August 15th 2008: PCC@UGent.be, mentioning the
name(s) of the author(s), abstract title, postal address, e-mail and telephone
number.
