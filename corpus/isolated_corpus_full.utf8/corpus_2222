Contributions are invited for a handbook on the pragmatics of
computer-mediated communication, to be published as one of nine
self-contained volumes in a new Handbooks of Pragmatics series by Mouton de
Gruyter.

The Handbook of Pragmatics series aims to provide a comprehensive overview
of the entire field of pragmatics. The series will operate with a wide
conception of pragmatics; it will reflect the state of the art in a
comprehensive and coherent way; it will be internationally oriented; it
will be interdisciplinary; and it will provide reliable orientational
overviews useful not only to researchers but also to students and teachers.

A significant body of pragmatic literature has accumulated over the past 20
years on computer-mediated communication (CMC), defined as text-based
interactive communication via the Internet, websites and other multimodal
formats, and mobile communication. Thus it is appropriate and timely for
this scholarship to be gathered together in a handbook. The Handbook of the
Pragmatics of Computer-Mediated Communication will include three main types
of content:

1) Overviews of pragmatically-focused research on genres or modes of CMC
e.g., chat, email, listservs, Usenet, blogs, IM, SMS, websites, graphical
virtual worlds

2) Overviews or research studies of pragmatic approaches to CMC phenomena
e.g., features such as emoticons, abbreviations, acronyms, and non-standard
punctuation; nicks; spam; email hoaxes

3) Overviews or research studies of traditional pragmatic phenomena as they
are manifested or take a specific shape in CMC
e.g., implicature, presupposition, Gricean Maxims, relevance, deixis,
performativity, speech acts, cohesion and coherence, openings & closings,
topic/threading, address terms, politeness, humor, code-switching, and
variation based on regional dialect, age, gender, and culture

Submissions will also be considered that address other topics relating
clearly to pragmatics and CMC, including, but not limited to, methodology
for studying the pragmatics of CMC, pragmatic studies of CMC in
institutional contexts, and approaches that capture the interaction of CMC
with physical behavior or offline communication.

Submission Guidelines:

Potential contributors should email a 500-700 word proposal, containing a
title and a description of the topic and organization of the proposed
chapter, or a complete manuscript draft if one is available (maximum 9,000
words, including all parts; no partial drafts, please) to all three editors
by February 20, 2008. Decisions will be sent by late March, and complete,
polished versions of accepted proposals or drafts will be due by August 15,
2008. The handbook is anticipated to go into production in summer of 2009.

Full Manuscript Preparation Guidelines:

In preparing full manuscripts, submitters are asked to follow Mouton de
Gruyter's stylesheet. The stylesheet will be emailed to all authors who are
invited to submit full or revised manuscripts, as well as to any submitter
who requests it sooner. In addition, all accepted manuscripts should
address the following general recommendations:

? Each article should explicitly relate its theme to pragmatic concepts and
the pragmatics literature, even if its antecedents are mostly in another
tradition.

? Each article should include a substantial literature review citing a)
seminal linguistic/pragmatic work upon which the study is based and b)
recent CMC research related to the theme of the chapter. 

? As the handbook will be international in scope, citation of relevant CMC
references about, and written in, other languages is strongly encouraged.

? Each chapter should engage to some extent with the question of the
effects of technological mediation on the phenomena it describes. For
contributions on CMC genres and CMC-specific phenomena, this should
naturally be an important part of the discussion. For chapters that address
traditional pragmatic phenomena, please also include some consideration of
how your CMC data resemble, and are different from, what might be expected
to occur in other communication modalities.

Inquiries, preliminary proposal ideas, and requests for Mouton's stylesheet
should be addressed to the volume editors: Susan Herring
(herring@indiana.edu), Dieter Stein (stein@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de), or
Tuija Virtanen (tuvirtan@abo.fi).
