Meeting Description

This two-day conference is intended for researchers (especially, but not only,
postgraduate students) who are working on topics associated with formulaic
language, including idioms, chunks, phrases, recurrent strings, etc., in
relation to any kind of linguistic data (e.g. corpus research, L1 acquisition,
L2 acquisition/learning/teaching, language disorders, etc). 

It aims to continue on the success of the two previous FLaRN postgraduate
conferences in Cardiff and Twickenham 
(see http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/encap/clcr/flarn/news.html) in offering a forum for
postgraduate students working in any area related to formulaic language to meet
and discuss their work, to exchange ideas and, through workshop activities, to
explore difficult issues with other postgraduate students and researchers in the
field.

There will also be keynote addresses by 
Professor Alison Wray and 
Professor Sylviane Granger 

and a panel discussion involving 
Professor Norbert Schmitt,
Dr Svenja Adolphs
and others (names to be confirmed). 

Attendees will have the opportunity to give a formal presentation (20 minutes
plus 10 minutes for discussion) about their work if they wish. 

Abstract Submissions & Important Dates

Please send abstracts of no more than 300 words to
flarn2008@googlemail.com 

Abstracts should be submitted by 21st January 2008.
