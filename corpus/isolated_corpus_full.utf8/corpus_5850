Special Issue of Corpus Linguistics & Linguistic Theory
Titled: Corpus Linguistics & Sociolinguistic Inquiry

Edited by: Tyler Kendall (Northwestern University) & Gerard Van Herk
(Memorial University of Newfoundland)

Overview

There are many methodological overlaps between corpus-based approaches to
linguistics and the central pursuits of sociolinguistic inquiry, especially
in the variationist paradigm of sociolinguistics pioneered by William Labov
(e.g., 1963, 1966), with its interest in the systematic, quantitative
analysis of real-world language use.  Despite these overlaps -
representative samples of language use, a focus on frequencies of use and
probabilities in distribution - there is less interaction between the
fields at the theoretical level than might be expected. 

Sociolinguists have rarely considered their work as falling within corpus
linguistics, and most sociolinguistic work falls short of the large-sized
data requirements and quantitative rigor maintained by corpus linguists. 
At the same time, sociolinguists often describe their data collections as
'corpora', but with a few exceptions (e.g., Poplack 1989; cf. Kendall 2008)
these sociolinguistic corpora tend to fall short of the definition
maintained by corpus linguists (true balancedness, representivity,
machine-readability; cf. McEnery and Wilson 2001, McEnery, Xiao, and Tono
2006).  Meanwhile, much research undertaken in a sociolinguistic vein by
corpus linguists tends not to be embedded enough in social practice to have
traction among many sociolinguists.  Despite a handful of attempts to draw
sociolinguists to existing corpus linguistic work (e.g., Bauer 2002,
Anderson 2008), few corpora have been developed by corpus linguists that
fully meet the needs of sociolinguists, or are robustly adequate for
examining a wide range of sociolinguistic questions (cf. Kretzschmar et al.
2006, Beal, Corrigan, and Moisl 2007a, b).  

This special issue of Corpus Linguistics & Linguistic Theory explores the
nexus of these two fields and highlights some of the best current work that
aligns sociolinguistic inquiry with robust corpus-based analytic
techniques.  As a part of this exploration, it seeks to chart a way forward
for better collaboration and communication between the two fields.

Call for Submissions

Submissions are solicited for this special issue of the journal Corpus
Linguistics & Linguistic Theory (cf.
http://www.degruyter.de/journals/cllt/), which publishes original
corpus-based research on a range of theoretically relevant topics in
linguistics.  Preferred submissions for the issue will address corpus
linguistic principles and methods (e.g., McEnery and Wilson 2001, Gries
2009) as well as central questions in sociolinguistic theory (e.g., Labov
1994, 2001; Chambers 2003) and/or substantive sociolinguistic research.

Please send a 300-500 word abstract to the guest editors at
t-kendall@northwestern.edu with the subject 'CLLT issue' by no later than
October 1st 2009.  Invitations to submit full papers will be sent one to
two weeks after the abstract deadline.

Projected Timeline

October 1, 2009: abstracts due
October 14, 2009: decisions on abstracts, invitations to submit full papers
February 1, 2010: papers due
May 3, 2010: final revisions due
November-ish 2010: publication
