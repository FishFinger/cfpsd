                      THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS
      International Workshop on Hybrid Logic 2007 (HyLo 2007)
                   http://hylomol.ruc.dk/HyLo2007
                        6 - 10 August, 2007
                       organized as part of
                   the European Summer School on
                  Logic, Language and Information
           ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007
                   6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin
*******************************************************************

ORGANIZERS:

Torben Braüner (Roskilde University, Denmark, torben@ruc.dk) - Chair
Jørgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark, jv@imm.dtu.dk) 

WORKSHOP PURPOSE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct reference 
to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest in hybrid 
logic on the grounds of applications as the additional expressive 
power is very useful. In addition, hybrid-logical machinery improves 
the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism. For example, it 
becomes considerably simpler to formulate modal proof systems, and 
one can prove completeness and interpolation results of a 
generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.

The topic of the HyLo workshop of 2007 is not only standard 
hybrid-logical machinery like nominals, satisfaction operators, and 
the downarrow binder, but generally extensions of modal logic that 
increase its expressive power.

The workshop HyLo 2007 will be relevant to a wide range of people, 
including those interested in description logic, feature logic, 
applied modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction. The 
workshop continues a series of previous workshops on hybrid logic, 
most recently the LICS-affiliated HyLo 2006 
(http://hylomol.ruc.dk/HyLo2006/). The workshop aims to provide a 
forum for advanced PhD students and researchers to present and 
discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who work in the 
broad subject areas represented at ESSLLI.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key 
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/). 

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

We invite the contribution of papers reporting new work from
researchers interested in hybrid logic. Papers should not 
exceed 10 pages including references. A paper must be submitted 
as a PDF file and the font size must be at least 10 pt when 
printed on A4 paper. It is recommended that the LaTeX "article" 
style is used. Please use the HyLo 2007 submission page 
(http://www.easychair.org/HyLo2007/), handled by the EasyChair 
conference system, to submit papers. The accepted papers will 
appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. 
One author for each accepted paper must attend the workshop in 
order to present the paper. It is planned to publish revised 
versions of the accepted papers in a special issue of 
Journal of Logic, Language and Information.

WORKSHOP FORMAT:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI 
participants. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over 
five consecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 
2 or 3 slots for paper presentation and discussion per session. 
On the first day the workshop organizers will give an introduction 
to the topic.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Balder ten Cate (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
Ian Hodkinson (Imperial College, UK)

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

Carlos Areces (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Patrick Blackburn (INRIA Lorraine, France)
Thomas Bolander (Technical University of Denmark) - Co-Chair
Torben Braüner (Roskilde University, Denmark) - Chair
Mai Gehrke (New Mexico State University, USA)
Valeria de Paiva (PARC, USA)
Jørgen Villadsen (Technical University of Denmark) 

IMPORTANT DATES:

Deadline for submissions: March 8, 2007
Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2007
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2007
ESSLLI early registration: May 1, 2007
Deadline for final versions: May 17, 2007
Final programme: June 21, 2007
Workshop dates: 6 - 10 August, 2007

LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS:

All workshop participants including the presenters will be required 
to register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting 
a paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker 
registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants 
will be made available by the ESSLLI local organizing committee on 
a competitive basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply 
for those. There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and 
accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding 
funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for 
the possibilities for a grant.
