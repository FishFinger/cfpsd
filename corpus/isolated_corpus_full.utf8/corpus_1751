Location: Istanbul, Turkey 
Contact Person: Sehnaz Tahir
Meeting Email: sehnaz.tahir@boun.edu.tr
Web Site: http://www.asiantranslation3.boun.edu.tr/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description

This conference will challenge the Eurocentric bias of Translation Studies by
exploring the richness and diversity of non-Western discourses and practices of
translation. The focus will be on translational exchanges among non-Western
languages and change and continuity in the translation traditions of specific
cultures ensuing from contacts with other cultures. One day of the conference
will be allocated to a discussion of the Ottoman/Turkish translation tradition. 

See http://www.asiantranslation3.boun.edu.tr/ for full details.

Meeting Description

While computing has becomes almost ubiquitous in the US and Europe, its spread
in Asia is more recent. Many Asian languages are very inadequately supported on
computers. Even basic NLP tools are not available for these languages. NLP/CL
based technologies are also now becoming important and future intelligent
systems will use more of these techniques. Again, most of the NLP/CL tools and
technologies are tailored for English or European languages. Recently, there has
been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries. This is now the
perfect time to address the problem mentioned above, namely lack of computing
support and basic NLP tools for less privileged languages. Only when a basic
infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes available can we hope
for a more equitable availability of opportunities made possible by language
technology. There have already been attempts in this direction and this workshop
will try to take them further, especially in the Asian context. 

Call for Papers

IJCNLP 2008 Workshop on NLP for Less Privileged Languages
(http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlp-lpl-07)

Background and Motivation

While computing has becomes almost ubiquitous in the US and Europe, its spread
in Asia is more recent. However, despite the fact that Asia is a dense area in
terms of linguistic diversity (or perhaps because of it), many Asian languages
are very inadequately supported on computers. Even basic NLP tools are not
available for these languages. This is a major bottleneck in the development of
advanced NLP applications and language resources and it also has a social cost.
NLP/CL based technologies are now becoming important and future intelligent
systems will use more of these techniques. Most of the NLP/CL tools and
technologies are tailored for English or European languages. Recently, there has
been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries. This is now the
right time to address the problem mentioned above, namely lack of computing
support and basic NLP tools for less privileged languages. Only when a basic
infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes available can we hope
for a more equitable availability of opportunities made possible by language
technology. There have already been attempts in this direction (some of them are
mentioned below) and this workshop will try to take them further, especially in
the Asian context.

Workshop Goals

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
archiving language data, developing language resources, providing basic
computing support and creating natural language tools for less privileged
languages. Some of these languages are Malayalam, Gujarati, Maithili, Assamese,
Burmese, Nepali and even tribal languages. They may or may not be low density
languages, but the common feature among them is that they are not adequately
supported on the computers and not many CL/NLP tools or resources exist for
them. The workshop is open to any less privileged (in the above sense) language
of the world, even though the focus will be on Asian languages.

We also invite novel approaches which can exploit the similarities among many
languages. One of these could be a relatively more privileged language and can
be treated as a pivot language around which resources and tools are developed
for related but less privileged languages with minimum effort. For example, in
the South Asian context, Hindi could be treated as the pivot language and
resources and tools for languages like Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati etc. could be
developed as extensions of the resources and tools for Hindi. Perhaps minimally
supervised algorithms could be used to achieve this.

Papers are invited on substantial, original and unpublished research on
following aspects of NLP for LPL, including but not limited to:

- Archiving and creation of interoperable data and metadata for less privileged
languages.

- Support for less privileged language on computers. This includes input
methods, display, fonts, encoding converters, spell checkers, more
linguistically aware text editors etc.

- Basic NLP tools such as sentence marker, tokenizer, morphological analyzer,
transliteration tools, language and encoding identifiers etc.

- Advanced NLP tools such as POS taggers, local word grouper, approximate string
search, tools for making development of language resources easier.

Submission

Paper submission is through the centralized workshop submission page at
https://www.softconf.com/ijcnlp/NLPLPL. Papers have to be written in English.
There are two categories of papers: long and short. Long papers can be up to 8
pages long, while the maximum length for short papers is 5 pages (including
references, figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.

The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX styles or MS Word templates
recommended for the main IJCNLP conference. These documents are available at
http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/callforpapers.htm. Reviewing will be blind. The draft
papers should not contain any information that can identify the authors, as far
as possible.

Important Dates

- Paper Submission Deadline: Sept 21, 2007
- Notification of Paper Acceptance: Oct 26, 2007
- Camera Ready Submission Deadline: Nov 16, 2007
