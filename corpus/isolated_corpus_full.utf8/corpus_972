CALL FOR PAPERS - STUDENT RESEARCH WORKSHOP at ACL-07
June 24th-29th 2007, Prague, Czech Republic
Submission deadline: January 23, 2007
Workshop URL: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/srw/
Submission URL: http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-SRW/submit.html
************************************************************************


1. General Invitation for Submissions
The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the
general audience and from selected panelists -- experienced researchers =
who
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop. =
As
the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis is on
work in progress. Original and unpublished research is therefore invited =
on
all aspects of computational linguistics including, but not limited to, =
the
following topic areas:
. pragmatics and discourse
. semantics and lexicons
. syntax and grammars
. phonetics, phonology, and morphology
. linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language
. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering
. summarization and paraphrasing
. speech recognition and speech synthesis
. corpus-based language modeling
. multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids
. spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems
. multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems
. narrative understanding systems

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos. More
information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page,
http://www.acl2007.org/.

2. Submission Requirements
The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with the
opportunity of presenting their work in a formal setting. Submission =
will
therefore normally be open only to students who have settled on their =
thesis
direction but who still have significant research left to do; those =
students
in the final stages of their thesis and those who have already presented =
at
an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop should submit to the main
conference instead.

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers =
should
clearly indicate directions for future research wherever appropriate. =
The
papers may have more than one author; however, all authors MUST be =
students
(graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted are eligible only if they =
have
not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available =
published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the submission page.

3. Submission Procedure
Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly =
recommend
the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored =
for
this year's conference. These will be available from the web pages of
ACL-07. A description of the format is also available in case you are =
unable
to use these style files directly. Submission must be electronic. The =
only
accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Please use the =
submission
page (http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-SRW/submit.html) to submit =
your
paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure
Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by =
the
Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewers. =
Each
submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior
researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on =
the
results of the review.

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make sure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should =
likewise
not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the paper submitted =
for
review. For example, rather than this: "We showed previously (Smith, =
2001),
...", use citations such as: "Smith (2001) previously showed ...".

5. Schedule
The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time January =
23,
2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be automatically
disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after receipt.
Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by e-mail) on March =
23,
2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final
camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance =
notice.

Important Dates:
Paper submission deadline: January 23, 2007
Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007
Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007
Conference date: June 25-27, 2007

6. Travel Grants
Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to =
the
Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel grants, =
please
contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Research Workshop.

7. Contact Information
If you need to contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Research Workshop,
please use: srw@acl2007.org An e-mail sent to this address will be =
forwarded
to all Co-Chairs.
