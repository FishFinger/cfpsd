Organized by: Eva Lavric, Gerhard Pisek, 
Andrew Skinner, Wolfgang Stadler

Language and Football

On the occasion of Euro 2008 being held in Austria and Switzerland, we are
organizing a workshop about language and sport with a special emphasis on
football. Football should be at the centre, with topics ranging from
terminology, sports reporting, match commentaries (also cross-culturally) to
communication within multilingual football teams. Other areas can include:
conversations among people watching football on TV and genres such as media
interviews, rules of the game, advertising with football stars, sponsoring
discourse and promotional campaigns, football chants and songs, as well as the
teaching of football and football language. 
We are also happy to accept contributions about other sports, provided they can
be related in a meaningful way to the football topics above. Other team sports
or medial / discourse genres about other sports can be included as long as they
help to elucidate football issues. 
We encourage interdisciplinary work, as well as cross-cultural and cross-sports
comparisons. 
Participants are asked to bring their finished papers to the workshop (style
sheets will be sent out in good time), as there will be a publication that
should, ideally, be presented on the occasion of Euro 2008.
Please send your abstracts before 31/05/07  to Eva.Lavric@uibk.ac.at.

Meeting Description:

Extremadura has a rich cultural heritage, with very significant contributions in
the field of oral traditions and mythology, and with an influence in the current
sphere of fantasy literature. The seminar is an opportunity to experience and
discover more about this heritage: myths and popular traditions, celebrations,
writers who develop the fantasy genre, etc. The aim, in turn, is to achieve
multi-disciplinary analyses and interpretations in order to examine educational
models and ways of spreading this knowledge for the 21st century, in particular,
contrasting the application of these materials for the teaching of Spanish as a
foreign language. The promotion and teaching of this cultural heritage is the
constant theme of the week's conferences, papers and debates.

This seminar is part of the "Extremadura Week" taking place at the Instituto
Cervantes in London, the aim of which is to offer an array of outstanding
activities about Extremadura, in particular those concerning heritage and
creativity.
