Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Advisory Board, we would like to inform you of the:

SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE BOOK      
The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK     
16-18 October 2009      
http://book-conference.com     

The Book Conference serves as an inclusive forum for examining the past, current and future role of the book. It proceeds from recognition that although the book is an old medium of expression, it embodies thousands of years' experience of recording knowledge. The pervasive influence of this experience continues to shape newer forms of information technology, while at the same time providing a reference point for innovation.
	
Keynote speakers include:     
* Bill Bell, Director of the Centre for the History of the Book, The University of Edinburgh, UK     
* Gobinda Chowdhury, Professor of Information and Knowledge Management, University of Technology Sydney, Australia     
* Lorraine Fannin, Board of Trustees, National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, UK     
* Michael Fraser, Director of the Communications Law Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Australia     
* John Man, British historian and travel writer, UK     
* Alistair McCleery, Professor of Literature and Culture, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, UK     
* Martyn Wade, National Librarian, National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, UK     
* John W. Warren, Director of Marketing, Publications, RAND Corporation, USA     

The Book Conference not only considers the book and other information technologies as artefacts or discrete objects, it also examines other key aspects of the information society, including publishing, libraries, information systems, literacy and education. Broadly speaking, the Conference engages the interrelation between changes in thought, creation, production and distribution, and the role and meaning of the book and other information technologies. The Book Conference welcomes a wide range of participants from the world of books including authors, publishers, printers, librarians, IT specialists, book retailers, editors, literacy educators, and academic researchers and scholars from all disciplinary traditions.

The Conference includes plenary presentations by accomplished researchers, scholars and practitioners, as well as numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in The International Journal of the Book. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 20 August 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://book-conference.com

In addition, we will be offering a tour to the 2009 Frankfurt Book Fair.  Please continue to check the Activities and Extras link on the Conference website for updates.

We look forward to receiving your proposals and hope you will be able to join us in Edinburgh, UK in October.

Yours sincerely,

Garett Gietzen      
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA     
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on the Book and International Journal of the Book
