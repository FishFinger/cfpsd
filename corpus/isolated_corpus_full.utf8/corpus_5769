Location: Rovereto, Italy 
Contact Person: Luca Ghirotto

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: 10-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the Workshop is to bring together scholars from various fields of
cognitive science to discuss issues dealing with the relationship among mind,
brain, and education.  A specific objective is to foster a productive exchange
between scientists and professionals in the various areas of cognitive science
and education.

The workshop differs from larger conferences in so far as there are only 8
speakers (all invited) and there are no concurrent talks. A poster session is
organized in an effort to encourage young researchers and students to present
their work. A Round Table with the participation of researchers, teachers,
school administrators, and legislators is also planned. 

Call for Papers:

A poster session is organized in an effort to encourage researchers and students
to present their works.

To present a poster please send an abstract using the ECN 2009 form at
http://www.cogsci.unitn.it/ecn2009/registration.jsp?lang=en&place=146&poster=28

Contributions should be written in English and no longer than 3500 characters.

The scientific committee will review the abstracts and will inform the author(s)
via email.
