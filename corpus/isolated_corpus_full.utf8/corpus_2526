Cultures in Transit

Liverpool
18th-21st July 2008
 
The inaugural conference of the International Institute for Transcultural and Diasporic Studies will take place in Liverpool, Europe's Capital of Culture, in 2008. Future conferences will alternate between Liverpool Hope University and Jean Moulin University, Lyon.

While focussed primarily on the arts, humanities and social sciences, the programme will be transdisciplinary and open to all those interested in transcultural and transdisciplinary discussion, particularly but not exclusively in fields such as literary and cultural studies, cultural anthropology and history, cinema studies, music studies, sociology and sociolinguistics.

His fifth novel, Drift, was published in July 1994. His sixth novel Stepper won the 1997 National Book Council 'Banjo' Prize for fiction.

We welcome proposals for papers which address the following questions:
- Why have diasporas happened? 
- What happens to social and cultural practices (textual, visual, linguistic, musical) when they are displaced (examples might include francophone cultures in America, and musical cultures in the Caribbean)? 
- What happens to local cultures when external social and cultural practices confront them?
- What happens to cultures which have experienced extensive emigration?

Related questions which focus on the central themes of historical processes of hybridisation/metissage, intertextuality and cultural fusion brought about by migrations of people, ideas and practices, the impact of globalization on the production, consumption, diffusion and reception of cultures and cultural practices, pre-modern nomadism and post-modern nomadologies.
 
We welcome proposals which approach these themes either from the perspective of specific communities or that of specific experiences. 

Proposals for papers in approximately 150 words should be submitted by 29th February, 2008. Those submitting proposals will be notified of the outcome of their submission in early March 2008. Final versions of papers which should be of 6,000 words should be submitted by 15th June, 2008. Papers should be in English and will be distributed in advance of the sessions in order to promote lively and engaged discussion at the conference.  

Please send outline paper proposals to Dr Terry Phillips at phillim@hope.ac.uk or at Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, L16 9JD, United Kingdom.

Meeting Description:

Lingua Franca English in Use 

Call for Papers

Convenors:
Dr. Tim Caudery (University of Aarhus)
E-mail: engtc@hum.au.dk 
Prof. Anna Mauranen (University of Helsinki)
E-mail: anna.mauranen@helsinki.fi 

Awareness of globalization issues has focused increasing attention on the use of English as a lingua franca in communicative contexts where the participants do not share the same mother tongue. This seminar is open for papers on studies of the use of lingua franca English in various settings (academic, commercial, diplomatic, etc.) and of the characteristics of lingua franca English itself as it has developed in such contexts.

General Information: 
Those wishing to participate in the Conference are invited to submit 200-word abstracts of their proposed papers directly to both convenors of the seminar in question before 1 March 2008. The convenors will let the proponents know whether their proposals have been accepted no later than 21 March 2008. 

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply reading their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced versions of the papers are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in question. There will be a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar session, and convenors should plan so that there is time for discussion between speakers and with the audience.
