Visual and Verbal Rhetoric of the Media 

Call for Papers

Extended Deadline: 15 April 2009

The Aims of the Conference: 
To discuss the rhetorical devices, techniques, and strategies used by the
authors and illustrators of media messages to achieve their goals of moving or
frightening their audiences, effectively shaping their perception and
conceptualization of events, and/or changing their attitudes. We will welcome
the papers analyzing examples of the use of linguistic and visual imagery and
tropes in both the traditional and the new media, but also discussing such
issues as media bias, stereotyping, the ways of tackling "delicate" topics, the
use of irony and parody, intertextuality. We also invite the authors who take up
contrastive analyses; and especially those who would like to focus specifically
on the interaction of the visual and the verbal aspects of the media messages. 
                  
The language of the Conference is English.
The length of the presentation: 30 minutes.
The conference proceedings will be published by the Lodz University Press. 

The conference fee will be approximately 75 ? . Detailed information about the
costs of accommodation will follow in the next circular. 

The deadline for the initial statement of interest and a general outline of the
paper is 15 April 2009.
