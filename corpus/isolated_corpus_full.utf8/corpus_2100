Dear Maggie,

have you seen www.elgrial.cl. It is a web interface for Spanish tagging
and parsing. If you have your corpus in *.txt you can ask Dr. Giovanni
Parodi at the Pontificia Universidad CAtolica de Valparaiso to upload your
corpus and to make some lexical and sintactics analysis. The mail of Dr.
Parodi is gparodi@ucv.cl

best regards,

Dr. Rene Venegas

> institutions and universities all over the world, e.g., USA, UK, New
> Zealand, Spain, etc.
>
> Who can participate?

>                  The Fifth International Contrastive Linguistics
> Conference (ICLC5) will be held July 7 - 9, 2008 at the

>
>                   The aim of ICLC 5 is to encourage the comparison between
> two (or more) languages from a theoretical linguistic
> perspective. Although contrastive linguistics has long
> been associated primarily with applied linguistics (in
> particular foreign language teaching), it is defined
> here as a subdiscipline of linguistics with major
> theoretical implications, which may contribute to our
> understanding of linguistic structures and functions.
>
>                   We invite papers or posters with a comparative approach
> to topics related to one of the following domains:
> discourse analysis and pragmatics, syntax and semantics,
> lexicon and morphology, phonetics and phonology.
> Empirically founded studies with theoretical
> implications will be especially welcomed.
>
>                   We are pleased to announce the following keynote
> speakers:
