Universals and Typology in Word-Formation 

Last Call for Papers

The Conference aims to give an impetus to the research into universals and
typology in word-formation by a joint effort of both morphologists and
typologists. Papers discussing correlations between individual word-formation
processes as well as between WF processes and genetic types and/or
geographically related languages are most welcome.  Space will also be given to
any other typologically oriented research into word-formation as well as papers
discussing the scope of word-formation and the relation between word-formation
and other linguistic disciplines.

Abstract of papers (500 words max.) clearly defining the topic and the
objectives pursued in the paper should be submitted by e-mail as Word
attachments to:
