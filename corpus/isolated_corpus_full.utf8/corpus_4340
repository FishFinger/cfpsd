CALL FOR PAPERS
----------
Special Track on SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare
3-4 August 2009
Albuquerque, New Mexico

http://sdsh09.biomap.org/

22nd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems

http://cvial.ee.ttu.edu/cbms2009/
----------

The aging population phenomenon together with community based care models is
driving the need for healthcare to seek support for the capture, collection,
transmission, real time assessment, storage and data mining of data
presented as data streams. A plethora of medical devices in healthcare
facilities, within the home and even within clothing is generating data
streams at frequencies up to 1000 readings a second. Services Computing has
been described as a cross-discipline that covers the science and technology
of bridging the gap between Business Services and IT Services supported by
Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA), transformation and
integration. Healthcare is often perceived to lag behind other industry
sectors in its uptake and adoption of new technology. Opportunities abound
for the unique aspects of data stream models in healthcare to drive
fundamental computing and IT research together with leading applied research
within the healthcare domain.

This special track invites papers with research contributions in the domain
of Services Oriented Architectures for Data Streams in Healthcare. The
topics include but are not limited to:

* Trends and Challenges of SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare
* Barriers to adoption of SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare
* SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare Methodologies
* Legal and Regulatory requirements concerning SOA for Data Streams in
Healthcare
* New models of healthcare delivery supported by SOA for Data Streams in
Healthcare
* Services performance issues (e.g. Availability, Reliability and Security)
* Management and monitoring of SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare
* The integration of patient journey modeling with SOA for Data Streams in
Healthcare
* Case Studies in SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare

PAPER SUBMISSION:

No hardcopy submissions are being accepted. Electronic submissions of
original technical research papers will only be accepted in PDF format. Use
a maximum of 6 pages IEEE two-column format, including figures and
references. All submissions will be done electronically via the CBMS 2009
web submission system (
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecbms2009). Select the track
"SOA for Data Streams in Healthcare", provide the information about the
paper title, authors, keywords, and corresponding author's information
(telephone, fax, mailing address, e-mail address). Please note that author
names should not appear on the paper. Submission implies the willingness of
at least one of the authors to register and present the paper at the CBMS
2009 Symposium. All papers will be peer reviewed by at least two independent
referees. All accepted papers will be included in the conference
proceedings. Selected papers from the track will be published in Special
Issue of International Journal of Healthcare Information Systems and
Informatics (IJHISI) in 2010.

IMPORTANT DATES:

April 1, 2009     Paper Submission Due
May 25, 2009     Notification of acceptance
June 21, 2009     Final camera-ready paper due
June 21, 2009     Pre-registration deadline

You must pre-register to have your paper published in the proceedings. If
you only plan to attend and are not submitting a paper, pre-registration is
still strongly encouraged.

TRACK CHAIRS:

Carolyn McGregor
Canada Research Chair in Health Informatics, University of Ontario Institute
of Technology, Canada

Amandeep S. Sidhu
WA Centre for Comparative Genomics, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia

Matthew I. Bellgard
