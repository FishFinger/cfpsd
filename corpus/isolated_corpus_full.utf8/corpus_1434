of language acquisition. 

Second Call for Papers

Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition

PsychoCompLA-2007 

August 1st at CogSci 2007 - Nashville, Tennessee 

Submission Deadline: May 22, 2007 

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic: 

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated computational models
of language acquisition. That is, models that are compatible with research
in psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics. 

Invited Speakers:

- Elissa Newport, University of Rochester 
- Shimon Edelman, Cornell University 
- Damir Cavar, University of Zadar, University of Indiana 
- Robert Frank, Johns Hopkins University 
- Terry Regier, University of Chicago 
- Alex Clark, Royal Holloway University of London 
- Charles Yang, University of Pennsylvania 

Workshop Description:

This workshop will present research and foster discussion centered around
psychologically-motivated computational models of language acquisition,
with an emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades there has
been a thriving research agenda that applies computational learning
techniques to emerging natural language technologies and many meetings,
conferences and workshops in which to present such research. However, there
have been only a few (but growing number of) venues in which
psychocomputational models of how humans acquire their native language(s)
are the primary focus. By psychocomputational models we mean models that
are compatible with, or might inform research in psycholinguistics,
developmental psychology or linguistics. 

Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular
interest in light of recent results in developmental psychology that
suggest that very young infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns
in an audible input stream. Though, how children might plausibly apply
statistical 'machinery' to the task of grammar acquisition, with or without
an innate language component, remains an open and important question. One
effective line of investigation is to computationally model the acquisition
process and determine interrelationships between a model and linguistic or
psycholinguistic theory, and/or correlations between a model's performance
and data from linguistic environments that children are exposed to. 

Although there has been a significant amount of presented research targeted
at modeling the acquisition of word categories, morphology and phonology,
research aimed at modeling syntax acquisition has just begun to emerge. 

Workshop History:  

This is the third meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human
Language Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, held in Geneva,
Switzerland as part of the 20th International Conference on Computational
Linguistics (COLING 2004) and PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in
Ann Arbor, Michigan where the workshop shared a joint session with the
Ninth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005). 

Workshop Organizer: 

William Gregory Sakas, City University of New York 
(sakas at hunter.cuny.edu)  

Workshop Co-organizer: 

David Guy Brizan, City University of New York
(dbrizan at gc.cuny.edu) 

Submission Details:

Authors are invited to submit abstracts of 1 page plus 1 page for data and
other supplementary materials. Abstracts should be anonymous, clearly
titled and no more than 500 words in length. Text of the abstract should
fit on one page, with a second page for examples, table, figures,
references, etc. The following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word.
Please include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment) containing the
title of your submission, your name, contact details and affiliation.
Please send your submission electronically to Psycho.Comp@hunter.cuny.edu.
The accepted abstracts will appear in the online workshop proceedings. Full
papers will be considered for a submission for a special issue of a
Cognitive Science Society Journal in the fall. 

Submission deadline: May 22, 2007 

Topics and Goals:

Abstracts that present research on (but not necessarily limited to) the
following topics are welcome:

- Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
- Models that combine parsing and learning;
- Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that incorporate
psychologically plausible constraints; 
- Comparative surveys that critique previously reported studies; 
- Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
- Models that address learning bias in terms of innate linguistic knowledge
versus statistical regularity in the input;
- Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics;
- Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
- Models of language change and its effect on language acquisition or vice
versa;
- Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
- Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or
developmental theories (e.g., principles & parameters, optimality theory,
construction grammar, etc.)
- Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from cognitive
psychology, computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical
sciences, linguistics and psycholinguistics working on all areas of
language acquisition. Diversity and cross-fertilization of ideas is the
central goal.

Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

One of the most contentious topics in recent translation studies is the notion
of translation universals. Translated texts differ from non-translated texts in
that certain types of shifts occur during the process of translation. The effort
has been made to test hypotheses by using different pairs of languages
(Blum-Kulka 1986; Baker 1991, 1993, and 1995; Laviosa-Braithwaite 1995, 1996;
Olohan and Baker 2000). However, identifying the general features of translation
is by no means easy. Only in the late 1990s did empirical studies begin with the
introduction of a corpus-based approach. 
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together people doing translation
research and to provide a forum for discussing possible universals. It is hoped
that evidence of translation universals will be found and tested and that a
variety of pairs of languages will be used. Focus should be placed on such
qualities as the length of texts, over-representation, cohesive and logical
ties, use of punctuation, topic and theme relation and syntactic or lexical
simplification manifested in translated texts. 

We invite submissions on research dealing with features of translation
universals. The talks should be twenty minutes each, -- that is, a fifteen-minute
presentation followed by five minutes for questions. A two-page abstract should
be sent electronically to both cil18@cil18.org and kimsy@dongguk.edu. An MS Word
and/or PDF format is strongly preferred. All submissions will be evaluated
anonymously. Names are not to appear on the abstracts. Instead, name, title of
talk, affiliation, address, and contact number should be in the body of the
e-mail message. Confirmation of receipt will be sent by e-mail. Please do not
hesitate to show this announcement to interested colleagues.
