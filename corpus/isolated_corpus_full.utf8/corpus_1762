Meeting Description:

Within the Contact project for the study of translation and communication
transfer across cultures, The Department of English Studies of the Catholic
University of Milan is pleased to announce a satellite symposium on Native and
Non-Native English Mediated Discourse and the changing English language. 

The satellite symposium will be held in Verona within the GlobEng: International
Conference on Global English (14-16 February 2008) 

The aim of the symposium, organized in three sessions, is to provide a forum for
the presentation of research related to the role of English as a Lingua Franca
with specific regard to the concept of mediated discourse. 

There is an increasing awareness that specific mechanisms are at work in the
mediation process, which influence the kind of language used and the text which
is produced. This is particularly evident when English is used as a Lingua
Franca within international academic, institutional and professional settings
where native-speakers are a minority. Two scenarios emerge: on the one hand,
English as a Lingua Franca is subject to change because of non-native speaker
influence; on the other, native speakers still exercise their control on
acceptability and accuracy, as, for instance, in the editing of international
academic and scientific articles or the final drafting of EU documents in
English. Interestingly enough, however, even in this latter context, an osmotic
process seems to be underway as features of international English find their way
unobtrusively into the final texts, escaping the notice of the native-speaking
custodians of English. 

Papers are encouraged which address the following topics: 
Non-native speaker influence on the changing English language 
Centrifugal and centripetal forces in mediated discourse 
Translation quality assessment and native English expectancy norms 
Translation Universals - State of the Art 
Medium-specific variations of mediated English 
Lingua Franca English and editing practices in academic, institutional and
professional settings 
Hybridity in mediated discourse 

Invited Speakers to the GlobEng conference: 
David Crystal, Adrian Holliday, Jennifer Jenkins, Alan Maley, Barbara Seidlhofer
and Simon Sweeney. 

Contributions are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus discussion). 

Submission: 

- Abstracts should not exceed 300 words in length (references excluded); 
- They should be anonymous and will be subject to anonymous peer-review; 
- They should be sent as email attachments (preferably in pdf format or rtf) in
Times New Roman pt.12 or equivalent font, single-spaced to:
symposium.globeng-contact@unicatt.it; 
- To assist the reviewing process, please list up to 5 keywords in the email
message; 
- Subject line of the email should be GlobEng_Contact and abstract title; 
- Email message should include: Talk Title, Author's Name(s), Title(s),
Affiliation(s), Contact Info (email address, postal address, telephone number,
fax number). 

Submission deadline: September 30, 2007 
Notification of Acceptance: November 30, 2007
