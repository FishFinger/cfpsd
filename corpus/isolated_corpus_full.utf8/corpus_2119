Multiword expressions: hard going or plain sailing?

Special issue of the International Journal of Language Resources and
Evaluation http://www.springer.com/journal/10579/ =


Guest editors:

Paul Rayson (Lancaster University, UK)

This special issue is concerned with language resources and evaluation in t=
he area of multiword expressions. For a number of years, the focus in the n=
atural language processing (NLP) community on the problems posed by multiwo=
rd expressions (MWE) was on English. Recently, for example at the ACL and E=
ACL workshops on multiword expressions, attention has expanded to other lan=
guages including Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, German, Estonian, Russian, Basqu=
e, Turkish and Hindi. This necessitates a re-evaluation of earlier rule-bas=
ed, statistical and hybrid techniques for MWE extraction and classification=
. In English, MWE types such as phrasal verbs, light verb constructions, no=
un compounds, proper names, and non-compositional idioms, have been conside=
red. However, in other languages some MWE types can be represented as compo=
und words, e.g. phrasal verbs in English are generally expressed as verb-pr=
efix in Russian. At the same time, research on MWEs for languages other tha=
n English is confronted with new problems, such as the number of word forms=
 per lemma, case marking, word order or word segmentation.

The focus of this special issue is on the acquisition and analysis of langu=
age resources related to MWE and the methods for evaluation of the extracti=
on procedures and resulting MWE resources. Language resources include writt=
en or spoken corpora marked up for MWE, terminology or domain specific data=
bases and dictionaries of MWE, as well as software tools for their acquisit=
ion and analysis.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:

1. Linguistic analysis: of MWE based on language resources (such as corpora=
) and the impact that these studies have on NLP applications. We also welco=
me articles which undertake cross-linguistic analyses of MWE or which ident=
ify variation across languages. Here we include studies which investigate h=
ow application of techniques developed for one language can be transferred =
to another language and how successful bilingual (or multilingual) approach=
es are. =

2. Typologies of MWE: descriptions of different classes of MWE and their re=
presentation in language resources, and in addition to evaluate how well co=
mputational techniques transfer across different types of MWE. Investigatio=
ns of the variability of MWEs. =

3. Extraction methods: Do methods generalise across languages? What is the =
interaction between linguistic descriptions/analyses of MWE and extraction =
methods? (i.e. to what extent are linguistically informed extraction method=
s useful?) Is fully automatic extraction of MWE feasible, or will manual va=
lidation/intervention always be necessary? =

4. Evaluation strategies: creation of gold standard MWE language resources.=
 Comparative studies using human subjects including experts and non-experts=
 and computational evaluations using language resources derived from the we=
b and elsewhere. Task-based evaluation of MWE lexical resources in NLP appl=
ications =

5. Compositionality: comparative evaluation of how well humans and machines=
 make reliable judgements on compositionality for the various classes of MW=
E. Also, the extent to which compositionality is a key indicator for extrac=
tion and classification of MWE. =

6. Applications: of the theories, techniques and tools developed in MWE res=
earch to practical tasks such as IR, Text Mining etc. =
