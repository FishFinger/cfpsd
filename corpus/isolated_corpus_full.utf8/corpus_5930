Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Syntax=20

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Subordinators are usually defined as markers which transform an autonomous,=
 syntactically structured sequence into a dependent unit. The terms traditi=
onally considered as subordinators belong to various categories and have di=
fferent syntactic and semantic properties. Relative pronouns, for instance,=
 are used not only to embed a clause into another, but have a syntactic fun=
ction in the embedded clause. Subordinating conjunctions, while not having =
a syntactic function in the embedded clause, convey only a grammatical mean=
ing or express a semantico-logical relation.

However, the identification of a subordinator or a class of subordinators a=
s such does not rely on well-defined criteria. This is due not only to thei=
r variety, but also to their frequently ambiguous or polysemous nature (e.g=
. que, comme in French, ut, quod in Latin). Likewise, their position in the=
 grammar depends on the adopted approach: from items which just relate two =
clauses, to phrase heads in generative grammars.

This colloquium, organized by the Syntaxe et TAL team of the Laboratoire de=
 recherche sur le langage (EA 999), aims at contributing to the understandi=
ng of subordinators.=20

Call for Papers:

Participants are invited to reflect on morphology, syntax and semantics, th=
rough a confrontation of works on various languages (ancient and modern), i=
n a synchronic and/or diachronic perspective, and to compare research from =
different approaches: theoretical, applied, or corpus linguistics, NLP, etc=
.

Submission Procedure:

Participants are invited to submit summaries of articles, in French or Engl=
ish, no longer than two pages, examples and bibliography included.

Submission deadline: September 15, 2009.

Each summary will be evaluated anonymously by at least two members of the s=
cientific committee. After the colloquium, speakers will be invited to subm=
it a complete article to be published, after a review by the scientific com=
mittee, in a dedicated volume of the Cahiers du LRL.

Practical information for the submission of summaries is published on the c=
olloquium's web site: http://www.univ-bpclermont.fr/LABOS/lrl/spip.php?rubr=
ique94.

Important Dates:

Submission of summaries: September 15, 2009
Notification of acceptance: November 15, 2009
