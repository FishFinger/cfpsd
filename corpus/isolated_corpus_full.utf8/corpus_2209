Location: Kunming, China

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description

The panel is organized in the framework on an ongoing Sino-Dutch cooperation
project 'Trans-Himalayan database development: China and the Subcontinent'.
Started off in 2005, this research programme has been conceived to bring
together the expertise of the two internationally renowned centres of
Tibeto-Burman research, namely Leiden University on the Netherlands side and the
Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology (CASS) on the Chinese side, with the
ultimate goal of creating an online digital lexical database of Tibeto-Burman
languages spoken in China and the Indian Subcontinent. The database is to
present linguistic data under one unified standard so as to enable historical
reconstructions and multi-leveled research on Tibeto-Burman languages. The
second goal of the project is to continue documentation of endangered
Tibeto-Burman languages of the Greater Himalayas. 

The 16th World Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences (ICAES 2008) will be held in Kunming, China from July 15
through July 23, 2008 (http://www.icaes2008.org). It will host a panel on the
Sino-Tibetan languages of the Greater Himalayas, to which you are cordially invited.

The panel is organized in the framework on an ongoing Sino-Dutch cooperation
project ''Trans-Himalayan database development: China and the Subcontinent''.
Started off in 2005, this research programme has been conceived to bring
together the expertise of the two internationally renowned centres of
Tibeto-Burman research, namely Leiden University on the Netherlands side and the
Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology (CASS) on the Chinese side, with the
ultimate goal of creating an online digital lexical database of Tibeto-Burman
languages spoken in China and the Indian Subcontinent. The database is to
present linguistic data under one unified standard so as to enable historical
reconstructions and multi-leveled research on Tibeto-Burman languages. The
second goal of the project is to continue documentation of endangered
Tibeto-Burman languages of the Greater Himalayas.

The goal of this panel is twofold. On the one hand, it reports on the work
progress and future plans of the research team. On the other hand, it aspires to
broaden the existing cooperation by actively involving in the programme other
scholars working on Tibeto-Burman languages in order to ensure that the output
of the project, the database of Tibeto-Burman languages, will ultimately become
an encompassing, reliable and useful tool for further research on Tibeto-Burman
languages and linguistics.

We invite presentations on all aspects of Tibeto-Burman languages of the Greater
Himalayas, as well as those related to linguistic database construction and
maintenance. 

Please note that participation in this panel does not preclude participation in
other panels of the Congress.

If you intend to participate in the panel ''Tibeto-Burman languages of the
Greater Himalayas'', please submit a one-page abstract (in English or Chinese),
accompanied by your contact information (name, affiliation, address, e-mail,
telephone number) to the undersigned. The closing date for abstract submission
is December 31, 2007. A formal invitation will be sent to you after the abstract
has been checked and accepted.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to possible participants. 

We are looking forward to seeing you in Kunming in July.
