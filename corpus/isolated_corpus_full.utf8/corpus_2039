Meeting Description

The 'Syntax of the World's Languages' conference series provides a forum for
linguists working on less widely studied languages or varieties of languages,
with a clear focus on the data (preferably first-hand data). 

The 'Syntax of the World's Languages' conference series provides a forum for
linguists working on less widely studied languages or varieties of languages.
Contributions are expected to be data-driven, preferentially based on first hand
data. Comparative and diachronic papers are also highly welcome. The discussion
of theoretical issues is appreciated to the extent that it helps to elucidate
the data. The list of topics relevant to the conference includes:

- interesting aspects of basic clause structure;
- argument structure (e.g. grammatical relations, diathesis, linking);
- intra-clausal dependencies (e.g. agreement, binding);
- inter-clausal dependencies (e.g. reference tracking, subordination);
-  the expression of information structure;
- interaction between syntax and other areas of grammar (morphology, phonology,
semantics).

The use of specific syntactic frameworks is encouraged, but presentations
should be understandable without prior knowledge of the relevant theory.
Abstracts of no more than one page (plus one additional page for examples)
should be sent to swl3@anglistik.fu-berlin.de before January 31, 2008, with
''SWL3'' in the subject line. Submissions should be anonymous and refrain from
self-reference. Please provide contact details and the title of your
presentation in the body of the email.

Balthasar Bickel (Leipzig)
