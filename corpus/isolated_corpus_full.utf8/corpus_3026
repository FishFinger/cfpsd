Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all
aspects concerning formal approaches to South-Slavic and Balkan languages,
including, but not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology and morphology;
- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;
- syntax, semantics and grammars;
- pragmatics, discourse and dialogue;
- lexica and ontologies;
- parsing and grammatical formalisms;
- generation, text planning and summarization;
- language modeling, spoken language recognition and understanding;
- mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval and extraction, text mining, text categorisation;
- question answering;
- machine learning for natural language;
- multilingual processing;
- machine translation, machine aided translation and translation aids;
- computer aided language learning;
- speech processing;
- language and speech oriented applications, tools and resources.

Requirements:
Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality,
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest
to the attendees.

Important Dates:
Submission of proposals for oral and poster papers: 20 May 2008
Notification of acceptance of oral papers, posters: 30 June 2008
Final versions for the proceedings: 31 July 2008

Reviewing:
The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed by an
international Program Committee. Final decisions on the technical program will
be made by the Conference Program Committee.

Submission:
The abstract should be of 1500 words maximum. The duration of the paper
presentation should be estimated at 20-25 minutes.

As reviewing will be blind, the abstract should not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to these requirements
will be rejected without review.

The MS-Word/RTF document template for papers will be available from this page soon.

Submissions should be sent to fassbl2008@ffzg.hr

a. Database similarity assessment
b. Automatic schema mapping and relationship discovery
c. New mapping framework for multiple information sources 
d. Data source classification and clustering
e. Data cleansing, data preparation, conflict and inconsistency resolution
  
2. Integrative and Cooperative Mining
a. Model integration for heterogeneous information sources
b. Mode transferring across different data domains
c. Incremental and scalable data mining algorithms
d. Multi-tasks multi-sources co-learning for multiple information sources
  
3. Differentiation and Correlation
a. Local pattern analysis and fusion
b. Global pattern synthesizing and assessment
c. Merging local rules for global pattern discovery
d. Pattern summarization from multiple datasets
e. Multi-dimensional pattern search and comparison 
f. Pattern comparison across multiple data sources
g. Inter pattern discovery from complex data sources
  
4. Stream data mining algorithms
a. Clustering and classification of data of changing distributions
b. Data stream processing, storage, and retrieval systems
c. Sensor networking
  
5. Security and privacy issues in multiple information sources

6. Interactive data mining systems
a. Query languages for mining multiple information sources
b. Query optimization for distributed data mining
c. Distributed data mining operators in supporting interactive data mining
