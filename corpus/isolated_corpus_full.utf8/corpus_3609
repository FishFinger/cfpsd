Meeting Description:

The Department of Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies at the University of
the West of England, Bristol invites you to attend its first three day
conference on Meaning and Interaction. 

i-Mean will be held at the University of the West of England, Bristol on April,
23rd- 25th 2009. 

Call for Papers


About i-Mean@uwe
The conference aims to disseminate cutting edge, multi-disciplinary, research in
the area of meaning in interaction. It is unique in bringing together scholars
working on meaning in interaction and others working on the impact of
interaction on language structure. The two constituencies share an interest in
the manner in which meaning is co-constructed and negotiated between
interactants, thus leading to a form/function reconfiguration. The complexities
of the interpretation of meaning can be more acute in intercultural encounters.
The conference thus extends its scope to include the relatively new
sub-discipline of intercultural pragmatics. It is timely in reflecting a rising
interest, across a number of fields, in issues in interpreting meaning.

Key note speakers
We are pleased to announce 
Professor Janet Holmes, Victoria University of Wellington, NZ, 
Professor Elizabeth Traugott, Stanford University, USA,
Dr Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini, University of Nottingham Trent,
Dr Helen Spencer-Oatey, University of Warwick,
Dr Véronique Traverso, Université de Lyon 
as this year's invited plenary speakers.


Papers are invited which draw on empirical data to elucidate the relationship
between function and form, as it is played out in interactions.

The conference covers but is not limited to the following key topics:
- Discourse in professional contexts 
- From Synchrony to Diachrony: context bound interpretation of interaction and
form/function shifts 
- Intercultural Pragmatics 
- Issues and Methodologies in Interpreting Meaning. 
- Corpus-based Research

The conference will host two colloquia on: 
- Workplace Discourse 
- Meaning in Diachrony

Abstracts of no more than 250 words (max and including references, if necessary)
are invited. The deadline for receipt of abstracts is the 05th January 2009.
Abstracts should not include the name and affiliation of the author(s). Further
details and a submission form will be published on the i-Mean website soon and
details will be circulated. Abstracts should be sent to imean@uwe.ac.uk

A separate call for papers will be circulated for the two colloquia shortly 

Please note that no late submissions will be accepted and all submissions will
be peer-reviewed. 
Authors will be notified of acceptance by 02 February 2009 
Registration and Accommodation details will be circulated in November 2008 

We look forward to seeing you at i-mean@uwe 2009 
For further information please contact Dr Jo Angouri (Jo.Angouri@uwe.ac.uk), Dr
Kate Beeching (Kate.Beeching@uwe.ac.uk )

Location: Berkeley, California, USA 
Contact Person: Eve Sweetser

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

ICLC is the conference of the International Cognitive Linguistics Association. 
It takes place every two years and welcomes submissions on a wide range of

Call for Papers


Call for Papers and extension of Call for Theme Sessions
ICLC 11 - July 28-Aug 3, 2009
Abstracts due by November 15, 2008

The International Cognitive Linguistics Association solicits papers for the 11th
International Cognitive Linguistics Conference, to be held July 28-Aug 3, 2009
at the University of California, Berkeley.

The ICLC is open to presentations on a broad range of topics relating to
cognitive linguistics.  We invite proposals on subjects including but not
limited to: cognitive and linguistic categorization, polysemy, syntax and
semantics of grammatical constructions, frame semantics, mental spaces theory,
metaphor, metonymy, crosslinguistic comparison and typology, cognitive
approaches to narrative and literary texts.  We would be happy to see proposals
which break down boundaries between lab research and corpus/literary language
research, or between research on visual/gestural and auditory modalities of
communication, or between lab or field work and historical linguistics or
sociolinguistics.  Questions and correspondence may be addressed to Eve
Sweetser, Chair of the Organizing Committee, at sweetser@berkeley.edu. 
Abstracts should be filed on the website (see below).

Abstracts should be no more than 500 words, but may also include an added page
of data or examples.  

Abstracts should be filed by Nov. 15, 2008 on the ICLC 2009 website, which may
be found at <http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~iclc> or via a link from the main
International Cognitive Linguistics Association website.

Abstract-writers should also indicate whether they would be willing to be
considered for a Poster Session, as well as for the General Session.  Anonymous
reviewers will not be aware of this notation as they rate papers; however, the
organizers will use this notation to give added consideration to some papers
which may not be able to be fitted into the General Session.


Theme Sessions

We point out that for this conference, all Theme Session paper abstracts will
also have to pass the general anonymous abstract review process for conference
papers.  This is to make sure that each paper gets the same chances, whether
part of a Theme Session or not.  We recognize that some excellent Theme Sessions
may be shortened if not all the proposed individual papers are accepted, but on
the other hand, if that happens then there will be room for more General Session
papers.
Therefore, all theme session paper authors must also individually submit
abstracts to the regular abstract competition; when you submit the abstract, you
will be asked whether you belong to a proposed Theme Session group, and if so
which one.   
 
Extension of Call for Theme Sessions.

Because all Theme Session abstracts will need to undergo the general anonymous
abstract review, we are extending the Call for Theme Sessions.  We are grateful
to those who have already submitted Theme Session proposals - the accepted Theme
Sessions will be announced after the paper referee process.  
The organizers are still willing to accept Theme Session proposals (which should
include the abstracts for the papers, as well as a 1,000-word description of the
theme session) up until October 31, 2008.
