Meeting Description:
The Second Language Research Forum (SLRF) is a prestigious and internationally
renowned conference which brings together researchers in second language (L2)
research from all over the world. It is the premier conference on L2 research in
North America providing a venue for established scholars and graduate students
to present work on a wide variety of theoretical and empirical issues.

'Exploring SLA: Perspectives, Positions, and Practices'  
Through this year's theme, we investigate various professional interests and
practices of the field of Second Language Acquisition. The overall purpose of
SLRF 2008 is to integrate an array of ideas about SLA research, ethics, and
practice, from across multiple approaches. We solicit papers, posters, and
colloquia that consider SLA from a range of theoretical, methodological,
linguistic, practical, political, historical, and disciplinary perspectives, and
encourage submissions that deepen and broaden our understandings and inform the
quality and application of SLA research. 

Call Deadline: April 15, 2008
Notification of Acceptance: Mid-May

The Second Language Research Forum at the University of Hawai'i seeks proposals
for paper, poster, and colloquia presentations for the 2008 conference in Hawaii. 

We ask that all abstracts be submitted online at
http://www.nflrc.hawaii.edu/slrf08/. Proposals will not be accepted via email or
post. All abstracts will be submitted to blind peer review by international
experts on the topic.

Papers and Posters:
Individual papers will be allotted 20 minutes (plus 10 minutes for discussion).
Posters will be displayed for a full day. Posters are intended for one-on-one
discussion or reports of work in progress. Authors must be present to respond to
questions from attendees during the allocated time.

Abstracts are limited to 300 words. The title should be no longer than 12 words.
Also include a 50-word summary of your presentation to be published in the
conference program. Only one abstract submission per person, but you may
co-author on others. See the website for details on how to prepare for your
online proposal submission. 

Colloqiua:
The Colloquia consist of individual paper presentations that relate to a
specific or related topics of interest. They are offered in 2-hour sessions, and
we suggest 20-minutes for each paper (plus 5-10 minutes for discussion),
depending on the number of presenters.

Each colloquia session will have an organizer and a chair (i.e. discussant).
Details on the organizer and the chair should be included in the submission; the
organizer and the chair can be the same person. The organizer is responsible for
securing the cooperation of all the presenters before the abstract is submitted
online. The chair of each colloquium is the person responsible for managing the
session and the format and content of colloquia submissions.

Proposals for colloquia will include a summary of all studies with a clearly
defined common theme. The colloquium abstract as well as its individual paper
abstracts should be limited to 300 words each. Sufficient detail should be
provided to allow peer reviewers to judge the merit of the proposal. 50-word
summaries for the colloquium as well as its individual papers should also be
included. All titles should be no longer than 12 words. See the website for
details on how to prepare for your online proposal submission. 

For any proposal submission questions, please contact the SLRF 2008
Program Chairs at slrf2008program@gmail.com.

perspective. 

Call For Papers

Workshop:
Language and Sexuality (Through and) Beyond Gender: Anthrolinguistic Perspectives

Saturday 7 June 2008 
Department of Social Anthropology and History University of The Aegean Mytilene
 
Information:
Costas Canakis, c.canakis@sa.aegean.gr Graduate Program Secretary,
gender@sa.aegean.gr 

Setting the Scene: 
Given that "language plays a crucial role in shaping human sexuality and in
mediating its various expressions" talking about sex "is not so much a
'displacement of sexual energies' as it is a means for giving those energies
direction, shape and form" (Cameron & Kulick 2006: 1). The goal of this workshop
is to examine the linguistic manifestation of sexuality and to investigate the
linguistic construction of gendered "identity" through the interplay of gender
and sexuality, given the multiple indexical relations holding among language,
sexuality, and gender (cf. Ochs 1986, 1990, 1992, Giannakopoulos 2001, 2006,
Canakis 2007 & in press, Athanasiou 2006). These issues call not only for a
multi-disciplinary, but indeed for an inter-disciplinary approach, visualized as
a getting together of linguistics and the social sciences. For the purposes of
this workshop, the relation between language and sexuality is
understood--following Cameron & Kulick (2006)--as an examination of the role
played by language in constituting sexuality as human experience. Moreover,
while a theoretical distinction is drawn between "sexuality" and "sexual
identity", both fall within the scope of this workshop. As there is no precedent
in Greece, the workshop will, hopefully, cover a research gap. 

More Specifically: 
We invite papers dealing with 
a. the indexical relation of language and gender vis-à-vis the indexical
relation between gender and sexuality; 
b. the relation of language and sexuality as mediated, for political and other
reasons, by gender (as a notion which is not explicitly tabooed); 
c. the relation of sexuality and identity; 
d. the relation of sexuality and desire, etc. 
Pivotal to such an endeavour are the notions of deixis and indexicality as
developed in philosophy, linguistics, and the social sciences at large: cf. the
notion of symbolic mediation which is the basic--and, perhaps, the only
non-negotiable--point of contact between linguistics and the social sciences.
Given that linguistic communication is based on the indexical character of
linguistic expressions (which tend to have numerous and only partly predictable
meanings when not bound contextually), indexicality has to do with all of
linguistic practice. Therefore, the analysis of linguistic practice with a focus
on sexuality (and gender) is in order if we want to realize the ways in which
these interact; and more specifically: a. why and how people encode sexuality
or/and sexual identity linguistically (cf. Kiessling 2002) and b. how sexual
discourse is constituted (cf. indicatively, van Dijk 1997, 1998, Kantsa 2000,
Pavlidou 2002, Makri-Tsilipakou in press, Canakis 2007 & in press). 

This meeting can also function as a step towards the research of sexuality
through specific and socially positioned "masculinities" and "femininities",
among other things. Therefore, papers should adhere to the well-known
exhortation "think preactically and look locally" (Eckert & McConnell-Ginet
1992). The ultimate goal is to show that the linguistic expression of sexuality
(including selective abstinence of such expression; cf. Kantsa 2000) is a valid
agenda for linguistic research.

Despite earlier voices which have urged us to dissociate gender from sexuality,
in an attempt to circumvent heteronormativity and heterosexism, it becomes
increasingly apparent that gendered language is, among other things, sexed
language and language of desire (Kristeva 1980, Kulick 2000, Valentine 2003) and
it, most often, has to do with eroticizing the same or the opposite sex (i.e.,
its prototypical characteristics as represented in collective social cognition).
Practically, this means that while the two notions are not to be fused, the
study of gendered linguistic identities is incomplete without the investigation
of desires. 

Indicative Thematic Units: 
1. theoretical approaches to the linguistic study of sexuality: 
    a. sexuality as identity 
    b. sexuality as desire; 
2. language and sexuality from the perspective of gender; 
3. language and sexuality from the perspective of queer theory. 

Important Dates: 
Abstract submission deadline: 15 March 2008
Notification of acceptance: till 15 April 2008
Workshop date: Saturday, 7 June 2008 

Submission of Abstracts: 
Anonymous abstracts should be written in Greek or English using Times New Roman
font point 12 and should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references which, in
turn, should not exceed one page). Abstracts are to be submitted electronically
to c.canakis@sa.aegean.gr & gender@sa.aegean.gr no later than 15 March 2008 in a
single message featuring two attached documents: one including the anonymous
abstract (to be forwarded to the selection committee) and another featuring the
abstract and your name and affiliation centered under the title (for the printed
book of abstracts). 

The languages of the workshop will be Greek and English. 

Submission of Papers for Electronic Publication: 
The papers may be submitted for electronic publication until 30 June 2008
