2nd Call for Papers

Workshop Topics
This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes of
evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and applications of "deep" grammars to real-world
domains and NLP tasks.

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to support
robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world domains and
applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in significant
advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic
approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The
effective acquisition, development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a
central issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars
makes these tasks extremely challenging; indeed, these tasks are often tackled
in ways that have much in common with software engineering. 

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
- for example LFG, HPSG, TAG, CCG, dependency grammar - to compare their
research and methodologies.

The workshop will solicit submissions for papers on the following themes:

1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages;

2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks in promoting or inhibiting modularity;

3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multi-developer
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis;

4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on how to
present grammar engineering work to other research communities;

5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars.

6. Multilingualism: Approaches, techniques and tools improving development and
maintainability of grammars for multiple system languages.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
