Workshop on Different Kinds of Specificity Across Languages

Berlin, Germany
July 6-7, 2007

Workshop Description
The workshop aims at bringing together researchers working on theoretical
and empirical aspects of specificity. The notion of specificity is an
intensively investigated and debated topic and there are many very
different conceptions of specificity around: it has been proposed that
specificity should be captured by a notion of speaker's reference (Fodor
and Sag 1982), that it has to be linked to the notion of
presuppositionality or familiarity (Enç 1991), and that it is simply a
matter of scope (Quine 1956). These different conceptions have lead to
quite diverse formalisations. Furthermore, the interconnection of
topicality and specificity has often been addressed (e.g. Cresti 1995), but
the role that information structure plays for the notion of specificity is
still not well understood.

On the empirical side, there has been intensive research on the detection
and examination of specificity markers in different languages. However,
what has been less acknowledged so far is the fact that there are vast
differences among specificity markers - across languages and within one
language. What is usually regarded as specific indefinites is by no means a
homogeneous class. Different kinds of specific indefinites behave
differently in a number of respects: whether they have to be given/familiar
or unique, whether some kind of speaker-hearer-asymmetry for referent
identification is involved, what scope they take in the context of other
quantifiers, negation, attitude verbs, and intensional/modal operators.
Little attention has been paid to these unexpected differences so far (but
important first steps have been made in Prince 1981, Ionin 2006 on
indefinite 'this' vs. 'a certain' or Schwarz 2001, Farkas 2002 on 'some'
vs. 'a certain' and others).

This workshop is designed to close these gaps. We aim at bringing different
theoretical strands together thus furthering fruitful discussion. We invite
talks that further our theoretical understanding of specificity, for
instance by discussing differences among specific indefinites within one
language as well as by presenting and investigating more of these 'funny
indefinites' cross-linguistically. Furthermore, we would like to learn more
about the connection of specificity and  information structure and
topicality in particular.
