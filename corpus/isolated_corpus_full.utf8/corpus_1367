Call Deadline: 25-Jul-2007 

Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Identity, Authenticity, Locality, Urbanity and Speech Community: A
New Sociolinguistic Perspective' will be held at the upcoming INST- conference
on the theme 'Knowledge, Creativity and Transformations of Societies (KCTOS)' 
in Vienna, 6th-9th December 2007.  
The workshop aims to discuss the effect of globalization on the perception of
identity, authenticity, urban and local transformations and speech community in
the context of sociolinguistics. 
Send abstracts to 
meryem.sen@isbank.net.tr  
imrankarabag@kou.edu.tr

Deadline: July 25th, 2007. 

Papers of quantitative and qualitative perspectives with the related issue are
welcome. 

'Identity, Authenticity, Locality, Urbanity and Speech Community: A New
Sociolinguistic Perspective'
We live in an age of globalization, which presupposes deep transformations in
the life of world societies. This is indeed a challenge to them as they are
societies of a common culture with a standardized language, and embodied in
common economic, political, and educational institutions. This is a functional
requirement of a modern economy, with its need for a mobile, educated, and
literate work-force. Citizens in such modern societies display the sort of
solidarity essential with a strong sense of common identity and common
membership. However, it is impossible to keep away from the world surrounding
effects of globalization. Like in many other fields of life linguistic behavior
and stance could not have stayed neutral to this challenging stimulation. Thus,
a new sociolinguistic perspective of globalization that requires a close
observation of urban and local transformations in order to understand the
sociolinguistic phenomenon can provide reevaluation of local and urban events
beyond their own linguistic borders.
Within this frame we would like to discuss identity, authenticity, urban and
local transformations and speech community. Besides, understanding the effect of
globalization on perception of the other (othering) and sense of belonging or
alienation are also of concern to us in this specific debate. All in all, it is
expected to find answers to the following questions:
1. Is globalization a threat to national languages or not? 
2. What does globalization serve for in the context of language and culture? 
3. Would regional languages and variations be able to keep their presence in the
globalized world or not? 

Papers with close concerns with the above topics providing quantitative and
qualitative approaches are invited.
 
NB: Papers will be published in TRANS 17 (http://www.inst.at/trans/index.htm). 
Selected papers will be published as a book.

Send abstracts to Meryem Sen meryem.sen@isbank.net.tr by July 25th, 2007.
