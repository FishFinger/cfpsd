Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Linguistic Theories; Morphology;

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 2nd Graz Conference on Reduplication aims to discuss reduplication with a
special focus on diachrony and productivity within a typological perspective. 

Due to the developments of phonological and morphological theories, the
discussion of reduplication has attracted the attention of scholars, and the
number of publications on the topic has increased considerably. However, the
majority of these studies had approached the issue from a theory-centric point
of view, and substantial problems had been subordinated to theoretical issues.
Thus, the First Graz Conference on Reduplication, which was held in November
2002, was dedicated to discuss the issue in various aspects with a focus on
empirical evidence, and the papers were published in Studies on Reduplication
(Hurch ed., 2005). 

What still needs clarification is historical and comparative aspects of
reduplication. Moreover, we are deeply convinced that any synchronic theory on
reduplication, as on any other phenomena, is valid only if it includes or
conveys an explanation of diachronic change. Therefore, the Second Graz
Conference on Reduplication aims to further discuss reduplication with a special
focus on diachrony and productivity within a typological perspective. 

Invited speakers are: 
   Henning Andersen (University of California Los Angeles, USA)
   Hans den Besten (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
   Nick Evans (University of Melbourne, Australia)
   Larry Hyman (University of California Berkeley, USA)
   Laurie Reid (University of Hawaii, USA)

Please submit an abstract in the following format: 
1.	maximum of 3 pages 
2.	in English 
3.	with the title of the paper 
4.	anonymous 

Please email the abstract in plain text or PDF to reduplication@ling.uni-graz.at. 

In the body of email text, please include: 
1.	title of the paper 
2.	author's name 
3.	author's affiliation 
4.	email address and other contact information 

The submission deadline is February 28, 2007. Notification of acceptance will be
emailed by March 31, 2007. The length of each presentation is 40 minutes (time
for discussion included). The conference language is English.
