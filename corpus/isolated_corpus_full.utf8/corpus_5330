For now about two decades, the biennial International Symposium on Chinese 
Languages and Linguistics (IsCLL) has become a major academic event for the 
small but lively linguistic community of Taiwan. The upcoming twelfth 
symposium (IsCLL-12) scheduled for June 19-21, 2010 and jointly hosted by the 
Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica and the Linguistics Society of 
Taiwan will feature 'Complex Predicates' as its theme. 

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (20 minute presentation + 10 minute 
question-and-answer period) on any aspect pertaining to theoretical and 
descriptive studies on the languages of China, with preference given to issues 
dealing with 'complex predicates'.

Contributors are limited to only one singly-authored and one jointly-authored 
abstract. Abstracts should be anonymous and about 2 to 3 pages of length, 
including references. A separate page should contain the following 
information: 1. paper title; 2. name(s) of author(s); 3. affiliation(s) of 
author(s); 4. e-mail address. 

All files should be submitted in a pdf format. Non-standard fonts should be 
avoided wherever possible, and if necessary should be embedded in the pdf 
document. 

Abstracts are to be submitted via e-mail at iscll@sinica.edu.tw with the e-
mail title: 'name of the author: IsCCL-12'. The deadline for abstract(s) 
submission is December 15, 2009. Authors will be notified of the results of 
their abstract review by March 15, 2010. Note that only abstracts e-mailed 
before the final deadline and only those following the guidelines specified 
above will be considered for review. Upon acceptance of their abstracts, 
authors are committed to present original papers written exclusively for IsCCL-
12. Full papers should be received by May 15, 2010.
