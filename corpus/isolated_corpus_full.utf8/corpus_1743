This will be the fourth biennial Conference on the Reclamation of Indigenous
Languages hosted by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. Our conference series
serves to bring together those who work to maintain and reclaim the indigenous
languages of Native North America. We believe that our ancestral languages can
and should be spoken in our communities and we continuously seek and support
efforts toward this end. The conference planning committee, in their selection
of presenters strives to balance linguistic research, instructional techniques,
technological innovations and most recently, indigenous languages in the context
of the visual, written and performing arts.

We invite you to share your work and in so doing, further efforts to reclaim,
perpetuate and celebrate Native North America's unique and precious languages of
heritage.

Conference Topics:

A. Instructional Techniques, such as those that focus on producing first and
second language speakers, workbooks, CDs, computer-interactive programs, videos,
TPR, the Silent Way, Immersion Nests, etc.

B. Artistic Application of Language, such as storytelling, performing artists,
authors and playwrights for all age groups, visual artists, etc.

C. Linguistics in the Context of Language Preservation and Reconstruction, such
as historical linguistics of Native - North America, preferably but not limited
to Algonquian languages and those of Southern New England. Papers addressing
methodologies and sources used in preservation and reclamation projects as well
as place-names' analyses sought.

D. Technological Innovations in the areas of language documentation, databases
and dictionary software, educational and instructional software, etc.
