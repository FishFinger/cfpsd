Location: Osnabrueck, Germany 
Contact Person: Carla Umbach
Meeting Email: comparison@cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Psycholinguistics; Semantics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2008 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is part of the 31. annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS). We would like to address the question of what
strategies there are in natural languages to express comparison, how theses
strategies can be modeled, and how these strategies relate to the findings from
Cognitive Psychology. We are interested in semantic/pragmatic approaches as well
as contrastive/typological studies and, in particular, contributions from
Cognitive Psychology. 

Final Call for Papers 

''Comparison constructions and similarity-based classification''

Workshop at the 31. annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS), 4.- 6. March, 2009, Osnabrück

Deadline for abstract submission: July 31, 2008

Workshop description and details of abstract submission can be found at:

Full Title: Applied Natural Language Processing Special Track 

Date: 19-May-2009 - 21-May-2009
Location: Sanibel, Florida, USA 
Contact Person: Scott Crossley
Meeting Email: sc544@msstate.edu
Web Site: http://www.msstate.edu/dept/english/applied_nlp/flairs_2009 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Computational Linguistics;
Neurolinguistics; Semantics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 23-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

The track of Applied Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers
working in natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL),
applied linguistics (AL) and related areas. 

Call for Papers

Goal:
NLP/CL developments in fields such as textual studies, speech recognition,
speech production, data mining and numerous other fields have led to a rapid
growth in interest in tools able to understand, organize, and extract
information from natural language sources. This interest includes the analysis
of online materials, most of them in textual form or text combined with other
media (visual, audio), the use of innovative human-computer interfaces, such as
interactive agents, which benefit from language understanding, and the use of
computational tools to facilitate intelligent tutoring systems and instructional
methodology. In addition, natural language processing can facilitate
human-computer interaction for people with special needs, assist in the
organization of classification systems, and coordinate text segmentation.
 
Papers and contributions on all issues are very much welcome, but the track
emphasizes and encourages submissions that present actual applications that can
benefit from or have an impact on NLP/CL.

General Topics:
We invite original papers (i.e. work not previously submitted, in submission, or
to be submitted to another conference during the reviewing process) that
describe work in, but not limited to, the following areas:
1. Paraphrase or Entailment evaluation approaches
2. Textual assessment indices 
3. NL-based Knowledge Representations and Systems
4. Coreference Resolution 
5. Word Sense Disambiguation 
6. Text Cohesion and Coherence 
7. Dialogue Management and Systems 
8. Language Generation 
9. Language Models 
10. Human Computer Interfaces - in particular, multimodal human-computer
communication and language as the only acceptable human-computer communication
channel for the handicapped and elderly 
11. Machine Learning applied to NL problems 
12. Multilingual Processing 
13. Standardization, Language Resources, Corpora Building, and Annotation Languages 
14. NL in Learning Environments 
15. Semantic Web, Ontologies, Reasoning 
16. Applications: Machine Translation, Summarization, Intelligent Tutoring,
Question Answering, Information Extraction, etc. 
17. Syntax 
18. Semantics 
19. Applied Linguistics and First and Second Language Acquisition
20. English for Specific Purposes
21. Others
22. The special topic: The User-Language Paraphrase Challenge

Special Topic:
This year, the ANLP track features a special topic, which is in addition to
general topics for the track. The special topic is the User-Language Paraphrase
Challenge. 

We are pleased to introduce the User-Language Paraphrase Challenge. We use the
term User-Language to refer to the natural language input of users interacting
with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The primary characteristics of
user-language are that it is short (typically a single sentence) and that it is
unedited (e.g., it is replete with typographical errors and lacking in
grammaticality). We use the term paraphrase to refer to ITS users' attempt to
restate a given target sentence in their own words such that a produced
sentence, or user response, has the same meaning as the target sentence. The
corpus in this challenge comprises 1998 target-sentence/student response
text-pairs, or protocols. The protocols have been evaluated by expert human
raters along 10 dimensions of paraphrase characteristics. Along with the
protocols, the database comprising the challenge includes 10 computational
indices that have been used to assess these protocols. The challenge we pose for
researchers is to describe and assess their own approach (computational or
statistical) to evaluating, characterizing, and/or categorizing, any, some, or
all of the paraphrase dimensions in this corpus. The purpose of establishing
such evaluations of user-language paraphrases is so that ITSs may provide users
with accurate assessment and subsequently facilitative feedback, such that the
assessment would be comparable to one or more trained human raters.  As such,
these evaluations will help to develop the field of natural language assessment
and understanding. For full details of the challenge and all data go to:
http://csep.psyc.memphis.edu/mcnamara/link.htm and click on User Language
Paraphrase Corpus.

Submission Guidelines for the ANLP track:
Interested authors (for the general ANLP track or the special topic) should
format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The papers should
be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to another
conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages and are due by
November 23rd, 2008. For FLAIRS-22, the 2009 conference, the reviewing is a
double blind process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on
submitted papers to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be submitted as
PDF through the EasyChair conference system. (n.b. Do not use a fake name for
your EasyChair login - your EasyChair account information is hidden from
reviewers). Authors should indicate the special track of ANLP for submissions.
All submissions will be done electronically via the FLAIRS web submission system
available through the paper submission site at http://www.easychair.org/FLAIRS-22/ 
Please, check the website http://www.flairs-22.info/ for information regarding
submission.

Conference Proceedings:
Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press.
