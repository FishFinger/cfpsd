Meeting Description

Each year, the graduate students of the Department of German and Dutch at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, organize an annual conference on German and
Dutch Studies. Graduate students from the United States and universities
worldwide present papers and participate in discussions in their field of
interest. We would like to invite you to participate in the Tenth Annual
Graduate Student Conference to be held March 28th and 29th, 2008 at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison. The topic for this year is 'Recognizing
(Dis)Order'. We encourage all graduate students to attend the conference and
participate in the academic sessions as well as social events. Our hope is that,
as in past years, this will be an opportunity for exchanging ideas and
networking with colleagues in a friendly atmosphere. 

10th Annual Graduate Student Conference

Spring 2008

Recognizing (Dis)Order

"Aufgabe von Kunst heute ist es, Chaos in die Ordnung zu bringen''
-Th. W. Adorno, "Minima Moralia''

Ist alles in Ordnung? Muss Ordnung sein? Herrscht hier Ordnung? Erhält Ordnung
die Welt? In the 10th Annual Graduate Student Conference of the German and Dutch
Graduate Students' Association at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we will
explore the concept of order and its inevitable subversion and disruption in
German and Dutch literature, culture and language. How is structure conceived
of, implemented, and regulated? How do individuals negotiate between conformity,
resistance and rebellion in both the private and the public sphere? How does the
concept of order regulate literary and artistic production? How do we approach
and receive the apparent order in texts? How is language structured, regulated
and changed?

Reflecting the diverse research interests of the Department of German, this
conference will feature panels on literature, cultural studies, linguistics and
Second Language Acquisition.  

We will consider abstracts dealing with the concept of order in all areas of
Germanic linguistics, including phonetics, syntax, morphology, and socio- and
historical linguistics. Possible topics might address:

Prescriptive and descriptive grammars
Word order and syntax
Learner resistance and curriculum issues
Language contact and koinés

Abstracts on literary and cultural topics may include but are not limited to the
following themes:

1) Individual measure, moderation and excess
(Dis)orderly bodies and minds
Ostracism, exclusion, crisis (Nachdenken über Christa T. by Ch. Wolf)
The gendered body and mind
Repression, digression, psychosis
Family politics (Das Muschelessen by Birgit Vanderbeke)
The invention and performance of tradition

2) Revolution, war and peace
Class conflict and social hierarchy (Kabale und Liebe by F. Schiller)
Defining utopia vs. dystopia 
Social upheaval and times of political instability
Representations of natural and/or man-made disasters (Der Schimmelreiter by T.
Storm) 
Germany's place in the world 

3) Structuring narrative:
Textual order and narrative disruption
Ordering of time and space (Das Ornament der Masse by S. Kracauer)
Narratological hierarchies and taxonomies
Rephrasing genre (fairy tales, detective literature, the Bildungsroman, etc.)
	
Abstracts of no more than 250 words must be received by January 4, 2008.
Submissions should not bear the author's name. Please include the following
information as a separate attachment: name, title of paper, department and
university affiliation if applicable, and reliable contact information. Papers
should not exceed 20 minutes in length (8-10 pages) to allow for 10 minutes of
discussion after your presentation. Pending availability, some travel funds may
be available, but participants are strongly encouraged to seek support from
their home institutions.

Final Call for Papers

CUNY Phonology Forum Conference on the Syllable

We invite papers from any subdivision of cognitive science such as formal
linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, philosophy, psychology,
etc. We also encourage diversity in methods so we welcome both formal and
experimental approaches to the topic of syllables.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to throw the field of discussion to all matters related
to the syllable in phonology or phonetics.

Do syllables exist?

Are syllables derived? Is syllable structure ever lexically distinctive?

What is the internal structure of the syllable?

Are syllables hierarchically dominated by other prosodic categories?

What principles guide the syllabification of a string of phonemes?

What aspects of syllables are referred to by morphological and phonological
rules/constraints?

How do phonetic syllables relate to phonological syllables (and vice versa)?

What is the role of sonority for syllables?

Invited Speakers:
Harry van der Hulst, University of Connecticut
Paul Kiparsky, Stanford University
Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, MIT
Donca Steriade, MIT
Bert Vaux, University of Cambridge

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts should consist of a one page description of the paper (12pt font) with
a second page for references, data and/or illustrations. Talks will be 20
minutes with 10 minutes for discussion. Abstracts should be emailed as an
attachment (PDF format) to syllable@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than
midnight, November 10, 2007. Authors should include title of the paper, name of
the author(s) and affiliation in the body of the email.
