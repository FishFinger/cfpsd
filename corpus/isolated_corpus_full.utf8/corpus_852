Full Title: From Computational Linguistics to Computational Humour 
Short Title: CLIP-2007 

Date: 07-Jul-2007 - 10-Jul-2007
Location: Camogli, Italy 
Contact Person: Stefano Rovetta
Meeting Email: rovetta@disi.unige.it
Web Site: http://clip.disi.unige.it/clip2007 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description:

The CLIP workshop focuses on computational linguistics in cross-language
contexts. The 2007 edition will also be devoted to making sense out of texts
processing their semantics, sentiments, emotions and humour taking into account the affective weight of lexicon.

Language technologies have steadily evolved in recent years. However the issue
of language diversity has not been addressed to a similar extent as other
aspects. Indeed, many socio-economical environments, of which the European Union is a prominent example, are inherently based on cultural diversity. Therefore solving multilingual issues is central to the development of the Information Society in the EU. On the other hand, this is true in many other instances (we may recall the case of India with more than 20 official languages and several more idioms actually spoken). This means that this topic is of strong European interest, but has a global relevance.

The final aim of the event is to bring together researchers with different
backgrounds to encourage a cross-disciplinary discussion in the computational
linguistics field making emphasis also on recent computational trends such as
sentiment analysis and automatic humour recognition, the topic of the invited talk.

Topics:

Submissions are welcome in areas of computational linguistics with an emphasis on the multilingual aspect as well as on new trends such as new trends such as automatic sentiment, emotion and humour recognition.

- Ontologies in linguistics
- Text classification and clustering
- Text mining
- Text summarisation
- Question answering
- Word sense disambiguation
- Sentiment analysis
- Computational humour 

Workshop Format and Paper Submission

Submit an extended abstract by e-mail directly to the chair (see below, and note the anti-spam format) by December 15, 2006.

Submitted papers will be judged based on relevance to the cross-disciplinary
dissemination, novelty of the idea, technical quality, clarity of presentation,
and expected impact on future research within the area of focus.

CLIP-2007 will be a special session within the WILF2007 workshop, Hotel
Portofino Kulm, Portofino Vetta - Ruta di Camogli, Genova (Italy), July 7-10, 2007.

Registration to WILF2007 will be required for participation, so perspective
participants are invited to refer to the main conference website:
http://wilf2007.disi.unige.it/ for all details not covered in the present call.

Invited talk:

Rada Mihalcea (http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/) on automatic humour recognition.

Important Dates:

Preliminary submission (abstract): December 15th 2006.

Other deadlines are the same as WILF2007:
Paper submission deadline: Jan 31 2007
Notification of acceptance:Feb 28 2007
Final Paper Submission deadline: Mar 31 2007
