Meeting Description:

Workshop on the Divison of Labour between Morphology and Phonology 

Call for Papers

For many grammatical processes it remains highly controversial whether they are
primarily phonological or morphological in nature. A notorious case is
reduplication which is analyzed as a basically phonological phenomenon in most
optimality-theoretic analysis (McCarthy & Prince, 1994, 1995), but treated as
morphological readjustment by representation-based frameworks (Raimy, 2000;
Nevins, 2005; Frampton, in press). Under closer inspection, both types of
approach employ phonological and morphological mechanisms although to different
degrees and in different modes of interaction. The crucial problem is therefore
not so much an all-or-nothing assignment of work to phonology or morphology, but
the division of labour. This point becomes even clearer in the approach of
Inkelas and Zoll (2006) where the copying part of most reduplication processes
is purely morphological while templatic effects are the result of
(morphologically conditioned) phonology.

The goal of this workshop is to discuss the division of labour among morphology
and phonology in any relevant grammatical phenomena. We invite contributions in
any grammatical framework which address this problem under theoretical or
empirical aspects, and also welcome presentations on typological and diachronic
aspects. Relevant phenomena include, but are not restricted to:

- Allomorphy: Phonologically triggered suppletive allomorphy has been analyzed
as phonological selection of alternants provided by morphology (Kager, 1996;
Joan Mascaró, 1996; Rubach & Booij,2001) or as morphological subcategorization
which has access to phonological information (Paster, 2005a; see also Bye, 2006).
- Morpheme-specific Alternations: Captured recently by phonological constraints
(Pater, to appear) or grammars (Inkelas & Zoll, 2006)
- Infixation: reduced to phonological metathesis in McCarthy & Prince (1993),
but claimed to be morphological in Yu (2003)
- Morphological Blocking: usually assumed to be purely morphological, but
partially or entirely reimplemented by phonological mechanisms in Kurisu (2001)
and Müller (2007)
- Mutation and Umlaut: Competing phonological (Wolf, 2006; Svenonius 2006),
morphological (Green, 2003) and mixed (Wiese, 1996) analyses
- Affix order: Affix order seems to be generally insensitive to phonology
(Paster, 2005a), but Noyer (1994) discusses a case where affixal orientation
seems to be governed by phonology

The workshop will take place as a single joint event together with the fourth
meeting of the Network Core Mechanisms of Exponence. Presentations will be
alloted 40 minutes (including discussion).

Abstracts must be anonymous, at most one page long (with an optional second page
for data and references), and should be sent as a pdf attachment to:
