Meeting Description:

Coling 2008 workshop on human judgements in Computational Linguistics

Manchester, UK
23 or 24 August 2008 (to be determined)

http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/hjcl/ 

Call for Papers

Human judgements play a key role in the development and the assessment of
linguistic resources and methods in Computational Linguistics. They are commonly
used in the creation of lexical resources and corpus annotation, and also in the
evaluation of automatic approaches to linguistic tasks. Furthermore,
systematically collected human judgements provide clues for research on
linguistic issues that underlie the judgement task, providing insights
complementary to introspective analysis or evidence gathered from corpora.

We invite papers about experiments that collect human judgements for
Computational Linguistic purposes, with a particular focus on linguistic tasks
that are controversial from a theoretical point of view (e.g., some coding tasks
having to do with semantics or pragmatics). Such experimental tasks are usually
difficult to design and interpret, and they typically result in mediocre
inter-rater reliability. We seek both broad methodological papers discussing
these issues, and specific case studies.

Topic of interest include, but are not limited to:
1. Experimental design:
- Which types of experiments support the collection of human judgements? Can any
general guidelines be defined? Is there a preference between lab-based
experiments and web-based experiments?
- Which experimental methodologies support controversial tasks? For instance,
does underspecification help? What is the role of ambiguity and polysemy in
these tasks?
- What is the appropriate level of granularity for the category labels?
- What kind of participants should be used (e.g., expert vs. non-expert), how is
it affected by the type of experiment, and how should the experiment design be
varied according to this issue?
- How much and which kind of information (examples, context, etc.) should be
provided to the experiment participants? When does information turn into a bias?
- Is it possible to design experiments that are useful for both computational
linguistics and psycholinguistics? What do the two research areas have in
common? What are the differences?

2. Analysis and interpretation of experimental data:
- How important is inter-annotator agreement in human judgement collection
experiments? How is it best measured for complex tasks?
- What other quantitative tools are useful for analysing human judgement
collection experiments?
- What qualitative methods are useful for analysing human judgement collection
experiments? Which questions should be asked? Is it possible to formulate
general guidelines?
- How is the analysis similar to psycholinguistic analysis? How is it different?
- How do results from all of the methods above affect the development of
annotation instructions and procedures?

3. Application of experiment insights:
- How do the experimental data fit into the general resource-creating process?
- How to modify the set of labels and the criteria or guidelines for the
annotation task according to the experimental results? How to avoid circularity
in this process?
- How can the data be used to refine or modify existing theoretical proposals?
- More generally, under what conditions can the obtained judgements be applied
to research questions?

Last Call for Papers

Fifth North American Phonology Conference

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008

Invited Speakers:

David Odden, Ohio State
Bridget Samuels, Harvard

Recent work in phonology has met with a number of recalcitrant problems.

1. Probabilistic and exemplar-based models of phonological learning and
phonological computation have failed to deal with the same conceptual and
empirical challenges that led to the demise of their empiricist, behaviorist
forebears.

2. Objections against the computational complexity associated with derivations
with multiple levels of representation have turned out to have been
ill-grounded, and stubborn problems of analysis have forced 'two-level'
theorists to allow complex derivations to sneak back in, as in the Stratal,
Harmonic Serialism and Candidate Chains models of recent work in Optimality Theory.

3. The grounding of constraints in markedness 'theory' remains an elusive goal
that fails on both logical and empirical grounds to provide explanations.

In this context, we invite papers on the prospects of future research in Good
Old Fashioned Phonology (GOFP, an adaptation of Haugeland's Good Old Fashioned
Artificial Intelligence). That is, we propose an exploration of phonology as a
substance-free, symbolic computation system. Papers critiquing GOFP are also
very welcome.

A substance-free theory considers the formal properties of a grammar without
regard for transduction between symbols in the grammar and the input and output
systems involved in language acquisition and use. Relevant sources for this
position in phonology and elsewhere are Hjelmslev and Uldall (see Fudge
2006:88), Chomsky and Halle (1968), Kaplan 1987, Hale and Reiss (2000, 2008) and
Pylyshyn (2003).

Formal topics might include the use of quantifiers or operator-variable
structures, computation of locality, computational power of phonological
grammars, and formal grammar and biolinguistic considerations.

Abstracts should be sent in pdf format to cogsci@alcor.concordia.ca, up to 3
pages in length. Anonymity is not required.
