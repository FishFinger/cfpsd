Full Title: Bi-directional Perspectives in the Cognitive Sciences 

Date: 27-Feb-2009 - 01-Mar-2009
Location: Marburg, Germany 
Contact Person: Marcus Callies
Meeting Email: callies@staff.uni-marburg.de
Web Site: http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~callies/BPCS/BPCSindex.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Discourse Analysis; Language
Acquisition; Ling & Literature 

Call Deadline: 01-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

Aiming at bringing together researchers who engage in the trans-disciplinary
study of cognitive phenomena, this conference intends to investigate the
bi-directionality, that is, the mutual heuristic applicability of diverse (and
possibly complementary) research topics and methodologies in the cognitive
sciences. 

While the application of methods used in cognitive linguistics and psychology to
literary texts, for instance, has enriched our interpretations of literature,
how could cognitive phenomena reflected in literature help to uncover similar
manifestations and refine their study in more traditional cognitive sciences
such as linguistics and psychology? To what extent can techniques used in
cognitive approaches to linguistic and literary analysis be beneficial to
studies in language acquisition and teaching - and how does the latter affect
the former? How do different mapping processes - for example, metaphors of
embodiment in non-Western cultures - contribute to our understanding of
seemingly universal metaphorical mappings? And how can applied cognitive
linguistics benefit from potential parallels in cross-cultural mappings?

Keynote Speakers

Beate Hampe (Jena)
Susanne Niemeier (Konstanz)
Gerard Steen (Amsterdam)
Peter Stockwell (Nottingham)

We would like to encourage further submission of papers from scholars working in
the fields of linguistics, language acquisition and teaching, literary and
cultural studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and others, that explore
how cognitive approaches within these disciplines can enrich and illuminate one
another.

Selected papers will be published in a peer-reviewed volume.

Please send abstracts (as pdf-attachments) of no more than 300 words (excluding
references) by 1 August 2008 to Wolfram Keller (kellerw AT staff.uni-marburg.de).
