Meeting Description:

Conference on the Foot in Phonology
Sponsored by the MA/PhD program in linguistics at the City University of New
York and the CUNY phonology forum

January 15th-17th, 2009 at the CUNY graduate center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
City, 10016

Call for Papers

We invite oral and poster presentations from any subdivision of cognitive
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics,
philosophy, psychology, etc. We also encourage diversity in methods, so we
welcome both formal and experimental approaches to the topic of the foot in
phonology.

By "foot" we mean any structural entity that has been proposed to describe or
explain stress, rhythmic and/or prosodic phenomena above the level of the
syllable. The conference organizers especially want to encourage both oral and
poster proposals from a variety of theoretical frameworks.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to open the field of discussion to all matters related
to foot structure in phonology and/or phonetics.
- Do feet exist?
- Are feet hierarchically superordinate to syllables (or are they on separate
planes)?
- What is the internal structure of the foot?
- What principles determine foot structure?
- Are feet hierarchically dominated by other prosodic categories?
- Is foot structure lexically distinctive? If so, how is this distinction
represented?
- How is foot structure derived (if indeed it is)?
- What aspects of feet are referred to by morphological and phonological
rules/constraints?
- How do phonetic feet relate to phonological feet (and vice versa)?

Invited Speakers:
Morris Halle
Lou Ann Gerkin
Pat Shaw

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts for oral or poster presentations should consist of a one page
description (12pt font) with a second page for references, data and/or
illustrations. Please specify whether it is a proposal for a poster or an oral
presentation, or potentially either. Although we will make every effort to honor
authors' requests, the criterion for assigning a proposal to either the oral or
the poster format is simply whether the subject matter is better suited for one
or the other mode of presentation. Abstracts should be emailed as an attachment
(PDF format) to foot@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, November 8,
2008. Authors should include title of the proposal, name of the author(s) and
affiliation in the body of the email.
