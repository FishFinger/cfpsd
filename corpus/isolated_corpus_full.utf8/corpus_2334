Call for Papers

LREC 2008 Workshop on
Sentiment Analysis: Emotion, Metaphor, Ontology and Terminology
(EMOT 2008)
27 May, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco
https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/lrec-emot08.html
Submission deadline: 20 February 2008

Workshop Topics

Sentiment analysis systems seek to extract emotions and feelings expressed about
people, organisations, nation states, goods and services, in free natural
language texts. This interdisciplinary workshop will address three related
topics in this area:

(a) how metaphor and sentiment interact in everyday communication;

(b) language/conceptual resources properties to support sentiment analysis

(c) evaluation of sentiment analysis programs and evaluation methodologies.

There will be one keynote lecture on each of the three topics followed by the
presentation of papers related to each of the three topics.

Workshop Aims

This workshop will deal with the recent advances in the processing of
''sentiment'' in arbitrary collections of text.  Sentiment can be expressed
about works of art and literature, about the state of financial markets, about
liking and disliking individuals, organisations, ideologies, and consumer goods.
 It is necessary to examine what aspects of emotional experience sentiment
analysis aims to capture, how and in what way this may be evaluated. This
workshop focuses on three strands of research which will serve to enhance the
development of automated sentiment analysis systems of free text for real world
applications.  

Firstly, in psychology and computational linguistics, the notions of emotion and
metaphor interact in a number of complex ways.  It has been argued that
conceptual metaphors underlie human understanding and processing of emotion.  In
addition, it can be argued that the expression of sentiment and its
interpretation can rely critically on how a speaker or writer uses metaphor. 
Therefore, an understanding of how emotion is expressed and perceived in
language is not complete without addressing the role of figurative language and
metaphor as basic scaffolding or tool for modulating affective text content.  

Secondly, to date, sentiment analysis typically deals with a specific domain of
'ideal objects'.  In order to build a sentiment analysis system, one has to
understand 'what there is' in a given domain, i.e. the ontology of the domain. 
In this context, is it possible to conceive of generic sentiment analysis? 
Practitioners in this area need to examine the requirements and challenges of an
approach that could cross boundaries of domain or time or even language where
different communities of use, languages or cultures may express or even
experience sentiments in different ways.  

Finally, work in sentiment analysis may be regarded as work in intelligent
information retrieval and ''success'' is evaluated in terms of accuracy in
identifying the affective content of information segments. Yet sentiment
analysis has the potential to have a powerful impact in other domains that
require input about emotional context. Researchers in Human-Computer
Interaction, Affective Computing, Lexicography and Terminography, may become
end-users of work in sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis folks may have
much to learn from how a machine artificially ''endowed'' with
emotions/sentiments behaves.  It may become feasible to evaluate sentiment
analysis systems in terms of the performance of such applications. An
examination of alternative end-user systems and evaluation mechanisms can only
serve to enrich the field of sentiment analysis and present new challenges for
researchers to address.  

Submissions
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop. Submissions should should not exceed 8 pages and
should be typeset using a font size of 11 points. (Style files will be made
available by LREC for the camera-ready versions of accepted papers.)
The reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least
two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.  Springer has expressed an interest in publishing selected
papers from the workshop in one of its series, we are currently in discussions
and will confirm details at a later date.
Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than February 20, 2008. The
only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Details about the
submission procedure will be published on the workshop webpage
(https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/lrec-emot08.html) closer to the time.

Important Dates
20 February - Deadline for workshop papers
21 March - Notification of acceptance
 4 April - Camera-ready papers due

Meeting Description

2008 NooJ Conference
Budapest, Hungary
8-10 June, 2008 

The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(HAS), LAboratoire de SEmioLinguistique, Didactique et Informatique (LASELDI,
Univ. de Franche-Comté) and Maison des Sciences de l'Homme Claude Ledoux,
France, are pleased to announce the 2008 NooJ Conference to be held in Budapest,
Hungary, 8-10 June, 2008.

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used to
formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical and
productive morphology, local, structural and transformational syntax) using a
large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State Automata to Augmented
Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes tools to construct, test, debug,
maintain and accumulate large sets linguistic resources, and can apply them to
large texts. NooJ is used as a linguistic engineering development platform, a
corpus processor, an information extraction system, a terminological extractor,
a Machine Translation development tool as well as to teach linguistics and
computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ, download the software, linguistic resources, manual,
tutorials and reference papers: www.nooj4nlp.net.

This conference will hopefully provide an opportunity for NooJ users, as well as
other researchers interested in corpus linguistics, to meet and to exchange
their experience of development, research or teaching. It will also be the
occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ (v2.0).

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 7, 2008 to
nooj08 at nytud.hu. The abstract, in French or in English, should contain the
title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail and electronic address
of each co-author. All papers will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee.
Authors will be notified whether their papers are accepted or rejected by 30
April, 2008 the latest. The timeslot is 30 minutes for presentations, including
5 minutes for discussions.
