Dear Colleagues: 

Senta Goertler and Paula Winke (Michigan State University) are editing a
volume on distance learning for the CALICO Monograph Series and are
currently accepting chapter proposals for the chapters presented below. If
you are interested in any one of them, please, submit via email to
goertler@msu.edu a one to two page description of the chapter you would
like to write by March 31 based on the general outline below. Please use
the title and description we have provided as a general guideline - you can
amend aspects of the chapter as you see fit. 

TIMELINE:
 - March 31: Submission of chapter proposal & commitment to timeline
 - April 30: Acceptance notices and comments from the editors on chapter
descriptions
 - August 31: Submission of full chapter
 - October 1: Comments from the editors on full chapter
 - November 1: Resubmit final version of chapter
 - The volume is expected to go to press in time for the CALICO conference
in March 2008 in San Francisco. 

Thank you very much for your interest and we look forward to working with
you. Feel free to contact us in case of questions.

DESCRIPTION OF AVAILABLE CHAPTERS:
Virtual Space vs. Physical Space
When researching and discussing distance learning or technology-enhanced
teaching, often little information is provided to describe the physical
space, in which such teaching and learning occurs. However, both the
physical space as well as the virtual space influence the distance learning
experience for learner and instructor and the effectiveness of such
learning and teaching for language acquisition. In this chapter we will
discuss factors in the physical and virtual space that may play a role in
language learning in hybrid or distance learning environments, especially
in contrast to a traditional classroom-based learning environment. The
chapter will provide recommendations for the design of distance learning
courses. 

The Students' Role in Distance Learning
Distance learning takes away the immediate physical presence of other
students and teachers, hence the class dynamic may be influenced. In this
chapter we will discuss how factors in the different forms of distance
learning change the role of the learner in a language class. The chapter
will provide suggestions for effective distance learning environments. 

Materials Development for Distance Learning
When a decision is made to develop new curricular materials for L2 distance
learning courses, the process begins by assessing the tools and skills
available for the creation of such materials, along with a review of the
course's objectives, the desired learning outcomes, and appropriate
delivery mode for the particular subject area and student group. Budgeting, 
scheduling, and staffing are also considered. In addition, the formation of
a course and its materials must be informed by current second language
acquisition research and pedagogy. This chapter begins by reviewing a model
of an ideal internet-based L2 curriculum as it relates to current theories
in second language acquisition. Secondly, current commercially available 
tools for developing distance learning materials, such as CD-Rom, Video
lessons, and TV-streaming. 

Teacher Training for Distance Learning Teachers
Often L2 teachers are given online courses or are mandated to implement
online courses, but do not receive specific training in how to be effective
teachers in an online environment. Up until recently, training has
generally come through experience. This chapter discusses effective
practices, approaches, and strategies for teaching language through
distance learning courses and suggests ways to design a course to train
those who will teach second or foreign languages online. Reviewed are
virtual classroom management issues, particularities of syllabus design for
online learning, the implementation of synchronous and asynchronous
communication tools, and methods of providing feedback to learners.
E-learning approaches that are based on sound pedagogical theory are also
reviewed. 

Using Distance Learning for Teacher Training
Teacher education is a hands-on endeavor that incorporates practical
training with demonstrations and discussion of sound pedagogical theory.
However, as more and more pre-service and practicing teachers of diverse
languages from remote locations are in need of continuing education classes
or teacher training, the need for online teacher education courses is
growing. This chapter reviews the online instruction of teachers, who are
future classroom teachers with varying degrees of intent on using CALL in
their teaching. In addition, this learning environment also allows language
teachers continued practice in the languages they teach. 

Effectiveness of Distance Learning
While previous chapters discuss aspects of distance learning, this chapter
will discuss empirical evidence for the effectiveness of distance learning
for foreign language education. The effectiveness is measured according to 
cost-effectiveness, classroom space gained, foreign language proficiency
gains, and student and teacher satisfaction.
