Apologize if you receive more than one copy.



Since there are a lot of requests to extend the deadlines due to the 
holiday
season and the very tight period between ADMI08 workshop day and
ADMI09 submission deadline, we have seriously decided to extend the
submission deadline to the following:

Paper deadline: 15 February 2009, 23:59:59 PDT

** The proceedings will be published by Springer LNAI **
** Format can be Springer LNAI with up to 12 pages or follows AAMAS2009 
guideline**
** Papers should be submitted to asymeon@eng.auth.gr and cc 
longbing.cao-1@uts.edu.au **


=====================================
Call For Papers
The Fourth International Workshop on
Agents and Data Mining Interaction (ADMI-09)
MAY 10-15, 2009 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY
http://admi09.agentmining.org/

Held in conjunction with
The Eighth International Conference on
Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS2009)
http://www.conferences.hu/AAMAS2009

Important dates:
"    Electronic submission of full papers:   February 15, 2009 (extended)
"    Notification of paper acceptance:       March 1, 2009
"    Camera-ready copies of accepted papers: March 15, 2009
"    AAMAS-2009 workshop:                    May 11, 2009

Scope: The ADMI workshop provides a premier forum for sharing research 
and engineering results, as well as
potential challenges and prospects encountered in the coupling between 
agents and data mining. The workshop
welcomes theoretical work and applied dissemination aiming to:
"    exploit agent-enriched data mining and demonstrate how intelligent 
agent technology can contribute to
critical data mining problems in theory and practice;
"    improve data mining-driven agents and show how data mining can 
strengthen agent intelligence in
research and practical applications;
"    explore the integration of agents and data mining towards a 
super-intelligent system and intelligent
information processing; and
"    identify challenges and directions for future research and 
development on the synergy between agents
and data mining.

Topics: Contributions on the following and other related topics are 
solicited:
"    Challenges and prospects of agent and data mining interaction
"    Theoretical foundation for the integration between agents and data 
mining
"    Agent-enriched knowledge discovery and data mining
"    Self-organizing data mining and learning
"    Data mining-driven enhancement of agent intelligence
"    Data mining-driven agent performance evaluation
"    Emerging intelligent applications and intelligent information 
processing

Post-workshop publication:
"    The ADMI-09 Proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a 
volume of LNCS/LNAI series.
"    Special Issues on Agents and Data Mining, IEEE Intelligent Systems 
(ISI,SCI).
"    Edited book on Data Mining and Multiagent Integration, Springer.
