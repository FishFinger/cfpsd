Due to the success of the nine previous SIGDIAL workshops, SIGDIAL is now a
conference. The conference is sponsored by the SIGDIAL organization, which
serves as the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for both ACL and
ISCA. SIGDIAL 2009 will be co-located with Interspeech 2009 as a satellite event.

In addition to presentations and system demonstrations, the program includes an
invited talk by Professor Janet Bavelas of the University of Victoria, entitled
'What's unique about dialogue?'.
