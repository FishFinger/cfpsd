The 16th World Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences (ICAES 2008)
Call for Abstracts for the Academic Session on ''Issues of Language Endangerment''

The 16th World Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences (ICAES 2008) will be convened in Kunming City, Yunnan
Province, China from 15th to 23rd July, 2008 (see www.icaes2008.org). There will
be an academic session on ''Issues of Language Endangerment'' to which you are
cordially invited. 

Language endangerment is a global issue that is becoming increasingly
widespread. As the embodiment and expression of culture, language is a very
important part of our non-material cultural heritage. When languages become
extinct, there are adverse effects on linguistic and cultural diversity,
resulting in irreplaceable losses for the whole of mankind. Therefore, the
problem of language endangerment is a contemporary issue faced not only by
linguists and anthropologists, but which also affects the public at large.
Documentation and preservation of data from endangered languages have now become
the special responsibility of and an urgent task for linguists and
anthropologists. Development of field research and data recording of endangered
languages has led to numerous theoretical discussions and practical
investigations, involving linguists and anthropologists from all over the world.
Studies of language decline and extinction, as well as the recording and
archiving of data from endangered languages, have therefore led to the gradual
formation of new theories in both principles and methodology.

This academic session aims to facilitate communication and exchange of both
information and experience. It is hoped that this will further promote the
recording and preservation of data from endangered languages, as well as
fostering the development of theoretical and methodological research. This will
enable the formulation of effective strategies to ameliorate the loss that
language extinction will bring to the whole of human civilization.
If you would like to attend the academic session entitled ''Issues of Language
Endangerment'', please provide the following information:

(1) Name, Gender, Nationality/Ethnicity, Occupation/Professional Title, Academic
Qualifications, Address for Correspondence, Contact Telephone Number and the
title of the paper you would like to present during the session.

(2) Please submit an electronic copy of the abstract of your paper to both
contact persons before the 30th of December, 2007. The abstract should contain
no more than 350 words in English or around 500 characters in Chinese. Key words
should be provided. A formal invitation will be sent to you after the abstract
has been checked and accepted.
