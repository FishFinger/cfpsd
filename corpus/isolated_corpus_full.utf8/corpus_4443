Final Call For Papers

NAACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Creativity
(CALC 2009)

Boulder, Colorado
June 4, 2009

http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=CALC-09
 
It is generally agreed upon that "linguistic creativity" is a unique
property of human language. Some claim that linguistic creativity is
expressed in our ability to combine known words in a new sentence,
others refer to our skill to express thoughts in figurative language,
and yet others talk about syntactic recursion and lexical creativity.

For the purpose of this workshop, we treat the term "linguistic
creativity" to mean "creative language usage at different levels", from
the lexicon to syntax to discourse and text (see also topics, below).

The recognition of instances of linguistic creativity and the
computation of their meaning constitute one of the most challenging
problems for a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, such as
machine translation, text summarization, information retrieval, question
answering, and sentiment analysis. Computational systems incorporating
models of linguistic creativity operate on different types of data
(including written text, audio/speech/sound, and video/images/gestures).
New approaches might combine information from different modalities.
Creativity-aware systems will improve the contribution Computational
Linguistics has to offer to many practical areas, including education,
entertainment, and engineering.

Within the scope of the workshop, the event is intended to be
interdisciplinary. Besides contributions from an NLP perspective, we
also welcome the participation of researchers who deal with linguistic
creativity from different perspectives, including psychology,
neuroscience, or human-computer interaction.

Topics
======

We are particularly interested in work on the automatic detection,
classification, understanding, or generation of:

* neologisms;
* figurative language, including metaphor, metonymy, personification,
idioms;
* new or unconventional syntactic constructions ("May I serve who's
next?") and constructions defying traditional parsers (e.g. gapping:
"Many words were spoken, and sentiments expressed");
* indirect speech acts (such as curses, insults, sarcasm and irony);
* verbally expressed humor;
* poetry and fiction;
* and other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity.

Depending on the state of the art of approaches to the various phenomena
and languages, preference will be given to work on deeper processing
(e.g., understanding, goal-driven generation) rather than shallow
approaches (e.g., binary classification, random generation). We also
welcome descriptions and discussions of:

* computational tools that support people in using language creatively
(e.g. tools for computer-assisted creative writing, intelligent
thesauri);
* computational and/or cognitive models of linguistic creativity;
* metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware
systems;
* specific application scenarios of computational linguistic creativity;
* design and implementation of creativity-aware systems.

Related topics, including corpora collection, elicitation, and
annotation of creative language usage, will also be considered, as long
as their relevance to automatic systems is clearly pointed out.

Invited Speaker
===============

Nick Montfort, MIT

Submissions
===========

Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers are
limited to 8 pages. The style files can be found here:
[http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html]. No author
information should be included in the papers, since reviewing will be
blind. Papers not conforming to these requirements are subject to
rejection without review. Papers should be submitted via START
[https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/CALC2009/] in PDF format.

We encourage submissions from everyone. For those how are new to ACL
conferences and workshops, or with special needs, we are planning to set
up a lunch mentoring program. Let us know if you are interested. Also, a
limited number of student travel grants might become available, intended
for individuals with minority background and current residents of
countries where conference travel funding is usually hard to find.

Important Dates
===============

Submission Deadline:	Feb 27, 2009
Notification Due:	Mar 30, 2009
Final Version Due:	Apr 12, 2009
Workshop:		Jun 04, 2009
