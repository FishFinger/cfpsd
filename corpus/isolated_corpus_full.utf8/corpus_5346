Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce the first international conference on Intonational Variation in Arabic, to be held on 28th and 29th September 2009 at the University of York, UK. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers working on Arabic prosody and intonation, and together to explore the range of prosodic variation observed in spoken varieties of Arabic. 

Second Call for Papers 

Conference website: http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~sh581/iva09 

Papers of a descriptive and/or theoretical nature are invited which treat the 
phonetics and/or phonology of suprasegmental phenomena in one or more Arabic 
varieties (or other related Afro-Asiatic languages). Papers treating the 
intonational phonology of spoken Arabic dialects will be particularly welcome 
and will be prioritised. The conference will include a special workshop session 
on the development of transcription systems for research on intonational 
variation in Arabic. 

Invited speakers:
Professor Francis Nolan (University of Cambridge, UK) 
Professor Khaled Rifaat (Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud University, Riyadh)

examples, figures and/or references. No submissions will be accepted which are 
longer than two pages.

pdf format.
