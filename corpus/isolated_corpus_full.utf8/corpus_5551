Researching and Applying Metaphor 8

Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands 
Contact: Alan Cienki

Meeting Description: 

We are pleased to announce the 8th conference of the Researching and 
Applying Metaphor International Association (RaAM), which will be held 
at VU University (Vrije Universiteit), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 
from 30 June through 3 July 2010. 

As an association, RaAM strives to advance the study of metaphor, 
metonymy and other aspects of figurative language, with a commitment 
to the application of metaphor research to 'real world' issues. In 
light of this, the theme of the upcoming conference will be 'Metaphor 
and Domains of Discourse'. The theme is intended to highlight the 
socio-cultural as well as the situational diversity of metaphor as 
manifested in, for example: government and politics; education; 
science and healthcare; business and organizations; mass media and 
journalism; and literature and the arts. 

The conference will feature plenary lectures by: 
- Paul Chilton 
(Dept. of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, UK) 
- Dedre Gentner 
  (Dept. of Psychology and School of Education and Social Policy, Northwestern University, USA) 

and an address by the outgoing Chair of the RaAM Executive Committee: 
- Lynne Cameron 
  (Faculty of Education and Language Studies, Open University, UK). 

The conference will also include a new way of linking basic and 
applied research: in addition to regular papers and a poster session, 
a selection of 'real world workshops' will be offered. The workshops 
will involve demonstrations for, and with, conference participants on 
how metaphor can be used as an intervention or tool to change 
people's way of thinking and reasoning. 'Real world workshops' will 
be offered on: 

-- Metaphor in communicating public interest issues 
  (Joseph Grady, Cultural Logic, USA) 
-- Metaphor in business organizations 
  (Joep Cornelissen, Leeds University Business School, UK) 
-- Metaphor in education professionals' discourse 
  (Graham Low, University of York, UK) 
-- Metaphor in knowledge management 
  (Daan Andriessen, INHolland University of Applied Sciences, NL) 
-- Metaphor and metonymy in painting 
  (Irene Mittelberg, RWTH Aachen University, Germany) 
- Metaphor in product design 
  (Paul Hekkert, Technical University Delft, NL). 

More details, including the call for papers, will be 
available at a later date. Updates, including a link 
to the conference web site, will be posted at 
http://www.raam.org.uk/Amsterdam_2010.html 

See the link for 'Joining' at the top of that web page 
if you wish to become a member of the RaAM International 
Association. 

Sincerely yours, the local organizing committee: 
Alan Cienki and Gerard Steen (chairs); Lettie Dorst, Berenike 
Herrmann, Anna Kaal, Tina Krennmayr, Tryntje Pasma
