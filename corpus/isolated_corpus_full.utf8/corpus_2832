                          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                       Joint HCSNet-EII Workshop on
              Interactive and Ubiquitous Information Access

                           Sydney (NICTA ATP)
                           Fri/Sat May 16-17

                 http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents


Introduction

HCSNet (www.hcsnet.edu.au) and the EII taskforce on Mobile Information
Access taskforce (MAII) (http://www.eii.edu.au/taskforce0607/maii) are
organising a joint workshop on Interactive and Ubuquitous Information
Access. This workshop is designed to bring together researchers in
designing systems, methodologies, infrastructure, and interactive
interfaces for information access in mobile and/or ubiquitous
environments. The aim is to identify shared interests, understand
different perspectives, and to take first steps towards developing
future collaborations. HCSNet and EII-MAII will fund travel for a
number of Australian participants from outside the Sydney area.

We invite participants from HCI, Information Systems, Computer
Science, Information Science, Language Technology, Psychology,
Communication Science, Sociology, and other fields of interest to
information access and management, particularly in mobile and
ubiquitous environments.

Possible themes of interest include:
* information extraction;
* information retrieval via mobile devices;
* interactive question answering;
* ubiquitous computing;
* context-aware information access;
* dialogue systems for information access;
* cognitive and user modelling;
* methodologies for user studies.


Proposed Outcomes

Effective Interactive Interfaces and New Generation Search are
designated Priority Areas for HCSNet. Mobility and Accessing
Information Infrastructures is a taskforce for EII. The workshop aims
to bring these sub-communities together, to build bridges between
these two ARC Research Networks, to discuss specific problems and
issues that may stimulate new collaborations.


Invited Speakers

We have invited 2 prominent international researchers as invited
speakers and participants, as well as targetting local participants.
We hope to have confirmation of these shortly.
We also plan to involve targetted industry and user communities for
the purpose of highlighting problems and issues of value to them.


Participation and Format

We welcome participation from a range of disciplines and perspectives,
as outlined above, from both academia and industry, and we would like
to involve as many as possible in discussion.
* Attendees are asked to submit a short abstract of up to about 250
  words. Submissions should contain:
  - research interests pertinent to the workshop theme; and/or
  - thoughts on issues deemed to be important and potential points of
    interaction with other disciplines.
  Also indicate:
  - whether you require travel funding;
  - whether you are a HCSNet or EII member (or both or neither).
* Abstracts will be used to identify common or recurring themes, and
  help us plan the event.
* As well as invited presentations, there will be some time set aside
  for "speed presentations" (i.e. up to 5 minutes); every abstract
  submitted will also be scheduled space for a poster presentation.

Please send abstracts, by the date below, to Lawrence Cavedon at
lawrence.cavedon@rmit.edu.au

The format of the workshop will be designed to promote interaction and
collaboration, and we will allocate time for panels, discussion issues
raised by industry/user groups, and break-out sessions.


Funding

HCSNet/EII-MAII is able to provide funding support (covering travel
and accommodation) for a number of participants travelling from
outside Sydney. SUBMISSION OF AN ABSTRACT DESCRIBED ABOVE IS A
PREREQUISITE FOR BEING CONSIDERED FOR TRAVEL FUNDING. If not all
participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based on
specified interests---as described in the submitted abstract--- and
how well they fit with the theme and format of the workshop.

Please indicate at time of abstract submission whether you request
travel funding.


Dates

Fri April 4:                  Due date for abstracts
Fri April 18:                 Awards of travel funding notification
Fri May 16---Sat May 17:      Workshop
