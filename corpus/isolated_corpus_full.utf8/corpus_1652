Meeting Description:
Workshop at the 13th International Morphology Meeting, February 2008, Vienna,
Austria 

New lexical concepts can be expressed through the combination of two or more
existing free lexical morphemes. These can be combined in (more or less complex)
phrases as well as compounds, cf. New High German Geodätisches Institut
'institute of geod-esy' (NP) vs. Wirtschaft-s-institut 'institute of economy'
(compound). Language his-tory reveals that the borders between these two
mechanisms are not clear-cut. In contrast, they can be crossed diachronically:
Syntactic nominal phrases like Early New High German des teuffels list can turn
into morphological compound structures, cf. New High German Teufelslist 'cunning
of the devil', which gain productivity as a morphological mechanism. 

We propose a workshop addressing questions on the internal structures of
compounds and constructions in an intermediary state between syntax and
morphology (cf. French chemin-de-fer ''way-of-iron'' 'railway' or Icelandic
vél-ar-hlóð 'machine sound'). The focus is set on elements which originally
serve to express syntactic relations (cf. in-flectional affixes, prepositions
etc.) and develop as 'linking elements', cf. the linking -s in Teufel-s-list in
the joint position between the parts of compounds.

We would like to invite research presentations on the origin, change, and
functionalization of linking elements in different languages. Although all work
on linking elements is of high interest, we would especially want to stress the
importance of diachronic and contrastive studies. Some of the questions to be
addressed are listed in the following:
- What linguistic material develops as linking elements?
- Which morpho-syntactic categories have retained their meaning and which have
abandoned it (cf. e.g. former number- vs. case-affixes)?
- Can functionalization in morphology, semantics, or phonology be taken into
account? Which functions do linking elements develop? Is there a correlation
between productivity and functionalization?
- How are linking elements connected to language processing?
- What has led to the loss of productive linking elements, cf. the history of
English?
- Which factors condition productivity and changes in productivity for linking
elements? How many productive linking elements do languages keep, and are
unproductive elements substituted by productive ones?
- Is the productitity of linking elements connected with the producitivity of
compounding (cf. the high productivity of compounding and the use of linking
elements in languages like German and Danish vs. the low productivity of
compounding and little use of linking elements in English or Polish)?
- Is there a difference between origin and functionalization of linking elements
in right-headed vs. left-headed compounds?
- What influence does the token frequency of the first or second part of a
com-pound have on the appearance of linking elements?
- What is the grammatical status of linking elements?
- What differences can be accounted for between written and spoken language?

Abstract submission:
Please send an anonymous abstract of max. 500 words (20-minute talks with
10-minute discussion) in both .pdf and .doc formats to rszczepa@uni-mainz.de.
