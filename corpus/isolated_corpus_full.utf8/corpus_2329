CALL FOR PAPERS
2008 NooJ Conference
Budapest, Hungary
Deadline: 7 March, 2008


The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of =

Sciences (HAS), LAboratoire de SEmioLinguistique, Didactique et =

Informatique (LASELDI, Univ. de Franche-Comt=E9) and Maison des Sciences =

de l'Homme Claude Ledoux, France, are pleased to announce the 2008 NooJ =

Conference to be held in Budapest, Hungary, 8-10 June, 2008.

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used =

to formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical =

and productive morphology, local, structural and transformational =

syntax) using a large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State =

Automata to Augmented Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes =

tools to construct, test, debug, maintain and accumulate large sets =

linguistic resources, and can apply them to large texts. NooJ is used as =

a linguistic engineering development platform, a corpus processor, an =

information extraction system, a terminological extractor, a Machine =

Translation development tool as well as to teach linguistics and =

computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ, download the software, linguistic resources, =

manual, tutorials and reference papers: www.nooj4nlp.net.

This conference will hopefully provide an opportunity for NooJ users, as =

well as other researchers interested in corpus linguistics, to meet and =

to exchange their experience of development, research or teaching. It =

will also be the occasion to present and discover the recent =

developments of NooJ (v2.0).

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 7, 2008 =

to nooj08 at nytud.hu. The abstract, in French or in English, should =

contain the title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail =

and electronic address of each co-author. All papers will be reviewed by =

the Scientific Committee. Authors will be notified whether their papers =

are accepted or rejected by 30 April, 2008 the latest. The timeslot is =

30 minutes for presentations, including 5 minutes for discussions.

Further information on the conference: www.nytud.hu/nooj08.
