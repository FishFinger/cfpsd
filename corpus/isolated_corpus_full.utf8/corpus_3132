Call for Papers

Linguistic Association of the Southwest (LASSO) 
37th Annual Conference 
October 17-19, 2008

Deadline for submission: Extended June 25, 2008

Conference Theme: ''Building Communities and Making Connections''

Plenary Speaker: James Crawford

Abstract submissions are invited for paper presentations, poster presentations,
and panels on any research area related to language issues of special interest
in the Southwest.  In addition, proposals on the conference theme are
particularly encouraged, and may include, but are not limited to:  connecting
language with non-academic areas, interdisciplinary collaborations, language
learning communities, education and language policy, and non-traditional
dissemination of language research.

In addition a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Making Connections Beyond the
Academic Community is encouraging presentations on that topic. Please indicate
in the abstract if you would like to be considered under this SIG.

Presentations are generally given in Spanish or English, although special
provisions may be made to support the use of endangered languages that have been
excluded historically from academic discourse. Presentations should be given in
the same language as the abstract.  

Paper presentations will be limited to 20 minutes followed by a 10 minute
question period.  

Poster presentations will be organized into informal poster sessions where
presenters can distribute hand-outs, explain posters, and answer questions.  

Panels should be composed of 2-4 speakers. Early submission of panel proposals
is desirable.  

Only one abstract as a single author and a second as co-author will be accepted
from any one individual.

Submissions by graduate students are welcome, and students are eligible for the
Helmut Esau Prize, a $250 cash award.

may mail a disk copy accompanied by a paper copy to the address below.
