Meeting Description:

Panel title: 'Listener Activities and Responses' 

Panel organizers:  Neal R. Norrick and Kerstin Fischer 

This panel is to be held in the context of the 11th IPrA conference in
Melbourne, Australia. 

Panel Description

Listeners do not inertly and silently receive talk by speakers. They actively
demonstrate listenership and encourage other participants to continue to hold
the floor. They signal uptake, understanding, agreement or disagreement,
emotional involvement and so on. They engage in various ''activities in the
back-channel'' by contrast with the primary channel occupied by talk produced by
the primary speaker (Ingve 1970). These listener activities may take either
visual or auditory form. Visual back-channel activities include nods, smiles,
grimaces, furrowed brows and gestures like raised palms and shoulder shrugs;
auditory back-channel signals include both non-linguistic sounds like sighs,
inhalations, laughs, suction clicks and linguistic signals. These linguistic
signals include discourse markers like yeah and okay, interjections like wow and
damn, and items such as m-hm and uh-huh. 

This panel unites scholars studying listener behaviors in concrete contexts,
focusing on everyday talk-in-interaction, talk at work, or talk transmitted
through such media as radio, television and the internet. The common objective
is to reveal the basic characteristics and variants of listener activities in
their simultaneous functions of signaling recipiency and/or emotional
involvement, commenting, doing politeness or impoliteness, constructing
identity, accomplishing interactional goals and so on within such registers as
small talk, sports talk, political debates and storytelling. The general
availability of large corpora now makes possible systematic study of the full
richness of listener behavior across different contexts, and the explosion of
technical possibilities for the recording and transmission of language presents
new challenges for linguistic analysis. Participants in this panel seek to take
advantage of these resources and to meet these challenges in theoretically
founded ways. 

Please send abstracts of about 500 words before October 10th to
