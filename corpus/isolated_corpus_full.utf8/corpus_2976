Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Translation 

Call Deadline: 20-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers from different research
strands, including applied or theoretical aspects of Second Language
Acquisition, Contact-induced Variation and Change and Bilingual Speech
Processing. Our aim is to discuss recent work on one key issue in these fields,
namely cross-linguistic influence, with a view to bringing together the research
agendas in each discipline, promoting mutual understanding of theoretical models
and concepts, exchanging recent findings and developing collaborative,
interdisciplinary research projects. 

Call for Papers

Interdisciplinary approaches to transfer, crosslinguistic influence and
contact-induced change
 
9-11 July 2008, UWE Bristol
 
The proposed workshop will focus on uncovering the processes and mechanisms at
work in cross-linguistic influence/transfer in second language learners and
bilinguals. As researchers working on bilingual speech production have shown
that both languages are active during production, accounting for the ''hard
problem'' (Costa 2004; Finkbeiner, Gollan & Caramazza 2006) of unintended
choices, i.e cross-linguistic influence/transfer, becomes a key issue. Recent
work on transfer suggests that it is important throughout the L2 learning
process (Lefebvre, White and Jourdan 2006). In the same way, work on language
contact suggests that cross-linguistic influence in bilingual speech can result
in language change, and language contact in the form of code-switching can under
particular circumstances lead to language shift or language death in the long
term (cf. Muysken 2000; Deuchar and Vihman 2002; Treffers-Daller 2005; Matras
and Sakel 2007). Nonetheless, altogether the question of how and when transfer
operates in L2 learners and bilinguals remains controversial. We want to build a
forum of discussion and collaboration between the different approaches to
cross-linguistic influence and identify innovative, collaborative ways of
approaching this issue.

Plenary Speakers:
- Albert Costa (University of Barcelona): ''Costs and Benefits of being a
bilingual speaker''
- Margaret Deuchar (University of Bangor): ''Welsh as a test case for two models
of contact-induced language shift''
- Pieter Muysken (University of Nijmegen): ''Contacts between the Amerindian
languages of South America: An overview''
 
The workshop is sponsored by the LAGB, ESRC Centre for Bilingualism (Bangor),
the Bristol Centre for Linguistics at UWE and the Research Committee of the
Department of Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (UWE Bristol)
 
Papers are invited on any aspect of the above-mentioned subjects. Abstracts of
no more than 400 words (incl references) should arrive on or before 20th of May
on one or both of the following addresses:
Jeanette Sakel (jeanette.sakel@uwe.ac.uk) or
Jeanine Treffers-Daller (jeanine.treffers-daller@uwe.ac.uk)

Full Title: Lexical-Semantic and Ontological Resources 

Date: 01-Oct-2008 - 01-Oct-2008
Location: Berlin, Germany 
Contact Person: Lothar Lemnitzer
Meeting Email: lothar@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de
Web Site: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~lothar/LexSem08/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Lexicography; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 16-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of recent
developments in the area of lexical-semantic resources - especially with regard
to wordnets and ontologies. The focus of this year's meeting is on the
maintenance, extension, representation, and standardization of resources. A
topic of particular interest is interoperability between different types of
resources. 

Call for Papers

The workshop is a follow-up to a series of thematically related events starting
with two GLDV workshops on GermaNet in 2003 and 2005 and continued by meetings
on lexical-semantic resources at the DGfS 2006 and GLDV 2007 conferences.

Contributions reporting on ongoing projects and initiatives to build new
resources are also welcome.

Papers on the application of lexical-semantic and ontological resources should
be submitted to the main conference (see http://konvens.dwds.de/).

Important Dates:
Submission of extended abstracts: 16 June 2008
Notification of acceptance: 15 July 2008
Workshop date: 1 October 2008

(KONVENS: 30 September - 2 October 2008)

Submission Information:
Extended abstracts of not more than 2 pages (500-600 words) should be submitted
in plain text format or PDF to lothar@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de.

The languages of the workshop are German and English. We are planning a
post-workshop journal publication of selected papers.

Registration:
Workshop participation is free of charge, but participants are kindly asked to
register in advance (contact: lothar@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de).

We strongly encourage participants to also attend the KONVENS main conference
(http://konvens.dwds.de/).
