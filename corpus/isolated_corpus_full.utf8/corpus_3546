Hi all,

I get rather a lot of these.  I'm guessing it's another sham  
conference (red lights come on at "papers on anything" and "in  
Orlando, Florida") but I'd have to say that I don't have anything more  
authoritative than "this looks dodgy" to draw that conclusion.

I wouldn't be considering submitting a paper to something like this,  
but it does raise the question: how do we identify sham conferences?   
Are there well-known ones?  Is there a 'name and shame' web site  
somewhere?

Cheers,
Brett
