Meeting Description

An international conference on metrics, organised by the Nordic Society for
Metrical Studies in cooperation with the University of Iceland  and the Árni
Magnússon Institute of Icelandic Studies, Reykjavík. 

The theme of the conference will be: Germanic features in Nordic and European
poetry, linguistic and literary aspects. Among our invited speakers will be
Professor Nigel Fabb, Strathclyde University.

We plan to have a special session on medieval Nordic poetry as represented in
the eddic and skaldic forms, and described by Snorri Sturluson, who lived,
worked and died (in 1241) in Reykholt. In his terminology, the distinctive
traits or branches (greinir) of poetry were those of diction (mál), sound
(hljóð) and number (tala). 

Submissions are invited for 30 minute papers on the linguistic and literary
aspects of metres and poetry.
