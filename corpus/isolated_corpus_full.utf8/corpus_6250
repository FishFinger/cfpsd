Final Call for Expressions of Interest:  HCSNet Workshop on Statistical Parametric Mapping for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Please go to our website for more information and to send your expression of interest: http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2009/spmhcd-09

Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is the primary software tool for the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. This three-day workshop will deliver both formal lectures and practical sessions on the analysis and characterisation of functional MRI data, using SPM. The course faculty will include international experts in fMRI and SPM, with specific expertise in language-related research in both neurologically intact and neurologically impaired individuals.

Basic topics covered:
â¢ Basic MR physics and BOLD contrast
â¢ Experimental design
â¢ Image acquisition
â¢ Image preprocessing
â¢ Data analysis (general linear model)

Advanced topics include:
â¢ Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM)
â¢ Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM)
â¢ Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)

An overview of additional SPM toolboxes will also be provided. Participants will be given the opportunity to apply these different techniques in SPM practical sessions using sample data sets on individual workstations. A limit of 30 workshop participants provides the opportunity for maximum support from the course faculty.

The following people will be presenting at the workshop:

Dr Jenny Crinion (University College London)
Dr Cyril Pernet (University of Edinburgh)
Dr Julia Hocking (University of Queensland)
Dr Greig de Zubicaray (University of Queensland)
Dr Katie McMahon (University of Queensland)
Professor Michael Breakspear (Queensland Institute for Medical Research)
Dr Bill Budd (University of Newcastle)
Audience

The workshop is intended for researchers with basic fMRI experience, who wish to build on their knowledge and skills in the analysis and characterisation of fMRI data in the normal and clinical populations. As numbers are limited, priority will be given to participants working in a speech and/or language-related field, and particularly PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, however this is not a prerequisite for participation, and invitations to attend will be based on a submission statement.
Event Format

The 3-day workshop will be held at The University of Queensland, Brisbane on the 18th-20th November 2009. The workshop faculty will include national and international experts in the field. Each of the three days will consist of lectures on SPM for fMRI, with related SPM practice sessions.
Important Dates

    * Submission Deadline: Wednesday 28th October 2009
    * Notification of Acceptance: Friday 30th October 2009
    * Notification of Award: Friday 30th October 2009
    * Registration: Closes Monday 9th November 2009
    * Event Date: Wednesday 18th to Friday 20th November 2009

Submission Format

Interested participants are asked to submit an expression of interest (max 300 words) that includes:
1) Current position and research area
2) Specific interest in the topic (functional neuroimaging of speech, language and cognition)
3) Why the workshop is relevant for your current and/or future research

If you are a full time student, please also indicate if you wish to be considered for a travel grant.

As numbers are limited, participants will be invited to register for the workshop based on their submitted expression of interest. Invitations to register will be sent out by Friday 30th October. Cost of registration for the workshop is $150 for students and $300 for postdoctoral researchers, academics, and professionals.

Submission deadline: Wednesday 28th October 2009

Submit online:http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2009/spmhcd-09

Getting There

Sir James Foots building (47a), Room 241, University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus

Travel Bursaries

HCSNet will fund a number of travel grants of up to $500 to help cover the costs of travel and accommodation for Australian-based HCSNet members from outside the Brisbane area. To be eligible for a travel grant, you must have been an HCSNet Member for two months prior to the event, and you must provide a submission as described above. If not all participants can be covered, funding will be allocated based on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop theme; also, students and early career researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in the last fifteen years)will have priority. Please ensure that you indicate at the time ofsubmission if you wish to considered for a travel grant. Submission deadline for travel grant: Wednesday 28th October.
