Meeting Description:

Alliteration can be found in a broad range of linguistic forms, from old
Germanic verse to modern advertising jingles, from Finnic lullabies to
traditional proverbial comparisons,  from the names of paired oxen to the
tabloid headlines and contemporary football chants. Alliteration is however
a rather under examined topic. This conference aims to address the
phenomenon of repeated initial sounds in a variety of languages and
linguistic forms.
