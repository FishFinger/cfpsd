I know of this paper:

	Address =3D {Saarbr{\"u}cken, Germany},
	Author =3D {Kenneth W. Church},
	Booktitle =3D {Proceedings of the 18th conference on Computational  =

We've been exploiting the distance between repeated syntactic  =

constructions (not terms) in our work on structural (syntactic)  =

priming.  For a more applied paper, see

@inproceedings{reitter2007predicting,
	Address =3D {Prague, Czech Republic},
	Author =3D {David Reitter and Johanna D. Moore},
	Booktitle =3D {Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the  =

Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL)},
	Pages =3D {808-815},
	Title =3D {Predicting Success in Dialogue},
	Year =3D {2007}}

What you call "distance-weighted context window" is roughly what we've  =

been using to estimate short-term priming levels in dialogue corpora;  =

however, we've been looking at the decay in repetition probability  =

with increasing distance.  That's not quite the same.  Long-term  =

adaptation is measured slightly differently, but it translates to the  =

distance paradigm if you compare mean distances between different  =

terms (or structures).  (See the CogSci and EMNLP papers on various  =

aspects.)  In the above paper, it was long-range repetition that  =

predicted task success, not the short-term distance effects.

There is further work on structural repetition effects, where distance  =

is observed as one of many factors (not sure if this is right paper -  =

there is a book as well):

@article{Szmrecsanyi2005habit,
	Author =3D {Benedikt Szmrecsanyi},
	Journal =3D {Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory},
	Number =3D {1},
	Pages =3D {113-149},
	Title =3D {Creatures of Habit: A corpus-linguistic Analysis of  =

Persistence in Spoken English},
	Volume =3D {1},
	Year =3D {2005}}


If you're primarily interested on the lexical level, Ward and Litman  =

have been using the metric recently, e.g.,

http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~litman/cpSlate.pdf
http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~litman/primeLearn.pdf

Hope this helps!
