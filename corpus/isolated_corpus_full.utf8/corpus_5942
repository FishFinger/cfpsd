Meeting Description:

Language, Migration and Labour
4th International Seminar Series
AILA Research Network on Language and Migration

Institute of Multilingualism, University of Fribourg and HEP Fribourg, Swit=
zerland

The fourth AILA Language and Migration Research Network Seminar focuses on =
the relationship between language, migration flows and labour processes. Ou=
r major concern is to explore the complex relationship between the economic=
 and cultural capital of migrants and its use or exploitation by power inst=
itutions in a globalized labour market. We will focus on the role of langua=
ge in access, selection, social mobility and gate-keeping processes. The se=
minar will address some of the following key issues:

A) The way language operates as a means of social selection in the workplac=
e for migrants (ie. the role of language skills in recruitment processes or=
 job performance, with attendant issues of measurement and evaluation);=20
B) Language teaching for migrants and acquisition of language proficiencies=
 on the workfloor (including literacy issues);=20
C) The capitalization by employers of migrant language skills in the manage=
ment of multilingualism (through commodification of language and identity a=
nd/or the (non)-recognition of crucial multilingual practices);=20
D) The role of language in the regulation of labour market related migratio=
n trajectories.

Plenary Speakers:

- Beatriz P. Lorente, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore=20
