Meeting Description:

XVII Symposium on Languages for Specific Purposes 

2nd Call for Papers

The extended deadline for paper abstracts for the LSP symposium in August 2009
has now passed. We are very content with the number of abstracts received (more
than 100). However, if you are interested in presenting a paper at the
symposium, but did not manage to comply with the deadline, we do not close the
door fully. Do contact us, and we will try to find a solution. 

Apart from paper sections, we invite contributions in the form of Round Tables
(= discussions on the basis of introductory presentations), Workshops (=
analytically oriented sessions) and Panels (= groups of presentations). So far,
we have accepted panels and workshops on terminology, international commercial
arbitration and on lecture comprehension and learning in English-medium
instruction. For more information on the types of contributions, please click
the link in the left-side menu. 

As these contributions will be subject to a different kind of assessment
procedure, the deadline for these contributions is 1 March 2009. We look forward
to receiving your interesting suggestions before the deadline. 

Please note that on Thursday and Friday, 20 and 21 August, the LSP Symposium
will be held together with the annual meeting in the Council for Programs in
Technical and Scientific Communication (CPTSC). This means that you are welcome
to participate in the programmes of both arrangements, if you register
accordingly. We look forward to this parallel activity and hope that both
parties will benefit from the initiative.

And finally, we are happy to inform you that we have now uploaded the abstracts
for plenary speaker contributions on this website. Click "Keynote speakers" in
the left-side menu to see the abstracts. 

We look forward to welcoming you in Aarhus in August! 

On behalf of the Organising Committee, 
Jan Engberg

Location: London, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Adam Schembri

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

Abstracts are invited for a workshop "Sign language corpora: Linguistic issues"
to take place at University College London (London, England) on 24-25 July, 2009. 

Second Call for Papers 

Revised Deadline: 28th February, 2009

Increasing numbers of sign language researchers are seeking to create large
corpora of sign language digital video data. Projects have been undertaken or
are underway in Australia, France, Greece, Ireland, The Netherlands, Spain, the
United Kingdom and Germany, for example, and more are underway or being planned
in other parts of the world. This workshop aims to share experiences from
current work and plans for future work. What are the descriptive and theoretical
challenges being encountered and what solutions are being proposed? What kinds
of linguistic data are being collected? What linguistic and sociolinguistic
factors are being considered in corpus design? What standards for linguistic
tagging and metadata are being used and how can these be improved? What kinds of
linguistic research questions are being addressed using sign language corpus
data? What kinds of linguistic evidence can corpora provide? What implications
does sign language corpus work have for theories of language?

We invite abstracts for 30 minute papers or posters on descriptive, theoretical
and applied linguistic issues in corpus-based approaches to sign language
research, including the following topics:

- Linguistic and sociolinguistic issues in building sign language corpora
- Linguistic issues in annotation or for metadata descriptions
- Reports from linguistic research using corpora
- Use of corpora in sign language teaching and learning
- Use of parallel corpora in sign language research, and
interpreting/translation studies
- Language documentation, archiving and preservation of sign language data
 - Linguistic issues in the development of annotation software and automated
sign language recognition

Day 1 of the workshop will consist of presentations and posters, while day 2
will involve a series of invited talks interspersed with discussions on key
issues led by discussants (invited speakers and discussants are to be confirmed,
but will include Onno Crasborn and Trevor Johnston).

Please send your abstract (max. 500 words) by email to <
abstracts@bslcorpusproject.org > no later than 28th February, 2009. In your
message, please indicate your preference for the presentation format:
spoken/signed paper or poster.
