Full Title: Linguistic Interfaces & Language Acquisition Workshop 
Short Title: The Mind-Context Divide 

Date: 30-Apr-2009 - 02-May-2009
Location: Iowa City, Iowa, USA 
Contact Person: Jason Rothman; Rouymana Slabakova
Meeting Email: interfaces-workshop@uiowa.edu
Web Site: http://www.uiowa.edu/interfaceworkshop 

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Pragmatics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss current issues on the interfaces
between phonology and syntax, syntax and semantics, syntax and discourse, syntax
and the lexicon and their first, bilingual and second language acquisition.
Assuming the division between integrative and interface linguistic processes
(Jackendoff, 2002) and a language architecture along the lines of Reinhart 2006,
we are interested in demonstrable differences between the various interface
properties and timing/rates/accuracy of their acquisition. It is no longer
sufficient to maintain that properties at the interfaces are 'harder' and take
longer to acquire as compared to integrative properties within the modules
(especially within the computational system) (Sorace, 2003). New empirical
research and theoretical generalizations are invited refining and specifying the
research program outlined above.

Mind-Context Divide 
Language Acquisition and Interfaces of Cognitive-Linguistic Modules

The University of Iowa

Date: April 30th- May 2nd 2009

Conveners: Jason Rothman and Roumyana Slabakova 

Questions to be addressed include, but are not restricted to, the following: How
do children and L2 learners acquire the properties of lexical items
(lexicon-syntax interface)? What role does prosody play in the acquisition of
morphology (prosody-morphosyntax interface)? How are semantic concepts (e.g.,
definiteness, specificity, genericity, tense, aspect, among others) acquired,
and how does this affect the use and interpretation of the dedicated
morphological markers of these concepts (semantics-syntax and pragmatics-syntax
interface)? Is context and discourse information (focus, topic) readily
integrated and marked by language learners? In addition to focusing on these
grammatical areas, which are starting to receive enhanced attention in language
acquisition, the workshop will explore the following questions which are
fundamental to the study of language development and ultimate attainment: Are
there stages of development in acquisition at the interfaces? Does children's
cognitive development make a difference with respect to such properties? What is
the role of the L1 in the acquisition of the second language interfaces? How do
L2 learners eventually converge on the complete grammar of the target language,
if they ever do?

Keynote Speaker:
Lydia White (McGill University)

Plenary Speakers:
JÃ¼rgen Bohnemeyer (SUNY Buffalo)
Alison Gabriele (University of Kansas)
Andrea Gualmini (Utrecht University)

Maria Luisa Zubizarreta (University of Southern California)

Call for submissions: Abstracts are invited for thirty-minute talks as well as
posters presentations. Authors of papers selected for oral presentation will be
required to submit a preliminary version of their paper by March 1st 2009, to be
posted on the conference website.  All oral presentations and alternate papers
(presented as posters) will be invited to submit to a peer-reviewed edited
volume, which will feature the keynote and plenary talks. Please submit a
one-page abstract (single-spaced, at least 11' font) with an optional second
page for examples, data and references) to interfaces-workshop@uiowa.edu  by
October 1st 2008.  Notification of acceptance will be sent out by December 1st
2008.

e-mail: Author(s) name(s), affiliation(s), indicating whether they are faculty
or students as well as the1st author's e-mail, phone number and mailing address.
Graduate students are especially encouraged to submit! Please check out the
