Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 03-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working on
natural language within the paradigm of cognitive science. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

Computational Models of NLP
Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
Computer Assisted Language Learning
Evolutionary NLP 
Situated (embodied) NLP 
Multimodality in speech / text processing 
Text Summarization and Information Extraction 
Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems 
Multi-Lingual Processing
Pragmatics and NLP
Speech Processing 
Tools and Resources in NLP 
Ontologies 
Text Mining
Electronic Dictionaries
Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives: full
automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT), semi-automated
processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (the program assisting people in
their tasks), simulation of the human cognitive process.

The 5th International Workshop on ''Natural Language Processing and Cognitive
Science'' 
(NLPCS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/workshops/nlpcs/nlpcs2008-cfp.html

12-13 June, 2008 - Barcelona - Spain

In conjunction with the 10th International Conference on Enterprise Information
Systems (ICEIS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/

Background

Realising that no single discipline will ever suffice to reveal the functioning
of the human mind, cognitive science was born. The idea was to analyse complex
behaviour (speaking, thinking, problem-solving) from different angles or levels
and to build models that could account for them.

Goals

While ambitious and intriguing, the idea looked promising enough to attract
numerous researchers, and there were plenty of opportunities then to present
this kind of work. Alas, the situation has changed, the discipline has lost
speed during the last decade. And if the reasons for this are multiple, ranging
from lack of results to unkept promises (« cognitive science » remaining wishful
thinking rather than a widely shared way of doing research), the fact is that
funding has become more and more scarce, and so have the opportunities to
present work done within this framework.

In the meantime statistical approaches have gained in popularity, and evaluation
has become an obligatory feature for presentation of work in the arena of
computational linguistics. While there is no doubt that evaluation has certain
qualities, it does not guarantee progress or insights per se. A broader
perspective is needed. To get the necessary insights and to get the big picture,
we probably need to get back to the framework in which we worked in those days,
which means, we should adopt and integrate multiple viewpoints, that is, take a
cognitive science approach. This is the goal of this workshop.

Justification of the New Name and Relation to the Topics

The workshop used to be called NLUCS (Natural Language Understanding and
Cognitive Science), yet, realising that this is too restrictive, we decided to
rename it NLPCS (Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science), as NLP is
obviously more than just natural language understanding. Information Retrieval,
Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Question Answering, Text
Summarization, Text Generation, etc. are all part of NLP or HLT (Human Language
Technology), and they all go clearly beyond language understanding. This being
so, it might be a valuable proposition to integrate them into the debate. In
other words, we would like to widen the scope and provide a forum for all
researchers of NLP working within the CS paradigm.

Also, while certain components (dictionaries, grammars, or ontologies) are very
general, the way they are used varies considerably with the task. Hence it is
important to show how the task reflects in the use of a given resource.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working within
the paradigm of cognitive science

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Computational Models of NLP
- Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
- Evolutionary NLP
- Situated (embodied) NLP
- Multimodality in speech / text processing
- Text Summarization and Information Extraction
- Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
- Computer Assisted Language Learning
- Multi-Lingual Processing
- Pragmatics and NLP
Speech Processing
- Tools and Resources in NLP
- Ontologies
- Text Mining
- Electronic Dictionaries
- Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives: full
automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT), semi-automated
processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs assisting people in their
tasks), simulation of human cognitive process.

Submission of Papers

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation in any of
the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be accepted, and the
length of the paper should not exceed 10 pages (5000 words). Instructions for
preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex format) are available at the ICEIS
web site. http://www.iceis.org/paper_template.htm Postscript/RTF versions of the
manuscript should be submitted through ICEIS web-based paper submission
procedure: http://www.iceis.org/paper_submission.htm

Workshop Format

The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations of previously
submitted papers that went through a double peer review process. The proceedings
of the workshop will be published in the form of a book.
