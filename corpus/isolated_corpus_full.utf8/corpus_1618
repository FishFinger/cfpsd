Call For Papers

Translating Biology: Text Mining Tools That Work

A Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing Session

January 4-8, 2008
The Big Island, Hawai'i

<http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-nlp.html>http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-nlp.html

Biomedical science is now an information-intensive field of study, with
high-throughput experimental techniques generating large amounts of data,=
 and
bioinformatics providing tools for managing and making sense of that data.
However, the information generated and used in biomedical science must be
accessible both to computers and to people. This=20
requires constant translation between=20
human-readable forms, such as text and figures,=20
to computer-readable forms, such as biological=20
databases and ontologies. In a recent PLoS=20
Computational Biology editorial, Philip Bourne=20
posed the following question: Will a biological=20
database be different from a biological journal?=20
If we had text mining tools that worked, then the=20
translation from text to database (and back)=20
would blur these lines. Such tools would enable=20
the seamless incorporation of semantic=20
information extracted from text with databases=20
and with analytical tools, as just one of many=20
sources of information for addressing complex biological problems.

 From the many publications in the area, we know that performance has=
 reached
reasonable levels on a number of basic text=20
mining tasks, such as indexing and the=20
identification of biomedical entities. We now=20
need to ask a new set of questions: Do these=20
tools work? Can they be adapted to new=20
applications? Are they cost-effective in real=20
applications? Who uses these tools, and how? Can=20
these tools be maintained over time? The answers=20
to these questions are critical to understanding=20
the apparent gap between the number of=20
publications on biomedical text mining and the=20
number of deployed text mining applications. The=20
answers to these questions are also essential to=20
providing the bioinformatics community with the=20
text mining tools that they are asking for. We=20
categorize these questions into four attributes:=20
utility, usability, portability, and robustness.

The session will focus on papers that explore these issues, including
questions such as:


What is the actual utility of text mining in the work flows of the various
communities of potential users=ADmodel organism database curators, bedside
clinicians, biologists utilizing high-throughput=20
experimental assays, hospital billing departments?

How usable are biomedical text mining applications? How does the application
fit into the workflow of a complex bioinformatics pipeline? What kind of
training does a bioscientist require to be able to use an application?

Is it possible to build portable text mining systems? Can systems be adapted
to specific domains and specific tasks without the assistance of an
experienced language processing specialist?

How robust and reliable are biomedical text mining applications? What are=
 the
best ways to assess robustness and reliability? Are the standard evaluation
paradigms of the natural language processing world=ADintrinsic evaluation
against a gold standard, post-hoc judging of outputs by trained judges,
extrinsic evaluation in the context of some other task=ADthe best evaluation
paradigms for biomedical text mining, or even sufficient evaluation=
 paradigms?

Submission information

The core of the conference consists of rigorously peer-reviewed full-length
papers reporting on original work. Accepted papers will be published in a
hard-bound archival proceedings, and the best of=20
these will be presented orally
to the entire conference. Researchers wishing to=20
present their research without
official publication are encouraged to submit a one-page abstract by noon,
November 9, 2007 to present their work in the poster sessions.

Important dates

Paper submissions due: July 16, 2007
Notification of paper acceptance: September 5, 2007
Final paper deadline: September 24, 2007 midnight PT
Abstract deadline: November 9, 2007
Meeting: January 4-8, 2008

For full submission information, including style sheets and
all requirements, please see the session web site at
