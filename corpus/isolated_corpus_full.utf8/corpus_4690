Meeting Description:

Unsupervised and Minimally Supervised Learning of Lexical Semantics - is a
workshop being held in conjunction with NAACL-HLT 2009 in Boulder, Colorado. 

Call for Papers

NAACL HLT 2009 Workshop on
Unsupervised and Minimally Supervised Learning of Lexical Semantics
June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado, USA
http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/lls-workshop

New Submission deadline: March 22, 2009 

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working in topics
related to the unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of the semantics 
of lexical items. These include learning of word meanings, learning of lexical
relationships (e.g. hyponym, meronym, antonym learning), learning of idiomatic
and multi-word expressions, learning of bilingual lexicons etc.

Each of these topics have so far been covered in diverse venues eg. WordNet
conferences, SemEval, EMNLP etc. but has lacked a focussed venue that brings
together the issues and methods relevant to lexical semantics within a single
venue. In the past few years there has been a surge of interest in unsupervised
and minimally supervised methods in natural language processing. The proposed
worshop will help focus on methods that are suitable in learning of lexical
semantics.

The workshop format would help speedup development in this area as it will make
it accessible to both experienced researchers and new PhD graduates working in
the field. Another purpose of the workshop will be to make available the
workshop proceedings that should serve as a review of the current
state-of-the-art in the field.

The scope of the workshop will be limited to topics that cover unsupervised and
minimally supervised methods relevant to learning of lexical semantics. The
following is a list of potential topics:

representation, feature selection and parameter tuning for representing word
meanings e.g. bag-of-words context window, syntactic dependency (e.g.
verb-direct object), methods for feature selection (e.g. log likelihood vs
mutual information), issues dealing with sense conflation, measures of
similarity (e.g. distributional similarity), smoothing techniques

unsupervised and minimally supervised induction of word senses including senses
of both single word and multi-word lexical items e.g. uniform methods for both
single and multi-word lexical items, methods for detecting near synonyms, issues
focusing on minimising manual parameter tuning

unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of lexical relations e.g.
learning of hyponomy, antonomy, noun-adjective, meronomy relations

unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of bilingual lexicon e.g.
bootstrapping methods for extending a small bilingual lexicon, use of cognates
in unsupervised bilingual lexicon extraction.
