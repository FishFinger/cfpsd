Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 06-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

This will be a three-day conference organized by ELTAI and the IATEFL Learning
Technologies SIG. The event will host a variety of practical and theoretical
presentations centering on the conference's theme of new and emerging
technologies. The talks and workshops will cater both to experienced and novice
teacher-users of learning technologies. 

Papers addressing a variety of aspects in the application and research of New
and Emerging Technologies in language teaching and learning will be considered.
Main area of interest to the conference is Web 2.0 and its effects on the
learning and teaching of languages. Other proposals which are related to the
general area of learning technologies will also be considered. Sample areas of
interest to the conference are:

- podcast and vodcast technology 
-  implementation of CMC technologies
-  issues in teacher and learner training  
-  blogs and wikis
-  research on implementation and effectiveness of Learning Technologies
-  the use of Virtual Learning Environments  
-  Virtual Worlds

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This three-day workshop on Variation, Gradience, and Frequency in Phonology will
run concurrently with the 2007 Linguistic Institute at Stanford University in
July 2007. The goal is to facilitate the collaboration among phonologists
seeking unified theoretical explanations for qualitative and quantitative
patterns in phonology.

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007

Workshop on Variation, Gradience and Frequency in Phonology

Call for Posters:

The workshop will focus on three main topics:

- Phonological variation
- Gradient phonotactics
- Lexical frequency effects

Phonology studies the sound patterns of human languages. Sound patterns
sometimes emerge as quantitative tendencies and preferences. This can be
illustrated by the following three examples. First, in American English,
word-final /t/ is variably deleted, more often before consonants (''west side'')
than before vowels (''west end''). Second, some sound combinations make better
words than others. This can be seen in the dictionary where some combinations
are statistically overrepresented, others underrepresented, as well as in
experiments where subjects judge some nonsense words to sound more natural than
others (''stin'' > ''smy'' > ''bzharsk''). Third, word frequency influences
phonological patterns. The low-frequency word ''exploit'' has initial stress as
a noun, final stress as a verb, whereas the high-frequency word ''express'' has
final stress under both readings.

Phonological theory has traditionally focused on qualitative patterns.
Quantitative phenomena, such as variation, gradient phonotactics and lexical
frequency effects, have not figured prominently in theoretical discussion. This
is changing. Quantitative studies are becoming common, partly because of new
methodological developments (annotated corpora, sociolinguistic databases,
searchable dialect archives, on-line dictionaries, experimental psycholinguistic
data, new computational tools), and partly because of new theoretical
developments. This has broadened the empirical base of phonology and is likely
to lead to new discoveries and connections to neighboring fields of inquiry.

Abstract Guidelines:

We are soliciting abstracts for posters relevant to any of the topics mentioned
above. Abstracts should be at most one page long on a letter size or A4 sheet
with one-inch margins and typed in at least 12 point font. An optional second
page may be used for data, charts, and references. Abstracts should be submitted
electronically in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format to gmail.com>. The author(s) of
the abstract should not be identified in the abstract itself. The body of the
submission message should include the title of the abstract, the names(s) of the
author(s), the(ir) affiliation(s), and e-mail address(es). Submissions are
limited to one individual and one joint abstract per author, or two joint
abstracts per author.

This workshop is funded by NSF Grant #0647250.  Funding will be available to
help offset the travel costs of student presenters.

Deadline for submission: April 30, 2007. The workshop program will be announced
in early May.

Important Dates:

April 30: Poster abstracts due (send to: variation07gmail.com)
Early May: Notification of acceptance
