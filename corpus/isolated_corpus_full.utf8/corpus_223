Distributed Applications (GADA'06)
   http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/index.html?page=gada2006cfp

                          Montpellier, France
                     October 29 - November 3, 2006
                 http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/

BRIEF OVERVIEW: The current and future software needs are towards the 
development
of large and complex Intelligent Networked Information Systems, covering 
a wide
range of issues (such as Data and Web Semantics, Distributed Objects, 
Web Services,
Grid Computing, High-performance and distributed applications, 
Databases, Workflow,
Cooperation, Interoperability, Mobility) as required for the deployment of
Internet- and Intranet-based systems in organizations and for e-business.
This federated event is unique at providing an opportunity for researchers
and practitioners to understand the recent developments in ubiquitous 
computing....

OnTheMove (OTM) co-locates four successful related and complementary
conferences (DOA = infrastructure, ODBASE = meaning of data, CoopIS = 
application in organizations),
GADA = grid computing, high-performance and distributed applications).
Each of these conferences covers several research aspects, viz. theory 
(e.g. underlying formalisms),
conceptual (e.g. technical and conceptual solutions) and
applications (e.g. case studies and industrial solutions).
