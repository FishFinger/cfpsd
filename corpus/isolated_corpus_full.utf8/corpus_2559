Meeting Description:

Large linguistic databases, especially databases having a global coverage such as The World Atlas of Language Structures (Haspelmath et al. 2005), Jazyki Mira or The Automated Simility Judgment Program (Brown et al., n.d.) are now making it possible to systematically investigate many aspects of how languages change and compete for viability. Agent-based computer simulations supplement such empirical data by analyzing the necessary and sufficient parameters for the current global distributions of languages or linguistic features. By combining empirical datasets with simulations and applying quantitative methods it is now possible to answer fundamental questions concerning language dynamics. The session is intended to bring together scholars who have been building up and analyzing different databases independently of one another or have applied computer simulations in the study of language dynamics such that we may develop our methodologies further and discuss empirical result!

Meeting Description:

The First Oxford Workshop on Romance Verb Morphology will be held in Trinity College, Oxford, UK from 27-28 August 2008 (Wed-Thu). The conference aims to provide a forum for presenting research carried out by the members of the AHRC-funded research project 'Autonomous Morphology in Diachrony: comparative evidence from the Romance languages' at the University of Oxford (http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/romance-morphology/). The focus of this two-day conference will be on basic features of the structure of Romance verb paradigms, especially on the notion of autonomously morphological structures in the Romance inflectional system and their importance in diachronic change in the paradigmatic system. 

Call for Papers

Due to numerous requests, the organisers of OxMorph1 decided to extend the deadline for abstract submission.

The new deadline is the 1st of March, 2008

Invited speakers:
Mark Aronoff (Stony Brook)
Michele Loporcaro (Zürich)

Researchers working on verb morphology in the Romance languages are invited to submit proposals for a special poster session. All abstracts with a length of approximately 500 words must be submitted electronically to oxmorph [at] mod-langs.ox.ac.uk (in the body of the e-mail and as a pdf document) by 1 February 2008. Please use 'Abstract - Name(s) of author(s)' as the Subject header and include, below the abstract, the following information, which should constitute the body of the message:
1. Name(s) of author(s)
2. Affiliation(s)
3. E-mail address(es)
4. Postal address(es)
5. Title. 
As space is limited, researchers and students wishing to attend the workshop should notify the organizers by sending an e-mail to oxmorph [at] mod-langs.ox.ac.uk as soon as possible.
