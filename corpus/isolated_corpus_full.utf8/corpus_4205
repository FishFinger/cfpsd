CALL FOR POSTERS

The 32nd Annual ACM SIGIR Conference July 19-23 2009, Boston, USA

Poster presentations offer researchers a unique opportunity to present  
late-breaking results, significant work in progress, or research that  
is best communicated in an interactive or graphical format. Poster  
presentations further provide researchers with an opportunity to  
obtain direct feedback about their work from a wide audience during  
the poster session.

Poster submissions are welcomed in areas related to any aspect of  
Information Retrieval (IR) as identified in the call for  
contributions. Posters should focus on problems and methodology of the  
presented research. Submissions describing the work will be reviewed  
and the ones accepted will be published in the conference proceedings.  
Please note, however, that posters describing work at the proposal  
stage will not be accepted.

Submissions of extended abstracts for posters must be in English and  
should not exceed 2 pages in SIGIR format (including references and  
figures). Suitable LaTeX and Word templates for SIGIR are available  
from the ACM Website (for LaTeX, use "Option 2").

The only accepted format for submissions is PDF. As with full papers,  
authors should conceal their identity where it is practical to do so.  
Poster papers must be submitted electronically at the poster track of  
the conference submission system. Please see http://sigir2009.org/submitting 
  for submisison information.

POSTER CO-CHAIRS:
Jimmy Lin, University of Maryland, USA
Donald Metzler, Yahoo! Research, USA

IMPORTANT DATES:
Feb 23, 2009 Posters submission deadline
Apr 11, 2009 Author notification of acceptance
