Full Title: Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory 


Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis;Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2009 

Second Call for Special Issue
Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory
3-500 word abstracts due April 15, 2009

Call for abstracts for a special issue on 'Contemporary perspectives on
discourse and corpora: New registers, analyses, texts, and tools' (working
title).
 
Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory (
http://www.degruyter.de/journals/cllt/detail.cfm) publishes original
corpus-based studies focusing on theoretically relevant issues of
linguistic research. The guest editor is inviting abstracts for paper
submissions for a special issue on 'Contemporary perspectives on discourse
and corpora: New registers, analyses, texts, and tools' (working title) to
appear in the next volume in 2010.
 
The aim of the special issue is to promote current research on
theoretically sound discourse analytical aspects of corpus linguistics.
More specifically, the special issue will offer studies exhibiting
state-of-the-art approaches to corpus-based analyses of texts from a range
of contexts. Consistent with the general philosophy of the journal, and
specific to the applied, discourse analytical aspect of linguistics, the
special issue seeks submissions that 
 
-- utilize new corpus-linguistic methods or extensions of existing methods
in analyzing text; 
-- support theories of discourse as they relate to corpus-based text analysis;
-- offer systematic and detailed analyses of lexical, grammatical, and/or
lexico-grammatical patterns in spoken and/or written registers;
-- analyze texts from emerging discourse contexts as they relate to the
theoretical framework of corpus-based register studies;
-- propose new approaches to corpus-based lexical pattern studies as they
relate to discourse structure.
 
All submitted work will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis.
 
The following is our projected timeline:
-- April 15, 2009: 300-500 word abstracts due 
-- April 25, 2009: Invitations to submit/rejections of abstracts
-- September 25, 2009: Papers due
-- February 15, 2010: Final revisions due
 
Please send your abstract to the guest editor of the special issue, Eniko
Csomay, by no later than April 15, 2009 via email ecsomay@mail.sdsu.edu
with a subject heading 'CLLT Special 2010' (abstracts and contact
information should be sent in one attachment but separate sheets and saved
in .pdf or .rtf formats) or by regular mail (to arrive by April 15, 2009)
to the following address:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
