MLMI 2008 second call for papers (apologies for multiple postings):



                 5th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                 and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI 2008)

                         8-10 September 2008
                       Utrecht, The Netherlands

                        http://www.mlmi.info


The fifth MLMI workshop will be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands, =

following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005), =

Washington (2006) and Brno (2007).  The MLMI joint multi-disciplinary =

workshops bring together researchers from the different communities =

working on the common theme of advanced machine learning algorithms =

applied to multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction.

MLMI 2008 will also feature a special session on user requirements and =

evaluation of meeting browsers, and the AMI Career Day.


*Important dates*

Submission of papers/posters: Monday, 31 March 2008
Acceptance notifications: Monday, 12 May 2008
Camera-ready versions of papers: Monday, 16 June 2008
Workshop: 8-10 September 2008


*Workshop topics*

MLMI 2008 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers), =

posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit =

proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine =

learning and multimodal interaction:
  - human-human communication modeling
  - audio-visual perception of humans
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above

The special session on user requirements and evaluation of meeting =

assistants/browsers has a separate call for papers with additional =

topics and a later deadline (check =

http://www.mlmi.info/index.php?id=3Dspecial_session).


*Satellite events*

MLMI 2008 will feature the AMI Career Day =

(http://www.mlmi.info/index.php?id=3Dami_career_day).  To propose other =

special sessions or satellite events, please contact the special session =

chair.

MLMI 2008 is broadly collocated with a number of events in related =

domains: Mobile HCI 2008, 2-5 September, in Amsterdam; FG 2008, 17-19 =

September, in Amsterdam; ECML 2008, 15-19 September, in Antwerp; and =

Measuring Behavior 2008, 26-29 August, in Maastricht.


*Guidelines for submission*

The workshop proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes =

in Computer Science series.  The first four editions of MLMI were =

published as LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299, and 4892.  However, unlike previous =

MLMIs, the proceedings of MLMI 2008 will be printed before the workshop =

and will be already available onsite to MLMI 2008 participants.

Submissions are invited either as long papers (12 pages) or as short =

papers (6 pages), and may include a demonstration proposal.  Upon =

acceptance of a paper, the Program Committee will also assign to it a =

presentation format, oral or poster, taking into account: (a) the most =

suitable format given the content of the paper; (b) the length of the =

paper (long papers are more likely to be presented orally); (c) the =

preferences expressed by the authors.

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at =

http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi08/, following the Springer LNCS format =

for proceedings and other multi-author volumes =

(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D5-164-7-72376-0). =

  Please indicate in the comments for the PC if a demo is intended, and =

if the paper is a special session submission.  Camera-ready versions of =

accepted papers, both long and short, are required to follow the LNCS =

guidelines and to take into account the reviewers' comments.  Authors of =

accepted short papers are encouraged to turn them into long papers for =

the proceedings.


*Venue*

Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands, with historic =

roots back to the Roman Empire.  Utrecht hosts one of the bigger =

universities in the country, and with its historic centre and the many =

students it provides an excellent atmosphere for social activities in- =

or outside the workshop community.  Utrecht is centrally located in the =

Netherlands, and has direct train connections to the major cities and =

Schiphol International Airport.

TNO, organizer of MLMI 2008, is a not-for-profit research organization. =

  TNO speech technological research is carried out in Soesterberg, at =

TNO Human Factors, and has research areas in ASR, speaker and language =

recognition, and word and event spotting.

The workshop will be held in "Ottone", a beautiful old building near the =

"Singel", the canal which encircles the city center.  The conference =

hall combines a spacious setting with a warm and friendly ambiance.
