Cases on Online Discussion and Interaction: Experiences and Outcomes
A book edited by Leonard Shedletsky, Professor, Communication,
University of Southern Maine, USA, and Joan E. Aitken, Professor,
Communication Arts, Park University, USA

To be published by IGI Global: 
http://www.igi-global.com/requests/details.asp?ID=558

Introduction

A close look at online communication takes us headlong into a heated
battleground of strongly held beliefs in relation to people talking to one
another, face-to-face, versus online discussion. Some individuals maintain
that the traditional, face-to-face environment is one of debate,
interaction, and immediacy between human beings, and that online
communication is a cold and inhuman landscape. Others hold that the online
discussion forum extends the opportunity to interact, depth of content, and
sense of selfinvolvement,
which surpasses face-to-face discussion.

As human communication on the Internet includes more and more channels
associated with ordinary, face-to-face communication, for example, sound
and sight, there are now many specific and varied examples of how people
are using online discussion. 

These examples or cases give us the specifics needed to make sense out of
how research and theory are being applied?or not applied?in current
practices. What is the evolving nature of online discussion today? Can we
begin to understand what is likely to make for better and worse online
discussions?

The Overall Objective of the Book:

Cases on Online Discussion and Interaction: Experiences and Outcomes will
attempt to help us better understand how people communicate through online
discussion, what its strengths and weaknesses are, what we can do to
facilitate better discussions, how communication is evolving, and how we
can think about online discussions as we take part in them, lead, moderate
or facilitate them, and find new applications in social and work contexts.
After reading the case studies, the reader should have a good idea of what
is likely to facilitate discussion online, what is likely to encourage
collaborative meaningmaking, which is appropriately productive, supportive,
engaged, and what is likely to foster critical thinking. We wish to draw
together in one book, chapters dealing with an array of research methods,
communication contexts, and philosophical perspectives. The cases will observe
online discussion in
education, business conferences, support groups, social networking, and
public and private discussions of all kinds. Often, authors will find it
useful to compare the online discussion to the more traditional face-to-face
discussion. Hence, this book is going to be useful in helping us better
understand the traditional face-to- face discussion, too. Either one-on-one or
group discussion analysis can provide insight regarding where we are and where
we need to go.

Target Audience:

The prospective audience is the academic audience and the practical world
of users from business, politics, medicine, information technology,
entertainment, short message services, telephony, social networking, and
imagined communities. The readers will be people who want to understand how
online connectivity works, either to add to the research and theory or to
enhance effectiveness of online discussion. 

Table of Contents:
A tentative Table of Contents may be found at:  

http://www.igi-global.com/requests/details.asp?ID=558

Submission Procedure:
Researchers and practitioners are invited to electronically submit a 5-7
page manuscript proposal, which clearly explains the purpose and central
ideas of their proposed case chapter. Prospective authors are welcome to
submit a conference paper, which has potential for revision to a case
chapter. For primary consideration, proposals need to be submitted on or
before January 19, 2009. Potential authors can also submit a draft of a
full case chapter by February 16, 2009.

Each case study chapter will be a detailed account of an individual, group,
organization, or system, though we do not want to count out experimental
research. The detailed example may include personal perspectives of the
author or quotes from people involved.

We do not wish to limit the structure of chapters to one model only, but
one way to organize the chapters is as follows:

-Background of the case, and relevant research and theoretical issues
-Technology Use, advancements, and people described in the case
-Case Description of technology concerns, technology components
management and organizational concerns
-Current Challenges facing the organization and the current status of
the aforementioned challenges and problems
-References
-Additional Readings
-Questions for Discussion

Publisher:

All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis. The
book is scheduled to be published by IGI Global, (Formerly Idea Group
Inc.), www.igiglobal.com, publisher of the Information Science Reference
(formerly ''Idea Group Reference'') and Medical Information Science
Reference imprints. Inquires and submissions can be forwarded
electronically (Word document) or by mail to the contact editor Dr. Leonard
Shedletsky.

Important Dates:
March 31, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
April 15, 2009: Notification of Acceptance
June 15, 2009: Full Chapter Submission
July 30, 2009: Review Result Returned
September 30, 2009: Final Chapter Submission
APA Style Manual.

additional reading list. Inquiries and submissions can be forwarded
