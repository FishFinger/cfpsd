Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

Syntax under lexical rule: the role of clause-embedding predicates 

Call for Papers

Syntax under lexical rule: the role of clause-embedding predicates

The potential lexical impact of predicates on syntax is especially evident in the case of clause-embedding predicates. These may take the form of raising or control predicates (the latter showing predicate-specific control behaviour), question-embedding predicates, predicates that license embedded root clauses or other types of finite or infinite clauses. In addition, these predicates may impose specific restrictions on the morphosyntactic realization of the clausal argument (e.g. case marking, marking by adposition etc.). A non-exhaustive list of issues to be addressed in this workshop is the following:

- Are there systematic classes of clause-embedding predicates?
- Are these classes cross-linguistically stable?
- Are these classes diachronically stable?
- Are these classes defined in syntactic or semantic terms?
- Are there exceptional or idiosyncratic predicates?
- Are there systematic differences between languages that display a big inventory of clause-embedding predicates and languages with a small inventory?
- Which properties of clause-embedding predicates are affected in language contact and change?
- Are there processing differences between various clause-embedding predicates?

We invite contributions from all theoretical approaches, from historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and language contact studies.

Invited Speakers: Katrin Axel (U Saarbrücken), Anastasia Giannakidou (U of Chicago), Pieter Muysken (U Nijmegen), Robert D. Van Valin (U Düsseldorf)

Location: Centre for General Linguistics, Berlin, Germany

Abstracts are invited for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute question period. 

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in 12-point font with 2.5 cm margins, including data and references. Authors are requested to submit two copies of their abstract, one with their name and one anonymous. Abstracts must be submitted as a pdf attachment to the email listed above. The names of the files should be surname-named.pdf and surname-anon.pdf.

The body of the e-mail should contain the following information:
Name(s) of author(s), Title of talk, Affiliation(s), E-mail address(es)

Important Dates:
Submission deadline for abstracts: June 1, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 16, 2008
Workshop: December 12-13, 2008

Organizing Committee: Kerstin Schwabe, Barbara Stiebels, Tonjes Veenstra

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
