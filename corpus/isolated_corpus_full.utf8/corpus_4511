Meeting Description:

From 15 to 20 September 2009, in Beijing, the 24th IVR World Congress will take
place under the title "Global Harmony and the Rule of Law."

The Italian Society for Law and Literature has been entrusted with 
coordinating for the congress a Special Workshop on Law and Literature. 

Call for Papers

Global Harmony and the Rule of Law
24th IVR World Congress
Special Workshop no. 28: Law and Literature

Our idea is to maintain a line of continuity with the workshop's previous 
edition, coordinated by François Ost and Jeanne Gaaker, but in doing so we will
also be looking to address the interests not only of legal philosophers but also
of all those who, coming from different disciplines and cultural backgrounds,
are working to develop the connection between law and literature (and, with a
wider embrace, between law and the humanities too).

We will appreciate your contribution if you are planning to take part in the
initiative, just as it will be a pleasure for us to meet you in Beijing.

The topic chosen for this 24th IVR Congressglobal harmony and the rule of law-
is one that we think lends itself to being effectively investigated on the
interdisciplinary approach that has recently been emerging out of the field of 
study known as Law and Literature.

The growing interest that Law and Literature has been drawing beyond the United
States, not only in Europe but also in the East and in Latin America, has
recently prompted us to establish an association- the Italian Society for Law
and Literature (ISLL), on the Web at www.lawandliterature.org- whose first
objective is to promote reflection on law by looking at it in connection with
literature, taking also into account the contribution that may come from the
broader realm of Law and the Humanities.

The initiative immediately got off to a good international start, with many
scholars joining who represent the philosophy, sociology, and history of law, as
well as a range of legal and literary disciplines; and there are also in this
group a number of jurists and of men and women of letters. Indeed, from many
quarters a need is being expressed to observe the law and the different systems
of law from a more comprehensive perspective capable of affording a greater
understanding of the legal system in relation to its factual reality and to its
possible functions.

Law and Literature became the subject of a special workshop in the last IVR
congress, held in Krakow in 2007 under the excellent stewardship of François Ost
and Jeanne Gaaker.
This year's workshop is meant to proceed in continuity with last year's as
concerns those activities and objectives that are more specifically connected
with Law and Literature, but this is done in such a way as to contribute to the
overall topic the congress is devoted to.

As is known, Law and Literature has developed around three core areas, these
being law in literature, law as literature, and the regulation of literature by
law. While this last area has not gained universal recognition, the first two
(law in literature and law as literature) have flourished with a wealth of
approaches and subjects of study, and these (at their current stage of
development) call for a deep epistemological and methodological reflection as a
way to bring to fruition the experiences of the past and to open new avenues for
the future.

In addition to the subjects more closely connected with Law and Literature, we
also have the use of Law and Literature in teaching: This further development is
valued for its ability to expand our knowledge of law as well as the jurist's
understanding of ethics. And this is taken up with a view to making Law and
Literature a subject of academic study, as is already happening at law schools
across the United States. For these reasons it seems important that, in taking
up the specific issues covered under the convention's overall heading of global
harmony and the rule of law, the possibility should emerge of also exploring the
new directions just briefly outlined.

By way of a final note, it will also be possible to find a wide audience for the
work emerging out of the workshop, this by publishing the work in international
journals in legal philosophy and the general theory of law.

A note on the workshop's languages
We are well aware that English is the official language of the congress but- in
the effort to establish a line of continuity with the previous Law and
Literature workshop, coordinated by our colleagues François Ost and Jeanne
Gaaker- we would like to leave open the possibility for participants to express
themselves in one of the four official IVR languages (English, French, German,
and Spanish) for this special workshop in particular.

A notice by the Organizing Committee
The deadline for sending in the abstracts of papers to be presented at the
workshop is June 15, 2009. Abstracts should be about 1,000 to 4,000 words long.
And the deadline for submitting the papers themselves is July 15, 2009.

All the abstracts and papers for the special workshops will be published on the
congress website at www.ivr2009.com.

Meeting Description:

MCLC is a gathering for computational linguists from all subfields to present
work in progress in a less formal setting. 

Call for Papers

The Sixth Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-09)

MCLC offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics researchers to get
together and present ideas and research results. It is intended to be primarily
for researchers from the Midwest region, but applications from all regions are
welcome.  We particularly welcome work in progress from graduate students and
other young researchers.  The first meeting of MCLC was successfully held at
Indiana University, Bloomington in 2004, and we're pleased to bring it back to
Indiana.
http://cl.indiana.edu/~mclc09/

Submission Guidelines
- Researchers should prepare a 2-page, extended abstract using the ACL style files.
- The abstract should be anonymous.
- Abstracts should be emailed to mclc09@indiana.edu no later than March 27,
2009. The abstract should be in .pdf format.

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. The major criteria of
evaluation will be the originality, soundness, and clarity of the research idea
presented and the relevance of the topic to the colloquium.

Registration
Registration will be free.

Publication
Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited (but not required) to submit a 4-8
page full paper using the ACL style files for the proceedings. Copyright of a
submitted paper remains with the author(s).
