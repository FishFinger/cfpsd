CONFERENCE OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

EIAE 2008 provides a virtual forum for presentation and discussion of the
state-of the-art research on Engineering Education, Instructional
Technology, Assessment, and E-learning and IETA 2008 provides a forum for
presentation and discussion of the state-of the-art research on Industrial
Electronics, Technology & Automation. EIAE 2008 and IETA 2008 are
sub-confernces in the CISSE series of international joint e-conferences.
CISSE is the World's first Engineering / Computing and Systems Research
E-Conference. CISSE 2005 was the first high-caliber Research Conference in
the world to be completely conducted online in real-time via the internet.
CISSE 2005 received 255 research paper submissions and the final program
included 140 accepted papers, from more than 45 countries. CISSE 2006
received 691 research paper submissions and the final program included 390
accepted papers, from more than 70 countries. CISSE 2007 received 750
research paper submissions and the final program included 406 accepted
papers, from more than 80 countries.


The virtual conference will be conducted through the Internet using
web-conferencing tools, made available by the conference. Authors will be
presenting their PowerPoint, audio or video presentations using
web-conferencing tools without the need for travel. Conference sessions
will be broadcast to all the conference participants, where session
participants can interact with the presenter during the presentation and
(or) during the Q&A slot that follows the presentation. This international
conference will be held entirely on-line. The accepted and presented papers
will be made available and sent to the authors after the conference both on
a DVD (including all papers, powerpoint presentations and audio
presentations) and as a book publication. Springer, the official publisher
for CISSE, published the 2005 proceedings in two books and the CISSE 2006
and CISSE 2007 proceedings in four books.


Conference participants - authors, presenters and attendees - only need an
internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be
able to contribute and participate in this international ground-breaking
conference. The on-line structure of this high-quality event will allow
academic professionals and industry participants to contribute their work
and attend world-class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed
submissions, live, without the need for investing significant travel funds
or time out of the office.


The concept and format of CISSE is ground-breaking. The PowerPoint
presentations, final paper manuscripts and time schedule for live
presentations over the web are available for weeks prior to the start of
the conference for all registrants, so that the participants can choose the
presentations they want to attend and think about questions that they might
want to ask. The live audio presentations are also recorded and are part of
the permanent CISSE on-line archive - accessible to all registrants - which
also includes all the papers, PowerPoint and audio presentations.


Potential non-author conference attendees who cannot make the on-line
conference dates are encouraged to register, as the entire joint
conferences will be archived for future viewing.


The CISSE conference audio room provides superb audio even over low speed
internet connections, the ability to display PowerPoint presentations, and
cross-platform compatibility (the conferencing software runs on Windows,
Mac, and any other operating system that supports Java). In addition, the
conferencing system allowed for an unlimited number of participants, which
in turn granted us the opportunity to allow all CISSE participants to
attend all presentations, as opposed to limiting the number of available
seats for each session.


Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in
Microsoft Word format through the website of the conference at

Accepted papers must be presented in the virtual conference by one of the
