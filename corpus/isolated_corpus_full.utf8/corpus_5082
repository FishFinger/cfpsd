Meeting Description:

SNLP is an international conference held biannually since 1993 with the
cooperative effort of a number of universities in Thailand. It is aimed to
promote research in natural language processing by bringing together researchers
and practitioners in the field to exchange ideas and present results from
research in natural language processing and various related fields among Pacific
Rim countries and regions. The emphasis of the conference is on
interdisciplinary scientific exchange demonstrating openness towards
high-quality research falling outside current dominant schools of thought, and
on technological transfer within the world wide region.
