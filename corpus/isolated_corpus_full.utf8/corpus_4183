                     Middle English (enm)

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

You are cordially invited to participate and to offer a presentation on
historical English corpus linguistics from Middle English to Late Modern
English. Given the relatively long period at issue, from 1150 to 2000, we would
like to encourage topics with a decidedly methodological or innovative focus,
both in corpus compilation and exploitation. 

Call for Papers

Innsbruck is a suitable place for a conference on historical English corpus
linguistics, not only due to its location and its being a beauty spot, but also
in view of the local corpus linguistic activities of the English Department in
the past. Within the Innsbruck Computer Archive of Machine-Readable English
Texts (ICAMET), two corpora have been compiled: the Innsbruck Middle English
Prose Corpus and the Innsbruck Letter Corpus. Moreover, a government-funded
project Spoken English in Early Dialects (SPEED) was started in 2006 and is
still running. It is concerned with the digitisation and exploitation of Joseph
Wright's English Dialect Dictionary. EDD Online is already available as of 1
August 2008 in a beta version.

While we would wish to encourage studies based on any of the Innsbruck corpora,
there is no restriction on the corpus linguistic basis of your paper.
Please submit your proposal for a paper (20 minutes and 10 minutes discussion)
in the form of a 200- to 300-word abstract to

manfred.markus@uibk.ac.at - or to
christine.kreinig@uibk.ac.at

by 15 February 2009. Decisions on the acceptance of proposals can be expected
six weeks later.
