Second HCSNet Next Generation Search Workshop -- NGS07

Macquarie University
19-20 July 2007

http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/next-gen-search07

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS


BACKGROUND

Existing information retrieval systems effectively treat documents as
unstructured bags of words. As current Web search engines demonstrate,
this approach works surprisingly well. At the same time, it is clear
that human processors of information make use of a much deeper
understanding of text than these systems exhibit. Humans cannot
compete with machines in terms of quantity, but their abilities far
exceed those of machines when it comes to quality.

Linguistics treats texts as richly structured objects that obey
complex and interacting rules about language use, and natural language
processing attempts to implement computational models that embody
these ideas: how do we add this sophistication to information
retrieval in a way that scales and which delivers better results? Are
there insights from the cognitive sciences that can tell us how to
build better tools for finding information?  How do we extend these
technologies when the data we are concerned with includes audio and
video as well as text?

The aim of HCSNet's Priority Research Area in Next Generation Search
is to bring together researches from a wide range of disciplines to
address these questions.  At our first workshop in September 2006 at
the University of Melbourne, initial groundwork was laid via a
collection of short presentations aimed at knowledge sharing across
communities; see
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2006/next-gen-search.  At this
second workshop, our aim is for participants to gain a deeper
understanding of each others' work.


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to gather people from all areas of
research, development and industry. We welcome people from academia
and industry with interest in any area related to innovative methods
for search, including but not limited to the following:

    * Cognitive Science
    * Natural language Processing and Language Technology
    * Information Retrieval
    * Human-computer Interaction
    * Data Mining
    * Formal Syntax and Morphology
    * Formal Semantics
    * Conversational and Discourse Analysis
    * Music Information Retrieval
    * Philosophy of Language


WORKSHOP FORMAT

Our main aim is to further develop grounds for collaboration across
the NGS community.  Accordingly, the workshop will consist of a number
of presentations of different types with this focus in mind:

  - 30 minute project presentations which aim to give a detailed
    'under-the-covers' understanding of how the technology used in
    current projects actually works, with the objective of building
    upon the knowledge sharing achieved at last year's workshop; and

  - 10 minute speed presentations that describe a new project or
    specific idea to be shared with the community, with the aim of
    encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration; and

  - 10 minute student project presentations, with the aim of informing
    the community of new ideas being developed, and to get feedback
    from an interdisciplinary audience.

The schedule will include ample time for discussion and networking.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATION

There will be a keynote presentation by Brett Poole, Head of Search of
Yahoo!7.

Brett began his career with a variety of roles in commercial web
development where he was responsible for all facets of production
including planning, designing, building and marketing of client
websites.

In 2001, Brett was appointed as search product manager at
Hitwise. During this time he focused on creating unique search
marketing strategies for key clients by integrating website consulting
and sponsored search solutions.

 From there, Brett joined Yahoo! Australia & NZ in July 2004 as Search
Producer, responsible for the technical integrity and local relevance
of the Yahoo!'s search offering.

In January 2005, he was appointed to Product Manager of Search under
the newly formed Yahoo!7, and in 2006 Brett became the Head of
Search. Brett is charged with the ongoing development and direction of
Yahoo! search, and his achievements include the successful launch of
Yahoo!7 Answers and Video Search in the Australian market.


SUBMISSIONS

We want to involve as many as possible in discussion, so the effort
required for attendance is deliberately small.

  - Those interested in making a project presentation should submit a
    half-page description of the project to be described.

  - Those interested in making a speed presentation or student
    presentation should submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in
    length.

In addition, we ask all those interested in attending to submit a
100-150 word statement indicating their research interests pertinent
to the workshop theme.  These will be made available as part of the
workshop materials.

Please send all submissions as indicated on the website (still TBA).


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation for a number of participants
from outside the Sydney area. The provision of a submission as
described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants
can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based on the relevance
of your abstract to the workshop theme; also, early career researchers
(in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in the last ten
years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Syndey area. To apply for this
funding stream, send a short CV in plain text to the email addresses
below by the date of submission.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior
registration will be required.


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of Abstracts 8 June 2007
    * Notification of Awards 15 June 2007
    * Workshop 19-20 July 2007
