ETC - EMPIRICAL TEXT AND CULTURE RESEARCH

ISSN 1617-8912

Dedicated to quantitative empirical studies of culture

Published by RAM-Verlag

----------

Editorial board:

SCOPE

The purpose of ETC is to publish culturally oriented research that is =
both empirical and quantitative in its approach.

'Culture' is understood by ETC to encompass both 'high' culture (such as =
literature, art, and music) and the many aspects of everyday life - for =
instance, fashion and cuisine. The 'world views' of different cultures =
and sub-cultures, and the relationship between language and culture, =
will also be key issues for the journal.

Whilst work within the framework of systems-theoretic constructivist =
research is especially welcome, ETC aims to publish all forms of =
empirical quantitative research that fit its general parameters - for =
example, corpus-based research; computer-assisted content analyses; =
semantic differential studies; studies using sentence completion or word =
association techniques; and so on.

ETC will normally not publish papers of a purely theoretical or =
qualitative nature, unless their implications for quantitative empirical =
research are very clear.


ARTICLE CATEGORIES

ETC accepts the following kinds of articles:

* full-length papers (approximately 10 to 20 double-spaced pages)
* short notes (around 5 pages or less)
* reviews of relevant books, software, conferences, etc.
* historical and biographical studies related to empirical cultural =
research

If anyone is unsure about the suitability of their topic or approach for =
ETC, they are invited to send a short structured abstract to the editor =
in advance of a formal submission.

From time to time, the editorial board may actively commission articles =
or reviews.


LANGUAGE POLICY

For the journal to have the maximum international impact, only papers =
written in English will be published in ETC.


PEER REVIEW

All papers will be peer reviewed by at least one member of the editorial =
board or by another qualified person appointed by them. We will aim to =
move swiftly and normally provide a response within one month of =
submission.


SUBMITTING YOUR MANUSCRIPT

Manuscripts should be submitted to the Editor at the contact address =
shown overleaf.

Authors should submit one printed copy of their manuscript, together =
with an electronic copy in either MS Word or RTF format. The electronic =
copy may be submitted by e-mail.

Manuscripts should be accompanied by a covering letter stating that the =
content of the article has not previously been published and is not =
being concurrently submitted elsewhere.

Layout and referencing should follow the style guidelines of the =
American Psychological Association.
