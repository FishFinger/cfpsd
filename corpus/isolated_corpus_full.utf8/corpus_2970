QUEER EXCURSIONS: NEW DIRECTIONS IN LANGUAGE, GENDER AND SEXUALITY RESEARCH

Editors: Jenny Davis, Joshua Raclaw, and Lal Zimman (Department of
Linguistics, University of Colorado at Boulder)

Submissions are invited for a new edited volume in the field of language,
gender, and sexuality that seeks to expand the present scope of these
research areas. The volume will showcase work that considers how speakers
(re)produce gender and sexuality outside of the traditional dichotomies
that have been dominant in both scholarship and popular discourses. Topics
of chapters currently under consideration focus on issues of linguistic
practice among understudied communities such as female-to-male
transsexuals, genderqueer individuals, tomboys and their girlfriends in
Indonesia, polyamorists and other non-monogamists, and members of Native
American two-spirit groups; additionally, much of this work underscores the
theoretical limitations of a sociolinguistics driven by binary
categorization. The editors welcome abstracts from scholars working within
various disciplinary traditions, including sociolinguistics, linguistic
anthropology, discourse and rhetorical analysis, gender and queer studies,
and others.  


Background:

The past two decades have seen a significant rise in what has been termed a
poststructuralist sociolinguistics, a shift reflected in the adoption of a
wide range of third-wave feminist and queer stances within language, gender
and sexuality research. Adopting the trend toward critical examination of
the dominant dichotomization of gender and sexuality, researchers within
the last decade have considered additional intersections such as class and
ethnicity, have deconstructed the traditional primacy assigned to
male/female difference, and have established the importance of examining
queer subjecthood. Yet research that looks at gender and sexuality as
positioned outside of dichotomous categorizations - such as transgenderism
and transsexuality, third and fourth gender categories, bisexuality and
pansexuality - has been less forthcoming. Indeed, with few exceptions, the
field has paid little attention to how social actors might challenge such
binary categories through linguistic means, or to how speakers enact
gendered and sexual identities outside of the dominant categories of male
and female, heterosexual and homosexual. Rather than just constituting a
simple gap in the literature, such trends potentially contribute to the
reinforcement of traditional gender and sexual dichotomies by reinforcing
the invisibility of those groups and individuals that remain outside of
them (cf. Bing and Bergvall 1996).


Submission Guidelines:

Potential contributors should email a 500-1000 word abstract, including a
title and a description of the topic of the proposed chapter, theoretical
frameworks and methodologies employed, and how this work is situated
outside of, or provides new insight into or potential challenges to, the
binaries discussed above. Complete manuscripts are also welcome for
submission at this time. Please restrict these submissions to a maximum
length of 10,000 words and follow the Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics
(located at
http://www.linguistlist.org/pubs/tocs/JournalUnifiedStyleSheet2007.pdf).

Abstracts due June 30, 2008.
First round of full drafts due September 1, 2008.
