Full Title: NELS 40  Semantics Special Session 

Date: 15-Nov-2009 - 15-Nov-2009
Location: Cambridge, MA, USA 
Contact Person: Pritty Patel-Grosz
Meeting Email: pritty@mit.edu
Web Site: http://web.mit.edu/nels40/nels40/home.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Pragmatics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 21-Aug-2009 

Meeting Description:

Pronouns can vary along two dimensions: semantic (e.g., free vs. (syntactically)
bound vs. e-type pronouns) and formal, i.e. morpho-syntactic or phonological
(e.g., personal vs. clitic vs. null vs. demonstrative pronouns). Both dimensions
have been studied a lot, but not always with consideration for the other
dimension. The goal of this workshop is to bring together recent advances
bearing exactly on the interplay of the two, e.g. how do choices along one
dimension restrict the possible choices along the other one? 

More specifically, questions like the following should be addressed for
different languages: Are null pronouns more or less likely to be bound than
overt pronouns and why? Are weak pronouns more or less likely to receive an
e-type interpretation than strong pronouns and why? How do demonstrative
pronouns behave cross-linguistically, and to what extent do their binding
properties differ from those of personal pronouns within a certain language?
Does the semantics of clitic pronouns differ from that of non-clitic pronouns?
How many types of null pronouns are there (both within one language and across
languages)? Do formal similarities between pronouns and determiners entail
parallel semantic similarities? Do formal classes of pronouns impose different
grammatical constraints on their antecedents?

Call for Papers:

Ideal submissions to this workshop might involve approaches to questions like
the above such as the following (individually or in combination):

- Formal approaches to different aspects of pronominal semantics in a language
other than English.
- Empirical discussions of novel facts relevant for the interface between
pronominal form and pronominal semantics.
- Extensions or modifications of current semantic approaches to pronouns
accommodating other pronominal classes (e.g. null pronouns, demonstratives). 

We invite submissions for 30 minute talks, followed by 10 minutes of comments
and 10 minutes of questions and answers. The authors of accepted submissions
will be asked to prepare a draft of the talk which can be sent to the
commentator at least two weeks before the conference. General NELS guidelines
for abstracts apply: abstracts must be anonymous, in pdf format, 2-page (A4 or
letter), in font no less than 11 points and with margins of 1 inch/2.5 cm.  The
link for submitting abstracts is http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/nels40-sem. 

The deadline is August 21st, 2009.
