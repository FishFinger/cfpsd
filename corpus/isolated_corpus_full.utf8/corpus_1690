Meeting Description:

Using Corpora for NLG: Language Generation and Machine Translation UCNLG+MT is a
pre-conference workshop at MT Summit XI, to be held in Copenhagen on 11
September 2007. Continuing from UCNLG'05, the workshop's general focus is
data-based methods for language generation and their evaluation. This year the
special theme is Language Generation and Machine Translation with which we aim
to explore crossover points and potential for cross-fertilisation between MT and
NLG. 

UCNLG+MT - Final Call for Abstracts for Special Session on NLG and MT

(see section ''Discussion Session on Language Generation and MT'' below)

About UCNLG+MT:

Using Corpora for NLG: Language Generation and MT (UCNLG+MT) is a
pre-conference workshop at MT Summit XI, to be held in Copenhagen, 11
September 2007.

There are many branches of NLP research where language is generated (MT,
summarisation, human-computer dialogue, data-to-text generation, document
authoring, etc.).  However, for the most part, these form separate research
communities and the field called ''Natural Language Generation (NLG)'' is to
some degree isolated from many of them.

The UCNLG workshops have the general aims

1. to provide a forum for reporting and discussing data-based methods for
generating language in all areas of application;
2. to open up the NLG research field to neighbouring areas in NLP and to foster
cross-fertilisation between these research fields;
and
3. to promote the sharing of data in NLG and the use of data-based methods of
evaluation.

The special theme of this second UCNLG workshop is Language Generation and
MT. Target language generation is typically given less attention than other
aspects of MT, such as evaluation, source language analysis and transfer. 
Recently there has been increasing interest in combining linguistic knowledge
with statistical MT. Conversely, NLG -- where symbolic approaches have long
dominated -- has seen increasing interest in probabilistic methods. With this
special theme, we would like to explore crossover points and potential for
cross-fertilisation between MT and NLG.

Invited Speaker:

Kevin Knight, ISI, University of Southern California, US, will present
the keynote address.

Discussion Session on Language Generation and MT:

There will be a discussion session on the special theme of the workshop,
Language Generation and Machine Translation. It is intended as a discussion
forum where people can present short 'opinion pieces' on the special theme.
Possible topics include, but are by no means limited to, the following:

- common research agenda for NLG and MT
- given the `more data is better data' mantra of statistical MT, what space is
there for linguistically motivated generation?
- can a shared task be defined that would interest both NLG and MT researchers?
- data resources that can be shared between NLG and MT
- methods and tools that can be used for NLG and MT

We invite submissions of extended abstracts for this session which should be up
to 2 pages long and follow the ACL'07 guidelines using the style files provided
at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/. Abstracts should be sent in PDF
format by email to ucnlg@itri.brighton.ac.uk no later than July 1. Submissions
will be reviewed by at least two members of the programme committee, to ensure
appropriateness of content. If there are more submissions than we can
accommodate, then the workshop organisers will make a selection based on the
reviews. Extended abstracts will be included in the workshop proceedings.

Proceedings:

The proceedings of the workshop will be published by the MT Summit XI conference
organisers, in a companion volume to the main conference proceedings.

Important Dates:

01 July - Submission deadline for extended abstracts for Discussion Session on
NLG and MT
09 July - Notification of acceptance to authors of extended abstracts for
Discussion Session on NLG and MT
20 July - Camera-ready copy from all authors
11 September - UCNLG+MT in Copenhagen

Full Title: Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems 

Date: 01-Sep-2007 - 01-Sep-2007
Location: Antwerp, Belgium 
Contact Person: Hartwig Holzapfel

Call Deadline: 14-Jul-2007 

Meeting Description

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual workshop
designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working in research
related to spoken dialogue systems. The roundtable provides an open forum where
participants can discuss their research interests, current work and future plans. 

YRR-2007: Call for participation

Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems
September 3, 2007, Antwerp, Belgium

Attention: This workshop date has changed to September 3rd.

Because SIGdial has been rescheduled, we have decided to move our workshop from
Sept 1st (as previously advertised) to the new date of Sept 3rd to allow
participants to join both workshops.

Second Call for Participation

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual workshop
designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working in research
related to spoken dialogue systems. The roundtable provides an open forum where
participants can discuss relevant research problems and identify issues that are
likely to be important in the coming years. The workshop is meant to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about current issues in spoken
dialogue systems research, and help create a stronger international network of
young researchers working in the field. The workshop is co-located with
Interspeech 2007 and will occur the day after the 8th SIGdial workshop.

Workshop Format

The workshop will consist of an introductory session, two sets of discussion
sessions followed by plenary summaries, a panel and a social activity. The
discussion sessions will be composed of 4-5 groups running in parallel working
with topics, relevant publications, and goals identified by participants prior
to the day of the workshop. After each discussion session, all workshop
participants will reconvene to summarize and present their results. After the
last session a panel of senior researchers will follow to discuss the topic:
''Advice to a Young Dialogue Researcher.'' Coffee Breaks, Lunch, and Dinner will
be provided during the day.

Submission Process

We invite participation from students, post docs, and junior researchers who are
currently working in spoken dialog systems research. We also invite
participation from those who are working in related fields such as linguistics,
psychology, or speech processing, as applied to spoken dialogue systems.  Please
note that by 'young researchers' the workshop's organizers mean to target
students and researchers in the field who are at a relatively early stage of
their careers, and in no way mean to imply that participants must meet certain
age restrictions.

Potential participants should submit a 2-page position paper and suggest topics
for discussion. A template and specific submission instructions are available on
http://www.yrrsds.org/. After participants are accepted to the workshop, they
will be directed to an online resource to sign up for the discussion sessions of
their choice. They will be encouraged to provide specific agenda for the
discussions, as well as representative publications and suggested goals for the
discussion session.

Submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis until the maximum number of
participants for the workshop (50) is reached, or until the submission deadline
(July 14th, 2007) is reached. Proceedings from previous years' workshops are
also available on our web site. Specific questions can be directed to the
organizing committee at yrr-organizers07 at ira dot uka dot de.
