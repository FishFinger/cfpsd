The 18th International Postgraduate Linguistics Conference

In March 1992 the Department of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures at The
University of Manchester hosted its first Postgraduate Linguistics Conference.
Since then this annual event has grown, now drawing participants from across the
world to exchange ideas in a relaxed but stimulating environment. 

The aim of the Conference is to bring together postgraduates from within the
various areas of the discipline of Linguistics and to allow them to present
papers to their peers. It is hoped that the day will be rewarding for all in
attendance, both in sharing their research findings and establishing new networks. 

We are very pleased to announce the invited plenary speakers for the
conference:
Professor David Crystal, Bangor University
Professor Eva Schultze-Berndt, University of Manchester

Abstract/Poster Submission - deadline February 15, 2009
We invite abstracts for paper and poster presentations in any field of
linguistics. Abstracts should be no more than 250 words and should be sent by
email as an attachment (in a PDF file) to plc@manchester.ac.uk.

Each paper will be allocated 30 minutes (20 minutes for presentation and 10
minutes for questions). The time limit will be strictly adhered to, in order to
allow transitions between sessions. In your email, please indicate what
audio-visual equipment you will require for your presentation. 

There will be a dedicated poster session on the day of the conference. 
Speakers will also be invited to submit their paper for publication in the
conference proceedings.

Notification of Acceptance: March 10, 2009
Registration deadline: 27 March, 2009

Workshop:  Reconstructing Alignment Systems
14-15 May, 2009
University of Bergen, Norway

Invited Speakers:
Alice Harris (Stony Brook University)
Geoffrey Haig (University of Kiel)

Abstract Submission Deadline: 20 January, 2009

Workshop URL: http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP/Workshop3.htm

The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers working on alignment systems
in a historical perspective, in order to brainstorm on how alignment systems can
be reconstructed for earlier stages of a language or a language family. We
welcome abstracts on well-studied language families like Indo-European,
abstracts on oral languages without a recorded history, and everything in
between, aiming to highlight different kinds of reconstruction problems. We also
welcome papers on changes in alignment systems, papers addressing the issue of
how different theoretical frameworks can contribute to reconstruction, as well
as papers concerned with the more general implications of alignment changes for
diachronic typology.

Please send a one page abstract in pdf format to Thomas
Smitherman(Thomas.Smitherman@uib.no) no later than January 20th.
Notification of acceptance will be sent out soon thereafter.

The workshop is hosted by the University of Bergen and the research team of the
project, Indo-European Case and Argument Structure from a Typological
Perspective (IECASTP): http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP

Location: University of Bergen
Vilvite Bergen Vitensenter AS (Auditorium)
Thormøhlengate 51
