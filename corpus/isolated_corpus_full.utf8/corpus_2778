WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

NLP-based applications have had a profound effect on education in the areas=
 of
assessment and instruction. Early applications focused on writing for autom=
ated
essay scoring, short-answer response scoring in assessment and intelligent =

tutoring, and grammatical error detection for proofreading. More recently, =
NLP =

has been introduced into additional educational contexts, including automat=
ed =

scoring of speech and text-based curriculum development for reading support=
. In =

addition, the earlier applications for grammatical error detection have gre=
atly =

improved. Not only has the field improved existing capabilities, but as a =

community we are generating innovative and creative ways to use NLP in =

applications for multiple skill sets, including writing, reading, and speak=
ing.

The need for, and the rapid development of, language-based capability
development in the United States and other Anglophone countries are driven =
by =

increased requirements for state/national assessments and a growing populat=
ion =

of English language learners. In the past five years, steady growth in the =
area =

of NLP-based applications for education has prompted an increased number of =

workshops which typically focus on one specific aspect of NLP-based educati=
onal =

applications. In this workshop, we solicit papers from all subfields.

We intend to bring all subfields together to foster continued interaction a=
nd =

collaboration among researchers in both academic institutions and industry. =

This workshop (consistent with previous workshops at ACL 1997, NAACL/HLT 20=
03, =

and ACL 2005) will continue to expose the NLP research community to these =

technologies with the hope that they continue to identify novel opportuniti=
es =

for the use of NLP tools in educational applications.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

For this workshop, we invite submissions including, but not limited to:

1) Automated Scoring/Evaluation for Text and Speech
      * Automated processing of spoken and written lecture materials across
        genres, e.g., - Content-based analysis - Grammatical error detection
        - Response-based discourse analysis - Stylistic analysis
      * Knowledge representation in learning systems
      * Machine translation for assessment, instruction, and curriculum
        development
      * Plagiarism detection tools

2) Intelligent Tutoring
      * Intelligent tutoring systems that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP
        methods to evaluate response content, using either text- or
        speech-based analyses
      * Dialogue systems in education
      * Hypothesis formation and testing in automated tutoring systems
      * Multi-modal communication between human learners and machines
      * Automatically generating tutorial responses

3) Learner Cognition
      * Automated assessment of students' language and cognitive skill leve=
ls
      * Automated systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or
        emotional states
      * Automatic generation of test questions
      * Tools for learners with special needs


4) Corpora and annotation standards for building NLP educational tools

5) Use of Response Databases
      * Data mining of student corpora for tool building
      * Visualization of concepts in learning systems

6) Classroom Tools
      * NLP tools for second language learners
      * Semantic-based access to instructional materials
      * Tools for teachers and test developers (such as tools that
        automatically identify text on a given topic, or adapt a text to the
        grade level of the student, or assist in text-based curriculum
        development)
      * E-learning tools for personalized course content

7) Evaluation of NLP-based tools for education

8) Descriptions of Working Systems


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, =
PDF =

format (with up to 1 additional page for references). Previously published =

papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program =

committee.  As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are =

anonymous.  Self-references that reveal the author's identity,
e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead,=
 use =

citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Please use the ACL style sheet for composing your paper:

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: March 14, 2008
Notification of acceptance: April 07, 2008
Final papers due: April 21, 2008
Workshop: either June 19 or 20, 2008
