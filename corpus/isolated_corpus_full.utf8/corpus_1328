Web Site: http://www.iccsl3.com 

Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics; General Linguistics;
Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
The colloquium is to discuss issues of language and ethnic identities in the
contexts of globalization and urbanization. In the world today we see sweeping
trends of industrialization and urbanization of unprecedented scales. These
bring in tremendous amounts of population movement, ethnic contact and mixture,
and cross-cultural communication, and with all their concatenated problems. A
recently-developed field of research, Urban Language Survey, as is called
sometimes, is a cross-disciplinary attempt to address the relevant issues, with
a focus on the roles of language in the dynamic process of urbanization.
Progress has been made in areas such as typological studies of urban and rural
language situations, the formation process of urban speech communities, migrant
speech communities, communication problems in urban encounters, etc. These areas
of study have attracted researchers of different disciplines from various parts
of the world. The researchers address questions of general linguistics and
sociolinguistics, while keeping a practical interest in upholding cultural
diversity and ethnic harmony.
The colloquium is part of ICAES16. 

The 16th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethological Sciences
(ICAES) will be held in July 2008, in Kunming, China. Under the main theme of
''Humanity, Development and Cultural Diversity'', 150 organizational sessions
and academic sessions will be held. Colloquium on Language, Urbanization, and
Ethnic Identities will be part of ICAES 16th. 

Colloquium theme: Language, Urbanization, and Ethnic Identities 
The colloquium focuses on issues of language and ethnic identities in the
contexts of globalization and urbanization, including non-exclusively topics
such as ethnic language contact and mixture, cross-cultural communication, urban
speech communities, migrant speech communities, communication problems in urban
encounters, etc. 

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (followed by 10 minutes for questions)
addressing any topic in the area of ''Language, Urbanization, and Cultural
Diversity''. Related issues are also welcome.

The organizing committee for the colloquium consists of Xu Daming of Nanjing
