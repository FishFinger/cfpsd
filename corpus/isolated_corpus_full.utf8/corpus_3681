It is generally agreed upon that "linguistic creativity" is a unique =

property of human language. Some claim that linguistic creativity is =

expressed in our ability to combine known words in a new sentence, others =

refer to our skill to express thoughts in figurative language, and yet =

others talk about syntactic recursion and lexical creativity.

For the purpose of this workshop, we treat the term "linguistic =

creativity" to mean "creative language usage at different levels", from =

the lexicon to syntax to discourse and text (see also topics, below).

The recognition of instances of linguistic creativity and the computation =

of their meaning constitute one of the most challenging problems for a =

variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation, =

text summarization, information retrieval, question answering, and =

sentiment analysis. Computational systems incorporating models of =

linguistic creativity operate on different types of data (including =

written text, audio/speech/sound, and video/images/gestures). New =

approaches might combine information from different modalities. =

Creativity-aware systems will improve the contribution Computational =

Linguistics has to offer to many practical areas, including education, =

entertainment, and engineering.

Within the scope of the workshop, the event is intended to be =

interdisciplinary. Besides contributions from an NLP perspective, we also =

welcome the participation of researchers who deal with linguistic =

creativity from different perspectives, including psychology, =

neuroscience, or human-computer interaction.


Location

The CALC-09 workshop will be held in conjunction with NAACL HLT 2009 in =

Boulder, Colorado.

Topics

We are particularly interested in work on the automatic detection, =

classification, understanding, or generation of:

     * neologisms;
     * figurative language, including metaphor, metonymy, personification,
      idioms;
     * new or unconventional syntactic constructions ("May I serve who's
       next?") and constructions defying traditional parsers (e.g. gapping:
      "Many words were spoken, and sentiments expressed");
     * indirect speech acts (such as curses, insults, sarcasm and irony);
     * verbally expressed humor;
     * poetry and fiction;
     * and other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity.

Depending on the state of the art of approaches to the various phenomena =

and languages, preference will be given to work on deeper processing =

(e.g., understanding, goal-driven generation) rather than shallow =

approaches (e.g., binary classication, random generation). We also welcome =

descriptions and discussions of:

     * computational tools that support people in using language creatively
       (e.g. tools for computer-assisted creative writing, intelligent thes=
auri);
     * computational and/or cognitive models of linguistic creativity;
     * metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware
       systems
     * specific application scenarios of computational linguistic creativit=
y;
     * design and implementation of creativity-aware systems.

Related topics, including corpora collection, elicitation, and annotation =

of creative language usage, will also be considered, as long as their =

relevance to automatic systems is clearly pointed out.


Invited Speaker :      Nick Montfort, MIT


Submissions

Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers are limited =

to 8 pages. The style files will be available here soon. No author =

information should be included in the papers, since reviewing will be =

blind. Papers not conforming to these requirements are subject to =

rejection without review. Papers should be submitted via START; more =

information on this will be available here as well.

We encourage submissions from everyone. For those how are new to ACL =

conferences and workshops, or with special needs, we are planning to set =

up a lunch mentoring program. Let us know if you are interested. Also, a =

limited number of student travel grants might become available, intended =

for individuals with minority background and current residents of =

countries where conference travel funding is usually hard to find.
