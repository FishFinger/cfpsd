Competence teaching and learning. 

Call for Papers

Keynote Speaker: Dr. Claire Kramsch-University of California, Berkley. 
Globalization, having brought individuals in contact with one another at an
unprecedented scale, has also brought forth a general challenge to traditionally
recognized boundaries of nation, language, race, gender, and class. 

For those living within this rapidly changing social landscape, intercultural
competence is a necessary skill, and the cultivation of such intercultural
individuals
falls on the shoulders of today's educators. They should provide students with
opportunities to help them define and design for themselves their 'third place'
or 'third culture,' a sphere of interculturality that enables language students
to take an insider's view as well as an outsider's view on both their first and
second cultures. It is this ability to find/establish/adopt this third place
that is at the very core of intercultural competence. 

Online proposal submission form: 
http://www.cercll.arizona.edu/icc_2010_submit.php 
	
Submissions will be accepted beginning March 2nd, 2009. 

Proposal types: 
Workshop (3 hours) on Friday and Sunday mornings (9-12): Workshops are meant to
be interactive and delve into a topic more deeply than a 60-minute paper or
poster session allows. Workshop proposals should include an outline of the
specific planned activities and a detailed time schedule for each segment of the
workshop. Only a limited number of workshop proposals will be accepted. 

Paper session (25 minutes per paper). Papers will be grouped thematically.
Grouped paper presentation sessions will include three papers followed by 25
minutes of discussion after all of the papers have been presented. Each grouped
paper presentation (100 minutes in length) is limited to three presenters. 

Poster session (60 minutes). Each poster presenter must be at his/her poster
display during the assigned 60-minute time frame that is published in the
conference program, so that attendees can view the poster and discuss the topic
with the presenter. 

Format: 
- Title: The title of proposed session can be a maximum of 10 words in length.
Be sure that your title matches the content of the intended presentation.  
- Proposal Type: Pre-conference workshop, post-conference workshop, paper, or
poster. 
- Abstract: The abstract must not exceed 400 words. Workshop abstracts should
include an outline of the specific planned activities, and a detailed time
schedule for each segment of the workshop. 
- Summary: The summary must not exceed 50 words. It needs to be in final,
publishable format and error-free. 
- Strand: All submissions must fit with ONE strand that best describes the focus
and content of the paper or poster session
