Meeting Description:

SENSE'09 - conceptual Structures for Extracting Natural language SEmantics
Workshop at the 17th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS'09)
July 2009, Moscow, Russia. 

Call for Papers

We invite papers on the application of conceptual structures (such as Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA) or Conceptual Graphs) to the extraction of semantics from
natural language resources (corpora, the Web, thesauri or lexical databases).
Conceptual structures provide mathematical models for concepts, semantic
relations and hierarchies. Their usefulness for the extraction and modelling of
semantics has been explored in prior research, but there have been very few
conferences or workshops specifically dedicated to linguistic aspects of
conceptual structures. This workshop intends to provide an interdisciplinary
forum for conceptual structures applications that focus on modelling,
extracting, representing, analyzing and exploring natural language semantics.

Workshop Chairs:
Uta Priss    Edinburgh Napier University
Galia Angelova  Bulgarian Academy of Sciences

Submissions:
Papers must be in English and not be submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers
should be up to 12 pages in length. Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed.
Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and printed in the workshop
proceedings (available online and as a hardcopy distributed at the workshop).

We encourage authors to use the Easychair latex class for their submissions.
Papers should be submitted (in PDF format only) using 
https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=sense09.

The format for the final versions of the paper is either latex/pdf or rtf/pdf.

Important Dates:
Paper submission deadline: March 20, 2009.
Acceptance notification: April 30, 2009.
Paper final version due: May 22, 2009.
Workshop:  25 or 26 or 27 July, 2009 (exact date to be determined).
