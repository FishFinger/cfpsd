Workshop Description

The main purpose of this workshop is to analyze and discuss the
results of systems participating in the SemEval-2007 evaluation. We
also expect discussion on further developments of related evaluation
exercises and systems. SemEval-2007 held nineteen different tasks,
which conducted evaluations of systems that perform automatic semantic
analysis of text, covering a wide range of aspects of semantics and
multilinguality.


Background

There are now many computer systems that do automatic semantic
analysis of text. The purpose of SemEval-2007 was to evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of such systems with respect to different
words, relations, types of texts, different varieties of language, and
different languages. This workshop is a follow-up to the SemEval-2007
and Senseval series of workshops on semantic evaluation, and we also
want it to be a preparation for the next SemEval evaluation exercise.

Senseval-1 took place in the summer of 1998 for English, French, and
Italian, culminating in a workshop held at Herstmonceux Castle,
Sussex, England on September 2-4.  Senseval-2 took place in the summer
of 2001, and was followed by a workshop held in July 2001 in Toulouse,
in conjunction with ACL-2001.  It included tasks for 12 languages. A
follow-up workshop on the recent successes and future directions of
word sense disambiguation was held at ACL 2002. Senseval-3 took place
in the spring of 2004, and was followed by a workshop held in July
2004 in Barcelona, in conjunction with ACL-2004. More than 55 teams
participated with over 160 systems in its 16 tasks. SemEval-2007
organized 18 tasks, with over 100 teams and 125 systems
participating. The results of the tasks and systems were presented in
a workshop hold in conjunction with ACL-2007.

SemEval-2007 was motivated by a desire to broaden the spectrum of
accepted works to all aspects of computational semantic analysis of
language. It especially encouraged the proposal of tasks for different
languages, cross-lingual tasks, and tasks that are relevant to
particular NLP applications such as machine translation, information
retrieval and information extraction.

In recent years, the deployment of multiple semantic lexicons and
accordingly tagged corpora (WordNet-SemCor, VerbNet-PropBank, FrameNet
Prague Dependency Treebank and OntoNotes, to name a few) have
radically changed the way semantic analysis is performed, especially
at the disambiguation stage. Some of the tasks at SemEval-2007
tried to take this one step further by proposing multiple layers of
semantic annotation of the same corpus (e.g., senses, roles,
name-entity classes), allowing for novel research to be performed.

SemEval-2007 had a tight schedule, and the results and systems were
usually not known until the workshop was held. This fact, and the
growing number of tasks and systems made it difficult to fully analyze
the tasks and systems. This proposal allows for a better analysis of
the developments in this area.


Topics

This workshop invites the submission of original research papers
describing systems and systematic evaluation exercises on tasks related to
the SemEval-2007 evaluation or semantic processing in general.
Both system and evaluation exercise papers are expected to provide
insight on the semantic process where they focus, which include the
following:

    * shallow and deep semantic analysis
    * word sense disambiguation
    * semantic role labeling
    * semantic relation identification
    * named-entity classification
    * analysis and disambiguation of prepositions
    * metonymy resolution
    * lexical substitution and paraphrasing
    * textual entailment
    * semantics in applications: IR, IE, MT, etc.



Submissions

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished
work in the topic area of this workshop. Full papers should be up to 8
pages in length, plus one page for references.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

All submissions must be electronic in PDF. Please see the conference
website for detailed typesetting specifications. Authors are strongly
encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files available at
http://ling.osu.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html.

Submission will be electronic, using the START paper submission
website. The submission deadline is March 9th, 2007. The START
submission page is https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS08/.
