Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 06-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

The proliferation of the Internet has revolutionised the way information is
disseminated and presented. Blogs no longer only relay and comment on news
stories but also influence what is talked about in the news. Such changes have
not gone unnoticed by the computational linguistics research community, who are
increasingly processing or exploiting blogs in an attempt to keep track of what
is going on and mine information. This workshop will focus on how events can be
identified and how information related to event processing (e.g. NP coreference,
temporal processing) can be extracted from blogs. Emphasis will be on how
existing methods for event processing need to be adapted in order to process
this medium, and on linguistic differences in the reporting of events in blogs
and more traditional news texts. Extensions of this research to text types from
other collaborative environments such as wikis, fora, chats and social networks
are also welcomed.

Event detection and processing is not a new topic in computational linguistics,
but until now it has focused mainly on processing of newswire. The TimeBank
corpus (Pustejovsky et. al. 2003), the AQUAINT TimeML corpus, and the NP4E
corpus (Hasler, Orasan and Naumann 2006) exclusively contain newswire, which may
make them inappropriate for the development of methods which need to process
other text types. This workshop will give researchers the opportunity to present
efforts to develop resources related to event identification and processing
using blog entries. In addition, papers describing annotation guidelines and
linguistic analyses of such resources are encouraged, including comparisons with
annotations of more traditional text types. 

Call for Papers:

The informal style and structure of most blog entries makes event detection in
these documents a difficult task. This workshop will encourage submission of
papers that develop new methods for event identification or test existing one on
blog entries. The fact that the same event is usually reported in several
entries, in many instances containing contradictory information, makes
cross-document event coreference identification a more challenging task.
Researchers are encouraged to submit papers presenting such methods. Of
particular interest are papers detailing methods to identify subjective or
objective ways of presenting an event or to detect contradictory reporting of
the same event. 

The workshop is not restricted only to event processing. Papers on topics
related to event processing, such as the identification of entities and temporal
processing and reasoning are also encouraged. Submissions about NLP applications
that exploit event identification such as summarisation of events in blogs,
question answering about events described in collaborative environments (e.g.
Wikipedia) or opinion mining related to events are also invited. 

Topics:

Original papers in three main areas are expected:

Linguistics:
-linguistic representation and function of different kinds of information (e.g.
opinion/subjectivity/objectivity)
-discourse structure related to the presentation of events within and across
blog entries
-annotation of events in corpora of blogs
-extension/adaptation of 'traditional' annotation of news texts for blog entries 
-description of resources encoding information relevant to this workshop

Methods for event processing or necessary for event processing:
-event identification in blogs
-contradictory information regarding the same events (cross-document NP and
event coreference)
-entity tracking across blog entries
-identification, representation and reasoning about time in blogs
-evaluation of event identification methods trained on newswire vs blogs

NLP methods and applications that use information about events:
-summarisation of events from blogs
-opinion mining and analysis in blogs vs newswire
-identification of objective and subjective information in blogs vs newswire
-commercial systems which process events in blogs

Although we only explicitly mention blogs, research on text types from other
collaborative environments such as wikis, fora, chats and social networks will
also be considered. 

Submission Guidelines:

Authors are invited to submit three types of papers: full papers which describe
original and unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop, posters which
describe work in progress, and demos which describe full working systems, and
which, if accepted, will be presented at a special session accompanied by live
demo. Papers should be submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP
2009 stylefiles and not should not exceed 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages
for posters and demos. The RANLP 2009 stylefiles are available at:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/submissions.htm. 

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authors' identities
should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be
rejected without review.

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system. Specific submission
guidelines will be posted on the workshop site shortly. Each submission will be
reviewed at least by two members of the Program Committee. Reviewers will be
asked to provide detailed comments, and to score submitted papers on the
following factors: 
-Relevance to the workshop
-Significance and originality
-Technical/methodological accuracy
-References to related work
-Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. By submitting a
paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for
publication, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop
participants are expected to pay the RANLP-2009 workshop registration fee.

Important Dates:
-Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2009
-Paper acceptance notification: July 20, 2009
-Camera-ready papers due: August 24, 2009
-Workshop date: September 17 or 18, 2009 (tbc)
