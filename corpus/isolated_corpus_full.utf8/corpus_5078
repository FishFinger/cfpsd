grammar, mathematical linguistics and the application of formal and mathematical
methods to the study of natural language. Themes of interest include, but are
not limited to:
-Formal and computational phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics;
-Model-theoretic and proof-theoretic methods in linguistics;
-Logical aspects of linguistic structure;
-Constraint-based and resource-sensitive approaches to grammar;
-Learnability of formal grammar;
-Integration of stochastic and symbolic models of grammar;
-Foundational, methodological and architectural issues in grammar;
-Mathematical foundations of statistical approaches to linguistic analysis.

Previous conferences in this series have welcomed papers from a wide variety of
frameworks.

Proceedings
Submissions will be reviewed anonymously by at least three reviewers.
Accepted papers will be published after the conference as volume number
5591 in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (under the
FoLLI LNAI subline).

papers can only be presented in one of the venues.
