Meeting Description:

2nd International Workshop on the Semantic Representation of Spoken Language

The aim of the SRSL-2009 is to bring together researchers interested in the
semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous speech. On one
hand, the semantic gap between contents conveyed by natural languages and their
formal representations is a burning aspect in tasks such as information
extraction and corpus annotation. The current state-of-the-art supports
solutions from very different backgrounds and perspectives, but still remain
important and complex issues to deal with, such as the accurate segmentation of
speech in semantic units. The discussions of those aspects are one of the main
reasons for this workshop. On the other hand, spoken language is a pending issue
in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence, both traditionally
focused on written language, although semantic processing of speech is necessary
for the understanding of both natural and human-machine interaction. Finally,
the problems found when trying to linguistically structure spontaneous speech
are leading to works focused on its semantic representation. In-depth research
on the semantic representation of speech can provide us with a suitable basis
for further analysis of related linguistic levels, like prosody or pragmatics. 

Last Call for Papers

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research concerning
the semantic representation of spoken language. Possible topics include:

- Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, etc.) and
concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
- Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
- Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
- Dialogue and discourse structures.
- Topic Detection and tracking.
- Multimodal Representation including speech.
- Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.
- Speech in embedded systems.
- Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic
representations.
- Standardization work.
- Interoperability/Comparison work of spoken and written corpora.

Submissions must be written in English and should follow the EACL-2009 style
format. They can be full (6-8 pages including references) or short papers (3-4
pages including references). As reviewing will be blind, papers should not
include author's names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity should be avoided. Submissions that do not conform
to these styles will be rejected.

The only accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Please remember that the
paper submission deadline is December 19th, 2008. Papers that are being
submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on
the title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with previously
published work. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the SRSL-2009.

Both full and short papers (3-4 pages) will have an oral presentation at the
workshop within the framework of the EACL-2009 conference in Athens (Greece).
For this reason, at least one author has to register for the workshop.

Liverpool. 

We are looking forward to an interesting programme and invite abstracts for
papers, posters, work-in-progress reports, as well as workshops and colloquia
covering any aspect of corpus linguistics. The conference begins with a workshop
and colloquium day on Monday 20 July, the main conference runs from Tuesday 21
to Thursday 23 July, with the conference dinner on Wednesday 22 July.

Second Call for Papers

Conference Submissions:
We invite 5 categories of presentations: the closing date for abstracts is 23
January 2009.  

Papers will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. Paper
abstracts should be between 300 and 500 words (excluding word count for
references). 

Work-In-Progress Reports will be 10 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions.
Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words (excluding word count for references). 

Poster abstracts should be no more than 200 words (excluding word count for
references). 

Colloquia usually take the form of between 4 and 8 papers, with time for
audience discussion. We will accommodate short colloquia (2 hours, about 4
speakers) and longer colloquia (4 hours, about 8 speakers). Proposals should be
no more than 1000 words (for colloquia of 2 hours) or 2000 words (for colloquia
of 4 hours). The proposal should include a rationale for the colloquium, an
indication of how much of the time will be allocated to audience discussion, and
an abstract for each of the proposed papers. 

Workshops usually include one or two short presentations and substantial
audience participation. Workshops can take 1 or 2 hours. Proposals should be no
more than 500 words (for a 1-hour workshop) or 750 words (for a 2-hour workshop)
and should describe the organisation of the workshop and the nature of the
audience participation. Additionally, information on technical requirements
should be provided. 

For colloquia and workshops we would encourage you to contact us ahead of the
deadline if you have any questions. 

The language of the conference is English. All abstracts should be in English,
though we encourage proposals for colloquia to be given in languages other than
English.

To submit an abstract go to the following URL and follow the instructions:
