Final Call for Papers

EACL 2009 Workshop on COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF COMPUTATIONAL LANGUAGE ACQUISITI=
ON

31 March 2009
Athens, Greece

http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cognitive/

-----------------------------------------------

Workshop Description
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This workshop is focused on the relevance of computational learning  =

methods for research
on human language acquisition. Developing and applying such  =

computational techniques that
can improve our understanding of human language acquisition will not  =

only benefit
cognitive sciences in general, but will also reflect back to NLP and  =

place us in a better
position to develop useful language models.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse  =

fields of NLP, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, (psycho)linguistics, etc. who are  =

interested in the
relevance of computational techniques for understanding human language  =

learning.

The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational  =

and cognitive
communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help initiate  =

interdisciplinary
research projects. Success in this type of research requires close  =

collaboration between
NLP and cognitive scientists. To this end, interdisciplinary workshops  =

can play a key
role in advancing existing and initiating new research. This was  =

demonstrated by some
successful events like the previous edition of this workshop held at ACL 20=
07.


Areas of interest
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning

- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language  =

acquisition

- Computational models of various aspects of language acquisition, and  =

their interaction
with each other

- Computational models of the evolution of language

- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of  =

human language
acquisition

- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment  =

and its impact on the
acquisition task

- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information  =

(related to e.g.
speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and  =

their relevance to
research on human language acquisition

- Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and  =

weakly-supervised
methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic,
biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from  =

the cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of  =

completion of the
reported results. In particular, any overlap with previously published  =

work should be
clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty,  =

technical
strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and  =

significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the EACL 2009  =

main-conference
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including  =

references. We strongly
recommend the use of either the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word  =

Style file, which
can be found at http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include  =

the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and other references  =

that could reveal the
author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted  =

papers is Adobe
PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than December 19, 2008 using  =

the submission
webpage that will be available soon.

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee.  =

Authors of accepted
papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce camera-ready  =

versions of their
papers for inclusion in the EACL workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.
