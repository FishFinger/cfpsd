*********************************************************
CALL FOR PAPERS
LREC 2008 Workshop on
Sentiment Analysis: Emotion, Metaphor, Ontology and Terminology
(EMOT 2008)
27 May, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco
https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/lrec-emot08.html
Submission deadline: 20 February 2008
*********************************************************

*Workshop Topics*

Sentiment analysis systems seek to extract emotions and feelings =

expressed about people, organisations, nation states, goods and =

services, in free natural language texts. This interdisciplinary =

workshop will address three related topics in this area:

(a) how metaphor and sentiment interact in everyday communication;

(b) language/conceptual resources properties to support sentiment analysis

(c) evaluation of sentiment analysis programs and evaluation methodologies.

There will be one keynote lecture on each of the three topics followed =

by the presentation of papers related to each of the three topics.

*Workshop Aims*

This workshop will deal with the recent advances in the processing of =

=93sentiment=94 in arbitrary collections of text. Sentiment can be expresse=
d =

about works of art and literature, about the state of financial markets, =

about liking and disliking individuals, organisations, ideologies, and =

consumer goods. It is necessary to examine what aspects of emotional =

experience sentiment analysis aims to capture, how and in what way this =

may be evaluated. This workshop focuses on three strands of research =

which will serve to enhance the development of automated sentiment =

analysis systems of free text for real world applications.

Firstly, in psychology and computational linguistics, the notions of =

emotion and metaphor interact in a number of complex ways. It has been =

argued that conceptual metaphors underlie human understanding and =

processing of emotion. In addition, it can be argued that the expression =

of sentiment and its interpretation can rely critically on how a speaker =

or writer uses metaphor. Therefore, an understanding of how emotion is =

expressed and perceived in language is not complete without addressing =

the role of figurative language and metaphor as basic scaffolding or =

tool for modulating affective text content.

Secondly, to date, sentiment analysis typically deals with a specific =

domain of =91ideal objects=92. In order to build a sentiment analysis =

system, one has to understand =91what there is=92 in a given domain, i.e. =

the ontology of the domain. In this context, is it possible to conceive =

of generic sentiment analysis? Practitioners in this area need to =

examine the requirements and challenges of an approach that could cross =

boundaries of domain or time or even language where different =

communities of use, languages or cultures may express or even experience =

sentiments in different ways.

Finally, work in sentiment analysis may be regarded as work in =

intelligent information retrieval and =93success=94 is evaluated in terms o=
f =

accuracy in identifying the affective content of information segments. =

Yet sentiment analysis has the potential to have a powerful impact in =

other domains that require input about emotional context. Researchers in =

Human-Computer Interaction, Affective Computing, Lexicography and =

Terminography, may become end-users of work in sentiment analysis and =

sentiment analysis folks may have much to learn from how a machine =

artificially =93endowed=94 with emotions/sentiments behaves. It may become =

feasible to evaluate sentiment analysis systems in terms of the =

performance of such applications. An examination of alternative end-user =

systems and evaluation mechanisms can only serve to enrich the field of =

sentiment analysis and present new challenges for researchers to address.

* *

*Submissions*
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work =

in the topic area of this workshop. Submissions should should not exceed =

8 pages and should be typeset using a font size of 11 points. (Style =

files will be made available by LREC for the camera-ready versions of =

accepted papers.)
The reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not =

include the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be =

reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Accepted =

papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. Springer has =

expressed an interest in publishing selected papers from the workshop in =

one of its series, we are currently in discussions and will confirm =

details at a later date.
Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than February 20, =

2008. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. =

Details about the submission procedure will be published on the workshop =

webpage (https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/lrec-emot08.html) closer =

to the time.
