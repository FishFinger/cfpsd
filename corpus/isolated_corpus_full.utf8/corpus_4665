(Apologies for cross-postings )

Deadline: March 27, 2009

The Sixth Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-09)

MCLC offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics researchers to get
together and present ideas and research results. It is intended to be primarily
for researchers from the Midwest region, but applications from all regions are
welcome.  We particularly welcome work in progress from graduate students and
other young researchers.  The first meeting of MCLC was successfully held at
Indiana University, Bloomington in 2004, and we're pleased to bring it back to
Indiana.

- The abstract should be anonymous.
- Abstracts should be emailed to mclc09@indiana.edu no later than March 27,

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. The major criteria of
