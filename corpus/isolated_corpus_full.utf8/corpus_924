SIGIR 2007:  Call for Posters and Call for Demonstrations

    The 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on
      Research and Development in Information Retrieval
         23-27 July 2007, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                  http://www.sigir2007.org

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new 
research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques
in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The Conference and 
Program Chairs invite all those working in areas related to IR to submit 
original research contributions, posters, and demonstrations of systems.

*CALL FOR POSTERS*

Poster presentations offer researchers a unique opportunity to present 
late-breaking results, significant work in progress, or research that 
is best communicated in an interactive or graphical format. They further
provide researchers with an opportunity to obtain direct feedback about 
their work from a wide range of persons during the poster session.

Posters should focus on problems and methodology of the presented 
research. Extended abstracts describing the work will be reviewed and 
published in the conference proceedings. Please note however, that 
posters describing work at the proposal stage will not be accepted.

Submissions of extended abstracts for posters must be in English and 
should not exceed 2 pages in SIGIR format (including references and 
figures). Suitable LaTeX and Word templates for SIGIR are available 
from the ACM Website. The only accepted form for submissions are PDF 
files, which need to be uploaded via the SIGIR electronic submission 
web page. As with full papers, authors are encouraged to conceal their 
identity where it is practical to do so. 

Submissions need to be received by February 25, 2007. Late submissions 
will be rejected without further consideration. 

*CALL FOR DEMONSTRATIONS*

Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes 
or operational systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas 
gained from implementing IR systems and to obtain feedback from expert 
users. Demonstration submissions are welcomed in any of the areas 
identified in the call for papers. One-page demonstration abstracts 
will appear in the conference proceedings.

Submissions must be in English and consist of an extended abstract 
(one page in SIGIR format including references and figures) and an 
additional one-page requirements description. The abstract should 
emphasize what the implemented system aims to achieve, the major 
components of the system, the novelty of the techniques that have been 
implemented, and comparisons with comparable systems. The requirements 
description should identify the hardware, software and network access 
requirements for the demonstration. Network connections and computers 
with standard Web browsers can be provided upon request. Proposals to 
demonstrate systems that require more than a standard Web browser 
(e.g. context-aware mobile systems or virtual reality systems) must 
explain how the systems will be demonstrated at the conference.

Submissions should be in PDF format. Unlike posters and research 
papers, authors of demonstration proposals are not expected to take 
measures to conceal their identity from reviewers. Demonstration 
proposals must be submitted by February 25, 2007. 

*IMPORTANT DATES*

January 28, 2007:  Full research papers due
February 25, 2007: Poster, demonstration, tutorial, and workshop submissions
March 11, 2007:    Doctoral consortium submissions due
April 11, 2007:    Notification of acceptance for all submissions
July 23-27, 2007:  Conference in Amsterdam
