Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Meeting Description:

The 7th International Conference 'Recent Advances in Natural Language
Processing' is the latest RANLP conference. It continues the tradition of many
successful summer schools and international conferences. RANLP events have
always been a meeting place for researchers from all parts of the world,
facilitating contact between computational linguists from Central and Eastern
Europe and their colleagues from Western Europe and America. 

RANLP-2009 will be held in conjunction with tutorials and international
workshops as follows:
Pre-conference Tutorials: September 12-13, 2009 (Saturday-Sunday)
International Conference RANLP-09: September 14-16, 2009 (Monday-Wednesday)
Post-conference Workshops: September 17-18, 2009 (Thursday-Friday) 

RANLP (Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing) is one of the
best-established and competitive European NLP conferences. It is held biennially
in Bulgaria and grew out from the international summer schools ''Contemporary
topics in Computational Linguistics'' organised for many years in Bulgaria as
international training events. The RANLP conferences in 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003,
2005 and 2007 had invited talks by leading names in NLP and accepted papers of
high quality, rigorously reviewed by an international Programme Committee of
well-known experts. Most of the RANLP conferences published a volume with
Selected papers in the John Benjamins series ''Current trends of linguistic
research''. The conferences also featured tutorials on hot NLP topics delivered
by leading researchers. RANLP 2007 was accompanied by nine international
workshops. Information about the RANLP events after 2000 can be found at:

http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2001

Submission deadline: End of April/beginning of May 2009 
(the conference web site will have updated information)

RANLP-09 will be held in the picturesque resort of Borovets. Located in the Rila
mountains, it is one of the best known ski and tourist resorts in South-East
Europe. Hotel Samokov, the conference venue, offers excellent study and leisure
facilities.

Full Title: 12th Meeting of the European Chapter of the ACL 
Short Title: EACL 2009 

Date: 30-Mar-2009 - 03-Apr-2009
Location: Athens, Greece 
Contact Person: Joakim Nivre
Meeting Email: nivre@msi.vxu.se
Web Site: http://www.eacl2009.gr 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 10-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

EACL 2009 is the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics. 

First Call for Papers

EACL 2009 
March 30 - April 3, 2009
Athens, Greece
URL: http://www.eacl2009.gr

Submission Deadline: October 10, 2008

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics, including, but
not limited to:
- phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
- spoken language processing and language modeling;
- word segmentation, tagging, and chunking;
- syntax, parsing, and grammar formalisms;
- lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation;
- compositional semantics and textual entailment;
- pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue;
- lexicon, lexical databases, and ontologies;
- generation and summarization;
- information retrieval, question answering, and information extraction;
- machine translation and multilingual systems;
- dialogue systems and multimodal systems;
- language resources and tools, and resources for lesser studied languages;
- linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language;
- machine learning and algorithms for natural language;
- evaluation methodology.

Requirements:
Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion
of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at EACL 2009 cannot
be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other conferences or
workshops must indicate this on the submission page.

Review and Selection:
Reviewing of papers will be double-blind, and all submissions will receive three
independent reviews. Final decisions on the program will be made by the Program
Committee, consisting of the Program Co-Chairs and Area Chairs.

Submissions will be assessed with respect to appropriateness, clarity,
soundness/correctness, meaningful comparison, originality/innovativeness,
and impact of ideas or results. For more information about the review criteria,
see the review form appended below.

Publication and Presentation:
All papers that are accepted will be published in the proceedings of the
conference, and will be presented as a poster or an oral presentation. Authors
will be asked on submission to state their preferred mode of presentation, and
the program committee will attempt to fulfill as many of these preferences as
possible, organizational factors permitting. EACL 2009 will additionally aim to
give poster presentations higher status than usual (by scheduling, physical
arrangement, combination with refreshments). The proceedings will not
distinguish long papers by presentation format.

Submission Information:
All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must follow the two-column
format of EACL proceedings. Authors are strongly recommended to use the
style files available on the conference web site. The maximum length of
a manuscript is eight (8) pages of content and one (1) additional page
of references. The page limits have to be strictly observed. As reviewing will
be double-blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity,
e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead,
use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. (Do not use
anonymous citations.) Do not include acknowledgments. Papers that do not conform
to these requirements will be rejected without review.

The deadline for submission is 23:59 CET on October 10, 2008. Additional
instructions for electronic submission will be posted on the conference
website at http://www.eacl2009.gr.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
