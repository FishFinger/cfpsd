Subject: Rochester: NAACL HLT 2007 - Call for Tutorial Proposals
Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1158183082.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>



HLT-NAACL 2007
Call for Tutorial Proposals

Proposals are invited for the Tutorial Program for HLT-NAACL 2007, to
be held at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York on April
22-27, 2007; the tutorial day is Sunday, April 22, 2007.  The
HLT-NAACL conferences combine the HLT (Human Language Technology) and
NAACL (North American chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics) conference series, and bring together researchers in NLP,
IR, and speech.  For details, see 
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/

We seek half-day tutorials covering topics in Speech Processing,
Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing, including
their theoretical foundations, intersections, and applications.
Tutorials will normally move quickly, but they are expected to be
accessible, understandable, and of interest to a broad community of
researchers, preferably from multiple areas of Human Language
Technology.  Our target is to have 4-6 tutorials.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposal format may be in (ASCII) text, HTML, or PDF.  Proposals
should be submitted by October 15, using the START conference
reviewing system.  The link to the submissions is available on the
conference web site at
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/


Proposals should contain:

1. A title and brief (2-page max) description of the tutorial topic
   and content.  Include a brief outline of the tutorial structure
   showing that the tutorial's core content can be covered in three
   hours (two 1.5 hour sessions).  Tutorials should be accessible to
   the broadest practical audience.  In keeping with the focus of the
   conference, please highlight any topics spanning disciplinary
   boundaries that you plan to address. (These are not strictly
   required, but they are a big plus.)

2. Two pages of sample materials from the tutorial; sample slides are
   a recommended format but other kinds of material are acceptable.

3. If available, a summary of similar tutorials given by the
   instructors, the venues, approximate audience size, and a summary
   of the ratings received, if available.

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
   the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research
   interests and areas of expertise.

5. A description of special requirements for technical needs (computer
   infrastructure, etc).  Tutorials must be financially
   self-supporting.  The conference organizers will establish
   registration rates that will cover the room, audio-visual
   equipment, internet access, snacks for breaks, and reproduction the
   tutorial notes.  A description of any additional anticipated
   expenses must be included in the proposal.


PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS

Accepted tutorial speakers will be asked to provide descriptions of
their tutorials suitable for inclusion in all of: email announcements,
the conference registration material, the printed program, the
website, and the proceedings. This will involve producing text and/or
HTML and/or LaTeX/Word/PDF versions of appropriate lengths.

Tutorial notes will be printed and distributed by the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL).  These materials, containing at least
copies of the slides that will be presented and a bibliography for the
material that will be covered, must be submitted by the date indicated
below to allow adequate time for reproduction.  Presenters retain
copyright for their materials, but ACL requires that presenters
execute a non-exclusive distribution license to permit distribution to
participants and sales to others.

Tutorial presenters will be compensated in accordance with current ACL
policies; see 
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/tutorial-payment-policy.html.

Submission:           October 15, 2006
Notification:         November 1, 2006
Descriptions due:     January 15, 2007
