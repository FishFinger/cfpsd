Meeting Description:

KPW (Kioloa Papuanists' Workshop)

Following the successful recent Papuanists' Workshops in Sydney, the ANU Papuanists will be hosting a weekend of Papuanist talks at the Kioloa coast campus (c. 3 hours from Canberra and 3.5 hours from 
Sydney; see http://kioloa.anu.edu.au/) from 2 pm Friday 30th October to early afternoon Sunday 1st November, with a bushwalk up Pigeon House planned for the Saturday afternoon. 

Now calling for papers and for registration of participants.

Anyone who has an interest in Papuan languages and linguistics is invited to come and present a 
paper or just listen to other people's papers and join in the discussion.

We expect to be able to accommodate participants in dorm-style accommodation at Kioloa, and food 
will be organised economically on a kitty system. Please specify any dietary requests beforehand.

Papers may address any topic related to Papuan languages or linguistics any should specify whether a 
20 or 40 minute presentation time is preferred.

The closing date for titles and abstracts is 20 September. Acceptances will be notified by 25 
September.

To submit a title and abstract for a paper or to register interest in attending, e-mail 
kioloapapuan09@gmail.com. Please also specify the number of beds required. (We will try and fit in 
non-presenting partners and family if there is space, though presenters will be given priority; there 
are other accommodation options nearby, http://www.kioloabeach.com/).

Organising committee:  Wayan Arka, Fiona Blake, Mark Donohue, Nick Evans, Yusuf Sawaki, Tom 
Honeyman, Antoinette Schapper
