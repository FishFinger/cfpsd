 * Call for Bids to Host the 23-th ESSLLI, 2011 *
 ************************************************

The Association for Logic, Language and Computation (FoLLI) and
the ESSLLI Standing Committee invite proposals to host the 23-nd
European Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information
(ESSLLI), to be held in August 2011.


 *** The ESSLLI Summer School ***

ESSLLI is a summer school which takes place two weeks in the
summer, every year since 1989. The school hosts approximately 50
courses at both introductory and advanced level, and convokes
around 500 participants each year from all over the world.

The main focus of the program of the summer schools is the
interface between linguistics, logic and computation. Courses,
both introductory and advanced, cover a wide variety of topics
within the combined areas of interest: Language and Computation,
Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation. Workshops are also
organized, providing opportunities for in-depth discussion of
issues at the forefront of research, as well as a series of
invited lectures.

Detailed information about the ESSLLI organization can be found in
the ESSLLI general guide, and the organizing and program committee
guides. The guides can be obtained via the Standing Committee
secretary.
