       WEB CONTENT MINING WITH HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES 
               http://orestes.ii.uam.es/workshop/ 

workshop to be held at the 5th International Semantic Web Conference, 
              Athens, GA, U.S.A. November 5-9 2006

MOTIVATION, AIM AND SCOPE 

With the large growth of the information stored in the World Wide Web, 
it is necessary to have available tools for automatic or 
semi-automatic analyzes of web data. Hence, a large effort has been 
invested in the last years in developing techniques for extracting 
patterns and implicit information from the web, a task that is usually 
known as Web Mining. Web Mining itself can be divided into three 
subtasks according to the kind of data that is collected: web 
structure, web usage and web content. 

Web content mining consists of automatically mining data from textual 
web documents that can be represented with machine-readable semantic 
formalisms. Initially, most web content mining systems used wrappers 
to map documents to other data structures, but this is highly 
dependent on the the layout and formatting instructions inside web 
pages. Therefore, alternative approaches, that make use of Natural 
Language Processing-based techniques, are increasingly used. 

While more traditional approaches to Information Extraction from text, 
such as those applied to the Message Understanding Conferences during 
the nineties, relied on small collections of documents with many 
semantic annotations, the characteristics of the web (its size, 
redundancy and the lack of semantic annotations in most texts) favor 
efficient algorithms able to learn from unannotated data. Furthermore, 
new types of web content such as web forums, blogs and wikis, some of 
them included in the so-called Web 2.0, are also a source of textual 
information that contain an underlying structure from which specialist 
systems can benefit. The workshop will give special emphasis to how 
existing techniques can benefit from these kinds of contents. 

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers from the Semantic 
Web, the Natural Language Processing and the Text Mining 
communities. The web constitutes a unique source of information to 
train and exploit systems for tasks such as Named Entity 
Identification and Classification, Term Identification, Relationships 
Extraction, Ontology Learning and Population from text and Text 
Mining. The Semantic Web community can contribute providing semantic 
formalisms and tools for knowledge representation and reasoning for 
exploiting the extracted metadata. The goal of the workshop is to 
establish communication between all these communities. 
TOPICS OF INTEREST 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

   * Term Identification for specialist domains using web corpora, as 
     an initial step for ontology construction. 

   * Extracting taxonomic and non-taxonomic relationships from the
     web. 

   * Automatic ontology-based semantic annotation and Information 
     Extraction of web content. 

   * Mining semantic information from blogs, forums or news sources. 

   * Automatic annotation in Semantic Wikis. 

   * Integrating mined information with semantic resources. 

   * Semantic annotation of multilingual web sources. 

   * Burst detection from web sources. 

   * Multi-webpage Named Entity Coreference 

   * Usage scenarios for the combination of the Semantic Web, Human 
     Language Techonologies, Text Mining, decision support, etc. 

IMPORTANT DATES: 

1 August 2006    - Paper submission 

5 September 2006 - Acceptance notification 

18 September 2006 - Camera-ready papers 

6 November 2006  - Electronic version of the proceedings available: 

SUBMISSIONS 

Paper submissions must be formatted in the style of the Springer 
Publications format for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, 
and submitted as PDF documents. We accept two kinds of papers: 

   * Full papers, with a length limit of 10 pages. 
   * Short position papers, with a length limit of 5 pages. 

In both cases, the names of the authors should not appear in the 
paper, in order to ensure a blind review process. 

At least one author must register for each accepted submission, for
the 
paper to appear in the workshop proceedings.
