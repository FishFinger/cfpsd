Dear Jean-Philippe Prost:

We invite you to submit a paper/abstract to The International =
Multi-Conference on Complexity, Informatics and Cybernetics: IMCIC 2010 =
(April 6 -9, 2010 - Orlando, Florida, USA). =
http://www.2010iiisconferences.org/IMCIC

The deadlines are the following:

Papers/Abstracts Submissions and Invited Sessions Proposals: October =
21th, 2009
Authors Notifications: November 16th, 2009
Camera-ready, full papers: December 16th, 2009

All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing =
processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, =
and (3) participative peer reviews. These three kinds of review will =
support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be =
accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to =
be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal.

Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic =
forums) will be held for each session included in the conference =
program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and =
authors presenting at the same session can interact during one week =
before and after the conference. Authors can also participate in =
peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions.

Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both =
accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process =
and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have =
access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the =
reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so =
they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. =
Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their =
respective submissions.

Registration fees of an effective invited session organizer will be =
waived according to the policy described in the web page  (click on =
'Invited Session', then on 'Benefits for the Organizers of Invited =
Sessions'), where you can get information about the ten benefits for an =
invited session organizer. For Invited Sessions Proposals, please visit =
the conference web site, or directly to =
http://www.2010iiisconferences.org/imcic/organizer.asp

Authors of the best 10%-20% of the papers presented at the conference =
(included those virtually presented) will be invited to adapt their =
papers for their publication in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics =
and Informatics.

Best regards,

Organizing Committee

If you wish to be removed from this mailing list, please send an email =
to remove@mail.2010iiisconferences.org with REMOVE MLCONFERENCES in the =
subject line.Address: Torre Profesional La California, Av. Francisco de =
Miranda, Caracas, Venezuela.
