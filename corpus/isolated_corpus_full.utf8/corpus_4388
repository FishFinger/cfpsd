Scope

The Sixth Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous 2009) will provide a forum for practitioners 
and researchers from diverse backgrounds to interact and exchange experiences about the design and implementation of mobile and ubiquitous systems.  Areas addressed by t
he conference include systems, applications, social networks, middleware, networking, data management and services, all with special focus on mobility and ubiquitous computing.

The Program Committee is soliciting technical papers that describe original, previously unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference or journal. 
Submissions should clearly identify how they relate to issues on mobile and ubiquitous systems. Contributions describing an overall working system are particularly of interest. 


Topics

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Architectures, systems and applications	 * Localization and tracking
* Wearable computing 				 * Context- and location-aware applications and services
* Personal area networks			 * Agent technologies in ubiquitous, wearable, and mobile systems
* Wireless technologies (Bluetooth, ZigBee,  	 * Energy efficiency and awareness
  802.15.x, WiFi, WiMAX)			 * Toolkits, testbeds, development environments,
* Wireless Internet access in ubiquitous systems   and languages for ubiquitous computing
* Ad hoc and sensor network support for 	 * Rapid prototyping of ubiquitous applications 
  ubiquitous computing
* Reconfigurability and personalization 	 * Mobile and ubiquitous data management and processing
* Wireless/mobile service management and delivery * Queries, transactions and workflows in mobile and ubiquitous environments
* Trust Issues for Ubiquitous Systems		 * Multimodal interfaces (speech, video kinetic, tactile)
* Community based computing		 	 * User generated content
* Service and knowledge discovery, matching	 * Mixed (virtual/real) world infrastructures
  and composition mechanisms

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission Instructions: Paper submission will be handled electronically (see the conference web page for details). Authors should 
prepare an Adobe Acrobat PDF version of their full paper. Papers must not exceed 10 pages double column (US Letter size, 8.5 x 11 inches) 
including text, figures and references. The font size must be at least 10 points. 

Workshops: Proposals for workshops are solicited.  Potential instructors are requested to submit a workshop proposal of at most 5 pages, 
including biographical sketch of each organizers, to the Workshop Chairs by Jan 20, 2009.  Evaluation of workshop proposals will 
be based on the expertise and experience of the organizers and the relevance of the subject matter. Please see the conference Website
for further details.
