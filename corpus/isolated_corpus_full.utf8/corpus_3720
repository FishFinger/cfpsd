Contact Person: Elly van Gelderen
Meeting Email: ellyvangelderen@asu.edu

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

On 27 February 2009, ASU is organizing a Workshop on Parameters and Typology, centered around an invited lecture by Mark Baker. There will be other talks on the place of parameters within the Minimalist Program and different formulations of parameters within the current feature-based framework. Implications for typology will also be discussed. 

Call for Papers

Within the Minimalist Program, there are currently two major lines of thought where parameters are concerned. Baker (2001), on the one hand, has suggested macro-parameters. The choice of polysynthesis, for example, implies that the language will have many other characteristics. Baker (2008: 221) refines this by focusing on agreement and case. Chomsky (e.g. 2008), on the other hand, attributes as little as possible to the role of parameters and to UG in general. Minimalist parameters now (Chomsky 2004; 2006) consist of choices of feature specifications as the child acquires a lexicon. All parameters are lexical and determine linearization; therefore, they account for the variety of languages. 

The workshop is intended to contribute to this debate:
(a)Are there ''many little parameters or two big parameters''? (Baker 2008)
(b)Can features (e.g. i-phi/u-phi) account for cross-linguistic differences?
(c)What are the implications for typology?

Location: Paris, France, France

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 05-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

Created in 1998, the Rencontres Jeunes Chercheurs (RJC) of the Doctoral School 'Langue and languages' (ED 268, Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III) is an opportunity for junior researchers preparing for a Master's degree or a Doctorate, but also for post-doctorates, to present their work  in paper or  poster sessions.

This year, the theme will be:
Cotext, Context, Situation 

Call for Papers

In linguistics (and in many other fields of study such as sociology and anthropology), the context is, a fundamental concept but what it means varies according to the discipline and the theoretical and methodological orientations of the researcher. RJC is an invitation for junior researchers to ponder upon the plurality of the values of context and their applications in the language sciences.
Presentations may follow four main lines of reflection:
1. The first line will let you review the way research in language sciences develops the notions of ''cotext'', ''context'' and ''situation''. You are invited to suggest or clarify a definition, to study the three notions by confronting one of them with the others, or to offer a critical view on the past and present scientific work (in particular on some set definitions).
2. The second line will be dedicated to the study of cotext, defined here as all the linguistic units (phonemes, lexemes, morphemes, text, etc.) adjacent to the studied linguistic unit. Any study, model or formalization treating cotext in phonology, in morphology, in syntax, in semantics may be the object of a study.
3. In a pragmatic, enunciative and interactional perspective, presentations may deal with the notion of situation as the frame of a statement, a dialogue, a speech, etc.- be it written or oral. Hypotheses may be formulated on the importance of the situational or extra-linguistic context, on its motives and effects (circumstances of a speech act, identity of the participants, the speaker's intentions, etc.). This third line also includes all the studies that delineate the relevant clues used to understand or interpret a speech in situation.
4. Finally, the fourth line will concern papers devoted to the development of the notion of context in a spatial and socio-cultural approach. The way the regional or national context (i.e. in geo-linguistics, dialectology, etc.) may be studied as well as the ideological, political and social contexts influencing  linguistic performances.

Invited Speakers
Catherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni
Georges Kleiber

Calendar
January 05, 2009: Deadline for the submission of abstracts for oral presentations (1,000 words) and of posters (500 words).

Beginning of March, 2009: Answer from the Organization Committee after examination by the Selected Scientific Committee.  
May 29 and 30, 2009: RJC ED 268.  

Submission
Proposals for oral presentations should be typed in Times New Roman 12, simple spacing, in the form of a summary of 1,000 words at most (including references) and the proposals for posters in the form of a summary of 500 words at most ( including references). In the case of phonetic transcriptions, please use the SILDoulos font, downloadable on http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?Id=91
Propositions are to be sent to the Organization Committee by e-mail (rjc.paris3@gmail.com), in the .rtf format. They should be sent twice: the first one will be named ''anon_NAME_rjc2009.rtf'' (for example ''anon_SMITH_rjc2009.rtf'') and will contain:
Title 
Fiel(s) of research
Line in which the paper or poster proposal applies
5 keywords 
A summary 

The second named ''NAME_rjc2009.rtf'' (for example ''JOHNSON_rjc2009.rtf'') will contain the following information, besides the previous ones:  
Personal data (last name, first name, e-mail and personal postal address)
Level of studies (clarify the number of years for the doctorate) 
Research supervisor(s)

Only one submission will be examined for each participant

The languages of oral presentations and posters will be English or French. The duration of oral presentations  will 20 minutes + 10 minutes for questions. Before the display of posters, each author will be invited to present their work in a short oral presentation (5 min.).
