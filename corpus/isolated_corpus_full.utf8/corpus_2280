Dear Colleague,

FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE AND SOCIETY Northeastern University, Boston, USA 18-20 January 2008 
http://www.Technology-Conference.com

This Conference will address a range of critically important themes in the various fields that address the complex and subtle relationships between technology, knowledge and society. The Conference is cross-disciplinary in scope, meeting points for technologists with a concern for the social and social scientists with a concern for the technological. The focus is primarily, but not exclusively, on information and communications technologies.

The Conference has an impressive line-up of international main speakers (http://t08.cgpublisher.com/main_speakers.html): Jody Berland (York University); James Paul Gee (Arizona State University); Karim Gherab Martin (Harvard University); David Matheson (Carleton University); Ronald Sandler (Northeastern University); Elizabeth Stark (Free Culture Group, Harvard University); and McKenzie Wark (New School for Social Research, New York).

The Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Papers submitted for the Conference proceedings will be peer-refereed and published in print and electronic formats in the International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

We are also making available a limited number of free registrations for graduate students who are willing to assist at the conference, and people from developing countries. For details, see http://t08.cgpublisher.com/registration_types.html.

Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website.  The final date for proposal submission is December 31, 2007.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Boston in January 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Marcus Breen
