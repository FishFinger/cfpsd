Hi James,

thanks for the report.
Just one quick question about OOT: is it possible to submit without being
enrolled (at the end of a full period of enrollment, of course) ?
I'm asking that, because international students start paying fees
after 3.5years, which is prohibitive for most students--if not all.
Having still the
possibility to submit beyond 3.5 years, while not being enrolled anymore,
would be quite helpful.

Cheers,
JP
