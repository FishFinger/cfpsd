Meeting Description:

2nd Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora:
From Parallel to Non-Parallel Corpora
ACL-IJCNLP 


Call for Papers

Objective
Following the success of the first Workshop on Building and Using Comparable
Corpora http://www.limsi.fr/~pz/lrec2008-comparable-corpora/ at LREC 2008, this
workshop aims to bring together language engineers as well as linguists
interested in the constitution and use of comparable corpora, ranging from
parallel to non-parallel corpora. In the larger context of the joint ACL-IJCNLP,
this workshop aims to solicit contributions from researchers in different
geographical regions, in order to highlight in particular the issues with
comparable corpora across languages that are very different from each other,
such as across Asian and European languages. Research in minority languages is
also of particular interest.

More detail on the context and motivation of this workshop can be found on the
workshop Web site:
http://comparable2009.ust.hk/

Invited Speaker
Kenneth Ward Church (Microsoft Research, Redmond) 

Topics
We solicit contributions in but not limited to the following topics:

Building Comparable Corpora
- Human translations
- Automatic and semi-automatic methods
- Methods to mine parallel and non-parallel corpora from the Web
- Tools and criteria to evaluate the comparability of corpora
- Parallel vs. non-parallel corpora, monolingual corpora
- Rare and minority languages
- Across language families
- Multi-media/multi-modal comparable corpora

Applications of Comparable Corpora
- Human translations
- Language learning
- Cross-language information retrieval & document categorization
- Bilingual projections
- Machine translation
- Writing assistance

Mining from Comparable Corpora
- Extraction of parallel segments or paraphrases from comparable corpora
- Extraction of bilingual and multilingual translations of single words and
multi-word expressions; proper names, named entities, etc.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
