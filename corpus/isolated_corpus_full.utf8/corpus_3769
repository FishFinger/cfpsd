Conference on Semantics and Modelisation, JSM09
April 9-10 2009
Paris, France
http://jsm.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/jsm09

The GDR Sémantique et Modélisation (CNRS) and the UMR 7110 (CNRS &
University Paris Diderot-Paris 7) organize the seventh edition of the
Conference on Semantics and Modelisation (JSM09). The conference will
be held in Paris, on April 9-10, 2009.

The goal of the conference is to promote research on the formalisation of
linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal models. In view of
the development of corpus-based research in semantics and related fields,
proposals articulating the use of corpora and representational problems in
semantics and pragmatics are particularly welcome.
