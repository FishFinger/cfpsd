Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Morphology; Semantics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description

The Workshop on Markedness and Underspecification in the Morphology and
Semantics of Agreement (MUMSA) will bring together researchers from two
disciplinary areas of Linguistics (Morphology and Semantics) and from
typological and formalist backgrounds, who are united by both their object of
study (the categorizations underlying agreement) and their approach (appeal to
competition via underspecification), but who in practice have little opportunity
for cross-pollination. The workshop will make steps towards filling the voids
among these exciting research domains. 

Workshop on Markedness and Underspecification in Morphological and Semantic
Agreement

2nd Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007
Call for Papers

Location: Harvard University
Date: February 29 - March 2, 2008

Organizers:
Jonathan Bobaljik (Univ. Connecticut)
Andrew Nevins (Harvard Univ.)
Uli Sauerland (ZAS, Berlin)

Significant advances have been made in the understanding of both the
morphology and semantics of agreement in recent years. For example, the
last five years have seen, on the one hand, the publication of new treatments of
the range of variation in the morphological expression of person marking (esp.
work by M. Cysouw), and on the other, some of the first new discoveries about
the formal semantics of personal pronouns and person agreement (especially work
by Heim, Kratzer, Sauerland and others). 
Yet, the results of the two disciplinary areas have been largely isolated from
one another, in part as a result of the increasing degree of sub-specialization
within the field. MUMSA will provide for a balance of speakers representing
morphology and semantics, typology and formal theory. Roughly two-thirds of the
speakers are invited participants, selected from the cutting edge in each area.
The workshop will have a presentation + invited commentary format to ensure the
highest level of integration among the invited participants. Additional talks
will be selected by refereed abstract.

Topics for investigation include but are not limited to:
- markedness (in form versus in meaning)
- person (evidence for or against categories such as ''participant'' and
''3/other'')
- number (morphologically, there is near consensus in treating singular as
unmarked with respect to plural, yet in the semantic literature, there is
growing evidence for the opposite relationship, see Sauerland et. al. 2005)
- gender (the legacy of Jakobson's view of the feminine:masculine contrast)
- entailment relations among features (morphological and semantic evidence)
and the related question of a feature geometry
- hierarchies (person, number, the question of a markedness reversal 2>1 in
Algonquian agreement systems)

Invited Speakers:
Susana Bejar (Univ. Toronto)
Andrea Calabrese (Univ. Connecticut)
Gennaro Chierchia (Harvard Univ.)
Greville Corbett (Univ. Surrey)
Michael Cysouw (Max Planck, Leipzig)
Daniel Harbour (Queen Mary's. London)
Angelika Kratzer (UMass Amherst)
Orin Percus (Univ. Nantes)
Louisa Sadler (Univ. Essex)
Kenneth J. Safir (Rutgers Univ.)

Abstracts should be sent as anonymous and as two-page PDFs in an email
attachment to mumsa.abstracts@gmail.com by November 15th.

MUMSA will be held thanks to the generous support of the National Science
Foundation.
