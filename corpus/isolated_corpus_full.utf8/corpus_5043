Meeting Description:

The Department of English, Sultan Qaboos University, Oman, is pleased to 
announce its second international conference on Language, Linguistics, 
Literature and Translation to be held on 10, 11 and 12 March, 2010. 

Call for Papers

The conference will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas in the four main
disciplines of language, linguistics, literature and translation. As the
articulated nature of the (sub)title, Centring the Marginal, Stretching the
Boundaries, suggests, the theme will highlight two processes in a redefinition
of our disciplines:  
- research and debate in areas which are traditionally seen as being at the
margins of our concern yet which can be seen as having a potentially
significant, central role; 
- research and debate which extends the limits of  our concern into new areas,
possibly through collaboration with related disciplines.   

Language
Language, Culture and Communication
Language and the Media
Language in Unequal Social Encounters
New Technologies and Language

Linguistics
New Frameworks in Language Analysis
Language Change
Sociopolitical Perspectives on Language
Globalization and Language Policy

Literature
Literatures in English
Literature in Translation/Comparative Literature
Children's Literature
Frameworks for Literary Analysis

Translation
Role of Theory in Translation Practice
Ideology and Translation
Translation Quality Assessment
Translation and Technology

Proposals are invited for papers (40 minutes) and brief presentations followed
by a led discussion (40 mins).  The conference will also include themed forums
led by a moderator.  Proposals should be submitted on the proposal form
(available from the email address below) by  Monday, 30 November, 2009.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
