The 14th conference on Formal Grammar

Bordeaux, France. July 25-26, 2009

Call for papers

Aims and Scope

FG provides a forum for the presentation of new and original research
on formal grammar, mathematical linguistics and the application of
formal and mathematical methods to the study of natural
language. Themes of interest include, but are not limited to,

   * formal and computational phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics
     and pragmatics;
   * model-theoretic and proof-theoretic methods in linguistics;
   * logical aspects of linguistic structure;
   * constraint-based and resource-sensitive approaches to grammar;
   * learnability of formal grammar;
   * integration of stochastic and symbolic models of grammar;
   * foundational, methodological and architectural issues in grammar;
   * mathematical foundations of statistical approaches to linguistic
     analysis.


Previous conferences in this series have welcomed papers from a wide
variety of frameworks.

Proceedings

Submissions will be reviewed anonymously by at least three reviewers.
Accepted papers will be published after the conference as volume
number 5591 in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(under the FoLLI LNAI subline).

Submission Details

We invite electronic submissions of original, unpublished 30-minute
papers (including questions, comments, and discussion). Papers should
report original work which was not presented in other conferences.
However, simultaneous submission is allowed, provided that the authors
indicate other conference to which the work was submitted on the paper
submission form. Note that accepted papers can only be presented in
one of the venues.


Authors are invited to submit anonymous papers presenting original and
unpublished research. Papers should not exceed 16 pages and should be
formatted according to the usual LNCS article style. The needed style
files are available at
ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/llncs2e.zip.


The submission deadline is May 3rd, 2009. Papers must be submitted
electronically at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fg09.
