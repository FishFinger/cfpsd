Meeting Description:

The Russian in Context Unit of the University of Edinburgh (Scotland) welcomes
papers for the conference 'The Russian Language Outside the Nation:
Speakers and Identity.' The aim of this conference is to explore multiple
issues connected to the position of Russian as a post-imperial language and
Russian speakers identities as members of a linguistic minority in the new world
configuration. This is a multidisciplinary conference that welcomes papers in a
variety of fields: sociolinguistics, critical discourse analysis, politics and
policies of language etc

The Conference web-page is soon to appear at the University of Edinburgh web-site. 

Call for Papers

Papers are invited for the conference to be held at the University of Edinburgh.
The aim of this conference is to explore multiple issues connected to the
position of Russian as a post-imperial language and Russian speakers identities
as members of a linguistic minority in the new world configuration. The
organisers wish to bring together scholars in the broadly understood field of
Russian language in society, including sociolinguistics, (critical) discourse
analysis, linguistic anthropology, language politics, and interdisciplinary
areas such as diaspora, identity, memory studies and others.

Key conference speakers:

- Professor David Andrews (Georgetown University, USA)
- Professor Bill Bowring (Birkbeck College, University of London, UK)
- Dr Ekaterina Protassova (Helsinki University, Finland)

It is envisaged that the conference will include but not be limited to the
following themes:

- Politics of the Russian language outside Russia;
- Space and place and Russian identity construction;
- Language and identities (cultural, ethnic, national, religious etc) of
Russian speakers in the countries of the former Soviet Union and of traditional
emigration;
- The Russian community as a story-telling society: narrative identities and
construction of common memories outside Russia;
- Fields of Russian identity negotiations;
- Russian and the questions of linguo-cultural marginality;
- Responses of Russian to the problems of globalization;
- Contested concepts (for e.g. diaspora, minority, integration) in relation
to Russian speakers;
- Linguistic performance of Russianness;
- Russian language virtual communications and questions of identity.

It is planned to publish an edited volume of selected papers.

Please E-mail your proposals, including a working title and an abstract of
around 300 words, by 15 August 2009 to the conference organisers:
Dr Lara Ryazanova-Clarke and Kristine Uzule, Russian in Context Research Unit,
Russian, Division of European Languages and Cultures, The University of
Edinburgh, U.K. : 
Lara.Ryazanova-Clarke@ed.ac.uk
k.uzule@ed.ac.uk

Participants will be notified on the acceptance of their proposals by 1st
October, 2009.
