Procedural Meaning: Problems and Perspectives 

Date: 15-Oct-2009 - 17-Oct-2009 
Location: Madrid, Spain 
Contact: Aoife Ahern

Meeting URL: http://www.uned.es/proceduralmeaning 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Meeting Description: 

The distinction between conceptual and procedural content, which represents a
new view on other classic characterisations, is a major component of Relevance
Theory. According to Wilson and Sperber (1993:1), an utterance can be expected
"to encode two basic types of information: representational and computational,
or conceptual and procedural -that is, information about the representations to
be manipulated, and information about how to manipulate them."

Research on procedural content has already produced very noteworthy results in
many areas. However, there are still a number of questions that require further
clarification and more detailed analysis. The conference is intended to be a
meeting point for those working on procedural meaning from different points of
view and to identify new challenges that will determine the directions for
research in the next few years. 

Conference Announcement

The conference call encourages the presentation of contributions in three main
areas: theoretical, analytical-descriptive and experimental.

Within the theoretical focus, enquiries on topics such as the following would be
appropriate: 
The distinction between conceptual and procedural content
Theoretical characterization of procedural content, its defining features,
nature and status
The type of units that encode these contents
The relationship between procedural content and grammatical categories
The differences between procedural content that contributes to explicit content
and that which contributes to implicatures
Diachronic processes in the emergence of procedural meaning
The relationship between semantic change and grammaticalization
The existence of universal restrictions on the type of procedural content that
can be encoded in a language
The consequences of all of these characterizations for semantic and pragmatic
theory and the interface between grammar and pragmatics.

Analytical and descriptive proposals could be related to any kind of linguistic
unit or aspect of grammar with procedural content, including:

Pronouns
Nominal reference
Deixis
Discourse anaphora
Affective meaning
Tense and temporal reference
Mood
Aspect
Modality
Evidentiality
Word order and information structure
The procedural function of prosody
Discourse markers

Any of the above topics would allow for treatment in experimental terms; thus,
the following types of investigations are equally welcome:

Neurological or psychological research contributing reliable data on processing
effort in the computation of procedural content

Brain areas involved in processing this kind of content and types of inferential
processes:

Computational models
Experimental studies on acquisition of procedural content both in L1 and L2
Experimental studies supporting the establishment or bases of significant
correlations among the different points in the areas of focus mentioned above.
