Language, Literature and Culture in Africa - Call for contributions

The book tentatively entitled, Language, Literature and Culture in Africa,
seeks to investigate, in more concrete and harmonized terms than as
represented in the literature, the link between language, literature and
culture in the African context. It attempts to explore how languages in
Africa, including English, engaged in several domains, convey
culture-related values both in real life situations and literary
mediations. Papers, which could be of any length and which must be related
to the African experience, are expected to cover the following or other
related areas:

1.	Language, literature and social values
2.	Language and ideology
3.	Ideological expressions in African literature
4.	Language, literature and political culture
5.	Linguistic theories and politics
6.	Language, literature and violence
7.	Literary theories and politics 
8.	Language, literature and history
9.	Language, Literature and Politics (power)
10.	Language, literature and development
11.	Language, literature and religion
12.	Language, literature and gender
13.  Language, literature and traditional medicine
14.  Language, Literature and Orature
15.  Language, literature and education
16.  Literature, culture and education
17.  Language, literature and ethical values
18.  Language, Literature and Social Class
19.	Language and domestic discourse
20.	Language, Literature and the Media
21.	Language, culture and law
22.	Communication, culture and development
23.	Communication, culture and grassroots    development/governance
24.	Communication and culture
25.	Language, Literature and African Economy

Papers, in soft versions, should be sent to Akin Odebunmi
(akinodeb@yahoo.com) or any of the editors. The deadline for submission of
manuscripts is 30 August, 2009. The book is expected to be published by a
reputable international publisher by mid 2010.
