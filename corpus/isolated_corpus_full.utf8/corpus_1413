Meeting Description

7th European Conference on Formal Description of Slavic Languages 

Call for Papers

The Slavic Department of the University of Leipzig is pleased to announce the
7th European Conference on Formal Description of Slavic Languages (FDSL-7).

Abstracts are invited for 30-minute talks (20-minute presentation plus 10
minutes for discussion) on Slavic syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics,
psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. Presentations will be in any
Slavic language, English or German.

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is 15 June, 2007.

How to submit abstracts 

Abstracts must be anonymous and no longer than one page (margins: 2.5 cm or 1
inch, size of characters: 12 points, spacing: single). An additional page for
references, figures and data can be also included. 

The abstract must be submitted as a PDF attachment. Please make sure that all
fonts are embedded. If you have no access to a pdf maker such as Acrobat
Distiller, you might consider installing the free office suite OpenOffice
(www.openoffice.org/), which includes a regular pdf output. 

Abstracts must be submitted to fdsl7@uni-leipzig.de by June 15, 2007. 

Include the following information in the body of the e-mail message: 

(1) title of paper;
(2) your name;
(3) email address;
(4) affiliation.

An individual may submit at most one single and one co-authored paper. 

Reviewing procedure 

The abstracts will be anonymously reviewed by external referees. Preference will
be given to presentations not duplicated at other major conferences. 

Authors whose abstracts are accepted will be notified by the end of June. 

Publication of Conference papers 

As usual papers will be published. Written versions must be submitted by March
31, 2008. Publication Guidelines with detailed information will be made
available on the Conference Homepage in due time. 

Papers submitted for publication will be reviewed. Only those submissions that
are recommended by the reviewers will be included in the volume. 

Additional information is available at the FDSL-7 web site:
