Institute of English Studies
Senate House
University of London 

Call for Papers

Extended deadline for abstract submission: 12 February 2009

The attention devoted to the linguistics of the English language has resulted in
a broad body of work in diverse research traditions. The aim of the ICLCE
conference is to encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas between different
frameworks and research traditions, all of which may address any aspect of the
linguistics of contemporary English. The first and second ICLCE conferences were
held in Edinburgh (2005) and Toulouse (2007) along the same lines. We aim for
the London conference to build on the success of those events.

The main conference will be preceded on 14 July 2009 by a one-day symposium to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Survey of English Usage, founded by
Randolph Quirk at UCL. The theme of this symposium will be 'Current Change in
the English Verb Phrase'.

Plenary speakers at the main conference:
James Blevins (Cambridge)
Bernd Kortmann (Freiburg)
James M. Scobbie (Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh)
Sali Tagliamonte (Toronto)

Instructions for the submission of abstracts can be found here:

http://ies.sas.ac.uk/events/conferences/2009/ICLCEthree/index.htm

This conference is organized by the Linguistics Department, Queen Mary,
University of London (QMUL) and the Survey of English Usage (SEU) at UCL in
collaboration with the Institute of English Studies.

Call for Papers

Key-note Speakers:
Vyvyan Evans (Bangor, UK)
Günter Radden (Hamburg, Germany)
Milena  ?ic Fuchs (Zagreb, Croatia)

Topics and Methodology:
Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research on
theoretical and applied linguistics aspects of the relation of space, time and
language, including, but not limited to, the following:
- space in cognition and language
- physical vs abstract (socio-cultural) vs virtual space, as reflected in language
- the relation of embodiment and environment, as reflected in language
- time in cognition and language
- the relation of space and time in language
- physical and fictive motion in language
- grammar of space
- time and linguistic categories
The relation of space, time and language can be discussed from a descriptive
(synchronic) point of view, but ideally it should be approached from one or more
of the following perspectives:
- contrastive
- typological
- contact linguistic
- cross-lectal
- acquisitional and FLT
- diachronic
- corpus linguistic

Apart from the plenary key-note speeches, the conference programme will consist
of 20-minute presentations in sessions (a 15-minute talk followed by a 5-minute
question-and-answer session) and a poster session.
