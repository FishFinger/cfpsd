Call for Software Demonstrations

ACL-IJCNLP-09: Call for Software Demonstrations
The ACL-IJCNLP-09 Program Committee invites proposals for the
Demonstrations Program. We encourage both the submission of early
research prototypes and interesting mature systems

PLEASE NOTE: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not
appropriate in the Demonstrations Program, and should be arranged as
part of the Exhibit Program.

Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and
applied computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the
topics listed for the conference paper submission:

http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/callforpapers.html

The systems may be of the following kinds:

- Natural Language Processing systems or system components
- Application systems using language technology components
- Software tools for computational linguistics research
- Software for demonstration or evaluation
- Development tools

Format for Submissions

Demo proposals consist of the following parts, which should all be
sent to the Demo Chairs. Please use the main ACL-IJCNLP paper
formatting guidelines.

- An extended abstract of the technical content to be demonstrated,
including title, authors, full contact information, references, and
acknowledgements.
- A "script outline" of the demo presentation, including accompanying
narrative, and either a Web address for accessing the demo or visual
aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams).
- A detailed description of the hardware, software and internet
service requirements expected to be provided by the local organizer.

The entire proposal should not be more than four pages.

Submission Procedure

Submission Deadline : March 30, 2009.

Submissions must be received electronically. Please submit your
proposals and any inquiries to (both chairs):

Gary Geunbae Lee (gblee@postech.ac.kr) and Sabine Schulte im Walde
(schulte@ims.uni-stuttgart.de)

- Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to
computational linguistics, innovation, scientific contribution,
presentation, as well as potential logistical constraints.
- Accepted submissions will be allocated maximum four pages in the
Companion Volume to the Proceedings of the Conference.
