Full Title: Current Issues in Language Planning 


Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2008 

Information technologies have had a considerable impact on language use in
recent decades. The development of new technologies has often been
undertaken without consideration of language issues, and this has meant
that language-planning work has been needed to integrate new technologies
into existing language ecologies. At the same time, technology developers,
especially software developers, have become aware of some of the language
issues relevant to the uptake and use of their products. Information
technologies have also been seen as a way of democratising communication,
and this has afforded many language communities new ways to develop,
promote and use their languages in the public domain. Modern information
technologies are characterised by rapid change involving a continuous cycle
of innovation, replacement and obsolescence of technologies which further
complicates language planning work. These developments have required
responses from government and from various institutions to respond to the
issues to which the development of new technologies have given rise. The
focus of planning for language issues revolving around technology includes,
but is not limited to:

-	The planning of language and literacy capabilities required to access and
use technologies, including issues relating to the 'digital divide'.

-	The development of technologies to support languages and to permit access
to technologies through particular languages.

-	The use of technology to achieve language planning goals in areas such as
education, language maintenance, prestige planning, etc.

-	Corpus planning for the language of technology.
This volume seeks to canvass the range of technology related issues which
confront contemporary language planners and to profile work in this field.

The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 31 July 2008.

The deadline for receipt of the final paper is 1 April 2009.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
