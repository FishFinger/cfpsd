Call Deadline: 20-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

Workshop will feature contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic
aspects of plurality.

'pluractionals', plural nominalizations) and the nature of cross-categorial
plurality markers. 

Call for Papers

Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality
November 7th -8th, 2008
Paris

Invited Speakers:
- Paul Newman (Indiana / Michigan)
- Martina Faller (Manchester)

The Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality will take place on November
7th -8th, 2008, in Paris. It is organized by the project ''Distributive
dependencies: nominal and verbal plurality'' (CNRS, Fédération TUL).

This project explores the parallels and interactions between the nominal
and the verbal domain by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality, and its
morpho-syntactic manifestations accross languages.

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of plurality
are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of event
plurality and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals,
distributivity, ''pluractionals'', plural nominalizations) and the nature of
cross-categorial plurality markers.

We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations (plus ten-minute discussions).
Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length (including examples and
references). Abstracts can be written in French or in English.

Abstracts must be anonymous and should be sent by e-mail (plain ASCII,
rtf, ps or pdf) to: pcabredo //AT// univ-paris8.fr

Please write the (first) author's name plus the word 'abstract' in the
subject line of your message (e.g., 'Dupont abstract'), and include author
name(s), affiliation, contact information and the title of the abstract in
the body of the email. For co-authored papers indicate the email address
that we should use for correspondence.

Abstracts should reach us by August 20, 2008.
