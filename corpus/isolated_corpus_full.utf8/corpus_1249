Meeting Description

This workshop is part of a series of workshops on Multiword Expressions
(MWE) that have been held at ACL conferences since 2001. This year, we want
to take a broader perspective on multiword expressions, in particular by
addressing the following topics:
- Linguistic, empirical and cognitive properties of MWEs
- Classes and subtypes of MWEs
- A cross-linguistic perspective on MWEs
- Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs 

2nd Call for Papers
ACL 2007 Workshop 
A Broader Perspective on Multiword Expressions
Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

Date: June, 28  2007
Location: Prague, Czech Republic

Submission deadline: 26 March 2007
 
Workshop Website: http://www.let.uu.nl/~Nicole.Gregoire/personal/ACL07-MWE/

In recent years, the NLP community has increasingly become aware of the
problems that multiword expressions (MWEs) pose. A considerable amount of
research has been conducted in this area, some within large research
projects dedicated to MWEs. Although progress has been made especially in
the area of multiword extraction, a number of fundamental questions remain
unanswered.

Following up workshops on various aspects of MWEs at previous ACL
conferences, we want to address these questions in this year's MWE workshop:

- Is it sufficient to use purely statistical methods for the extraction of
MWEs 
from corpora, or is it necessary to harness human knowledge and linguistic
insights?
- Is fully automatic MWE extraction feasible, or will manual validation always 
be required?
- What is the nature of MWEs, and how can they be defined formally?
- To what extent can definitions and extraction procedures be generalised
to other languages, other text types and other types of MWEs?
- Can and should we distinguish subtypes of MWEs for NLP applications?

In addition to these fundamental issues, we want to address the practical
question of what is needed for a successful treatment of MWEs in NLP:

- What properties should be specified for MWEs or subtypes of MWEs in the
lexicon?
- Can we detect these properties automatically with sufficient accuracy?
- How can existing grammars be adapted in order to deal better with MWEs?
- What role do the semantics of MWEs play in NLP applications and can they
be determined automatically from large corpora?

We therefore solicit papers describing linguistically motivated approaches
to MWEs, comparative studies across languages or different subtypes of
MWEs, and the treatment of MWEs in NLP applications. This includes (but is
not limited to) research on:

- Linguistic, Empirical and Cognitive Properties of MWEs: research into the
definitions and characteristic properties of MWEs and the impact that such
information has on NLP applications.

- Classes of MWEs: investigating classes (or subtypes) of MWEs and the
extent to which computational techniques transfer to different classes and
different languages.

- Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs: combining the
computational treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic and/or
psycholinguistic analysis.


Submission Information

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to
projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity
should be avoided. For example, instead of ''We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...'', write ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.

Submission will be electronic, using the workshop's ''Start'' paper
submission webpage (http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS6/submit.html).
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must
be submitted no later than 7pm US Eastern time March 26, 2007 (23:59 GMT
March 26, 2007). Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.


Workshop Format

This is a half-day workshop. The accepted papers will be presented as
20-minute talks followed by a 10-minute discussion.


Important Dates

Paper submission deadline: March 26, 2007 
Notification of acceptance: April 30, 2007 
Camera ready papers due: May 9, 2007 
Workshop date: June 28 (AM), 2007

Subject: Science of Aphasia 8 

	

Full Title: Science of Aphasia 8 
Short Title: SoA8 

Date: 14-Sep-2007 - 19-Sep-2007
Location: Monopoli (Bari), Italy 
Contact Person: Frank Burchert
Meeting Email: burchert@ling.uni-potsdam.de

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Neurolinguistics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

The SoA conferences are intended to bring together senior and junior scientists
working in the multidisciplinary field of neurocognition of language and dealing
with normal function as well as disorders. The size of the conference with a
maximum of 100 participants ensures direct interaction between the participants. 

SoA8 invites abstract submissions with a general focus on neurocognition of
language or on one of the following four program topics:

- Neuroanatomy/Neurophysiology (Organization: Prof. Dr. Riitta Salmelin, Dr.
Jubin Abutalebi)
- Neurolinguistic theory: representation and/versus processing (Organization:
Prof. Dr. Roelien Bastiaanse, PD Dr. Frank Burchert)
- Neurolinguistic intervention (Organization: Prof. Dr. David Howard, Dr. Wendy
Best)
- Convergences and divergences between different approaches (Organization: Prof.
Dr. David Poeppel, N.N.)

Contributed papers are planned in the form of short oral presentations and
poster sessions. Poster sessions start with brief oral presentations of the
highlights of each poster (3-5 min) and with ample time for discussion.
