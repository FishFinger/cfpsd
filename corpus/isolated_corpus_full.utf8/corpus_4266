Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERDISCIPLINARY SOCIAL SCIENCES     
University of Athens, Athens, Greece     
8-11 July 2009      
http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com     

The International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences examines the nature of disciplinary practices, and the interdisciplinary practices that arise in the context of 'real world' applications. It also interrogates what constitutes 'science' in a social context, and the connections between the social and other sciences.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 12 February 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Athens in July 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Gerassimos Kouzelis     
Professor of Philosophy of Science and Sociology of Knowledge     
Department of Political Science and Public Administration     
University of Athens, Athens, Greece     
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences and International Conference of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences
