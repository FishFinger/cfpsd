SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
REVISED DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS; 22nd MARCH
Exemplar-Based Models of Language Acquisition and Use
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~davec/workshop.htm
13 - 17 August 2007

organized as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organizers:
Rens Bod=09=09rb@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
Dave Cochran=09=09davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk

Workshop Purpose:
Exemplar-based models conceive of linguistic representations as being 
directly shaped by speakers' memories of specific tokens of linguistic 
items. Such models are being considered by a growing number of 
researchers in virtually all areas of linguistics, from language 
acquisition and psycholinguistics to computational linguistics and 
statistical natural language processing. This workshop aims at bringing 
together linguists working to expand their exemplar-based models by 
computational modeling, and computational linguists interested in 
extending exemplar-based models to aspects of language cognition. The 
workshop is open to all members of the Language, Logic and Information 
community, and is in particular intended as a forum for advanced PhD 
students and more senior researchers to share their research.

Workshop Topics:
- Unsupervised exemplar-based systems for parsing and other NLP tasks; 
Statistical grammar induction; bootstrapping in exemplar-based models 
of language, in computers and infants.
- The interaction between language and other cognitive modalities in 
exemplar-based systems; exemplar based semantics and pragmatics.
- The nature of linguistic knowledge and representations in 
exemplar-based systems.
- Distributional learning; Pattern matching and language acquisition
- Statistical, item-based and corpus-based language acquisition
- Exemplars, recency and priming.
- Cognitive consequences of the problems of computational complexity in 
exemplar-based algorithms and their solutions.
- Computational approaches to exemplar-based construction grammar; 
computational approaches to usage-based linguistics.
- Comprehension and generation in exemplar-based systems.
- Learning as abstraction vs. learning as storage; or, proposals for 
integration.
- General theoretical/philosophical considerations regarding the 
relation of computational models to experimental cognitive research

We are particularly eager to receive submissions of an 
interdisciplinary nature, especially those bridging the gap between 
computational and experimental approaches.

Submission details:
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 1000-2000 words. 
The following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Submissions 
must be suitable for anonymous review; reviewing will be double-blind. 
Please do not include name, contact details, affiliation, or any 
self-identifying references (eg; =93We proved in Smith 2003=85=94, rather 
than =93Smith 2003 proved=85=94) in the text of the submission; please 
include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment) containing the title 
of your submission, your name, contact details and affiliation. Please 
send your submission electronically to davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk by the 
deadline listed below. The submissions will be reviewed by the 
workshop=92s programme committee and additional reviewers. The accepted 
papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The 
format for the final versions will be MS Word.

Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. 
It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive 
days in the second week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper 
presentation (30 minutes) and discussion (15 minutes) per session. On 
the first day the workshop organizers will give an extended lecture to 
familiarize the audience with the topic.
