~~~~~   Workshop on Common Sense and Intelligent User Interfaces ~~~~~

@ IUI 2007
January 28, 2007
Honolulu, Hawaii

~~~~~~~~~~  Paper Submission Deadline November 13th ~~~~~~~~~

Ideally, computer interfaces will be able to interact with users at a
higher level by understanding our goals, our problems, and the social
procedures by which we live. In order for these intelligent computer
interfaces to see the world from the perspective of their users, they must
have access to a wealth of information about the world that human users
take for granted. This information, which forms the basis of goal-directed
computer interactions, is common sense knowledge.

Common sense knowledge is non-expert and possessed by every person. Thus,
volunteers make up a significant source of common sense knowledge being
collected today, and intelligent interfaces help these contributors create
robust and complete common sense databases. An interactive and intelligent
environment can guide a contributor to add the information that would be
most useful to the system and, with good design, can make the knowledge
entry experience more rewarding for the contributor.

In turn, this collected common sense knowledge helps enable a wide variety
of interfaces to function better. We're interested in exploring both sides
of this symbiotic relationship. How can common sense enable computers
interfaces to better understand their human users? How can interfaces
enable the elicitation of common sense knowledge?

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Knowledge engineering and gathering of common sense knowledge:

     * Interfaces for volunteers to contribute common sense knowledge
     * Interfaces for verification and consistency-checking of common sense
       knowledge
     * Knowledge elicitation
     * Mining of common sense knowledge from text, and from observation of
       user actions

Adaptation of interfaces using common sense knowledge:

     * Understanding context, affect, and other kinds of implicit knowledge
       using common sense knowledge
     * Using common sense knowledge for understanding user intentions,
       preferences, goals and plans
     * Using common sense knowledge to predict user actions and providing
       intelligent defaults
     * Common sense for debugging, "sanity checking", and dealing with
       unusual situations
     * Diversity of common sense knowledge across different languages and
       cultures
