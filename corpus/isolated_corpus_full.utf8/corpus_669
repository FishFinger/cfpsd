Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 20-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

The track of Applied Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers working in natural language processing (NLP)/computational linguistics(CL), applied linguistics(AL) and related areas. The rapid pace of development of online materials, most of them in textual form or text combined with other media (visual, audio), has led to a revived interest for tools able to understand, organize and mine those materials. Innovative human-computer interfaces, for instance interactive agents, can benefit from language understanding and generation techniques with a large impact on user acceptance and satisfaction. Moreover, language can facilitate human-computer interaction for people with special needs leading to an ever increasing user base for computer systems. 

While papers and contributions on traditional issues are welcome, the 2007 track will emphasize applications by the NLP/CL community, particularly in areas such as multilingual processing, learning environments, multimodal communication, bioNLP, spam filtering, humor processing, security, language teaching, textual assessment, language varieties, materials development, and educational applications etc. We also encourage papers in information retrieval, speech processing and machine learning that present actual applications that can benefit from or have an impact on NLP/CL.

19.Applications: Machine Translation, Summarization, Intelligent Tutoring, Question Answering, Information Extraction, etc. 
20.others 

Submission Guidelines:
Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The papers should not exceed 6 pages and are due by November 21, 2006. Please note the change from 5 to 6 pages from the first CFP. Additional pages (7 and more) have to be cleared by the program chairs and will be $100 each. For FLAIRS-20, the 2007 conference, the reviewing is not blind. Authors should indicate the special track if one exists that closely matches the topic of their paper. All submissions will be done electronically via the FLAIRS web submission system available through the paper submission site at http://www.easychair.org/FLAIRS20/. 

Please, check the website http://www.flairs.com/ for information regarding submission. 

Conference Proceedings:
Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press. Selected authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) to be published in 2007.
