The information economy exists as an environment in which we are all
contributors and consumers. Within this system, effective communication is
essential to success, allowing individuals to contribute ideas and information
effectively and to make efficient use of the goods and services. This conference
seeks to examine this economic model by examining the connections between
communication practices and the products, practices, and services that
constitute the information economy. The objective of such an examination will be
to help attendees better understand and participate in the information economy
as both contributors and consumers.
