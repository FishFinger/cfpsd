2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing
(EMNLP 2008)

Call for Papers

SIGDAT, the Association for Computational Linguistics' special interest
group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP, invites
submissions to EMNLP 2008. The conference will be held on October 25-27,
2008, at the Hilton Prince Kuhio, Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, immediately
following AMTA-2008 and the International Workshop on Spoken Language
Translation.

We are interested in papers from academia, government, and industry on
all areas of traditional interest to the SIGDAT community and aligned
fields, including but not limited to:

   * information extraction
   * information retrieval
   * language and dialogue modeling
   * lexical acquisition
   * machine translation
   * multilingual technologies
   * question answering
   * statistical parsing
   * summarization
   * generation
   * speech recognition and synthesis
   * discourse and dialogue
   * tagging
   * term and named entity extraction
   * word sense disambiguation
   * word, term, and text segmentation
   * general NLP-related machine learning techniques:
     theory, methods and algorithms

Submissions

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. Each
paper may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content and one (1) extra
page for references. Submissions should describe original, unpublished
work. Please use the official ACL 2008 style files at
http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html. We reserve the
right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles,
including font size restrictions. =


As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review. Separate identification
information is required, and will be part of the web submission process.


Submission/Reviewing will be electronic, managed by the START system.
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. To submit a
paper, please visit https://www.softconf.com/s08/emnlp08/.

A PDF file of the paper must be uploaded onto the system by the
submission deadline. Papers submitted after that time will not be
reviewed. =


Submissions presented at EMNLP should mainly contain new material that
has not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
proceedings. Papers that have been or will be submitted to other
meetings or publications must disclose this information at submission
time.

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: July 3, 2008 (11.59pm PDT Pacific Daylight Time)
Acceptance notification: August 21, 2008 =

Camera-ready copy due: September 15, 2008
Conference: October 25-27, 2008
