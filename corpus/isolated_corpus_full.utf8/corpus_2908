Announcement and First Call for Task Proposals

GENERATION CHALLENGES 2009
--------------------------

To be held in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

Following the NSF/SIGGEN Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative
Evaluation in NLG in April 2007
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/), and the INLG'06
Special Session on Sharing Data and Comparative Evaluation
(http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/inlg06-specsess.html),
there has recently been a lot of activity involving shared tasks in Natural
Language Generation (NLG).  The Pilot Attribute Selection for Generating
Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place between May and
September 2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge
2008 is currently underway; and other challenges are being prepared.

To provide a common forum for these activities, we are organising
Generation Challenges 2009, an umbrella event designed to bring together a
variety of shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of
natural language.  The following is a provisional list of tasks that have
been proposed so far:

1. The GIVE Challenge (Koller, Byron, Moore, Oberlander & Striegnitz):
Generation of natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a
virtual environment.

2. GREC Task (Belz, Gatt & Viethen): Generation of references to named
entities in discourse; exact task definition to be announced.

3. TUNA Progress Test (Gatt & Belz): An opportunity to improve on REG'08
Task 3, i.e. mapping from TUNA domain representations to referring expressions.

At this point, we invite any team of researchers interested in organising a
shared task as part of the Generation Challenges 2009 event to submit a
task proposal.

This is not intended to be a selective process.  Anyone interested in
running a shared task as part of Generation Challenges 2009 is in principle
welcome to do so.  We would simply like to get an idea of how many tasks
there are likely to be for organisational purposes, and also to be able to
offer advice and support where needed.  In the unlikely event that more
tasks are proposed than can be accommodated, we would make a selection
together with the ENLG'09 organisers.

Each team of task organisers will be reponsible for organising and
evaluating their task.  The Generation Challenges 2009 coordinators will
merely coordinate issues relating to the ENLG'09 special session,
presentations and reports.

Please send task proposals to gre-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk by 31 May 2008.
 Please bear in mind the timeline below, and include information regarding
organisers, task description, size and state of completion of data to be
used, evaluation plans and provisional timeline.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with any questions.  Best wishes,

Anja Belz and Albert Gatt

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
