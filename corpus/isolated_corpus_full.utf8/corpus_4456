  The e-journal Lexis is planning to publish its fifth issue, devoted to
Lexicology and stylistics, in April 2010.

  The relationship between lexicology and stylistics has always been, quite
understandably, somewhat ambivalent. While the lexicologist is mainly
concerned with the meaning and the formation of words, the stylistician
endeavours to reach beyond linguistic analysis to the various connotations
and shades of meaning produced. The lexicologist is sometimes prone,
however, to tackle stylistic issues just as the stylistician is not always
averse to coming to grips with lexical  matters. Whatever their apparently
different, even contrasting, modes of  investigation and aims, these two
domains do meet on common ground.
  The various lexical prospects opened up by interpretative semantics - in
the broadest sense of the term - range from the study of 'mots themes' (C.
Fromilhague / A. Sancier) to the exploration of lexical networks and
isotopies in a given corpus. From a lexicological viewpoint, both
etymological and graphic features, as well as derivational and
compositional parameters, can indeed provide food for thought for any
stylistic approach, as proved by the devices traditionally labelled as
polyptoton, antanaclasis or syllepsis. The syntagmatic axis is also of
major importance here, of course, via the different modes of syntactic
arrangement of lexical units.
  In addition to these semantic and morphological considerations, a number
of lexis-dependent acoustic phenomena can be taken into account, such as
the phonetic and rhythmical patterns at work in what G. Dessons and H.
Meschonnic describe as textual 'corporalisation', essential to the
intersubjective dimension of the text.
  The metalanguage used in stylistic analysis itself can also be a possible
field of study and, possibly, epistemological questioning.
  The chief aim of this issue of Lexis is to trigger a dialogue between
stylisticians and lexicologists by enabling them to confront their
prototypes in order to lay definite emphasis on words. The few suggestions
listed above are, of course, anything but exhaustive, and all papers aimed
at investigating the links between lexis and stylistics will be most welcome.

  Manuscripts may be written in French or in English, and should be
accompanied by an abstract of up to 10 lines in French and in English, as
well as a list of the relevant key words. They should be sent to the Editor
of Lexis, Denis Jamet as email attachments (Word and pdf), and will be
refereed by two members of the international evaluation committee.
Manuscripts may be rejected, accepted subject to revision, or accepted as
such. There is no limit to the number of pages.

  Deadline for sending in abstracts : February 2009.
  Deadline for sending in papers accepted : September 2009.
