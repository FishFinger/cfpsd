Meeting Description:

American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL)
Costa Mesa, CA
Proposal Submission Deadline: September 29, 2006

The 2007 conference of the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) will be held April 21-24 at the Hilton in Costa Mesa, California. Nationally and internationally, the AAAL conference has a reputation as a comprehensive and stimulating language conference. The 2007 AAAL conference will serve as a meeting place for applied linguists to generate ideas, cross disciplinary boundaries, and disseminate research about issues and concerns in language policy, second language acquisition, language pedagogy and assessment, discourse analysis, and other disciplinary areas of applied linguistics. 

AAAL is known for its in-depth colloquia and paper sessions, topical and thought-provoking plenaries, excellent book exhibits, and plentiful opportunities for networking. In 2007 the conference will feature a special strand on Spanish in the United States and will offer the opportunity to present and listen to papers in Spanish, learn about the latest developments in applied linguistics, and experience the beauty of Southern California. We hope you will consider sharing your work at AAAL in Costa Mesa. 

Call for Proposals

Extended Deadline: Friday, September 29, 2006 
Visit the AAAL2007 website to submit a proposal: http://www.aaal.org/aaal2007/index.htm

Proposals:

Proposals are invited for individual papers, posters, and colloquia in English and Spanish.

Individual Papers:
 
Papers are presented by one or more authors within a twenty-minute period and an additional ten-minute period is provided for discussion. 

Posters:

Posters are for one-on-one discussion of research. Posters are especially effective for presenting results of empirical research if data can be presented visually (in charts, graphs, or tables). A block of time will be designated when presenters are available to discuss their posters. Prospective presenters are encouraged to consider posters because of the opportunity they provide for inclusion of more presenters and topics in the program and for extended discussion with other researchers. 

Colloquia:

Colloquia are presented in three-hour blocks. Colloquium organizers may divide their time as they choose, but time should be allocated for opening and closing remarks, presentations, discussants (if included), and extended audience response. Colloquium organizers serve as the liaison between participants in their colloquium and the program committee, and are therefore responsible for communication among these participants.
