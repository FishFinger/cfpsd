Meeting Description:

This conference aims to map the current status of Audiovisual Translation
research, production, distribution and consumer needs, investigating the ways in
which research input, technology, user needs and the business aspects of AVT
intertwine. 

Call for Papers

Audiovisual Translation (AVT) earned its credentials as a practice and a
research area in the second half of the 20th century. Now, at the close of the
21st century's first decade, the discipline is expanding at a mind-boggling
rate.  AVT is a form of communication that is subject to, but also actively
engaged in aspects of social, political and technological change that call for
both increased specialisation and greater diversification on the part of
practitioners and researchers alike. In fact, AVT also offers a world of
possibilities and challenges to its users.

This conference aims to map the current status of AVT research, production,
distribution and consumer needs. The complexity and the ways in which research
input, technology, user needs and the business aspects of AVT intertwine, merits
serious thought. The 2nd international Media for All conference in 2007 revealed
concerns about the apparent tug of war between "quantity" and "quality". The
present conference would like to investigate whether these concerns were justified.

AVT practice crosses many disciplinary borders, but is also thrust in a variety
of directions by different influential players. We have mentioned technology,
business and political interests. AVT, from both the traditional 'translational'
perspective as well as the more encompassing accessibility angle, is considered
to be a tool for social integration. But is it? Will AVT and its users be able
to reap the benefits of the digital age? Will the research community be able to
turn the need for specialisation and diversification of research into an asset?
Where do we place AVT at a time when the dividing line between entertainment and
information becomes increasingly blurred and the borders between interlingual
and intralingual translation, audiovisual translation, creative (technical)
writing and localisation appear to be dissolving, challenging the distinction
between source and target texts? Audiences with different needs, different
access possibilities and different degrees of active input demand AVT forms made
to measure. Can these demands be met? How do we deal with hybrid art forms and
hybrid forms of communication that mix genres? How do we make the most of the
educational potential of AVT in a global village that should be able to remain
multilingual?

We hope to investigate these issues through papers, panels, and round-table
discussions. Please visit: http://www.mediaforall.eu/call.html  for more
information.
