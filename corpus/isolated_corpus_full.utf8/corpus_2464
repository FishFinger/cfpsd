Meeting Description

QITL-3 is a forum for researchers of linguistic frameworks engaged in
quantitative investigations of theoretically motivated linguistic questions. 

Second Call for Papers

3rd Quantitative Investigations in Theoretical Linguistics (QITL-3)
2-4 June 2008
Helsinki, Finland

Invited Speakers

Michael Cysouw, Max Planck Institute/Leipzig
Gary Marcus, New York University
Richard Sproat, University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign

General and background

The Linguistic Association of Finland (SKY) in association with the Department
of General Linguistics at the University of Helsinki will be co-hosting the
Third Workshop on Quantitative Investigations in Theoretical Linguistics
(QITL-3), to be held on Mon-Wed, 2-4 June, 2008, in Helsinki, Finland. The
official website of the workshop is to be found at:

http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/sky/tapahtumat/qitl/

This workshop is both a continuation of the two previous QITL events
held in Osnabrück, Germany (http://www.cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~qitl/), and the
latest in the sequence of summer symposia arranged by SKY
(http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/sky/tapahtumia.shtml).

Call for Papers

Since the turn of the millennium, the application of quantitative methods on
empirical data, with increasing sophistication and complexity, has become widely
accepted as central in the development and testing of theoretical hypotheses
concerning the nature of natural language and its processing by human beings.
However, it is also increasingly recognized that quantitative investigations
should be theoretically motivated and anchored, in addition to that linguistic
theories and models should be modified or even fundamentally revised, if not
also sometimes altogether refuted, to properly reflect the
reality of quantitative results. Simply put, quantitative methods and
theoretical developments should mutually feed and influence each other.

As with the previous two QITL meetings, we invite researchers from all
linguistic frameworks engaged in quantitative investigations of theoretical
linguistic questions to submit abstracts for 30 minute talks (plus 10 minutes of
discussion). The preferred focus is on how one has been able to address a
theoretically motivated linguistic question with some quantitative method(s);
computational and exploratory approaches may also be of interest if they lead to
or shed light on theoretical issues. Furthermore, we welcome studies
concerning all media of language use, whether spoken, written or electronic in
form. Relevant topics include (but are not by any means limited to) models of
lexical, syntactic or pragmatic/prosodic preferences, the nature of linguistic
rules/regularities and the lexicon (e.g. morphological productivity), the
relationship between language use, linguistic judgements and/or indirect data on
language processing, cross-linguistic typological tendencies, first and second
language acquisition, diachronic language development, and so
forth. Our goal is to continue the workshoppy and conversational form as well as
the theoretically and methodologically pluralistic atmosphere of the previous
QITL events.

Abstracts should be at the maximum 3 pages long (A4, with 12 point Times New
Roman or equivalent font and single spacing), including all tables, figures and
references (corresponding to approximately 1000-1500 words). Electronic
submission (in either PDF, PostScript or RTF format) by e-mail to ''qitl-3 at
helsinki.fi'' is strongly preferred. Each submission will be peer-reviewed by
(at least) two members of the program committee.

The deadline for submissions is Monday, 11 February 2008.
