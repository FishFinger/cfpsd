2nd CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS:

GlobEng: International Conference on Global English
             February 14 - 16 2008  - University of  Verona, Italy
             website: http://profs.lingue.univr.it/globeng/index.html

The Department of English Studies of the University of Verona is proud to =

announce "GlobEng: International Conference on Global English".
The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of =

research discussing issues related to the role of English as a global =

language.

The debate over the status of English as an International language has =

flourished over the past few decades and is still open to new developments.
Starting from the awareness of the undisputedly prominent role of English a=
s =

a Lingua Franca in international communication, the fact that native =

speakers are currently a minority, compared to second-language users of the =

language, has been repeatedly highlighted.
The changing status of English has led to the emergence of a new linguistic =

scenery. On the one hand, the native varieties have become highly =

differentiated and have acquired greater autonomy, while on the other, the =

rapid growth of a community of non-native speakers, thanks to increasing =

international exchanges, has triggered a reflection on the possible rise of =

a new International English, as opposed to the current native varieties.

A wide range of issues are brought to the fore in this connection, =

especially focusing on the possible evolution of the current scenario, both =

in Europe and in the rest of the world, with a reflection on (and a possibl=
e =

revision of) the notion of Standard, and the crucial implications that =

prospective developments might have on English Language Teaching (ELT).

The programme includes plenary lectures by renowned scholars in the field, =

such as David Crystal, Adrian Holliday, Jennifer Jenkins, Alan Maley, =

Barbara Seidlhofer and Simon Sweeney.

Papers are encouraged which address the following topics:

- Pronunciation models: new vs. standard
- Implications of new morphosyntactic models
- Semantic and pragmatic implications of globalising English
- Cultures, media and globalisation
- Identities and international communication
- Language policies in the European Community
- English and other languages in the classroom
- The teaching of English as a foreign/second language and as a specialised =

language
- Terminological issues and new taxonomies

Contributions are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus discussion). =

Abstracts should not exceed 300 words in length (references excluded). They =

should be anonymous and should be sent as email attachments (preferably in =

pdf format or rtf) to: globeng@lingue.univr.it

Please conform to the following specifications:
- Times New Roman pt.12 or equivalent font, single-spaced.
- Please do not include your name or any obvious form of identifiers in the =

abstract. This is because the abstracts will be subject to anonymous =

peer-review.
- In order to assist with the reviewing process, please also list up to 5 =

keywords in the email message

Submission:

- Abstracts should be submitted as an attachment in rtf, or pdf format;
- Subject line of the email should be GlobEng and abstract title;
- Email message should include: Talk Title, Author's Name(s), Title(s), =
