Full Title: Partial Parsing: Between Chunking and Deep Parsing 

Date: 01-Jun-2008 - 01-Jun-2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco 
Contact Person: Sandra Kuebler
Meeting Email: PaPa2008@bach.ipipan.waw.pl
Web Site: http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 17-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description:

Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a sentence.   However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to almost full parsing. This workshop will bring together researcher who work on partial parsing in its different interpretations. 

1st Call for Papers

LREC 2008 Workshop on
Partial Parsing: Between Chunking and Deep Parsing
Marrakech, Morocco
1 June 2008
http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/

Submission deadline: 17 February 2008

Motivation

Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to almost full parsing.  This workshop will bring together researcher who work on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Scope:

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted to):

- linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications:
- syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical   structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);

- development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine learning, hybrid;

- the usability of language resources for the development of partial parsers;

- multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;

- experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers for new languages;

- technical aspects of partial parsers:
robustness, scalability;
time and space complexity;
expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);

- applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question answering, machine translation, web text mining,
- acquisition of lexical information, etc.;

- evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards, application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different partial parsing tasks, etc.;

-.ways of combining multiple partial parsers;

- comparison (classification) of partial parsers.

Submissions:

Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, and significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages typeset in an 11pt font. Detailed guidelines will appear at the LREC 2008 web page: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/ and, once they are available, they will also appear at the web page of the workshop: http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/.

The publication of selected papers in a special issue of a journal is planned.

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: 17 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 16 March 2008
Camera-ready version due: 3 April 2008
Workshop: 1 June 2008
