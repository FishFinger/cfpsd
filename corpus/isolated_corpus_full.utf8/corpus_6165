Meeting Description: 

While many minority language communities recognize the need to maintain their languages, what are some tools available to help them gauge the relative health of their language and language communities? What kinds of policies have worked to support and maintain the vitality and viability of minority languages? What practices might be appropriate for various communities attempting to maintain their languages? This event will bring together experts from diverse backgrounds to pursue answers to such questions surrounding assessment of language vitality, policies to support viability, and practices to ensure a flourishing future for minority languages, with a special focus on the Tibetan language case.
