SEMANTIC PROCESSING OF LEGAL TEXTS

CALL FOR PAPERS=20

27 May 2008, Marrakech, Morocco
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/IMG/ws/Legal.pdf

Workshop description
The legal domain represents a primary candidate for web-based =
information distribution, exchange and management, as testified by the =
numerous e-government, e-justice and e-democracy initiatives worldwide. =
The last few years have seen a growing body of research and practice in =
the field of Artificial Intelligence and Law addressing aspects such as =
automated legal reasoning and argumentation, semantic and cross-language =
legal information retrieval, document classification, legal drafting, =
legal knowledge discovery and extraction. Many efforts have also been =
devoted to the construction of legal ontologies and their application to =
the law domain.=20
=20
A number of different Workshops and Conferences have been organised on =
these topics in the framework of the artificial intelligence and law =
community: among them, the ICAIL (International Conference on Artificial =
Intelligence and Law) and the Jurix (International Conference on Legal =
Knowledge and Information Systems) conferences, different workshops on =
Legal Ontologies (LEGONT) or on Legal Ontologies and Artificial =
Intelligence Techniques (LOAIT). The availability of lexical resources =
to enforce semantic interoperability among legal information is an =
emerging topic within the workshops held by the Legal XML Community =
(LegalXML workshops and Legal XML Summer school). In all these events, =
the topics of language resources and human language technologies are =
receiving increasing attention: natural language processing techniques =
are resorted to for bootstrapping lexical, terminological and =
ontological legal resources and for the semantic mark-up of legal texts; =
natural language processing components are used in application areas =
such as conceptual and cross-lingual retrieval, legal drafting support, =
and document classification; legal ontologies are used for legal =
knowledge representation, legal reasoning and drafting, concepts =
comparison and consistency checking.=20
=20
On the other hand, little attention has been paid to the legal domain =
within the computational linguistics community besides a few and =
isolated contributions and/or projects devoted to the processing of =
legal texts. In this situation, we believe that time is now ripe for =
offering a workshop on Language Resources (LRs) and Human Language =
Technologies (HLTs) in the legal domain, in which the two communities =
can meet, exchange information, compare perspectives and share =
experiences and concerns on the topic of legal knowledge extraction and =
management, with particular emphasis on the semantic processing of legal =
texts. Such an event could be beneficial to both communities, with the =
legal artificial intelligence community gaining insight on =
state-of-the-art linguistic technologies, tools and resources, and the =
computational linguists taking advantage of the large and often =
multilingual legal resources - corpora as well as lexicons and =
ontologies - for training and evaluation of current NLP technologies and =
tools.=20
=20
The workshop will be focussed on the topic of automatically extracting =
relevant information out of legal texts and of providing a structured =
organisation of extracted knowledge, and in particular on the crucial =
role played by language resources and human language technologies. The =
main goal of the workshop is to provide an overview of the =
state-of-the-art in the application area of legal knowledge extraction =
and management, explore new research and development directions and =
emerging trends, exchange information regarding legal LRs and HLTs and =
their applications.
=20
Areas of Interest
Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:
- Building legal resources: terminologies, ontologies, corpora
- Ontology learning from legal texts, including sub-areas such as =
ontology customization, ontology merging, ontology extension, ontology =
evolution, etc.
- Information Extraction from legal texts=20
- Semantic annotation of legal texts
- Legal text processing
- Multilingual aspects of legal text semantic processing
- Comparison of Legal concepts=20
- Diachronic meaning evolution of legal concepts
- Standardization of metadata for Content description
- Legal thesauri mapping
- Automatic Classification of legal documents
- NLP and legal information retrieval and extraction
Papers can cover one or more of these areas.
=20
Submissions
Submissions are solicited from researchers working on all aspects of =
semantic processing of legal texts. Authors are invited to submit full =
papers describing original completed work, work in progress, interesting =
problems, case studies or research trends related to one or more of the =
topics of interest listed above.=20
Submissions should not exceed 10 pages and should be typeset using a =
font size of 11 points. Style files will be made available by LREC for =
the camera-ready versions of accepted papers. Papers should be submitted =
electronically, no later than February 15, 2008. The only accepted =
format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Papers should be submitted to =
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlrec08_legalws. The final =
version of the accepted papers will be published in the Workshop =
Proceedings.
