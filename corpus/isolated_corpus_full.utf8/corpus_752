Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2006 

Meeting Description:

Research on grammaticalization has witnessed a period of enthusiastic activity during the 1980s and 1990s which was followed by a phase of critical discussion. Critics considered grammaticalization as an epiphenonmenon of language change, and have called its status as an independent process into question (cf. Campbell (2001) Grammaticalization. A Critical Assessment. Language Sciences 23). Recent research on grammaticalization is primarily characterized by the application of established theories and methods to new data, focussing on pragmatic phenomena and semantic change.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are currently looking at grammaticalization from different points of view and who take their research beyond the established frameworks. We therefore want to specifically invite presentations concerned with one of the following topics:

-New theoretical approaches and methods;
-Early stages of grammaticalization;
-New empirical studies focussing on the micro-processes of grammaticalization.
