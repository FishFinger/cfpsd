Meeting Description:

Empirical Semantics
10-Feb to 12-Feb 2010
T=FCbingen, Germany

Special session on the integration of empirical and theoretical approaches =
to
semantic issues.=20

Call for Papers:

The development of the empirically grounded cognitive approach is perhaps l=
east well-developed in the linguistic sub-field of semantics. While there i=
s some fairly extensive use of corpus approaches and a growing body of work=
 on semantic processing and pragmatics, in the area of theoretical semantic=
s the empirical trend in linguistics is as yet in its infancy: work in sema=
ntics tends to be characterized as either data-oriented or else theory-orie=
nted; the
productive and reciprocal mix of both, such as has fairly recently develope=
d in the field experimental syntax, is as yet infrequent.  =20
=20
We therefore particularly call for papers addressing this important gap.
