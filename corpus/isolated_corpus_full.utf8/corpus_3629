Call for Papers

The Community for Curiosity, Creativity and Collaboration invites individuals
and teams to submit proposals for its upcoming conference "Teaching Creativity:
What the academy can learn from entrepreneurs, inventors and artists." The
conference will be held February 24 - 26, 2009 on the University of Wyoming campus.

Founded on the assumption that the academy is meant to generate ideas and
projects that seek to improve the quality of life for society at large, this
conference aims to showcase how higher education can provide students with
direct access to the creative side of problem-solving. By moving our students
from critique to creativity, we can prepare them for a future where there are no
guarantees--a future that only they can bring into being. 

Through the "Teaching Creativity" conference, we hope to begin creating a
blueprint for 
1) transforming the academy into an arena for cultivating the creative and
imaginative powers that reside at the heart of the individual, and 
2) bringing those powers to bear on collaborative projects that engage the most
pressing problems of our time. 

As we conceive it, the pedagogy that will meet this challenge must embrace the
civic-mindedness that lies at the heart of service-learning, the high
intellectual and performance standards that define the academic community, and
the open-ended creative energy that fuels the work of the entrepreneur, the
inventor, and the artist. 

Among the questions the conference intends to explore are
- How can we foster curiosity in an age of No Child Left Behind? 
- What can be learned about teaching creativity from some of today's most
creative minds?
- How do we teach the collaborative process in an increasingly globalized economy?
- How can we better prepare future leaders to face the challenges of
contemporary society?
- What is the role of assessment within a pedagogy that prizes innovation and
encourages risk-taking?
- How do we accurately measure faculty accomplishments at the point of critical
evaluation - hiring, tenure, promotion - in the messy, fertile space of
interdisciplinarity?
- What responsibility does the academy have for training students to think of
themselves as change-agents committed to creating a better future? 
These questions are merely meant to suggest the kinds of questions that the
conference will engage. We welcome any proposal that engages with the project of
reimagining the work of the 21st century academy, both in theory and in practice.

Please submit the following materials in MS Word format to Mary P.
Sheridan-Rabideau (msherid1@uwyo.edu) by Monday, October 27, 2008. Note: Only 1
submission per person.

- A cover page that includes the title, speaker(s), address(es), email(s), and
phone number(s), along with a brief 25-50 word description of your presentation 
- A one-page abstract prepared for blind review that describes the proposed talk
and identifies the format for the presentation, for example, 
  1. 20-minute talk (think TED.com), which may be combined with similar
proposals to form a 60-minute panel
  2. 60-minute plenary talk, with up to 4 speakers. We are particularly
interested in interdisciplinary panels
  3. performance or workshop that illustrates the creative process
  4. experiential workshop that engage attendees in the creative process

Call Deadline: 19-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

2nd International Workshop on the Semantic Representation of Spoken Language

The aim of the SRSL-2009 is to bring together researchers interested in the
semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous speech. On one
hand, the semantic gap between contents conveyed by natural languages and their
formal representations is a burning aspect in tasks such as information
extraction and corpus annotation. The current state-of-the-art supports
solutions from very different backgrounds and perspectives, but still remain
important and complex issues to deal with, such as the accurate segmentation of
speech in semantic units. The discussion of those aspects are one of the main
reasons for this workshop. On the other hand, spoken language is a pending issue
in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence, both traditionally
focused on written language, although semantic processing of speech is necessary
for the understanding of both natural and human-machine interaction. Finally,
the problems found when trying to linguistically structure spontaneous speech
are leading to works focused on its semantic representation. In-depth research
on the semantic representation of speech can provide us with a suitable basis
for further analysis of related linguistic levels, like prosody or pragmatics. 

Call for Papers

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research concerning
the semantic representation of spoken language. Possible topics include:
- Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, etc.) and
concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
- Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
- Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
- Dialogue and discourse structures.
- Topic Detection and tracking.
- Multimodal Representations including speech.
- Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.
- Speech in embedded systems.
- Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic
representations.
- Standardization work.
- Interoperability/Comparison work of spoken and written corpora.

Submissions must be written in English and should follow the EACL2009 style
format. They can be full (6-8 pages including references) or short papers (3-4
pages including references). As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not
include author's names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity should be avoided. Submissions that do not conform
to these styles will be rejected.

The only accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Please remember that the
paper submission deadline is December 19th, 2008. Papers that are being
submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on
the title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with previously
published work. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the SRSL-2009.

Both full and short papers (3-4 pages) will have an oral presentation at the
workshop within the framework of the EACL2009 conference in Athens (Greece). For
this reason, at least one author has to register for the workshop.
