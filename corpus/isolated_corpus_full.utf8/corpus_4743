Call for Papers

Key Dates
Call for submissions: January 4 2009
Deadline for submissions: April 17 2009
Notification of acceptance: May 29 2009
Preliminary program: September 15 2009
Conference: November 16-20 2009

Themes
Over the last few years, in the southern part of Belgium, various competences
were developed that linked with Langue des Signes Française de Belgique (LSFB),
namely the sign language of the Deaf community of South Belgium. Scientific
works were published and practical experience matured in different fields:
linguistics, bilingual education and interpreting. 

The aim of the conference is to share this knowledge and experience with
international researchers and professionals and provide them with the
contribution of disciplines that, until now, have not been devoted to the study
of LSFB: issues on bilingualism between oral and signed languages or between
signed languages; and anthropologic and philosophical approaches to the
relations between Deaf and Hearing communities.

The conference will be 5 days long, each day devoted to one central theme. The
following prestigious Deaf and Hearing speakers have been invited to present
their ideas:
- Actual researches on Sign Linguistics
Invited Speakers: Christian Cuxac, Elisabeth Engberg-Pedersen, Josep Quer,
Markus Steinbach and Myriam Vermeerbergen.
- Bilingualism (oral/signed languages or between signed languages)
Invited Speakers: Kristina Svartholm and Bencie Woll.
- Teaching by/for the Deaf 
Invited Speakers: Chantal Gerday and Marie-Thérèse L'Huillier.
- Interpreting 
Invited Speakers: Alain Bacci, Brigitte François, Pierre Guitteny and Thierry
Haesenne.
- Anthropology and philosophy
Invited Speakers: Andrea Benvenuto, Jean-Luc Brackelaire and Sophie Dalle-Nazébi.

The contribution and participation of Deaf and Hearing are expected. Therefore,
the whole of the conference will be multilingual - LSFB, International Signs
(IS), French and English.

Submissions
Submissions should include:
1. An anonymous abstract in one of the four languages of the conference (LSFB,
IS, French or English). It should not exceed:
- for a written submission:  2 A4 pages in Times 12 (including references);
- for a signed submission: a 10 min. video (references are to be provided in a
written document). To guarantee her/his anonymity, the author may ask another
person to sign her/his abstract. The central theme of the submission
(linguistics, bilingualism, teaching, interpreting or anthropology/philosophy)
should be given in the abstract. The topic and conclusions should also be stated
clearly.

2. The author(s)' name(s), affiliation, postal address, e-mail address and the
title of the presentation should be sent on a separate document.

All submissions will be submitted electronically:
- for a written submission: in .rtf, .doc or .pdf version (the abstract and
author information should be sent in separate files) to cils.namur@gmail.com;
- for a signed submission: in .wmv or .mpeg version for the video file, and in
.rtf, .doc or .pdf version for the references and personal information files to
cils.namur@gmail.com (within a single message). If the author is unable to
submit the video electronically, she/he may send 2 CDs, each including both the
video file and the written files, to this address:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
