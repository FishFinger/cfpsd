EACL 2009 Workshop on Linguistics and Comp Linguistics 

Date: 30-Mar-2009 - 30-Mar-2009 
Location: Athens, Greece 
Contact: Timothy Baldwin 
Meeting URL: http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/eacl2009/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Meeting Description: 

This unique event will bring together a formidable group of invited speakers and
panelists to explore the interaction between linguistics and computational
linguistics. Join us to reflect on the past, present and future of the
linguistics--computational linguistics interface, and explore the nature of the
relationship between the two fields: virtuous, vicious or vacuous. 

Call for Participation
				       
EACL 2009 Workshop on the Interaction between Linguistics and Computational
Linguistics: Virtuous, Vicious or Vacuous?

March 30, 2009
Athens, Greece

http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/eacl2009/

Invited Speakers:

Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)
Frank Keller (University of Edinburgh, UK)
Mark Liberman (University of Pennsylvania, USA)
Stelios Piperidis (Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Greece)
Geoffrey Pullum (University of Edinburgh, UK)

Panelists:

Emily Bender (University of Washington, USA)
Gregor Erbach (European Union)
Bob Moore (Microsoft Research, USA)
Gertjan van Noord (University of Groningen, Netherlands)
Hans Uszkoreit (Saarland University, Germany)

Overview:
This workshop is an attempt to bring together linguists and computational
linguists across the broad spectrum of the two fields who operate across or
near the computational ''divide'', to reflect on the relationship between the
two fields, including the following questions:

* What contributions has computational linguistics made to linguistics, and vice
versa?

 * What are examples of success/failure of marrying linguistics and 
computational linguistics, and what can we learn from them?

 * How can we better facilitate the virtuous cycle between computational
linguistics and linguistics?

 * Is modern-day computational linguistics relevant to current-day linguistics,
and vice versa? If not, should it be made more relevant, and if so, how?

* What do computational and core linguistics stand to gain from greater
cross-awareness between the two fields?

* What untapped areas/aspects of linguistics are ripe for cross-fertilisation
with computational linguistics, and vice versa?

On the basis of exploring answers to these and other questions, the workshop
aims to explore possible trajectories for linguistics and computational
linguistics, in terms of both concrete low-level tasks and high-level
aspirations/synergies.

Background:

In its infancy, computational linguistics drew heavily on theoretical
linguistics. There have been numerous examples of co-development successes
between computational and theoretical linguistics over the years (e.g. syntactic
theories, discourse processing and language resource development), and
significant crossover with other areas of linguistics such as psycholinguistics
and corpus linguistics.

Throughout the history of the field, however, there has always been a subset
of computational linguistics which has openly distanced itself from theoretical
linguistics, perhaps most famously in the field of machine translation (MT)
where there is relatively little in the majority of ''successful'' MT systems
that a core linguist would identify with. In the current climate of hard-core
empiricism within computational linguistics it is appropriate to reflect on
where we have come from and where we are headed relative to the various other
fields of linguistics. As part of this reflection, it is timely to look beyond
theoretical linguistics to the various
other fields of linguistics which have traditionally received less exposure in
computational linguistics, including sociolinguistics, historical linguistics,
neurolinguistics and evolutionary linguistics.  


Target Audience:

The workshop is intended to be of interest to both the large numbers of people
interested in deep linguistic processing (e.g. grammar developers,
computational syntacticians, computational semanticists, researchers working
on parsing and generation, and researchers applying deep linguistic processing
in various application areas), but also those who have perhaps explicitly
distanced themselves from linguistics, or who come from a linguistic
background but have moved away from it in their computational linguist
research. We also strongly encourage (pure) linguists to come along.
