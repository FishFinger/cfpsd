ACL 2007 was the biggest ACL conference yet by a long way, with a final
total of 1095 participants registered for one or more of the main
conference, co-located conferences, workshops and tutorials that took
place over the 8 days. Participants came from 48 countries, making the
conference a truly international event. The range of Computational
Linguistics research presented was wide in scope -- in terms of
theories, processing techniques, and application areas -- and the
standard of work presented was very high.

Running such a large event required an enormous amount of work behind
the scenes, which was coordinated by an exceptional local organisation
team, led by Eva Hajicova. Local chairs were delegated tasks within
well-defined areas of responsibility, and together made everything run
so smoothly that to the attendees it appeared almost effortless. So on
behalf of all who attended I'd like to thank Eva and her colleagues.

It seemed to me that the conference had an almost palpable buzz of
excitement, helped I think by the compact venue of the TOP Hotel Praha
with the several large and small rooms needed for concurrent sessions
being in close proximity, the cafes and seating areas dotted around, and
the fact that many of the workshops incorporated poster sessions of
their own. Indeed this was the main new feature in the conference setup,
publicising to a wider audience much excellent work that otherwise would
still be confined to its research lab.

So many thanks to all who were involved in organising the conference
(mentioned by name in the front matter of the Proceedings) and to
everyone who came to ACL 2007 in Prague for making it a success. See you
next year at ACL 2008 in Columbus, USA.

Now, when "the show" is over, the locals can breathe more relaxed though
not fully disengaged because the flow of invoices is endless... In this
final and last Newsletter the most serious and most relevant factual
information on the ACL 2007 meeting is presented by the main
personalities engaged in the formation of its shape and content.
However, we thought that a glimpse or two behind the curtain might be of
interest for those who  participated at this huge event  (and of some
use, as a kind of warning, for the organizers of the future ACL
conferences) and therefore let's give here a couple of those. First, and
most importantly, be aware that nothing is definite: the estimates of
the number of participants ranging from pessimistic to optimistic may
not prove realistic on either side. Neither are the announcements of
"definite" schedules - let them refer to times, rooms, list of papers to
be delivered, names of chairs ... At some moments, especially when the
beginning of the conference was approaching, we had the impression that
the most important things about the conference were the meals -
fortunately, our restaurants already know that vegetarians may receive a
larger variety of more tasteful meals, but neither Anna nor me could
reliably answer such special questions whether at this particular
restaurant they add milk to their potato soup or garlic to goulash.
Also, we were eager to meet such last minute requirements as "our
workshop would like to have a room reserved for dinner", or "we would
need to have refreshments during our sessions" (actually, these were the
easiest to arrange for), up to "there is 15 of us and would like to =20
have a
dinner downtown, please, reserve a room and transport". Also
accommodation was sometimes a tough nut to crack, especially with the
ever rising number of participants; but some of the questions we
received were rather amusing like the one concerning the size of the bed
in a single room in the students dormitory (meaning: is the bed big
enough to sleep two?). On a more serious note: as the usage apparently
differs from country to country (or, maybe, even from hotel to hotel) it
would be recommendable to replace the specification of the dates of the
stay "from - to" by "arrival - departure", to avoid misunderstandings
(it came out that to ask for the number of nights does not help to solve
the problem). Every country has its own visa policy; and we appreciate
that our country is relatively liberal, not requiring visa even from
nationals from countries which require visa from us.  However, there are
some countries for the inhabitants of which an official letter of
invitation from the local organizers is needed, confirming that the
given person is attending a conference. This meant for us to send out
about 230 personalized letters of invitation for those who had to apply
for visa. In some cases, to make the procedure quicker, Anna contacted
our consulate in the country of the participant's residence by a phone
call (or several phone calls). It came then as a surprise to hear that
in one case, the person concerned came to our Embassy without any
identification card and without any money, asking our consul for a loan
to pay the visa fee. Not to speak about application forms with dates of
birth in the second half of this century, with no home address etc. etc.

As you see, in the end the organization of the ACL 2007 conference has
been a great experience and also fun, and we are happy to have received
several nice messages from the participants in which they shared with us
their positive remembrances. However, we have to disclose that there was
also a negative one: "I had a thoroughly great time, even if I did eat
(and drank!) too much." If all the negative remarks were of such a kind,
we would not complain.

Once again: Thanks to all who have made this experience real: the ACL
executive committee who endorsed us with such a challenging task; the
general chair for his enormous understanding of our everyday worries and
for the careful attention he paid to what we wrote in newsletters, on
our web and in our reports; the program chairs for their understanding
of the deadlines imposed on us by the printers; the tutorial and
workshop chairs to react promptly to our messages; to the publication
chair who made it possible for us not to bother at all with the
Proceedings printing and delivery, and all others who have helped us to
do our job smoothly.

Last but not least, we would like to express our thanks to all
participants, who came in such a large number, who have contributed to
great working spirits and to a friendly and enjoyable atmosphere and who
accepted all the calamities and inconveniences with great understanding,
good humor and smile.

On behalf of the local team

The ACL 2007 Best Paper Award went to Yuk Wah Wong and Raymond J. Mooney
for their paper "Learning Synchronous Grammars for Semantic Parsing with
Lambda Calculus". The paper was the clear choice of the general, program
and area chairs, and is in the areas of parsing, machine learning and
semantics. The paper describes the use of techniques pioneered in
Statistical MT to take a parallel corpus of sentences and their logical
forms and induce a grammar and semantic component that achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy.

This year, EMNLP-CoNLL considered a remarkable 398 submissions,(*)
accepting 109 of them (for an acceptance rate of 27%). It is startling
to realize that even the ACL conferences were not this large until two
years ago.

Only 66 of the accepted papers were scheduled for presentation as
talks, and 43 more as posters. We took pains to ensure that the poster
sessions would be leisurely and interactive.

In addition, two sessions of the conference and 22 specially
designated short papers were devoted to the CoNLL Shared
Task competition, an annual tradition. The 2007 competition concerned
dependency parsing, with both a multilingual track and a domain
adaptation track.

(*) Of the original 419 submissions, 17 were withdrawn (usually
upon acceptance elsewhere), and 4 more were rejected without review
(for violating the conference's standards on length, anonymization,
or plagiarism).

1095 participants registered for one or more of the main<BR>conference,=20
co=97located conferences, workshops and tutorials that took<BR>place =
over the 8=20
days. Participants came from 48 countries, making the<BR>conference a =
truly=20
international event. The range of Computational<BR>Linguistics research=20
presented was wide in scope =97=97 in terms of<BR>theories, processing =
techniques,=20
and application areas =97=97 and the<BR>standard of work presented was =
very=20
high.<BR><BR>Running such a large event required an enormous amount of =
work=20
behind<BR>the scenes, which was coordinated by an exceptional local=20

on<BR>behalf of all who attended I'd like to thank Eva and her=20

and<BR>the fact that many of the workshops incorporated poster sessions=20

<BR><BR>Now,=20
when "the show" is over, the locals can breathe more relaxed =
though<BR>not fully=20
disengaged because the flow of invoices is endless... In this<BR>final =
and last=20
Newsletter the most serious and most relevant factual<BR>information on =
the ACL=20
2007 meeting is presented by the main<BR>personalities engaged in the =
formation=20
of its shape and content.<BR>However, we thought that a glimpse or two =
behind=20
the curtain might be of<BR>interest for those who&nbsp; participated at =
this=20
huge event&nbsp; (and of some<BR>use, as a kind of warning, for the =
organizers=20
of the future ACL<BR>conferences) and therefore let's give here a couple =
of=20
those. First, and<BR>most importantly, be aware that nothing is =
definite: the=20
estimates of<BR>the number of participants ranging from pessimistic to=20
optimistic may<BR>not prove realistic on either side. Neither are the=20
announcements of<BR>"definite" schedules - let them refer to times, =
rooms, list=20
of papers to<BR>be delivered, names of chairs ... At some moments, =
especially=20
when the<BR>beginning of the conference was approaching, we had the =
impression=20
that<BR>the most important things about the conference were the meals=20
-<BR>fortunately, our restaurants already know that vegetarians may =
receive=20
a<BR>larger variety of more tasteful meals, but neither Anna nor me=20
could<BR>reliably answer such special questions whether at this=20
particular<BR>restaurant they add milk to their potato soup or garlic to =

goulash.<BR>Also, we were eager to meet such last minute requirements as =

"our<BR>workshop would like to have a room reserved for dinner", or "we=20
would<BR>need to have refreshments during our sessions" (actually, these =
were=20
the<BR>easiest to arrange for), up to "there is 15 of us and would like =
to&nbsp;=20
<BR>have a<BR>dinner downtown, please, reserve a room and transport".=20
Also<BR>accommodation was sometimes a tough nut to crack, especially =
with=20
the<BR>ever rising number of participants; but some of the questions=20
we<BR>received were rather amusing like the one concerning the size of =
the=20
bed<BR>in a single room in the students dormitory (meaning: is the bed=20
big<BR>enough to sleep two?). On a more serious note: as the usage=20
apparently<BR>differs from country to country (or, maybe, even from =
hotel to=20
hotel) it<BR>would be recommendable to replace the specification of the =
dates of=20
the<BR>stay "from - to" by "arrival - departure", to avoid=20
misunderstandings<BR>(it came out that to ask for the number of nights =
does not=20
help to solve<BR>the problem). Every country has its own visa policy; =
and we=20
appreciate<BR>that our country is relatively liberal, not requiring visa =
even=20
from<BR>nationals from countries which require visa from us.&nbsp; =
However,=20
there are<BR>some countries for the inhabitants of which an official =
letter=20
of<BR>invitation from the local organizers is needed, confirming that=20
the<BR>given person is attending a conference. This meant for us to send =

out<BR>about 230 personalized letters of invitation for those who had to =

apply<BR>for visa. In some cases, to make the procedure quicker, Anna=20
contacted<BR>our consulate in the country of the participant's residence =
by a=20
phone<BR>call (or several phone calls). It came then as a surprise to =
hear=20
that<BR>in one case, the person concerned came to our Embassy without=20
any<BR>identification card and without any money, asking our consul for =
a=20
loan<BR>to pay the visa fee. Not to speak about application forms with =
dates=20
of<BR>birth in the second half of this century, with no home address =
etc.=20
etc.<BR><BR>As you see, in the end the organization of the ACL 2007 =
conference=20
has<BR>been a great experience and also fun, and we are happy to have=20
received<BR>several nice messages from the participants in which they =
shared=20
with us<BR>their positive remembrances. However, we have to disclose =
that there=20
was<BR>also a negative one: "I had a thoroughly great time, even if I =
did=20
eat<BR>(and drank!) too much." If all the negative remarks were of such =
a=20
kind,<BR>we would not complain.<BR><BR>Once again: Thanks to all who =
have made=20
this experience real: the ACL<BR>executive committee who endorsed us =
with such a=20
challenging task; the<BR>general chair for his enormous understanding of =
our=20
