Creating Infrastructure for Canonical Typology

Location: Guildford, United Kingdom 
Contact: Anna Kibort

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics; Language
Documentation; Typology 

Meeting Description: 

The Surrey Morphology Group proposes to bring together linguists from different
perspectives to outline the issues relevant for the creation of an ontology for
Canonical Typology in the form of a Community of Practice Extension (COPE)
within the GOLD ontology for linguistics (Farrar and Langendoen 2003; see also:
www.linguistics-ontology.org/gold.html). Contributions may address the following
issues: the canonical criteria for defining different morphosyntactic features
(case, gender, number, etc.); defining canonical criteria for syntax-morphology
interaction (agreement, government, head, modifier, etc.); practical issues for
the fieldworker; issues of computational implementation and reasoning. We invite
papers on these and related topics from computational linguists, fieldworkers,
typologists, as well as researchers working on ontologies.

Confirmed Speakers:
- Nicholas Evans (Australian National University)
- Scott Farrar (University of Washington)
- Frank Seifart (Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum) 

Call for Participation

Creating Infrastructure For Canonical Typology
January 9 - 10, 2009

Conference hosted by the Surrey Morphology Group 
and Institute of Advanced Studies, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK

There is a growing movement within linguistics to promote the use of ontologies
for linguistic description. However, differences in terminology and the
underlying logic are major stumbling blocks. One way of addressing these
problems is to adopt the canonical approach to typology by taking defining
properties and placing them in a multidimensional space. In this way we can
treat, for example, issues of whether particular constructions fit under the
rubric 'agreement' or 'case' as a matter of greater or lesser proximity to a
canonical ideal. A two-day international seminar is being held at Surrey in
January 2009, addressing the issues relevant for the creation of an ontology for
Canonical Typology in the form of a Community of Practice Extension (COPE)
within the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD). It brings
together computational linguists, fieldworkers and typologists, as well as
researchers working specifically on ontologies.

Registration for the conference is now open online at:
http://www.ias.surrey.ac.uk/workshops/typology/index.php
Everyone who wishes to attend the meeting must register, using the online form,
no later than 10 December 2008.

A small number of bursaries is available to subsidise travel within the UK for
postgraduate student participants.  Anyone wishing to be considered for a
student bursary should send a one-page letter of application to Mrs Mirela Dumic
<m.dumic@surrey.ac.uk> by the end of 7 December 2008.
