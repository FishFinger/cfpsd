 Session Description

 The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is
 spreading across the world. For many years, the English Language was
 dominating all aspects of ICT systems that span from their
 development to their use. However, in the last few years many nations
 have felt the need to use their own language to spread the use of ICT
 among their populations and communities and also in some situations
 to protect their language and culture. This is certainly true for the
 Arab world where there are many initiatives to advance research,
 development and arabisation of ICT systems. This sessions aims at
 bringing together researchers and developers interested in topics
 that include but not limited to:

 * Developing culturally and linguistically aware Information Systems
   for tha Arab world.
 * Choice of information systems development methodologies for the
   Arab world.
 * Standardising Arabic Information Processing Vocabulary
 * Building of Arabic Ontologies, taxonomies and dictionaries.
 * Arabic Information extraction systems
 * Arabic Web-development
 * Machine translation systems for the Arabic Language
 * Arabic natural language processing

 Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and
 contribution. It is IBIMA policy to send complete papers to two
 reviewers for full blind peer review and to send a summary of review
 back to the author(s). Short papers/abstracts will be reviewed by
 reviewer and/or the editor. All review comments and suggestions
 should be addressed in the final submission. Submitted Papers must
 not have been previously published or currently submitted for
 publication elsewhere.
