Hi Guys,

Just a quick email to fill you in on the latest PGRC meeting.  Most  
of what was discussed came down to how to best make sure us  
postgraduate students are properly looked after.  This can be split  
into two points, out-of-time (OOT) candidature management and  
confidentiality matters arising from the annual report.  I will try  
and tackle these two as succinctly as possible.

Before we move onto the individual points it must be said that most  
of the meeting consisted of discussion on how to best assist  
postgraduate students who run into problems, how to solve these  
problems and how to limit their impact.  Throughout our studies, most  
of us are going to run into some problems, it's inevitable.  We all  
agreed (postgrad reps and staff) that a lot of the time having a  
quick chat to someone about the problem goes along way to solving  
it.  I know I do this as well, but we forget that we have plenty of  
people to talk to at various levels of the University and the sooner  
we try to fix it, the better the outcome.   Below is a suggestion of  
some of the people you may want to share your problems with.

* Your supervisor, they should be one of the first ports of call.
* There are the student PGRC reps: James, Anders and Anne.  Anders in  
particular has had experience as a student counsellor in his native  
Denmark and is more than happy to help.  If we don't know the answer  
straight away, we will go and find it out for you, keeping you  
anonymous.
* The person who sits next to you or any other of your fellow postgrads
* Agnieszka
* The Postgraduate Research Directors in your department.  A/Prof  
Karu Esselle for the Division, Prof Xuan Duong for Mathematics, Dr  
Annabelle McIver for Computing, Dr Charles Lee for Electronics and A/ 
Prof Judith Dawes from Physics.  All these people are very friendly  
and helpful and are on our side.
* The Head of your department
* The Dean of the Division
* The Dean of Students.  It is in fact the Dean's job to resolve  
student issues,  so behind the title is a guy who is definitely there  
to help students with their problems. http:// 
www.deanofstudents.mq.edu.au/
* The University Counseling service


OOT management
All divisions have been requested to develop a policy for the  
management of OOT.  OOT is over 4 years for PhD full-time and 2 years  
for Masters full-time.  A draft policy has been drawn up to help OOT  
candidates complete their studies as soon as possible.  As it stands,  
students who are not able to finish on time will be required to  
prepare a (short) OOT Candidature Extension Request (OOT-CER) along  
with their supervisors.  This report should be submitted at least 3  
months before the normal (on-time) thesis submission date do their  
Departmental Director.

The idea behind this policy is to help us postgraduate students  
complete our studies quickly and in the most painless manner  
possible.  To help us do this, we (the student, the supervisor, the  
department and the division) need to find where the problems lie and  
how best to overcome them.  These problems could be as simple as we  
just need an extra month or maybe we need access to some extra test  
equipment.  This short OOT-CER is supposed to be short.  All the  
members of the PGRC (staff and postgrad reps) agree that increasing  
the load on an OOT candidate by making them prepare a lengthy  
document is not an option - the priority is to look at how to get the  
thesis completed.


Confidentiality of the annual report
There has been some discussion recently about the confidentiality of  
the annual report and so this point was raised by Anders.  It seems  
that they only reason that you would want your report to be  
confidential is if you have a problem with your supervisor.   
Remember, anything that you put on this report will go on your file  
in HDRU so you will be accountable for what you write.  After some  
discussion it seems that next year we should be able to have our  
section handed directly into the division/HDRU without it going  
through the supervisors.  In doing this though, we have to think  
about who we don't/do want to see the report.  At some stage, we will  
have to confront the issue with our supervisors, they are going to  
have to find out eventually.

While this issue is being discussed, you may want to consider this  
flow for dealing with your supervisor associated problem.
* Firstly, it must be said that if at any time you have a problem  
with your supervisor/s you really should try and sort it out with  
them first.
* At any time, if you feel that the problem is unresolvable you can  
go to any of the people mentioned above for some advice or support in  
resolving the problem.  You do not need to wait for a formal review.
*  At the departmental review, you are given a means to give time for  
a confidential chat about your supervisor/s.  If you have a problem,  
and you don't believe you can talk here, you have to think about who  
you are trying to keep the problem a secret from.  Remember, the  
Academics have all been in our shoes before and are there as  
professionals.  You can trust them.
* There is also the HDRU report.  Keeping this confidential keeps  
both the department and the Division out of the loop.  Remember at  
one stage, all these people are going to have to know and keeping  
HDRU out of things generally results in a better outcome for  
everyone.  In keeping these reports confidential, you have to think  
exactly why you want this to occur.  This report is really for  
academic related issues.  For grievance issues, there are processes  
available to deal with these problems. Please see one of the above  
mentioned people to point you in the right direction.  For some more  
information have a look at http://www.eeo.mq.edu.au/studgriev.htm .

Anyway, It turned out to be a little longer than expected.  We hope  
this helps some of us out along the way.

Cheers
James, Anders and Anne.
