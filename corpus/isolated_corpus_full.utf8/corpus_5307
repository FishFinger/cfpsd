**************************************************************

Dear Colleague,

IC3K welcomes the submission of position papers.
A position paper presents an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and worth listening to, without the need to present completed research work and/or validated results. It is, nevertheless, important to support your argument with evidence to ensure the validity of your claims. A position paper may be a short report and discussion of ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research (bibliographic, experimental, theoretical, or other) focused on one of the conference topic areas. The acceptance of a position paper is restricted to the categories of "short paper" or "poster", i.e. a position paper is not a candidate to acceptance as "full paper". 
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support.

IC3K brings together top researchers and practitioners in knowledge technologies, especially those related to Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.
The three main topic areas have been defined as concurrent and co-located sub-conferences of IC3K, namely:
- Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval (http://www.kdir.ic3k.org/)
- Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development (http://www.keod.ic3k.org/)
- Knowledge Management and Information Sharing (http://www.kmis.ic3k.org/)


Don't hesitate contacting me should you have any questions.

Best regards,
Vera Coelho
IC3K Secretariat
