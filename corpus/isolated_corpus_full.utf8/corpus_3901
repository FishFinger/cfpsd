Full Title: Assessment in Language Learning and Teaching 

Date: 22-Jan-2009 - 23-Jan-2009
Location: Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia 
Contact Person: Tri Sunarti
Meeting Email: fbsltc@gmail.com
Web Site: http://www.uksw.edu/ltc/events 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition; Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 19-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Faculty of Language & Literature in cooperation with the Language Training
Center, Satya Wacana Christian University, invite language teachers and
researchers in this field to explore some of the challenges that are faced by
teachers and students. Even if teachers unconsciously depend on a particular
assessment tool as a measurement of successful learning, there are other
effective tools that can be maximized for different purposes. This seminar is
intended to mirror the role and development of program assessment, in addition
to giving further inspirations to teachers in choosing appropriate assessment
tools. 

Call for Papers

In language learning and teaching programs, assessment typically receives the
least attention. Many language teachers view assessment solely as a measure of
student learning, while in fact assessment can be used for various purposes,
ranging from administrative to instructional purposes. Through well-designed
assessments, promotions, certifications, and exemptions can be properly planned.
Assessments may also be used as a means of measuring program performance as well
as evaluating curriculum implementation or teaching activities.

Procedure for Submission of Paper/Workshop Proposals:

A 250-300 word abstract with a title not exceeding twelve words and a fifty-word
bio-data should be sent to the Seminar Secretariat no later than December 19, 2008.
Abstracts outside the word limit will not be accepted. Accepted presenters will
be notified by December 26, 2008.

A soft and hard copy of the full paper selected for the seminar must be sent to
the Seminar Secretariat no later than January 15, 2009, to be included in the
Conference Proceeding CDs. Should this fail, the Committee reserves the right to
withdraw the paper from the presentation.

Criteria for Acceptance:
All abstracts will be evaluated by the Seminar Planning Committee. Relevance to
the theme of the Seminar and freshness and originality of approach are among the
major considerations in the acceptance of papers. The Committee reserves the
right to decline paper/workshop proposals without assigning reasons. Proposals
are encouraged within the sub-themes, but are not limited to the topic areas.

Sub Topics:
Faculty in Language Program Assessment
Students in Language Program Assessment
Technology in Language Program Assessment
Appropriate Ways to Assess the Mastery of Language Skills
How to Align Learning Objectives and Learning Outcomes
Evaluation Models for Data from Testing
Other related subtopics

Types of Presentation:
1. Parallel Papers
These are formal lecture presentations which last thirty minutes and ten minutes
for questions.
2. Workshops
A workshop lasts two hours in which the speaker does not do much lecturing.
Instead, the speaker designs activities which can engage the participants
throughout the session.
3. Poster/Film Presentations
This session is intended to display assessment in language learning as well as
teaching and learning activities in the form of posters, pictures, photos, or
films. Participants will have opportunities to see the displays and talk to the
presenters during snack and lunch times.
