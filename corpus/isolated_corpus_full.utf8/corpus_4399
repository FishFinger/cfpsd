Full Title: Speech Communication 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science;Language Acquisition;Phonetics;Phonology;Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2009 

Call for Papers: Special Issue of Speech Communication

Non-native Speech Perception in Adverse Conditions: Imperfect Knowledge,
Imperfect Signal.

   Much work in phonetics and speech perception has focused on
doubly-optimal conditions, in which the signal reaching listeners is
unaffected by distorting influences and in which listeners possess native
competence in the sound system. However, in practice, these idealised
conditions are rarely met. The processes of speech production and
perception thus have to account for imperfections in the state of knowledge
of the interlocutor as well as imperfections in the signal received. In
noisy settings, these factors combine to create particularly adverse
conditions for non-native listeners. 

   The purpose of the Special Issue is to assemble the latest research on
perception in adverse conditions with special reference to non-native
communication.  The special issue will bring together, interpret and extend
the results emerging from current research carried out by engineers,
psychologists and phoneticians, such as the general frailty of some sounds
for both native and non-native listeners and the strong non-native
disadvantage experienced for categories which are apparently equivalent in
the listeners' native and target languages. 

    Papers describing novel research on non-native speech perception in
adverse conditions are welcomed, from any perspective including the
following. We especially welcome interdisciplinary contributions. 

-	models and theories of L2 processing in noise
-	informational and energetic masking
-	role of attention and processing load
-	effect of noise type and reverberation
-	inter-language phonetic distance
-	audiovisual interactions in L2
-	perception-production links 
-	the role of fine phonetic detail
