Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Advisory Board, we would like to inform you of the:

TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE, CULTURE AND CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONS
HEC Montreal(Business School affiliated to the Universite Montreal)
Montreal, Canada
26-29 July 2010
http://www.ManagementConference.com

The primary interest of the Management Conference is knowledge-based social and economic change. Driven by globalisation and advances in information and communications technologies, this change has been characterised in terms of emerging information/knowledge societies and a global knowledge-based economy.

The tenth anniversary of the Management Conference will be marked in Montreal, a city that is today an important centre of commerce, finance, industry, technology, culture, world affairs and was once the headquarters for the Montreal Stock Exchange. Montreal's economy is the second largest of all cities in Canada based on GDP and the largest in Quebec (for over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada).  In addition, Montreal is Canada's railway hub, is the center of film and television production in Canada, is ranked as the fourth largest center in North Amerca in terms of aerospace jobs, and the Port of Montreal is the largest inland port in the world handling 26 million ton of cargo annually.

As well as impressive line-up of plenary speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal. 

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 12 November 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.ManagementConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Montreal in July 2010.

Yours Sincerely,

Sebastien Arcand      
Professeur adjoint      
Service de l'enseignement du management      
HEC Montreal, Canada      
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations and The International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management
