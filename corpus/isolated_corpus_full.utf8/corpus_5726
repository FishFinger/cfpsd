ADCS 2009 Call for Papers
-------------------------

This is the first call for papers for the Fourteenth Australasian
Document Computing Symposium.  ADCS 2009 will be hosted by UNSW in
Sydney, on Friday 4 December 2009, as part of the HCSnet summerfest.

ADCS 2009 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
document management and information retrieval to meet and present
their work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document
Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document
architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management,
retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual
documents. The symposium will emphasize both commercial and academic
issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.

Website

http://es.csiro.au/adcs2009/

Topics of interest

The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:

* Cognitive Aspects of Documents
* Digital Libraries
* Document Databases
* Document Management
* Document Standards (XML, SGML etc)
* Document Workflow
* Information Retrieval
* Multimedia Document Management
* Multimedia Resource Discovery
* Natural Language Techniques and Documents
* Personalised Documents
* User Studies Involving Documents
* Web Documents

Important dates

Deadline for submissions: Monday 28 September 2009
Notification of acceptance: Monday 12 October 2009
Final version due: Monday 9 November 2009
Symposium: Friday 4 December 2009

Submission information is available at http://es.csiro.au/adcs2009/.

Full papers

Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research 
issues. These papers should be at most 3000 words long. Please refer to 
the guidelines for papers on the conference web page.

Posters, short papers, industry status reports

To encourage participation by industry, and to provide a place for work 
of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short 
papers, up to a maximum of 1500 words. A typical proposal might
describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document 
management. Short papers follow the same format as for full papers. The
mode of presentation of short papers is via a poster session. Accepted
short papers will be included in a separate section of the proceedings.

Demonstrations

If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please submit
an abstract following the same format as for full papers. Printed paper
proceedings will be distributed to participants at the symposium.
Electronic copies of the papers will be made available on the website.
