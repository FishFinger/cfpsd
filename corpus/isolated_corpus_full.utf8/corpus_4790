Frames and Constructions: A Conference in Honor of Charles J. Fillmore
July 31-Aug 2, 2009
The University of California, Berkeley

The Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley and the
International Computer Science Institute are pleased to announce a conference in
honor of Charles J. Fillmore on the occasion of his 80th birthday. The theme of
the conference is Fillmore's contributions to Linguistics for nearly five decades.

We anticipate major sessions on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar, along
with other presentations linked specifically to Fillmore's work, and its
relation to the allied fields of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and
natural language processing.

Plenary Talks: 
Speakers who have already agreed to participate include Charles J. Fillmore,
Gilles Fauconnier, Paul Kay, George Lakoff, Laura Michaelis, Manfred Pinkal, and
Dan Slobin.

Abstract Submission:
Those interested in presenting should send 500-word abstracts by April 20, and
expect a response by May 10. For directions about abstract submission, e-mail
(fillmorefest@berkeley.edu) after April 5 for an update. By March 30, the
conference website will be up, with directions for abstract submission - and the
automatic response to e-mails will then include the conference URL. After March
30, there will be a link to the conference website on the Berkeley Linguistics
Department website.

The conference will be relatively small, and contributions addressing Fillmore's
work explicitly will be given priority for oral presentation. However, we will
accept posters on a broader range of cognitive linguistic topics; applicants
should indicate specifically whether they would be willing to consider the
poster medium of presentation.

Lodging:
There are some campus dormitory rooms reserved for the conference period, for
those who want inexpensive lodging. Berkeley hotel information will be posted,
but dorm room inquiries should be sent as soon as possible to
fillmorefest@berkeley.edu, ideally with header "fillmorefest accommodation".

Please join us to celebrate a most important figure in Linguistics.

The Organizing Committee:
Collin F. Baker
Hans C. Boas
Alice Gaby
George Lakoff

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
