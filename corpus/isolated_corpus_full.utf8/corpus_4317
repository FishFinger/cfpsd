SCOPE

The successful development of multimedia services and applications in mobile environments requires adopting an interdisciplinary approach where multimedia, physical layer and networking issues are addressed jointly. Multimedia semantic characteristics, human interpretation of audiovisual information, extraction and usage of semantic information, coding standards and their interaction with transmission and networking aspects, mobility and security protocols are research challenges that need to be carefully examined when proposing new solutions. Many are the applications that will be enabled by the new standards for mobile networking, such as triple services for mobile networks, digital television in a converged environment, video streaming, interactive gaming, navigation services, context aware services, emergency and healthcare applications, and immersive communications in virtual environments. The efficient delivery of multimedia applications and services over emerging diver
 se and heterogeneous wireless networks is a challenging research objective. The research effort for the 4G vision of interworking among heterogeneous technologies to achieve multimedia session continuity, retain multimedia QoS characteristics etc., amplifies the need to evaluate the conditions and restrictions under which the delivery of such services can be accomplished. Within this scope, MobiMedia is intended to provide a unique international forum for researchers from industry and academia, working in multimedia coding, mobile communications and networking fields, to study new technologies, applications and standards.
Original unpublished contributions are solicited that can improve the knowledge and practice in the integrated design of efficient technologies and the relevant provision of advanced mobile multimedia applications.


Technical program

The conference will also include invited panels to facilitate for exchanging ideas and discussion, and specific sessions and workshops on focused interest areas. Submissions of proposals on workshops and special sessions on emerging topics are invited.

Proposals for Workshops and Special Sessions proposal deadline: Feb 20, 2009
Paper submission deadline: April 30, 2009
Notification of acceptance: June 19, 2009
Submission of camera-ready papers: July 23, 2009
