HCSNet Hands-on Workshop on Mashups for Human Communication Science

		27-28 July 2009, Macquarie University

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09


A Joint Workshop between the HCSNet Priority Areas of:

  - Next-Generation Search Technology

  - Effective Interfaces


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Mashups are all about presenting information from various sources in
an integrated Web application. While early experiments with
multimedia-multiweb application integration were done by savvy
programmers who would effectively decode yet unpublished APIs of
applications such as Google Maps, currently there is a wide range of
software platforms for the development of mashups, and building a
mashup is becoming increasingly easier by everyone. In this hands-on
workshop, experts from leading mash-up development technologies will
introduce their products and then groups will be formed to build
mash-ups on the spot. Emphasis will be given to mashups related to
HCSNet's Priority Areas.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

There will be presentations by the following people:

* Amanda Millar, coordinator of Yahoo! 7 Australia Open Sessions;

* Pamela Fox, from the Google Geo APIs team; and

* James Hogan, from Queensland University of Technology.


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to introduce mashup technology to all
people interested in using it for topics related with any of HCSNet's
Priority Areas. We welcome people from academia and industry with
interest in any of those areas:

 - Speech

 - Effective Interfaces

 - Next-Generation Search Technology

 - Human Communication Disorders

 - Perception and Action

This workshop is especially suited for students, researchers and
developers who want to apply this new technology to their projects.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. There will be extensive
tutorials and presentations by experts in mashups, and the workshop
will conclude with presentations of the mashups built over the two
days.


SUBMISSIONS

Submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length indicating the
reasons why you are interested in participating in this workshop and a
topic on which you would like to develop a mashup, and a paragraph
with research interests BY MONDAY 15 JUNE. Please send the submissions
by using the submission form at the workshop webpage (see the link at
the top of this call)


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a
number of participants from outside the Sydney area. The provision of
a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not
all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based
on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop; also, early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Sydney area.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior
registrations to HCSNet and this workshop are required.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Macquarie University can
attend the workshop without prior registration to HCSNet and they must
register to the workshop using a separate registration process (TBA).


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of Abstracts: 15 June 2009
    * Notification of Awards:  22 June 2009
    * Registration:            13 July 2009
    * Workshop:                27-28 July 2009
