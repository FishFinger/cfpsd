CALL FOR PAPERS

Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Special Issue on Recent Advances in CHR

Editors: Thom Fruehwirth and Tom Schrijvers

The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language saw the light more than 15 years
ago.  Since then, it has become a major declarative specification and
implementation language for constraint reasoning algorithms and applications.
In recent years, the Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules have spurred the
exchange of ideas within the CHR community, which has led to increased
international collaboration, new theoretical results and running systems.

The aim of this issue of Lecture Notes in Computer Science is to attract
high-quality research papers on these recent advances in Constraint Handling Rules.

TOPICS

Topics of interest, on all aspects of CHR, include but are not limited to:

     *  Semantics
     *  Logical Algorithms
     *  Constraint Solvers
     *  Expressivity and Complexity
     *  Program Analysis
     *  Programming tools
     *  Implementations and Optimization
     *  Program Transformation and Generation
     *  Language Extensions (Types, Modules)
     *  Retractable Constraints
     *  Programming Pearls
     *  Programming Environments (Debugging)
     *  Applications
     *  Critical Assessment
     *  Comparisons with Related Approaches

Submissions

Revised and enhanced versions of papers published at the Workshops on
Constraint Handling Rules and other conferences that have not appeared in
archival journals are eligible for submission.  Papers describing important
past research in this area which have not been published in archival journal
papers are also solicited.  New work, surveys and comparison of state of the
art techniques are also solicited. None of the submissions should have been
published in any form prior to 2001.

For any doubt regarding the appropriateness of the topic of a paper for this
special issue please email either to Thom Fruehwirth (Thom.Fruehwirth at
uni-ulm.de) or to Tom Schrijvers (Tom.Schrijvers at cs.kuleuven.be).

Papers should be written in English, and formatted using the LaTeX style files
developed by Springer Verlag for LNCS and which can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html

To submit please send an e-mail version to both Thom Fruehwirth
(Thom.Fruehwirth at uni-ulm.de) or to Tom Schrijvers (Tom.Schrijvers at
cs.kuleuven.be). For further information, please look at:
