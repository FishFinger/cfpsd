CALL FOR PAPERS

Language and Speech Infrastructure for Information Access in the Balkan
Countries
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2005/LSI_balkan.htm

Workshop to be held in conjunction with RANLP 2005
http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2005

25 September 2005

Borovets, Bulgaria

OVERVIEW
The emerging convergence of internet and media technologies, the abundance
of interesting and useful archived and contemporary content and the ever
increasing need for access to this content has set new challenges and
opportunities for human language technologies (HLT). Useful results from the
application of HLT for information access in a number of widely used
languages already exist, while only some first attempts have been made in
lesser used languages.

At the same time, the enlargement process of the European Union and the
forthcoming accession of a number of Balkan countries set new requirements
for technologically enhanced access to information generated and consumed in
the Balkan Peninsula.

The current workshop aims at bringing together researchers working in a
broad range of human language technologies for processing single- and/or
multimedia content.  The focus of the workshop is on issues relevant to the
respective linguistic infrastructure in the Balkan countries.
Submissions should be related to language and speech resources, tools and
applications developed for the languages of the Balkans. More specifically,
topics include but are not limited to:

·	grammars, lexicons and wordnets
·	information retrieval & extraction
·	text summarization
·	question answering
·	natural language generation
·	machine translation and computer-aided translation tools
·	speech synthesis and recognition
·	dialogue systems
·	multimedia information processing
·	computer-assisted language learning
·	architectures and development environments
·	evaluation of resources and language processing components and systems

LANGUAGE
The official language of the workshop is English.

SUBMISSIONS
Submissions should be A4, two-column format and should not exceed seven
pages, including cover page, figures, tables and references. Times New Roman
12 pt font is preferred. The first page should state the title of the paper,
the author's name(s), affiliation(s), postal and email address(es), a list
of keywords and an abstract. Papers should be submitted electronically in
PDF format to Stelios Piperidis, spip@ilsp.gr

Each paper will be reviewed by up to three members of the programme
committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how
to produce camera-ready version of their papers for inclusion in the
proceedings.

Parallel submissions to the main conference and the workshop are allowed but
the review process will be coordinated.

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission deadline: 20 July 2005
Notification of acceptance: 2 September 2005
Camera ready papers due: 8 September 2005
Workshop date: 25 September 2005
