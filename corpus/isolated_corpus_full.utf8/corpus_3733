Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

Although all the topics on formal historical syntax are welcome, the 11th
edition of DiGS encourages papers that approach topics related to the
understanding and modeling of how (morpho) syntax change comes about in
languages, or groups of languages, including but not restricted to: 
- parameter theory, 
- the role of language acquisition and contact on language change, 
- the dynamics of syntactic change
- grammaticalization,
- language reconstruction.

Confirmed Plenary Speakers:
Ana Maria Martins (University of Lisbon)
Giuseppe Longobardi (University of Trieste)
Ian Roberts (University of Oxford)
Jürgen Meisel (University of Hamburg / University of Calgary)
Mary Aizawa Kato (University of Campinas)

Call for Papers

We invite abstracts for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute
discussion period.
 
Abstracts should be anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references
and examples, with margins of at least 1 inch, Times New Roman 12,

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 13-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The traditional view of the critical period for language - going back to
Lenneberg - is that it is part of a biological process: the decline in language
ability reflects a maturational change in brain development. This view makes two
strong predictions, namely, that children will be better at acquiring language
than adults and that short of some kind of brain disorder, there's no way to
change that fact. This view has been challenged in recent years in a variety of
ways. Work on second language acquisition has found that adults are not always
worse than children in acquiring a language. Moreover, particularly in the
domain of phonology, there is evidence that second language learning can
influence first language representations, suggesting a continuity between the
two processes. In addition, alternative mechanisms to biological maturation have
been suggested as ways to account for differences between adults and children.
Chief among these alternatives are computationally influenced models which
appeal to the radical differences in terms of specific domain knowledge and
processing capacities through development.

We wish to address two related issues in this event: First, to what extent do
language acquisition abilities decline in adulthood? Second, to the extent that
adults are worse than children in acquiring language, what is the mechanism that
causes this decline? The goal of the symposium is to bring together scholars
with a range of views and thereby foster debate and discussion.

The symposium will include invited talks by:
James Flege, University of Alabama, Birmingham
Silvina Montrul, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Ann Senghas, Barnard College
Jason Zevin, Sackler Institute 

Call for Papers

We invite abstracts for contributed talks on research examining the critical
period hypothesis for language.  We hope that the final symposium program will
represent many different perspectives that include different dimensions of
language (Phonology, Syntax), different empirical approaches (Linguistics,
Psychology, Neuroscience), and different empirical domains (L1 acquisition, L2
acquisition, Computational Linguistics).

Contributed talks will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions.

Abstracts of at most 500 words should be submitted as an email attachment to
springsym@ling.osu.edu in pdf (preferred) or Word format by Friday, February 13,
2009.  Please include only the title and text of the abstract in the attachment.
 The authors' names, affiliations, and postal and email addresses should be
included in the text of the email.

Symposium website: http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~springsym/
Please email springsym@ling.osu.edu if you have any questions.

The Symposium is made possible through the generous support of the Targeted
Investment in Excellence in the College of Humanities, and the Center for
Cognitive Science at the Ohio State University.
