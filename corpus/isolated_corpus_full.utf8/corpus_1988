2nd Call for Papers

2nd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE AND AUTOMATA THEORY AND =
APPLICATIONS (LATA 2008)

Tarragona, Spain, March 13-19, 2008

http://grammars.grlmc.com/LATA2008/index.html

*************************************************************************=
******

AIMS:

LATA is a yearly conference in theoretical computer science and its =
applications. As linked to the International PhD School in Formal =
Languages and Applications that is being developed at the host institute =
since 2001, LATA 2008 will reserve significant room for young computer =
scientists at the beginning of their career. It will aim at attracting =
scholars from both classical theory fields and application areas =
(bioinformatics, systems biology, language technology, artificial =
intelligence, etc.).

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not =
limited to:

- words, languages and automata
- grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, multidimensional, =
unification, categorial, etc.)
- grammars and automata architectures
- extended automata
- combinatorics on words
- language varieties and semigroups
- algebraic language theory
- computability
- computational, descriptional, communication and parameterized =
complexity
- decidability questions on words and languages
- patterns and codes
- symbolic dynamics
- regulated rewriting
- trees, tree languages and tree machines
- term rewriting
- graphs and graph transformation
- power series
- fuzzy and rough languages
- cellular automata
- DNA and other models of bio-inspired computing
- symbolic neural networks
- quantum, chemical and optical computing
- biomolecular nanotechnology
- automata and logic
- algorithms on automata and words
- automata for system analysis and programme verification
- automata, concurrency and Petri nets
- parsing
- weighted machines
- transducers
- foundations of finite state technology
- grammatical inference and algorithmic learning
- text retrieval, pattern matching and pattern recognition
- text algorithms
- string and combinatorial issues in computational biology and =
bioinformatics
- mathematical evolutionary genomics
- language-based cryptography
- data and image compression
- circuits and networks
- language-theoretic foundations of artificial intelligence and =
artificial life
- digital libraries
- document engineering

STRUCTURE:

LATA 2008 will consist of:

- 3 invited talks
- 2 invited tutorials
- refereed contributions
- open sessions for discussion in specific subfields or on professional =
issues

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Mikolaj Bojanczyk (Warsaw U), Tree-walking Automata
