Deadline for Paper Submission: ***6th April 2009***


This special issue will address computational models and techniques
for the real-time interpretation of the user=92s behaviour to produce
mid- or high-level state descriptors, from basic emotions to more
complex appraisals or mental states (e.g. agreement and interest, or
blends of several emotions) for the purpose of closing the affective
loop in social robots and virtual agents.

A vital requirement for social robots and virtual agents is the
ability to infer the affective and mental states of humans, so as to
be able to engage in and behave appropriately during sustained social
interactions.  Examples include ensuring that the user is interested
in maintaining the interaction or providing suitable empathic
responses. A fundamental component in these 'mentalizing' and
'empathizing' capabilities is the interpretation of human behavior
from sensory input, which must be conducted in a timely
manner. Researchers in multimodal interfaces have been increasingly
addressing the design of systems endowed with these
abilities. Nevertheless, only a few attempts have been made towards
the development of virtual agents and robots capable of inferring the
user=92s states in real-time.

The focus of this special issue is on real-time computational
techniques for the recognition and interpretation of human verbal and
non-verbal behavior, models of 'mentalizing' and 'empathizing' for
integrative representation and processing of input data, and
implementation to support human-agent and human-robot interaction
frameworks.
