Observing Talk: Conversation Analytic Studies of Second Language Interaction 

JALT Pragmatics SIG Pragmatic Resources series

Editors
Rod Gardner, Griffith University, Australia r.gardner(at)griffith.edu.au
Tim Greer, Kobe University, Japan tim(at)kobe-u.ac.jp

As language teachers, much of our work involves conversation and
talk-in-interaction, even if we rarely stop to think about what it is we
are doing with and through our talk. Although the participant-centered
approach to talk in Conversation Analysis (CA) has been widely used in
sociology for the last forty years, it has only been in recent years that
it has received a growing interest among researchers into second language
learning. Markee and Kasper (2004) proposed a possible research agenda for
Conversation Analysis for Second Language Acquisition (CA for SLA) including;
     *treating cognition as socially distributed 
     *respecifying learning as something that is observable in and through
learner talk
     *documenting how L2 learners accomplish aspects of their identities in
talk
     *focusing primarily on actions rather than language
There is a clear need to investigate what this kind of fine-grained,
participant-centred observation of natural interaction can offer teachers
of second languages, and to make CA research more accessible to teachers
and applicable to classrooms. 

The JALT Pragmatics SIG is currently seeking papers for inclusion in the
second book in its Pragmatic Resource Series. This collection will explore
ways in which CA can be applied to investigations of interaction in second
language contexts. Authors must adhere to the CA precepts of; 
     * privileging the participants' actions over analyst interpretations
and/or pre-existing models
     * basing findings on detailed analysis of recordings of
naturally-occurring interaction 
     * beginning with "unmotivated looking" rather than testing a hypothesis
     * building collections of related interactional phenomena, based on
the organizational principles of sequence, preference, turn-taking, repair,
turn construction and action formation.

Papers will be considered in two main areas: 

1. CA studies based on collections of phenomena from second language
interaction. 

These studies will inform research into ways that second language users
accomplish certain social actions in their second language, and/or
investigate how language learning takes place as social action. CA-based
studies of novice/expert identity accomplishment in second language
interaction are also welcome. Authors should also endeavor to comment on
the study's implications for learning and/or implications for classroom
practice.

2. Commentary on how CA principles can be incorporated into classroom
practices. 

Articles in this section must be based around a practical theme, such as
advising teachers on how to assess conversation, or applying CA findings to
evaluate textbook dialogues or create teaching materials for second
language learners. As such, the papers in this section may deviate somewhat
from a traditional CA-style analysis, but should still present original
ideas that are grounded in micro-level understandings of interactional data.

Papers must be written in English (4000 to 6000 words) and use APA
referencing. Transcripts should adhere to the conventions developed by Gail
Jefferson, as outlined in Schegloff (2007), and any additional symbols
should be clearly noted in an appendix.

Timeline
Initial proposal and abstract due: 30 June 2007
First draft due: 15 November 2007
Revised draft due: 30 June 2008		
Proposed publication: November 2008

The initial proposal should be 800 to 1000 words and include a working
title and preliminary outline of the paper. It must clearly delineate the
study's main focus, participants and proposed findings, and may include one
or two short sample transcripts taken from the data collection. Outlines
must be sent to both editors as an email attachment in either Word or RTF.
Based on their demonstrated familiarity with the CA approach and the
suitability of the proposed topic, successful applicants will be invited to
further develop their article for eventual submission in the book.
