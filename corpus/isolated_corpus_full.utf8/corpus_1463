Call for Papers

The 2007 Western Conference on Linguistics (WECOL) will be held November 30th
-December 2nd, 2007 at the University of California, San Diego. This year's
conference will include a general session, a poster session, and two special
sessions described below.

General Session: expanding the depth and width of empirical data

While the general session will cover all areas of linguistic interest and
welcome papers  from all major linguistic subfields and frameworks, as well as
from related cross-disciplinary areas, special consideration will be given to
experimental and corpus studies which challenge existing linguistic data and
generalizations or bring previously unnoticed data to discussion. 

Invited Speaker
TBA

Special session I: What can L1 and L2 research tell us about Language Universals? 

The special session I will focus on language acquisition studies from any of the
sub-disciplines in linguistics and related fields which contribute to our
understanding of universal characteristics of language.    

Invited Speaker
TBA

Special session II: Challenges to linguistic generalizations from understudied
languages

This special session II invites papers that investigate linguistic
generalizations with data from under-studied languages. Submissions from all
theoretical and empirical perspectives are welcome.

Invited Speaker
TBA

Submission Guidelines

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion), and
for a poster session. Abstract submission will be done through Abstract
Submission page on the conference website: 

http://ling.ucsd.edu/events/wecol07/ 

When submitting your abstract, please specify the sessions you would like to be
considered for: General, Poster, or one of the two special sessions.
