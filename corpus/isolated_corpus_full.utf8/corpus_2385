Bonjour a tous,

A toute fin utile se trouve ci-dessous l'appel a soumission pour la session etudiante d'ACL 2008 (deadline dans 3 jours).

Cordialement,

******************************************************

ACL 2008 Student Research Workshop
June 15-20, 2008, Columbus Ohio

Call for Papers
1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come from any topic area within computational linguistics including, but not limited to, the following topic areas:

    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
    * phonetics, phonology and morphology
    * linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
    * information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
    * summarization and paraphrasing
    * speech recognition, speech synthesis
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
    * spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
    * multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
    * message and narrative understanding systems

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished research. The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who have settled on their thesis direction but still have significant research left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for further development of the work, papers should clearly indicate directions for future research wherever appropriate. All authors of multi-author papers MUST be students. Papers submitted for this workshop are eligible only if they have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Students who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper has been submitted to another conference or workshop.
3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference. These files are available at ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html. A description of the format is available there in case you are unable to use these style files directly. All submissions must be electronic. Please use the submission page to submit your paper.
4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on the results of the review. Note that reviewing of papers will be double-blind; therefore, please make sure your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should likewise not have any self identifying references anywhere in the paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: "We showed previously (Smith, 2001), ...", use citations such as: "Smith (2001) previously showed ...".
5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than midnight, January 10th, 2008 . No papers received after January 10th, 2008 will be accepted. Acknowledgment will be emailed soon after receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by email) on February 28th, 2008. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance notice.
Important Dates:

    Paper submission deadline: January 10, 2008
    Notification of acceptance: February 28, 2008
    Camera-ready paper submission deadline: April 14, 2008
    Conference date: June 15-20, 2008
    (The workshop will be held during the main conference)
