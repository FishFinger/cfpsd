Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:
The aim of this conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of original 
research that addresses empirical or theoretical questions of information 
structure from an explicitly contrastive perspective. The range of languages to 
be dealt with is not restricted, but we would prefer to have at least one of the 
languages to be contrasted to be English, German, French, Italian, or Spanish. 
(For a more detailed description see below, or the conference website at 
www.cisa-2008.de.)

We invite abstracts in RTF, DOC or PDF format for 30 minutes talks (plus 10 
minutes for discussion). Abstracts should be no longer than one page of A4 plus 
one page for references, with 2.5 cm margins on all sides, 1.5 line spacing, typed

these should be anonymous and one should include your name, affiliation and e-

reviewed anonymously by members of the advisory board.

Rationale:
The notion of information structure underlying this conference refers to the
grammatical properties of sentences that encode ''a speaker's assumptions
concerning the hearer's state of mind at the time of an utterance'' (Lambrecht 
1994). More specifically, what is relevant here is the addressee's state of mind as 
concerns their mental representation of the discourse. The communicator's aim 
and task in uttering a sentence is to supply information, or to be 'relevant' in 
Sperber & Wilson's (1986/1995) sense, in order to effect a modification of the 
addressee's representation of the discourse. Information structure thus 
conceived comprises two basic types of grammatical properties: (a) Properties 
relating to the communicator's assumptions about whether a given entity or 
proposition is known to the addressee and whether he is aware of it at the time 
of the utterance. Grammatical categories associated with such properties include 
(in)definiteness, (non-)specificity, mood, pronominal/zero versus full lexical 
coding, sentence versus embedded clause. (b) Properties relating to the 
communicator's assumptions about vacant information slots recently created in 
the process of the addressee's representation of the discourse. Information 
being propositional in nature, such slots have to be filled by expressions capable 
of denoting a proposition at the given point of
the discourse, i.e. by complete or elliptical sentences. Moreover, in order to
be 'relevant', in Sperber & Wilson's (1986/1995) sense, these expressions have 
to provide clues that help the addressee to determine which recently created 
information slot is to be filled by the utterance. The grammatical categories 
associated with such aspects of sentence grammar have been subsumed under 
the notion of focus structure. They include concepts such as background and 
focus, theme and rheme, sentence versus predicate versus argument focus (or 
thetic versus categorical versus identificational sentences). Intonation plays an 
important role in signalling assumptions of the kinds mentioned in (a) and (b) as 
well. Independently of the question of how intonation relates to syntax, it is clear 
that intonational properties may
express categories of information structure instead of or in combination with 
morpho-syntactic properties. Contrastive, or comparative, analyses can be found 
in numerous works on various aspects of information structure (see e.g. 
Lambrecht 1994, Schwabe & Winkler (eds.) 2007). However, the contrastive 
approach has seldom provided the explicit
and guiding perspective in this field (for recent works that do take an
explicitly contrastive/comparative approach, see e.g. Doherty 2005, Drubig 
2003, Frey 2005, Hasselgård & Johansson & Behrens & Fabricius-Hansen (eds.) 
2002).

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different 
frameworks to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the 
themes of evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and 
computational linguistics, and evaluation for internal purposes. 

Call for ''Demos''
Grammar Engineering across Frameworks  
July 13-15, 2007
Stanford, California, USA

This workshop is part of the 2007 LSA Summer Institute.

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to
support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world 
domains and applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in 
significant advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic 
approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The 
effective development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a central 
issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars forces 
these processes to be tackled in ways that have much in common with software 
engineering.  This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from 
different frameworks to compare their research and methodologies.
   
Demo Session
  
Please submit your demo directly to:
http://www.easychair.org/GEAF2007
with a paragraph description of your demo.  You do not need to turn in a
full paper version, just a short paragraph abstract (note that EasyChair
requires the short abstract as a pdf or txt file in addition to just pasting it in the 
box).  Be sure to choose the ''Demo only'' option for type of submission.

You do not have to have a paper in the workshop in order to give a demo.

Questions: geaf-organizers at u dot washington dot edu

Demo session requests due: June 1, 2007
Workshop: 13-15 July, 2007
