Call for Papers: Language Policy Special Issue 

Call Centers: Language policy and language ideology in action

The journal Language Policy (edited by Elana Shohamy and Kendall King)
welcomes original research papers for an upcoming special issue of the
journal on language policy, ideology, and interaction in call centers
around the world. As international business, out-sourcing, and
globalization have intensified in recent years, call centers have emerged
as major and dynamic sites of regulated talk. This special issue of
Language Policy will explore how such talk is restricted, invented, and
negotiated in the work place and the wider implications for language
policy, education and society. We welcome papers that document and analyze
language policies in call centers and/or consider the wider implications of
these phenomena for language policy, ideology, and use.

Deadlines and dates:

September 1, 2007: Submission of 250-word paper abstract (send to
akk25@georgetown.edu)

January 1, 2008: Submission of full paper for blind external peer review
(submit online through website).

Early 2009: Expected publication.

Please contact the editors directly with any questions. 

Please see the journal website for more details about Language Policy.
