Meeting Description
In conjunction with RANLP 2007 

Second Call for Papers, Programme Committee included

International Workshop
A Common Natural Language Processing Paradigm for Balkan Languages

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007
September 26, 2007 
Borovets, Bulgaria 

The workshop is partially supported by the European Commission via the project 
BIS-21++, FP6 contract no. INCO-CT-2005-016639

Many things have changed at the Balkans for two years, since the previous
workshop ''Language and Speech Infrastructure for Information Access in the
Balkan Countries'' was held in conjunction with RANLP'05. The languages spoken
in this unique region attract more attention, due to the rapidly developing
field of communication and translation, and the interest to language
technologies for these languages is increasing. New markets appear, together
with newly established collaboration and new opportunities to extend the
application areas of natural language processing.

In the last decade, numerous activities aimed at incorporating the Balkan NLP
research into the widely applied models of other European languages in the form
of joint projects like MulText East, BALRIC-LING, BalkaNet, INTERA and others.
Language resources and grammatical knowledge for different Balkan languages have
been incorporated and processed within the international NLP standards like MTE,
XCES, WordNet, INTERA. As a result of joint bilateral projects, the linguistic
knowledge for some Balkan languages has been processed according to well-known
systems and models - INTEX, GATE, etc.

The unified NLP paradigm for Balkan languages ensures the development of a
common idea for creation of a Balkan multilingual pool for NLP in monolingual or
multilingual - parallel or contrastive - perspective. Not all Balkan languages
are at the same distance from the achievement of that goal. That is why the main
task of this workshop is, along with the overview of present achievements
related to the development of a common NLP paradigm of the Balkan languages, to
suggest a roadmap for the multilingual research and development carried out in
joint activities of the members of the traditional Balkan language union.

Specific topics of interest for the proposed workshop are:
- NLP-driven models of large language data sets, for instance, grammatical
dictionaries, syntactic collections, text categories, ontologies; 

- collection and representation of large lexical resources conforming to
international standards; 

- compilation of large multilingual collections where a given Balkan language is
paired to a wide-spread European language, or another Balkan language; 

- evaluation of the results of using wide-spread NLP tools for the Balkan
languages; 

- investigation/evaluation of the results of mapping the well-known and widely
used NLP-driven models of the different Balkan languages.

Meeting Description:
The Relevance of Computational Concepts in Cognitive Linguistics. 

Computational Paradigms and Language Structure - 
The Relevance of Computational Concepts in Cognitive Linguistics

November 30th - December 1st, 2007,
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

Computer Science developed a wealth of computational paradigms responding to the
ever growing complexity of computer systems and the demands of software
maintenance and efficient data organisation. In Linguistics,  computational
models were frequently made use of (cf. e.g. the notion of interfaces) without
however systematically exploring the possibilities offered by Computer Science.

In this workshop we would like to consider the concepts and solutions provided
by the different  computational paradigms and address the question of  whether
they allow for a cognitive interpretation which can be utilised for linguistic
theory-building. For example, complexity, maintenance and efficiency should be
core aspects in the organisation of the lexicon from a cognitive perspective.
How do the different computational paradigms deal with these problems, and how
to exploit such solutions for the organisation of the lexicon? One hypothesis
would be that the principles of the object oriented paradigm will prove to be
productive for cognitive linguistics. With the exception of the pioneering work
by Schalley (2004), this path has not yet been investigated in a more systematic
way.

The workshop aims at putting a new research question on the agenda and solicits
original contributions exploring Computational Science concepts for Cognitive
Linguistics.
