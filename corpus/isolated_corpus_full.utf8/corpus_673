Location: Tübingen, Germany 
Contact Person: Alexander Mehler
Meeting Email: alexander.mehler@uni-bielefeld.de

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 13-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

Theme and Scope: Ontologies and semantic lexica (such as GOLD, WordNet, FrameNet in the area of linguistics) represent information about concepts and relationships between them (e.g. superclass-subclass and part-whole-relations, relations of semantic opposition) in an explicit form that can be used by computational applications. The focus of the workshop will be on the usage of ontologies and semantic lexica in automated discourse analysis. 

Call for Papers

Workshop on Ontologies and semantic lexica in automated discourse analysis

To be held in conjunction with the GLDV Frühjahrstagung 11.-13.April 2007 in Tübingen.

Organizers

Harald Lüngen (Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen)
Alexander Mehler (Universität Bielefeld)
Angelika Storrer (Universität Dortmund)

Theme and Scope:

Ontologies and semantic lexica (such as GOLD, WordNet, FrameNet in the area of linguistics) represent information about concepts and relationships between them (e.g.  superclass-subclass and part-whole-relations, relations of semantic opposition) in an explicit
form that can be used by computational applications. The focus of the proposed workshop will be on the usage of ontologies and semantic lexica in automated discourse analysis.

We invite contributions dealing with ontology-based approaches in the following application fields:

- discourse parsing (rhetorical and/or thematic structure assignment);
- lexical chaining / cohesion analysis;
- anaphora resolution;
-automatic text segmentation and linking (hypertextualization);
- topic detection and topic tracking;
- automatic text summarization;
- document and information retrieval;
- automatic text classification;
- information extraction;
- text mining.

Topics and research questions include but are not limited to:

- (comparative) evaluation of methods and resources;
- combining ontology-based and stochastic methods;
- ontology modelling for specific tasks in discourse analysis;
- use or generation of wiki(-pedia)-based ontologies;
- use of semantic web technologies.
