Pierrette Bouillon (ETI/TIM/ISSCO, University of Geneva, Switzerland)
Laurence Danlos (Universite de Paris VII, Paris, France)
Kyoko Kanzaki (National Institute of Information and Communications
Technology,
NICT, Japan)

Date:
May 10-11 2007

Location:
Ministere de la Recherche, Paris, France

Topic:
The aim of GL workshops is to bring together diverse contributions
in philosophy, linguistics, computer science and lexicography to
explore the lexicon from the point of view of generativity. The
discussions will be centered, but are not limited to, the emerging
view of "Generative Lexicon Theory" (Pustejovsky). Topics include:

- Philosophical foundations of a generative approach
- Generative lexicon theory and representation of word meaning
- Analysis of linguistic phenomena in a generative perspective
- Frameworks for lexical semantics
- Philosophical differences between frameworks
- Critical perspectives and evaluation

In this fourth workshop we would like to keep all the above
perspectives, but put more of the focus on building on-line GL
resources for NLP tasks, in particular:

- Arguments and counter-arguments in favour of a GL resource
- Acquiring lexical information: methodology, tools, resources
- Maintaining and evaluating GL resources on systematic grounds
- Scalability for different NLP tasks

Papers can make reference to any semantic lexicons (Wordnet, Framenet,
Meaning-text theory, etc.), but a link to Generative Lexicon theory is
desirable (Pustejovsky, 1995). Key topics are:

- How to build a Generative Lexicon?
- How a Generative Lexicon can be extracted from existing resources or
corpora?
- How to connect qualia structures with other lexical information?
- How to use qualia structures in NLP applications?

The conference will be held over a period of two days. Both posters
and presentations are foreseen and will be published in the
proceedings.  Invited speakers include Robin Cooper, Alain Polguere
and James Pustejovsky.

Submission procedure: Authors should submit an anonymous paper of at
most 7 single-column pages (including references) using a 12' body
font size together with a separate page specifying the author's name,
affiliation, address, e-mail address, title and type of paper (normal
presentation or poster). The minimum size is 3 pages for a poster
paper and 5 pages for a normal paper. The papers should be submitted
electronically (in postscript, rtf or pdf format) to both:
kanzaki@nict.go.jp and pierrette.bouillon@issco.unige.ch.

Language: All papers must be submitted and presented in
English. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the
workshop.

Important dates:
Paper due: 1st of February 2007
Acceptance/rejection notice: End of February 2007
Final version due: April 15th, 2007
Conference: May 10-11, 2007
