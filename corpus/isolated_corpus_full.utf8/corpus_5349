Meeting Description:

GL2009: Generative Lexicons: From Theory to Implementation
5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon
Date: Sept. 17-19 2009
Location: CNR, Pisa, Italy

The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse contributions from
theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science,
and lexicography, which explore compositionality from the point of view of
generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed,
as a starting point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon Theory
(Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). This year's GL conference will be in a new format,
combining both an open call for papers and a workshop on semantic annotation.  

The conference will be held over a period of three days and will be organized as
a combination of technical paper presentations and posters, break-out sessions,
and keynote lectures. The first day will be devoted to the annotation workshop
and the second day to conference papers. The final day will be dedicated to the
presentation of results from the workshop and an open discussion of remaining
issues.  

The workshop and the open discussion are jointly supported by the EC-FLaReNet
and the NSF-SILT projects, with the goal of identifying common future directions
of research.

This conference is endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups:
SIGANN, SIGSEM, and SIGLEX (pending).

Invited Speakers:

Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA
Johan Bos, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy
Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh, UK
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA 

Final Call for Papers

http://www.gl2009.org/
Submission Deadline EXTENDED: June 11, 2009

Important Dates:

Papers due: June 1, 2009 [extended to June 11, 2009]
Acceptance notice: July 1, 2009
Camera-ready version due: August 1, 2009
Conference: Sept. 17-19, 2009

Topics:

Track 1: Open conference

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Polysemy and sense shifting
- Co-compositionality and creation of new word senses
- Type coercion and argument selection phenomena
- Argument realization: mapping from lexicon to syntax
- Cognitive foundations for semantic categories
- The trade-off between pragmatics and lexical knowledge
- Presupposition and commonsense knowledge
- Underspecification and word sense disambiguation

These topics can be approached from either a theoretical or computational
perspective. Computational issues relating to the above phenomena include:

- Automatic knowledge acquisition
- Computational models of compositional phenomena
- Robust semantic annotation
- Evaluation of algorithms and annotation schemes

Track 2: Semantic Annotation Workshop

The annotation workshop will address general issues in the identification and
markup of semantic content in text. 

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Compositional mechanisms of argument selection and coercion
- Named entity classification including named entities, events, and temporal and
spatial expressions
- Lexical substitution
- Metonymy resolution
- Textual entailment
- Word sense disambiguation
- Semantic role labeling
- Qualia in argument selection and modification constructions
- Type selection in modification of dot objects (complex types)
- Annotation environments and tools

The workshop is intended to provide feedback and training for the upcoming 2010
SemEval tasks, with a special focus on the 'Argument Selection and Coercion'
task, which deals with identifying the compositional operations involved in
argument selection by a predicate.

Submission Information:

GL2009 will be using EasyChair for electronic submission.  All papers should 
be submitted using the following website:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gl2009

Please indicate whether your submission is intended for the open call or for 
the workshop. The final submission deadline is June 11, 2009 11:59 EST.  

All submissions must be in PDF and must follow the two-column format. The
maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages. Submissions must be
anonymized, i.e. no author information should be included, and obvious
self-references should be avoided.  Please use the ACL style guidelines, as
specified here:

http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/paperformat.html

Regular and poster papers should follow the same guidelines.  The appropriate 
presentation format will be determined at the time of acceptance.

Author Support:

A limited number of fellowships to student authors traveling from the U.S. will
be available to offset the cost of travel if the paper is accepted.
