Deadline for receipt of abstracts: January 31, 2010
Notification of acceptance: February 28, 2010

Abstract submission procedure: Please submit your abstract (1,600 characters in
Japanese or 1,000 words in English) as an MS-Word file (or a PDF file if it
contains special characters) and send it as an attachment to the following
e-mail address:
muranoih@tscc.tohoku-gakuin.ac.jp  
Hitoshi Muranoi (Tohoku Gakuin University, Department of English)

Please write "J-SLA Abstract Submission" in the subject line and list the
following information in the body of the message: the title of your paper or
poster, your name, affiliation, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail
address, and type of proposal (Student Workshop*, paper, or poster), and the

the bottom of the list whether you are willing to participate in the poster
session should your paper not be accepted for oral presentation.

(* A Student Workshop will be held the morning of June 12, 2010. We plan to
schedule parallel sessions to accommodate as many presentations as possible. The
time allotted for each presentation is 30 minutes, with an additional 10 minutes
for discussion. At least one expert in the area will attend each session to
promote discussion and to provide advice. Presenters should be student members
of J-SLA  (see (10) below). Studies-in-progress are welcome.)

Notes regarding abstract submission:
- Figures and tables are not counted as part of the word limit but should be
included in the abstract. 
- The total length of the abstract should not exceed two A4 pages.
- Include the title of the abstract at the top and the number of characters (if
written in Japanese) or word count (if written in English) at the bottom.
- Do not put the name(s) of the presenter(s) on the abstract.
- Send a shorter version of the abstract (no more than 300 characters in
Japanese or 100 words in English) as a separate attachment. Include the title at
the top and the number of characters or word count at the bottom.
- Authors may submit only one abstract for consideration as a paper for oral
presentation. This limit holds for all authors regardless of their status as
primary or secondary author. Additional submissions for the Student Workshop or
for poster presentations are also permitted as long as the contents of each
submission are not the same. 

General notes
