sessions will complement and support a follow-up of the respective =
conference sessions, via an electronic forum and the possibility of =
evaluating papers presented at the associated session. These evaluations =
will also support the selection process for the papers to be published =
in JSCI journal.

The registration fee of effective invited session organizers will be =
waived and they will receive at the registration desk, for free, 1) a =
package of 4 DVDs and one CD containing the 6-hour tutorial =
