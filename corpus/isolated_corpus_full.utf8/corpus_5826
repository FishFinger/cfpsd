Meeting Description:

The Institute of Cultural and Linguistic Studies at Keio University will be holding the 11th Tokyo Conference on Psycholinguistics(TCP 2010) on March 12 and 13, 2010.

The invited speakers are Dr. Susan Curtiss (UCLA) and Dr. Ken Hiraiwa (Meiji Gakuin University)

For details, visit our web site: http://www.otsu.icl.keio.ac.jp/tcp/ 

Call for Papers:

The Tokyo Conference on Psycholinguistics welcomes papers that represent any scientific endeavor that addresses itself to "Plato's Problem" concerning language acquisition: "How we can gain a rich linguistic system given our fragmentary and impoverished experience?"  Its scope thus includes linguistic theory (phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics), L1 and L2 acquisition, language processing, and the neuroscience of language, among other topics.

We believe that there are some types of studies which are suitable for oral presentations, and others, which are suitable for poster presentations.  We would like to accept both types of studies at the Conference.  The time for an oral presentation will be 20 minutes with a 10 minute discussion period (a total of 30 minutes).  There is the possibility that some papers of outstanding quality will be given longer time slots (i.e., a 30 minute presentation with a 15 minute discussion period).  Furthermore, the space allotted to a poster presentation will be 90 cm (width) x 180 cm (length).

The guidelines for the abstract submission are as follows:

1. Only e-mail submissions will be accepted.

2. You may submit at most one single (sole-authored) paper and two joint (co-authored) papers. Namely you may submit any of the following:

(a) one sole-authored paper
(b) one sole-authored paper and one co-authored paper
(c) one sole-authored paper and two co-authored papers
(d) one co-authored paper
(e) two co-authored papers

3. The abstract must be received by November 30, 2009 by 11:59 pm JST (Japan Standard Time) via e-mail to: tcpabst2010@otsu.icl.keio.ac.jp.  This address will be effective from October 1 to November 30, 2009.  Late submissions will not be accepted. Notification of receipt will be e-mailed to the first author shortly after receipt.

4. The subject of the e-mail should be "abstract".

5. The body of the e-mail should include:

a. The author information (name, affiliation, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number; If your paper has multiple authors, provide information regarding all of the co-authors.  And,?if you are in Japan, add kanji where relevant.),
b. The type of presentation (Your choice will not be revealed to the reviewers, and thus will not influence the review process.),
A)  Oral
B)  Poster
C)  Either Poster or Oral
c. The title of paper,
d. The language(s) which you are focusing on in your paper,
e. The field(s) which your abstract involves (e.g, Morphology, Phonetics, Phonology, Semantics, Syntax, Pragmatics, L1 acquisition, L2 acquisition, Language Processing, Neuroscience of Language, and so on), and
f. 3 keywords/phrases that best describe your paper.

6. A PDF file of your abstract in English should be attached to the e-mail. Document files (e.g., MS Word format) cannot be accepted.  If you have any problems in applying by e-mail with a PDF file attachment, do not hesitate to contact us.

7. Format the files of your abstracts (including bibliography) to A4 paper size, single-spaced, limiting the length to a maximum of 2 pages.  Since the abstract, if accepted, will be photocopied to be included in the conference handbook, make sure your margins have ample room.  This abstract will also be placed on the TCP website.

8. The font size should be 12 point.  For any fonts used, a font file should be attached.

9. Put the title in the center of the top of the first page.

10. Do not put your name on your abstract (The abstract reviews will be anonymous).

11. You cannot revise your abstract once it has been submitted.

We will notify you of the results of our review process via e-mail by January 12, 2010 at the latest. Those who are accepted as speakers will be requested to reply within several days if they are willing to present their papers at TCP 2010.  Please let us know if you plan to be away from e-mail in early January.

In addition, we are planning to publish a volume of the conference proceedings.  If your abstract is accepted, we will inform you of the details regarding this matter later.  Most likely, you will be asked to e-mail us your paper as a MS Word and a PDF file attachment by mid-May 2010.

Unfortunately, TCP has no funds for financial assistance.  Participants are expected to make their own travel arrangements.
