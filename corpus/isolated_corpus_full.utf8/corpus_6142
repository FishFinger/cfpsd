2nd Call for Papers

This conference proposes to unite insights from a number of research areas such
as linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, psychology and philosophy. Spatial
language and cognition has generated fervent debates in linguistics recently, in
particular since the revival of Whorfian ideas regarding the dynamics between
languages and cultures. Namely, the domain of space has become a prolific source
of evidence of both language-specific and universal features reflected in human
thinking and speaking. In some languages speakers speak and think of space using
absolute coordinates of east vs. west and north vs. south on a daily basis while
other communities use the notions of left vs. right for spatial orientation and
communication. Similarly, in some cultures the time scale is vertical, future is
upwards and past is downwards, while closer to home, time seems to be a
horizontal line, with future in front of us and the past behind. More formal
approaches in syntax and semantics provide yet another perspective for
representing time in language.

However, space and time are also universal categories, the representation of
which is embedded in both language and cognition. Recent anthropological
evidence also speaks volumes about the complexity of spatial orientation in
language and cognition. Archaeologists have been active in piecing together the
puzzle of how our distant ancestors thought about the immediate space and time
they lived in as well as how they communicated thoughts and experiences with
space and time via material artefacts and customs in different environmental and
social surroundings. Recent experimental psychology research has also tackled
the subject from the angle of spatial and temporal features relevant in event
perception, their linguistic expression and memory. Finally, physical sciences
offer a backdrop for an all-encompassing view of the origins of space and time
and their interrelatedness. Reconciling the concept of time and the notion of
real time is still one of the challenges for all disciplines.

This is an opportunity to highlight the particular aspects of the different
research agendas related to Space and Time as well as share experiences
regarding practical matters, such as research strategies and methodology. Time
and space are topics of general interest which are actively pursued in many
different disciplines and this conference proposes to foster interdisciplinary
collaboration and further enhance progress in these diverse but related research
areas.
