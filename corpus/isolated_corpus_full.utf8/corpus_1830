Collaboration and Communicative Tools for Distributed Communities: A Joint HCSNet-HxI Workshop

Date: 6-7 December 2007
Location: University of New South Wales, Sydney 
Contact: Barbara Kelly (b.kelly@unimelb.edu.au), Robert McArthur (Robert.McArthur@csiro.au)

CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION

INTRODUCTION

HCSNet (www.hcsnet.edu.au) and HxI (www.hxi.org.au) are organising a joint workshop on Collaboration and Communicative Tools for Distributed Communities. This workshop will be held as part of SummerFest '07 and will bring together researchers interested in a range of current issues at the intersection of collaboration in online communities and design & development of tools to facilitate this. The aim is to identify shared interests, understand different perspectives around online human-human collaboration and communicative tools, and to take first steps towards developing future collaborations. HCSNet will fund travel for a number of Australian participants from outside the Sydney area.

AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to gather people from a wide range of areas of research, development and industry. We invite and encourage participants from HCI, CSCW, Language Technology, Psychology, Communication Science, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Linguistics, Sociology, Education, and other fields of interest to researchers in distributed collaborative community development. 

An example of the range of themes of interest is:
â¢	Behaviours of online users;
â¢	Experiences of face-to-face vs. virtual users;
â¢	Design and development issues in face-to-face vs. virtual use;
â¢	Modelling online communication;
â¢	Tool development for specific tasks;
â¢	Studying online communities with ICT enabled research methods;
â¢	Managing virtual communities;
â¢	Communication for collaboration;
â¢	Non-verbal vs verbal communicative cues

INVITED SPEAKERS

There will be keynote presentations by two international invited speakers, identities yet to be confirmed. One presentation will focus on issues in design and development of tools for effective online collaboration and community building. The other will focus on human issues in online collaboration. 

PARTICIPATION AND FORMAT

We welcome participation from a range of interests and perspectives within the topic of understanding different perspectives around human-human online collaboration and communicative tools, from both academia and industry, and we would like to involve as many as possible in discussion. Two forms of presentations are possible - short and longer as follows:
â¢	SHORT Presentations are papers of 5 minutes duration, and should outline
a perceived problem in the area and ideas for its solution.
â¢	LONGER Presentations are of 20 minutes, and contain a strong, justified position statement, discussion issue, or results from current research.

For both types of presentation, please submit a short abstract of up to 250 words to Kym Buckley, ky.buckley@uws.edu.au by the date indicated below.

The format of the workshop will promote interaction and collaboration. As well as presentations, we plan panels, discussion issues raised by industry/user groups, and break-out sessions. 

FUNDING

HCSNet-HxI is able to provide support for a number of participants traveling from outside Sydney. SUBMISSION OF AN ABSTRACT DESCRIBED ABOVE IS A PREREQUISITE FOR BEING CONSIDERED FOR TRAVEL FUNDING. If not all participants can be covered, travel funding may be allocated based on specified interests, as described in the submitted abstract.
