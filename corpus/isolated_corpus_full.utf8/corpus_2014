CFP: IUI-2008 Workshop on Common Sense Knowledge and Goal-Oriented =

Interfaces (CSKGOI 2008)

 	Common Sense Knowledge and Goal-Oriented Interfaces (CSKGOI 2008)
 	A workshop at Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2008)
 	January 13, 2008
 	Canary Islands, Spain

Overview:

   When interacting with user interfaces, users have to bridge the gap =

between their goals expressed in mental terms and the interface's =

structures and functions expressed in physical terms. This gap has been =

characterized as the "Gulf of Execution", and it may imply significant =

cognitive processing on the users' side in order for them to successfully =

accomplish their goals.
   If user interfaces could understand, at a high-level, our goals, our =

problems, and our social procedures, users could have cognitively =

accessible, dynamic interfaces accommodating their unique needs, beyond =

the range of applications anticipated by the designers.
   For computers to realize such a goal-oriented paradigm,
  * They must have access to information about the world that human users =

take for granted. This information, which forms the basis for =

goal-directed computer interactions, is common sense knowledge.
  * They must provide for algorithms and techniques that are capable of =

acquiring and structuring knowledge about user goals.
  * They must have adequate means to represent knowledge about user goals =

in a way that allows for reasoning and inference about them.
  * They must provide for user interfaces that effectively map users' goals =

on the computer's functionalities and structures.
   This workshop has the goal of bringing together researchers from =

different domains that share an interest in common sense knowledge and =

goal-oriented knowledge representations in the context of intelligent user =

interfaces.


Important Dates:

     Workshop Paper submissions: Sunday, 11 November, 2007, 5pm US EDT =

(2100 UTC)
     Workshop Paper notification: Saturday, 1 December, 2007
     Camera-ready Paper due: Sunday, 9 December, 2007, 5pm US EDT (2100 =

UTC)
     Workshop: Sunday, 13 January, 2008


Paper Submission:

   We encourage submissions from researchers with a variety of backgrounds, =

including common sense reasoning, natural language processing, automatic =

classification, ontology, semantic web, requirements engineering, =

knowledge management and information sciences.

   Topics include, but are not limited to:

   Knowledge Acquisition:
     Mining of common sense knowledge and goals from different corpora
     Algorithms and techniques for collaborative knowledge acquisition
     Methods for knowledge validation
   Knowledge Representation
     Representational theories of commonsense knowledge
     Distributed forms of knowledge representation, such as goal-oriented =

ontologies and metadata
     Goal-oriented modeling languages and frameworks
     Algorithms for goal-centered reasoning and inference
   User Interfaces
     Integrating commonsense knowledge and inference into user interfaces
     Observational and interactive techniques for goal elicitation and =

recognition
     Evaluation of goal-oriented user interfaces
     Goal-oriented software configuration


  We are accepting full papers and demos. Full papers should be between 6 =

and 10 pages. Demo submissions should consist of a brief description (1-4 =

pages) and (a link to) a screencast showing the prototype in action (< 5 =

minutes, formats: mpeg, flash, avi). Please follow the formatting =

guidelines of the main IUI conference, which are detailed here. Send your =

paper submissions in PDF format to: CSKGOI@gmail.com

While there will not be printed proceedings, all papers will be included =

in the Conference CD or USB memory stick. The formatting of Workshop =

papers should therefore follow the IUI format.
