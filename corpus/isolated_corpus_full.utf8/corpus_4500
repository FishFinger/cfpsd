 			 FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

 			    NAACL-HLT 2009

        The 4th Workshop on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building
 		         Educational Applications

 		Boulder, Colorado; June 05, 2009

 		 Submission Deadline: March 06, 2009




WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

The Innovative Use of NLP in Educational Applications workshops have foster=
ed =

interaction and collaboration among researchers in intelligent tutoring sys=
tems =

(ITS) using text and speech, scoring of free-response assessments and =

proofreading tools. This workshop will continue to explore NLP technologies =

with the goal of identifying novel use of NLP techniques and tools for the =

development of educational applications.

We are increasing the scope of this workshop to include the following:

1. A demo session for accepted papers that involve a system.
2. Preliminary planning session for the first shared task of the workshop: =

grammatical error detection of articles and prepositions for 2010.

Full paper and short paper topics will include, but will not be limited to =
the =

following:


1) Automated scoring/evaluation for oral and written student responses
         * Content analysis for scoring/assessment
         * Grammatical error detection and correction
         * Discourse and stylistic analysis
         * Plagiarism detection
         * Machine translation for assessment, instruction and curriculum
           development


2) Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods
         * Dialogue systems in education
         * Hypothesis formation and testing
         * Multi-modal communication between students and computers
         * Generation of tutorial responses
         * Knowledge representation in learning systems
         * Concept visualization in learning systems

3) Learner cognition
         * Assessment of learners' language and cognitive skill levels
         * Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional
         	states
         * Tools for learners with special needs

4) Use of corpora in educational tools
         * Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
         * Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement

5) Tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers
         * NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
         * Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify
           appropriate texts
         * Tools that automatically generate test questions, such as
         	multiple choice or short answer
         * Processing of and access to lecture materials across topics and
         	genres
         * Adaptation of instructional text to individual learners' grade
         	levels
         * assist in text-based curriculum development
         * E-learning tools for personalized course content
         * Language-based educational games

6) Issues involving the shared tasks for the 2010 Workshop: Grammatical err=
or =

detection and correction


7) Issues concerning the evaluation of NLP-based educational tools


8) Descriptions of implemented systems


SUBMISSION INFORMATION
Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, =
PDF =

format (with up to 1 additional page for references). This year, we also in=
vite =

short papers of up to 4 pages (including references).  Papers which describ=
e =

systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like =
to =

present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, make sure to select eit=
her =

"full paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" in the START submission process.

Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be
reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensur=
e =

that papers are anonymous.  Self-references that reveal the author's identi=
ty, =

e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead,=
 use =

citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Please use the 2009 NAACL-HLT style sheet for composing your paper:
http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html

And use the following START conference page to submit your paper:
