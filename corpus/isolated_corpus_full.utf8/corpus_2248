Meeting Description:
Consonant Clusters and Structural Complexity, Munich, July 31st to August 2nd, 2008 

In the fields of phonetics, phonology and psycholinguistics there is currently a
wealth of activity involving the analysis of complex sound sequences. Consonant
clusters, whether occurring within individual lexical items, or emerging in
running speech at word boundaries, give particularly striking evidence for the
temporal complexity of human speech. The main aim of this workshop is to do
justice to this complexity by bringing together researchers from a wide range of
backgrounds, including speech production, speech perception, speech disorders,
language typology, acquisition of first and second language, lexical processing.

Meeting Description

Over the last years, three conferences (Potsdam 1999, Amsterdam 2002, Santiago
de Compostela 2005) presented reflections on grammaticalization, adducing new
evidence - and sometimes counterevidence - for the concept of
grammaticalization. The fourth NRG conference at the University of Leuven
intends to bring together innovating papers that explore the boundaries of the
current grammaticalization research. 

New Reflections on Grammaticalization 4
http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/nrg4/
Leuven, 16-19 July 2008

Third Circular and Call for Papers

Since the 1980s, grammaticalization has held an important place in linguistic
research. Early grammaticalization studies explored morphosyntactic change,
building on Lehmann's ([1982] 1995) seminal study of processes and parameters of
grammaticalization. This type of grammaticalization mainly focuses on the change
of free syntactic units into highly constrained morphemes with a grammatical
function. A more recent tradition, initiated by Traugott (1982) and elaborated,
for example, in Traugott (1989, 1995, 1996), focuses on semantic-pragmatic
change in grammaticalization. Over the last years, three conferences (Potsdam
1999, Amsterdam 2002, Santiago de Compostela 2005) presented reflections on
grammaticalization, adducing new evidence - and sometimes counterevidence - for
the concept of grammaticalization.

The purpose of this fourth NRG conference is to bring together innovating papers
that explore the boundaries of current grammaticalization research. As such, in
addition to contributions on the 'traditional' areas of grammaticalization, we
especially welcome contributions addressing issues in grammaticalization such as:

- Grammaticalization and constructions;
- Grammaticalization and the classification of transitional and gradient
linguistic phenomena;
- Micro-processes of grammaticalization;
- Grammaticalization, idiomaticization and lexicalization;
- Grammaticalization and the structure of discourse;
- Grammaticalization and/versus pragmaticalization and (inter-)subjectification;
- Formal(-semantic) approaches to grammaticalization;
- Accounts of degrammaticalization

We are also looking for contributions that address the relationship between
grammaticalization and analogy. Furthermore, we are seeking contributions that
highlight the importance of such usage-based factors as frequency and
entrenchment for grammaticalization, and that, in general, devote attention to
quantitative data in support of grammaticalization processes. Finally, we
welcome papers on what computer simulations of the evolution/emergence of human
communication can tell us about grammaticalization.

Plenary Speakers

''The fate of obsolete grammatical formations: (de)grammaticalization,
lexicalization, or word formation?''

Muriel Norde (University of Groningen):

Convenors

Bert Cornillie (University of Leuven - FWO-Flanders)
Hubert Cuyckens (University of Leuven)
Kristin Davidse (University of Leuven)
Torsten Leuschner (University of Ghent)
Tanja Mortelmans (University of Antwerp)

Scientific Committee

Johan van der Auwera (Antwerp), Walter De Mulder (Antwerp), Gabriele Diewald
(Hanover), Teresa Fanego (Santiago de Compostela), Bernd Heine (Koln), Brian
Joseph (Ohio State, Columbus), BÃ©atrice Lamiroy (Leuven), MarÃ­a JosÃ© Couso

Schwenter (Ohio State, Columbus), Elena Seoane (Santiago de Compostela),
Anne-Marie Simon-Vandenbergen (Ghent), Elizabeth Traugott (Stanford), Ilse
Wischer (Potsdam).

Call for Papers

Papers are invited on all aspects of grammaticalization within the framework
outlined above. Presentations will be 20 minutes with 10 minutes question time.

We particularly welcome proposals for workshops, which should contain (i) an
outline of the theme and (ii) a provisional list of workshop participants and
their topics (see also below).

Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should state
research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results. Abstracts
will be reviewed anonymously.

The deadline for the submission of workshop proposals is 1 December 2007. The
deadline for all abstracts (both for the general session and workshops) is 15
December 2007. Notification of acceptance will be given by 30 January 2008.

Submit your title through the conference website link Submit Abstract  and email
your abstract as an attachment to nrg4@arts.kuleuven.be. The attachments should
have a cover page mentioning the name(s) of the presenters and the title of the
abstract; the abstract itself should not mention the presenter(s). Abstracts are
preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your abstract contains special symbols,
please include a .pdf version as well.

Workshops

Since we would like all conference participants to be able to attend individual
workshop presentations, NRG4 workshops have to be compatible with the main
conference programme. This means that the format of the workshops must be
organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). Each
workshop should comprise:
1. An introductory paper by the convenor(s). It should summarize previous
research, specify the approaches to be found in the workshop and explain the
scope of the papers to be given.
2. Up to 7 papers. The preference is for one-day workshops, but other schedules
may also be considered.
3. Final discussion on topics covered by the papers, methodological issues and
questions for future research.
More detailed information and instructions to all the participants will be
provided in due course by the convenors of the workshops.


Registration

Registration will be open from February 1. Registration fees are anticipated to
be the following:

Early registration fee (until 31 March 2008)
Regular: 200     
Students (without salary): 100                                             

Fee after 1 April 2008
Regular: 230
Students (without salary): 130

The registration fee includes the conference materials, coffee/tea, lunch during
the conference days, a conference reception and a guided tour.


Publication of Papers

It is the organizers' intention to publish a selection of the conference papers
in the series Typological Studies in Language (Amsterdam / Philadelphia: John
Benjamins).

Social Programme

There will be a reception (included in the registration fee) and a conference
dinner (45 for a three-course dinner including wine, water, coffee/tea, and an
aperitif). Two alternative post-conference excursions, one to Ghent and Antwerp,
one to Namur and Dinant, are scheduled for Sunday 20 July. More information will
follow by 1 February.

Transport

Brussels National Airport is located a short distance between Leuven and
Brussels. Travelling to and from the airport is easy.

There is a direct train link from Leuven to the airport and from the airport to
Leuven; alternatively, you can take the Airport City Express to Brussels and
change trains to Leuven. Schedules for these lines, as well as for train service
throughout the whole of Belgium (and international trains), are available on the
Belgian National Railways (SNCB/NMBS) website; enter Brussels Airport as the
departure or destination station.

The airport of Charleroi (also, somewhat misleadingly, called Brussels South
Airport) is served by Ryan Air, and is about two hours from Leuven by public
transport.

Important Dates

1 December 2007: submission of workshop proposals
15 December 2007: submission of abstracts
30 January 2008: notification of acceptance
1 February 2008: early registration starts
1 April 2008: registration (full fee)
