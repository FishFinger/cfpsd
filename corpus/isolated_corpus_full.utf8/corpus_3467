2nd CALL FOR PAPERS: KARE 2008
----------------------------------------------------------

First International Workshop on Knowledge Acquisition, Reuse and Evaluation
(KARE2008)
http://set.utbm.fr/index.php?pge=395&lang=fr

In conjunction with the fourth IEEE international conference on Signal-Image
Technology & Internet Based Systems (SITIS 2008)
http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/SITIS/08/

Nov 30 - Dec 3rd 2008, Bali, Indonesia

++ Deadline for submission: Sept 15, 2008 ++
++ Full papers and position papers invited ++

===================================================================

Description
------------
In recent years, organisations have used multiple methods and approaches to
design their strategic and action plans. In this context, knowledge-based
systems have received increased attention as being instrumental to strategy
formulation. The synergy of these approaches with knowledge management
initiatives is intuitive and their use in a common framework is discussed in
this workshop to show the importance of methods and instruments to mapping and
assessing the knowledge assets of an organisation.

This workshop will focus on the theoreticians and practitioners concerned with
developing methods and systems that assist the knowledge management process and
assessing the suitability of such methods. Thus, the workshop includes all
aspects of acquiring, modeling and managing knowledge, and their role in the
construction of knowledge-based systems. Knowledge acquisition still remains
the bottleneck for building a knowledge based system. Reuse and sharing of
knowledge bases are major issues and no satisfactory solutions have been agreed
upon yet. There is a wide range of research. Much of the work in this field has
been knowledge acquisition. The advent of the age of digital information has
brought the problem of knowledge reuse and knowledge evaluation. Our ability to
analyze, evaluate and assist user in reusing knowledge present a great challenge
of the next years. A new generation of computational techniques and tools is
required to support the acquisition, the reuse and the evaluation of useful
knowledge from the rapidly growing volume of information. All of these are to
be discussed in this workshop.

All papers will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members on the
basis of technical quality, originality, clarity, and relevance to the track
topics listed below. Accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings. At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop to
present the paper.
