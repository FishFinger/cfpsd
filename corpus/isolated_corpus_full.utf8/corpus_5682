Meeting Description:

Positional Phenomena in Phonology and Phonetics

(Organised by Zentrum f=FCr Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, Berlin)

Date: 13 April 2010
Organisers: Marzena Zygis, Stefanie Jannedy, Susanne Fuchs

Invited Speakers:

Taehong Cho (Hanyang University, Seoul) confirmed

Paul de Luce (University at Buffalo; New York) requested
Venue: Instytut Filologii Angielskiej, ul. Kuznicza 22, 50-138 Wroclaw

Positional effects found cross-linguistically at the edges of prosodic
constituents (e.g. final lengthening, final lowering, strengthening effects=
, or
final devoicing) have increasingly received attention in phonetic-phonologi=
cal
research. Recent empirical investigations of such positional effects and th=
eir
variability pose, however, a great number of questions challenging e.g. the=
 idea
of perceptual invariance. It has been claimed that acoustic variability is =
a
necessary prerequisite for the perceptual system to parse segmental strings=
 into
words, phrases or larger prosodic units.

This workshop will provide a forum for discussing controversies and recent
developments regarding positional phenomena. We invite abstracts bearing on
positional effects from various perspectives.The following questions can be
addressed, but are not limited to:

What kind of variability is found in the data, and how does such variabilit=
y
need to be accounted for?=20
What positional effects are common cross-linguistically and how can they be
attributed to perceptual, articulatory or aerodynamic principles?
How does positional prominence (lexical stress; accent) interact with acous=
tic
and articulatory realizations of prosodic boundaries?
What are the positional (a)symmetries in the realizations of boundaries, an=
d
what are the=20
mechanisms underlying them?
How does left- and right-edge phrasal marking interact with the acoustic an=
d
articulatory realizations at these prosodic boundaries?=20
How are these interpreted in phonetics and in phonology?
What are the necessary prerequisites for the interpretation of prosodic
constituents? Which auditory cues are essential for the perception of bound=
aries
and positional effects? Are such cues language-specific?
To what extent do lexical frequency, phonotactic probability, and neighbour=
hood
density contribute to the production and recognition of prosodic boundaries=
 in
(fluent/spontaneous) speech?
How are positional characteristics exploited during the process of language
acquisition? How are they learned during the process of language acquisitio=
n?=20
Are positional effects salient enough for L2 learners?=20

Call for Papers:

Abstracts are invited for a 20-min. presentation (excluding discussion).
Abstracts should be sent in two copies:=20

one with a name and one without as attached files (the name(s) should also =
be
clearly mentioned in the e-mail) to: zygis@zas.gwz-berlin.de in .pdf format=
.
Only electronic submissions will be considered. Abstracts may not exceed tw=
o
pages of text with at least a one-inch margin on all four sides (measured o=
n A4
paper) and must employ a font not smaller than 12 point. Each page may incl=
ude a
maximum of 50 lines of text. An additional page with references may be incl=
uded.
