Call for Papers

We hereby invite you to submit papers to the first issue of Arena Romanistica.

Established late 2005, Arena Romanistica aims to be a refereed and
regularly published journal focusing on the current research in the Romance
languages, notably French, Spanish and Italian. Its main areas of focus are
linguistic, literary and cultural studies. The journal is affiliated with
the Department of Romance Studies, University of Bergen, Norway.

The papers submitted should reflect upon current research in the field of
corpus and text linguistics in Romance languages.

The tools of corpus linguistics represent a growing field in linguistics.
Not only do they offer insights of the current state of the Romance
languages but also valuable methodological and theoretical advances for
linguistics in general.

Papers should preferably be written in French although we will consider
Spanish and English submissions.
