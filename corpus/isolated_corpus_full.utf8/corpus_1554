Speech and Body in Interaction: Ethnographic Case Studies
International Workshop, Institut für Ethnologie, Freie Universität Berlin,
October 12-13, 2007

Social action and communication are the loci where society is created and
enacted. Within the last years more and more anthropologists have become aware
of the importance of studying social interaction for understanding social and
cultural processes. Rather than addressing social interaction and communication
in a Geertzian sense as ''cultural texts'', students of social interaction
highlighted the ''materiality of communication''. In their detailed studies,
social interaction emerges as an intricate, context dependent and orchestrated
interplay between dialogical selves deploying all kinds of semiotic resources
like speech, prosody, gesture, facial expression, gaze, posture, and body
movements. The basis of comparative data for all these phenomena is scarce and,
at the same time, the theoretical interests of researchers working in this field
are extremely diverse including such questions as:

- How are particular forms of these semiotic resources categorized, evaluated
and used (or proscribed) by social actors in specific settings?
- How are the access to and the use of these means intertwined with power relations?
- How, then, is social structure reflected in the interactional use of semiotic
resources?
- On the other hand, how is social structure also modified or, at times, even
created by these means?
- Can universal forms and patterns in the isolated or orchestrated use of these
resources be discerned?
- How can cultural variations be possibly explained?
- How can the use of these semiotic resources be properly recorded and the data
be efficiently analysed?

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who study social
interaction in Non-European settings. We invite them to present their data in
order to create a broader data basis for all these questions.

30-35 min each paper
