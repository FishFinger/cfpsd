(http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~nlg2000/). Prior to 2000, INLGs were International
Workshops, running every other year since 1984. INLG provides a forum for the
discussion, dissemination and archiving of research topics and results in the
field of text generation. 

INLG 2008 will be held this year immediately prior to ACL:HLT 2008 (June 15-20),
in Salt Fork, OH (about 2 hours from Columbus, OH, the site of ACL:HLT 2008). In
addition to the INLG conference, there will be a special session for the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008). 

3rd and Final Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: Friday, March 21, 2008 at 11:59 PM EDT (GMT-4)

INLG is the Biennial Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural
Language Generation (SIGGEN). It has been previously held in Sydney, Australia
in 2006, at Brockenhurst, UK in 2004, in Harriman, NY, USA in 2002, and in
Mitzpe Ramon, Israel in 2000. Prior to 2000, INLGs were International Workshops,
running every other year since 1984. As the leading international conference on
research into natural language generation, INLG provides a forum for the
discussion, dissemination and archiving of research topics and results in the field.

Invited Speakers:
Kiwako Ito and Shari Speer, The Ohio State University, USA
Matthew Stone, Rutgers, USA

INLG invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics
related to natural language generation. Active topics of interest include:

- Affect/emotion generation
- Architecture of generators
- Content planning
- Discourse models
- Embodied generation
- Evaluation of NLG systems
- Generation and summarization
- Lexicalization
- Multilingual NLG
- Multimedia or multimodal generation
- NLG for real-world applications
- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks

Submission Information

Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2008 must not have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Submission
to other conferences should be clearly indicated on the paper.

Category of Papers: The conference will be organized as a 2.5 day workshop,
including sessions to present long papers, a special session for discussing the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008), and a poster
session for short papers and REG Challenge results.

Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time:
- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research results
and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references;
- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort
and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these will be
presented as posters during the poster session).

Paper Submission: Submissions should be uploaded to the EasyChair web site for
the conference (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inlg08). The only
accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the
two-column format of ACL proceedings. Use of the ACL 2007 style files is
strongly recommended.

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors within the
paper. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Note that in extreme cases, an author unable to comply with the above submission
procedure should contact the program chairs sufficiently before the submission
deadline so alternative arrangements can be made.

Important Dates:
Mar 21, 2008: Submission of papers and posters
Apr 25, 2008: Notification of acceptance
May 16, 2008: Submission of camera-ready copy
Jun 12-14, 2008: INLG 2008 in Salt Fork, OH

Special Session on Referring Expression Generation Challenge 2008

The second Referring Expression Generation Challenge will involve two different
data sets: the TUNA Corpus (with previously unseen test data), and the GREC
Corpus of references to named entities in free text. The Challenge will have
eight submission tracks, including attribute selection, realisation and named
entity generation tasks, as well as open category and evaluation methods tracks.
Assessment criteria will range from automatically computed metrics to human
evaluation. For the TUNA tasks the criteria will include minimality,
humanlikeness, and identification/comprehension by human readers; those for the
GREC task will include humanlikeness and the DUC criteria of coherence and
referential clarity. Subject to feasibility, system processing efficiency is
another possible criterion.

Full details on the challenge can be found on the REG Challenge 2008 website. A
separate call for participation will be issued by the challenge organizers, Anja
Belz and Albert Gatt (gre-stec [at] itri.brighton.ac.uk).

Meeting Description:

CAFFEi-2008

Workshop on Computational aspects of affectual and emotional interaction
21-22 July 2008, Patras, Greece
http://caffei.iit.demokritos.gr/

The workshop is organized as part of the 18th European Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2008) and will be held in July 2008,
in Patras, Greece. 

Second Call for Papers

Deadline: 10 April 2008

Description and Topic:
A key enabling technology for next-generation artificial intelligence agents for
the service, domestic and entertainment market is natural human-computer
interaction. An AI agent that collaborates with humans on a daily basis requires
interactive skills that go beyond present-day language technology: seamless and
natural interaction requires that the AI agent is able to correctly interpret
(and to some extend also generate) linguistic signals that involve the emotional
state of the person they interact with, to behave differently in different
emotional contexts, to exhibit a different personality in order to co-operate
well with humans having different personalities, and to correctly interpret
humour or irony.

CAFFEi aims to bring together researchers working on the computational modelling
of emotions and affect, and especially their linguistic realization, for the
purposes of affectual human-computer interaction.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- affect and emotion recognition and generation, and particularly linguistic
aspects thereof in text and speech;
- personality trait modelling, and impact of computer personality traits and
affect analysis on natural language generation and dialogue management;
- evaluation of emotional impact of automatically generated text;
- evaluation methods for emotion-sensitive parsing, generation, and dialogue
management;
- emotion text classification and affect text classification, used to evaluate
or analyse human-computer or human-human interaction;
- generating and recognizing humour and irony;
- non-linguistic aspects of human-computer interaction, such as facial, gesture,
and posture recognition, audio signal processing, avatars and virtual faces,
etc., especially when used in conjunction to linguistic interaction modalities.

Invited Speaker:
Prof. Dr. Elisabeth Andre, University of Augsburg, will deliver a talk during
the workshop.

Important Dates:
Apr 10: paper submission
May 10: notification
May 26: camera-ready copy and author registration
July 21 or 22: workshop date.

Participation and Paper Submission:
The language of the conference will be English and we invite research
papers, work-in-progress papers, and position papers. All submissions
will be reviewed by an international programme committee.

Workshop proceedings will be prepared in paper and on CD-ROM. Each
participant will receive a hardcopy of CAFFEi proceedings, as well as a CD with
the proceedings of all ECAI'08 workshops. Workshop authors will maintain the
copyrights of their papers, but will be required to sign a form allowing
inclusion in the proceedings. The possibility of a journal special issue will be
discussed during the workshop.

Submissions should follow the style described in the ECAI-08 guidelines and be
up to 10 pages in length, including title, author names, abstract, body, and
references. Please use PDF as file format. Latex styles files implementing
ECAI guidelines can be found here:
http://www.ece.upatras.gr/ecai2008/documents/ecai2008.zip

Submissions should be made by email to caffei-submissions@iit.demokritos.gr
with the submission PDF attached. In case of unusually large files or need for
any other clarifications, please email at the same address.

Registration:
Workshop attendants are required to register to the main conference and to the
workshop. At least one author of each accepted workshop paper is required to
register by the camera-ready submission deadline. Registration will be done
through the ECAI-08 registration site,
http://www.ece.upatras.gr/ecai2008/registration.htm

CAFFEi authors will be able to register at early-registration dates, regardless
of the early-registration set for ECAI participants in general.
