Meeting Description:

DCM 2009 is the fifth in a series of international workshops focusing on new
computational models. It aims to bring together researchers who are currently
developing new computational models or new features of a traditional one, to
foster interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in
progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area.

DCM 2009 will be a one-day satellite event of ICALP 2009, with a special focus
on the theme 'Computational Models From Nature'.

Plenary Speakers:

Prakash Panangaden (McGill University) 'Computing with Anyons'
Amin Coja-Oghlan (Edinburgh) 'Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems'
Damien Woods (Seville) 'Two Notions of Uniformity in Natural Computing'

Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their
properties, and their applications to the development of programming languages
and systems:

- Quantum computation, including implementations and formal methods in quantum
protocols
- Probabilistic computation and verification in modeling situations;
- Chemical, biological and bio-inspired computation, including spatial models,
self-assembly, growth models
- General concurrent models including the treatment of mobility, trust, and security
- Information-theoretic ideas in computing
