SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS


COLING 2008 Workshop TextGraphs-3: Graph-based Algorithms for  Natural
Language Processing
Manchester, UK, August 24, 2008
http://lit.csci.unt.edu/~textgraphs/ws08/<http://lit.csci.unt.edu/%7Etextgraphs/ws08/>

This workshop is part of The 22nd International Conference on
Computational Linguistics (COLING 2008)

Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of graph
theory into natural language processing. Traditionally, these two areas of
study have been perceived as distinct, with different algorithms, different
applications, and different potential end-users. However, as recent research
work has shown, these two disciplines are in fact intimately connected, with
a large variety of natural language processing applications finding
efficient solutions within graph-theoretical frameworks.

In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a
graph and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent
research has shown that graph-based representations of linguistic units as
diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel and efficient
solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging,
word sense disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic
role assignment, summarisation, sentiment analysis and up to the study of
the evolutionary dynamics of language.

The Textgraphs workshop addresses a broad spectrum of research areas and
brings together researchers working on problems related to the use of
graph-based algorithms for natural language processing as well as on the
theory of graph-based methods. We are interested in looking at graph-based
methods from the perspective of diverse applications to facilitate a
discussion about the theory of graph-based methods and about the theoretical
justification of the empirical results within the NLP community.

Starting with Textgraphs-3 we would like to have one area of graph-based NLP
research as the primary topic for discussion. This year's focus is on large
scale lexical acquisition and representation. Efficient graph methods can
help to alleviate the acquisition bottleneck for lexicon construction and
resource building. They also provide smarter representation schemes for the
lexicon that facilitate fast search and word retrieval. SIGLEX endorsed our
workshop proposal for COLING-08.

We invite submissions of papers on graph-based methods applied to NLP
problems. Especially, we encourage submissions regarding

*Large-scale lexical acquisition using graph representations
*Graph-based representation schemes of the mental lexicon

Other topics include, but are not limited to:

*Graph representations for ontology learning
*Graph labeling and edge labeling for semantic representations
*Encoding semantic distances in graphs
*Graph algorithms for word sense disambiguation
*Graph methods for Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Text
Mining and Understanding
*Random walk graph methods
*Spectral graph clustering
*Small world graphs in natural language processing
*Semi-supervised graph-based methods
*Statistical network methods and analysis
*Dynamic graph representations for NLP
