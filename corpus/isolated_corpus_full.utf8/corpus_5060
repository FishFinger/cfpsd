 Workshop on Grammar Engineering Across Frameworks - GEAF 2009

     on August 6 at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference, Singapore

     http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF09/


Workshop Topics

  This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from
different frameworks to compare research and methodologies,
particularly around the themes of evaluation, modularity,
maintainability, relevance to theoretical and computational
linguistics, and applications of "deep" grammars to real-world domains
and NLP tasks.

  Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources
to support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in
real-world domains and applications. The demands of these types of
tasks have resulted in significant advances in areas such as parser
efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic approaches to disambiguation,
and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The effective
acquisition, development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a
central issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of
realistic grammars makes these tasks extremely challenging; indeed,
these tasks are often tackled in ways that have much in common with
software engineering. This workshop aims to bring together grammar
engineers from different frameworks --- for example LFG, HPSG, TAG,
CCG, dependency grammar --- to compare their research and
methodologies.

The workshop will solicit submissions for papers on the following themes:

1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and
metrics which can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic
analysis; evaluation techniques which can compare grammars across
varieties/languages;

2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure
can most easily be separated out from each other, why and how the
analyses of separate linguistic phenomena are
interconnected/interdependent, and the role of frameworks in promoting
or inhibiting modularity;

3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and
multi-developer maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations
of maintainability on choices of linguistic analysis;

4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections
on how to present grammar engineering work to other research
communities;

5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies
and techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in
day-to-day progress on grammars.

6. Multilingualism: Approaches, techniques and tools improving
development and maintainability of grammars for multiple system
languages.
