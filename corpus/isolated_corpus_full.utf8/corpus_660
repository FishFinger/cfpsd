Meeting Description:

Precedence Relationships in Phonological Grammar

The CUNY Phonology Forum presents a conference focused on 
investigating all aspects of precedence (temporal or sequential) relationships 
in phonology. The conference will bring together subdivisions of cognitive 
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, 
philosophy, psychology, etc. to create a broad survey of the issues, 
successes and approaches in understanding the nature of precedence in 
phonology. (We use the terms "precedence," "temporal" and "sequential" 
interchangeably below to keep the area of interest broad.)

Invited Speakers: (This is a preliminary list)
        
-Elizabeth Hume, Ohio State University
-William Idsardi, University of Maryland
-Charles Reiss, Concordia University

Important Dates and Information:

November 10, 2006: deadline for submission of abstracts
December 1, 2006: notification of acceptance
January 25/26, 2007: Precedence relationships in phonological grammar

Organizers: Chuck Cairns, CUNY, and Eric Raimy University of Wisconsin 

The CUNY Phonology Forum invites 20 minute papers on any aspect of 
precedence (temporal or sequential) relationships in phonology for a 
conference to be held at the City University of New York, Jan 25/26, 2007. 
We invite papers from any subdivision of cognitive science such as formal 
linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, philosophy, psychology, 
etc. Scholars with ideas broadly within the penumbra of the suggested 
topics listed below are heartily encouraged to make a submission. (We use 
the terms ''precedence'' ''temporal'' and ''sequential'' interchangeably below 
to keep the area of interest broad.)

-  What is unique to temporal (or sequential) representation in  
   phonology? What is derivable from general cognitive functions?

-  Does temporal representation change over the course of language  
   acquisition (e.g. from syllable representations to segment
   representations)?

-  Where are temporal relations encoded in the phonology? On each
   featural tier?  Strictly on the X-tier? Or are they all derivable from
   syllabic or other prosodic structure?

-  What do 'non-concatenative morphology' (e.g. reduplication, 
   infixation, root and template morphology) and ludlings tell us about
   the existence and manipulation of ordering relationships in phonology?

-  Do progressive and regressive operations (either local or long
   distance) in phonology yield insights into sequential order of 
   phonological segments?

-  How can sequential information be manipulated and/or referred to in
   phonology? E.g., what are the underlying formal mechanisms involved in
   metathesis, linearity, contiguity, etc.?

-  How does the phonological representation of ordering information get
   translated into phonetic information?

Abstracts should consist of a one page description of the paper (12pt font) 
with a second page for references, data and/or illustrations. Abstracts 
should be emailed as an attachment (PDF format) to 
ccairns@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, November 10, 
2006. The subject line should be ''precedence conference.'' Authors should 
include title of the paper, name of the author(s) and affiliation in the body of 
the email.
