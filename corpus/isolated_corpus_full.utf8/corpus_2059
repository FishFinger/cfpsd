Call for Papers Announcement

I. General
The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts of
between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of humanities computing and the
digital humanities, broadly defined to encompass the common ground between
information technology and issues in humanities research and teaching. As
always, we welcome submissions in any area of the humanities, particularly
interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage submissions on the current
state of the art in humanities computing and the digital humanities, and on
recent and expected future developments in the field.

Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,

- text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing, language
learning
- creation, delivery and management of humanities digital resources
- collaboration between libraries and scholars in the creation, delivery,
and management of humanities digital resources
- computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of
literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including
interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship
- use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music, film,
theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural heritage
- research issues such as: information design and modelling; the cultural
impact of the new media
- the role of digital humanities in academic curricula

Proposals should report significant and substantive results and will
include reference to pertinent work in the field (up to 10 items) as part
of their critical assessment.

The range of topics covered by humanities computing can also be consulted
in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic Computing
(LLC), Oxford University Press.

The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the
Programme Committee is November 18, 2007 (midnight Universal Time). All
submissions will be refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance by
February by 13, 2008.

The electronic submission form will be available at the conference site
from October 15th, 2007. See below for full details on submitting proposals.

Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local
conference organizer as soon as possible.

For more information on the conference in general please visit the
conference web site, at http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/.

II. Types of Proposals
Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1) papers,
(2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations (poster/demos), and
(3) sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of submission
must be specified in the proposal.

Proposals to the Programme Committee may be presented in English and any of
the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian,
Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Conference presentations may be in these
languages as well, and the Programme Committee encourages presenters to
consider multilingual presentations (for example, a presentation in one
language with accompanying slides or handouts accommodating speakers of
another language).

1) Papers
Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:
either completed research which has given rise to substantial results, or
the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous theoretical,
speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers will be allocated 20
minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches to
the problem and should include some critical assessment of the computing
methodologies used. All proposals should include conclusions and references
to important sources. Those describing the creation or use of digital
resources should follow these guidelines as far as possible.

2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations (Poster/Demos)
Poster presentations may include computer technology and project
demonstrations. The term poster/demo refers to the different possible
combinations of printed and computer based presentations. The poster/demo
sessions build on the recent trend of showcasing some of the most important
and innovative work being done in humanities computing. By definition,
poster presentations and project demonstrations are less formal and more
interactive than a standard talk. They provide the opportunity to exchange
ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss their work in detail with
those most deeply interested in the same topic. Presenters will be provided
with about two square meters of board space to display their work. They may
also provide handouts with examples or more detailed information.
Poster/demos will remain on display throughout the conference, but there
will also be a separate conference session dedicated to them, when
presenters should be prepared to explain their work and answer questions.
Additional times may also be assigned for software or project demonstrations.

There should be no difference in quality between poster/demo presentations
and papers, and the format for proposals is the same for both. The same
academic standards should apply in both cases, but posters/demos may be a
more suitable way of presenting late-breaking results, or significant work
in progress, including pedagogical applications. Both will be submitted to
the same refereeing process. The choice between the two modes of
presentation (poster/demo or paper) should depend on the most effective and
informative way of communicating the scientific content of the proposal.

As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters and
demonstrations to the conference, the Programme Committee will award a
prize for the best poster.

3) Sessions
Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:
Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for each
paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in the session;
Or
A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each
speaker is willing to participate in the session.

The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for papers,
i.e. November 18, 2007.

III. Format of the Proposals
All proposals must be submitted electronically using the on-line submission
form, which will be available from October 15th, 2007 at:
https://secure.digitalhumanities.org/conftool/

Those who registered as authors, reviewers or participants at the DH2007
conference are kindly asked to log on to their existing account (the one
used for the DH2007 conference) rather than making up a new account.

IV. Bursaries for Young Scholars
A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made available to
those presenting at the conference. If you wish to be considered for a
bursary, please refer to information about the bursary schemes available
from the Association for Computing in the Humanities
(http://www.ach.org/ach_bursary/) and the Association for Literary and
Linguistic Computing (http://www.allc.org/awards/bursary.htm).

Applications may be made to either the ACH or the ALLC, but not both
organizations.
