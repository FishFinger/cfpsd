Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

11th Diachronic Generative Syntax Conference 

Second Call for Papers

Although all the topics on formal historical syntax are welcome, the 11th
edition of DiGS encourages papers that approach topics related to the
understanding and modeling of how (morpho) syntax change comes about in
languages, or groups of languages, including but not restricted to: 
- parameter theory, 
- the role of language acquisition and contact on language change, 
- the dynamics of syntactic change
- grammaticalization,
- language reconstruction.

Confirmed Plenary Speakers:
Ana Maria Martins (University of Lisbon)
Giuseppe Longobardi (University of Trieste)
Ian Roberts (University of Oxford)
Jürgen Meisel (University of Hamburg / University of Calgary)
Mary Aizawa Kato (University of Campinas)

We invite abstracts for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute
discussion period.

Abstracts should be anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references
and examples, with margins of at least 1 inch, Times New Roman 12,
single-spaced. Submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one
joint abstract per author.

Authors are requested to send an e-mail message to digs11@iel.unicamp.br, with
two copies of their abstract attached (in pdf format); one of them anonymous.

Please include the title of the paper, the author's name, affiliation and e-mail
address in the body of the submission email. Subject should be "submission".

The deadline for submission is Saturday, January 31, 2009.
Notification of acceptance will be made by March 15, 2009.

Posters:
There will also be a poster session, for which we invite papers of an
empirically-driven nature or in a squib-like format when dealing with
theoretical issues.

The same guidelines for submission apply.
 
Please, indicate clearly in your submission email whether your abstract should
be considered for presentation or for the poster session.

Call for Papers

Workshop Topics
This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes of
evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and applications of "deep" grammars to real-world
domains and NLP tasks.

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to support
robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world domains and
applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in significant
advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic
approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The
effective acquisition, development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a
central issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars
makes these tasks extremely challenging; indeed, these tasks are often tackled
in ways that have much in common with software engineering. This workshop aims
to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks --- for example
LFG, HPSG, TAG, CCG, dependency grammar --- to compare their research and
methodologies. 

The workshop will solicit submissions for papers on the following themes:

1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages;

2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks in promoting or inhibiting modularity;

3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multi-developer
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis;

4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on how to
present grammar engineering work to other research communities;

5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars.

6. Multilingualism: Approaches, techniques and tools improving development and
maintainability of grammars for multiple system languages.
