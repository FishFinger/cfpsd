paper submission deadline will not be postponed by any significant 
amount of time.

The paper preparation guidelines can be found on the conference
website. They stipulate that authors may submit multimedia files 
to illustrate their contribution. These multimedia files will 
have to be incorporated in one ZIP archive.

The conference will host several Special Sessions (see conference 
website). If authors want their paper to be considered for one 
of these Sessions, they can specify that during paper submission. 
Irrespective of this specification, all papers will follow the same 
electronic review procedure.

Authors will have to declare that their contribution is original 
and not being submitted for publication elsewhere (e.g., another 
conference, workshop, or journal).

Each corresponding author will be notified by e-mail of the acceptance 
or rejection of his paper by May 25, 2007. Minor updates of accepted
