Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2008 


Meeting Description

The workshop is intended to bring together researchers from a variety of fields
concerned with LRs in a wider sense (language documentation, localization,
computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, literary computing) and invite
them to report and critically reflect upon their experiences with employing
existing standards. We thus expect to gain new insights on the uses, usage and
usefulness of standards for a variety of tasks as well as possible needs for
elaboration and expansion (e.g., best practices, interaction with non-language
data standards). The workshop will thus focus on experiences with standards
as well as tools to enhance the use of standards.

Pre LREC-2008 Workshop: 
Uses and Usage of Language Resource-Related Standards
Marrakech, Morocco 
Tuesday, 27 May 2008

In recent years more and more standards related to the representation and
processing of language resources (LRs) have been issued by different
organizations (e.g., ISO, Oasis, LISA, W3C, TEI etc.). While some of these have
been designed explicitly for the purpose of modeling language (e.g., LAF, OLAC,
IMDI, etc), other standards in use in the community are originally geared to the
representation of properties of texts (e.g., TEI). Still others have been
defined with broader, not inherently language or text-related purposes in mind.
Apart from standards for representation and linguistic description, recently
standards for resource management are also emerging.

The formal standardisation process is only one aspect of the evolution of a
standard. The application and the real use seem to be even more important. A
standard is useful for the community only if it is actually applied. The
workshop will concentrate on standards which are in use, experiences with
standards as well as tools to enhance the use of standards. In particular we
will encourage contributions in the following areas:

(a) experiences with different types of standards:

- research contexts inviting/impeding the use of standards
- standards and exploitation of LRs
- use of language vs. text encoding standards
- use of standards for representation vs. linguistic description
- standards for different types of LRs (corpora, archives, dictionaries, spoken
vs. written language etc)
- standards used in the localization process
- competing standards (comparison of competing standards, motivations for
preferring one standard over another)

(b) use of standards from different vantage points:

- data providers (support for standards, e.g., data category registry)
- data users (e.g., standards supporting resource exploitation)
- tool developers (e.g., corpus annotation tools supporting standards, standards
aware localization tools)

(c) new horizons in standardization

- standardization for resource management (e.g., resource validation) and best
practices
- efforts to make language resource-related standards communicate with each
other (e.g., mappings, upper structures)
- interaction of language resource-related standards with non-language data
standards
- special requirements for multilingual resources
- special requirements for multimodal resources
- methodologies for the evaluation of standards
