			   Call For Papers

			      TIME 2008

		 Fifteenth International Symposium on
		Temporal Representation and Reasoning

		  Montreal, Canada, June 16-18, 2008

		       http://www.time2008.org

TIME 2008 aims to bring together researchers from distinct research
areas involving the management of temporal data as well as the
reasoning about temporal aspects of information.

This unique and well-established event further has as its objectives
to bridge theoretical and applied research, as well as to serve as an
interdisciplinary forum for exchange among researchers from the areas
of artificial intelligence, database management, logic and
verification, and beyond.

TIME 2008 encompasses three tracks, but has a single program
committee. The conference will span three days, and will be organized
as a combination of technical paper presentations, poster sessions,
and keynote lectures.

			  KEYNOTE LECTURERS


o Carsten Lutz Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, TU Dresden,
   Germany

o Ravi Kothuri, Oracle Corporation, Nashua, NH, USA

o James Worrell, Computing Laboratory, Oxford University, GB

			   PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions of high quality papers describing research results or
on-going work are solicited. Submitted papers should contain original,
previously unpublished content, should be written in English, and must
not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submitted papers will be refereed by at least three reviewers for
quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Accepted papers will
be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, which
will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Acceptance of a
paper is contingent on one author presenting the paper at the
symposium.

Submissions should be in PDF format (with the necessary fonts
embedded) and should use the format for camera-ready papers.
Submissions must not exceed 8 pages in using that format; over-length
submissions may be rejected without review.

Papers should be submitted electronically using the online system
available via the TIME 2008 web site, at
