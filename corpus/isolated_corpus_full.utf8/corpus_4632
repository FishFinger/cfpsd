CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
_______________________________________________

3rd STI Roadmapping Workshop
"Charting the next generation of semantic technology"
Monday, June 1st 2009 co-located with ESWC 2009
_______________________________________________

*DESCRIPTION*
In the last 15 years the World Wide Web has radically changed how our
society communicates, connects, does business, shares information and
performs tasks. It can be expected that another paradigm shift will be seen
over the next 15 years, in which many terms are already part of the vision:
cloud, utility, services, mobile, ubiquitous, virtual worlds etc. In the
semantic technologies community there is the expectation that semantics are
on the cusp of maturity and wider uptake, and a large body of research work
demonstrates their relevance to all of the aforementioned areas.
How will the semantic landscape look like in 15 years from now? What path
will be taken to get there? This workshop solicits submissions from
visionaries in the semantic research community as well as early adopter
industry, addressing the question of what role semantic technologies will
play in the next developments of the Web.
Our aim is to bring together experts to chart together the requirements on
research and necessary steps in education and technology transfer that exist
to ensure semantics will achieve their full potential for society and
industry over the next 15 years. In the workshop, visions can be shared and
discussed, and actions identified which will result in, after the workshop,
an expert roadmap for semantic technologies. This roadmap is expected to
form a significant input to future efforts around semantic technology.


*BACKGROUND*
This workshop is an action of the Roadmapping Service of STI International.
The Roadmapping Service exists to initiate and coordinate the specification
of research roadmaps for the future research and development of semantic
technologies. The aim is to provide an integrated plan for future research
and development activities, which then serves as the basis for coordinating
cross-project activities as well as for standardization work ensuring
sustainability and global impact.
The results of the previous workshop event, looking at semantics through to
2019, can be found here:
http://roadmap.sti2.org/wiki


*FORMAT*
We expect an one day workshop consisting of:
- An invited talk from a semantic technologies visionary
- Presentations of submissions, including sufficient time for discussion.
Where possible, presentations will be split into sessions grouped around
specific Web developments (cloud, services, ubiquity, virtual worlds etc.)
- "Stand-up" session for all other submittees/attendees of a short 2-3 slide
presentation of an idea or vision. These are not refereed.
- Interactive session charting the next 15 years of semantic technology
(group activity)


Accepted submissions will be published in a workshop proceedings as well as
acknowledged in the STI roadmap document and all other publications derived
from it.


*CALL FOR SUBMISSION*
Submissions are welcomed from any member of the research or professional
community. They should take the form of a position paper, giving grounded
reasons for a particular vision of semantic technology use in our future
society and identifying research challenges that must be met, educational
needs that must be covered and technology transfer that must take place
before this vision can become reality. Position papers should be no more
than 5 pages LNCS format and be submitted in PDF format.
Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop in short
presentations with sufficient time for questions. All attendees are invited
to give a 2-3 slide ''stand up'' presentation of their ideas.
Submissions should be sent to lyndon.nixon@sti2.org


*DEADLINES*
Submissions - March 28
Notification of acceptance - April 11
"Stand up" slides to be submitted by May 30
