***************************************************************************
Call for Paper: Workshop on Advances in IMS and related Services

in conjunction with 
MobiMedia - 5th International Mobile Multimedia Communications Conference - September 7-9, 2009: London, UK
http://www.mobimedia.org/

The standardization process in the field of converging networks and multimedia services has produced complex architectures for Next Generation Networks (NGNs), the core of which is based on the Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). It covers most of classical communication paradigms, from packet forwarding to circuit emulation. Nevertheless, some recent communication models need a further intervention to make the IMS accessible by them, with possible implications in the control plane of the network architectures. For example, the inclusion of peer-to-peer communications and distributed security techniques is a currently being investigated by research projects, so as the management of efficient energy use of the ICT infrastructures.  

The aim of this workshop is to is to share research interests and recent achievements on IMS, to promote cooperation among academia, industrial research labs, manufacturers and operators. We are interested in theoretical, experimental, and work-in-progress papers in all aspects of IMS and related application services.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

1.	IMS Applications and Services
â¢	Advance Service Platforms for IMS
â¢	User-generated Services and Contents
â¢	Advanced messaging and presence services
â¢	Service engines (e.g. Parlay, SIP Servlets, JSLEE Application Servers)
â¢	Integration of open-source service components
â¢	Interworking with service oriented technologies (e.g. Web Services)
â¢	Interworking with legacy infrastructure
â¢	Testbeds and Validation Platforms
â¢	Charging
2.	IMS Security
â¢	Threats and Attack Modelling
â¢	Content filtering devices, and security gateways
â¢	Trusted service domain for third-party service deployment
â¢	Network Domain Security, integrity protection, and access security
â¢	Access control, authentication, nonrepudiation, and  privacy
â¢	Co-existence of authentication schemes 
â¢	Secure links between IMS control entities
3.	Management, Resilience and QoS
â¢	Subcriber profile management
â¢	Interdependency Modelling of IMS core elements
â¢	Advanced network management (efficient energy management, stabilization of the IMS core)
â¢	Support of P2P communications
â¢	Performance related issues 
â¢	User mobility management
â¢	High availability, reliability and jitter solutions for VoIP, NGN and IMS systems
â¢	End to end performance design and validation.
