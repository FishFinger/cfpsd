The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and
Computation (PACLIC 23)

3-5 December 2009
City University of Hong Kong
http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk


Call for Papers


**********************************************************=20
Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit revised
manuscripts to a Special Issue of Language Resources and Evaluation,
an SCI-indexed international journal.
**********************************************************


The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and
Computation (PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong
Kong on 3-5 December 2009.  The PACLIC series of conferences
emphasizes the synergy of theoretical analysis and processing of
language, and provides a forum for researchers in different fields of
language study in the Pacific-Asia region to meet, to inspire and to
be inspired.  According to the Computer Science Conference Ranking
Website, as in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of 701 conferences
in topic area II (AI and Machine Learning), roughly at top 7%.
(http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/topicsii.html)

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on
all aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics.  Topics
include but are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, typology, corpus
linguistics, formal grammar theory, natural language processing,
natural language systems and related computer applications.  Papers
which showcase the synergistic effects offered by multi-disciplinary
approaches on the construction of language resources and development
of language processing applications are particularly encouraged.
Different research topics could address the following issues in one
way or another, to feature the mutual advancement among language,
information and computation:

* How has formal linguistic analysis informed language technology and
  how is it deployed in advancing the development of language
  processing applications?

* What light has theoretical linguistics shed on the information
  demand of natural language processing, and how has it led to
  large-scale machine-usable language resources?

* How have linguistically-informed language resources improved the
  performance of language processing applications?

* What does the advancement in language technology have to offer
  theoretical linguists with respect to research methodology and
  analysis framework?

* What is the limit of pure computational methods like machine
  learning in language processing?  What roles do related disciplines
  such as cognitive science and psycholinguistics have to play in
  bridging the gap between human and computer language processing?


Important Dates:

 9 Aug 2009      Paper submission deadline
 21 Sep 2009    Acceptance notification
 19 Oct 2009     Camera-ready paper due
 3-5 Dec 2009   PACLIC 23 conference


Paper Submission:

Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished
work. Papers should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10)
pages, including references.  Please follow the formatting
instructions and use the style files provided on the conference
website (http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk).  Accepted papers will be
presented in one of the regular sessions or poster sessions as
determined by the program committee.  Such decisions will be based on
the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

The deadline for paper submissions is 11:59PM Aug 9, 2009 Hong Kong
time (GMT+8).  Submissions should be made via the submission software
at:

 https://www.softconf.com/a/PACLIC23/

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical
strength, significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to
the attendees. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three
program committee members.  As the reviewing will be blind,
manuscripts must not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Authors should ensure that their identities are not revealed in any
way in the paper.  Papers that do not conform to these requirements
will be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which
will subsequently be digitally archived and sent to ISI for indexing.
PACLIC conference proceedings are indexed in the ISI Web of Science
since 2002 and authors are encouraged to cite previous PACLIC papers
in their work.


For enquiries on paper submission, please contact the program
committee chair at paclic23@cityu.edu.hk.
