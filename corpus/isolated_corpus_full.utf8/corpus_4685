CALL FOR PAPERS

Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop (CLA'09)
http://cla.imcsit.org/

event of International Multiconference on Computer Science and 
Information Technology (IMCSIT 2009)

12-14 October 2009, Mragowo, Poland

The CLA Workshop is located within the framework of the IMCSIT 
conference to create a dialog between researchers and practitioners 
involved in Computational Linguistics and related areas of Information 
Technology. IMSCIT is a multi-disciplinary conference gathering 
scientists form the different fields of IT & Computer Science together 
with representatives of industry and end-users. IMSCIT with its motto: 
"new ideas are born not inside peoples' heads but in the space between 
them", quickly became a unique place to share thoughts and ideas. This 
year's gathering is held in October 2009 in a beautiful town of Mragowo 
in the midst of Mazury Lake Country.


Workshop Goals
============

The Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop was created in 
2008 in response to the fast-paced progress in the area.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists 
specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers. 
Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics, 
computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a 
number of practical applications available. These applications are 
sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve the 
problems using sophisticated heuristics.

Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of 
the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle 
unstructured text to allow search for information on the web. According 
to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are one of the 
key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority aim of the 
research in this area is to enable users to communicate with the 
computer in their native language.

CLA'09 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views and 
ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on 
practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications 
needed to improve human-machine interaction.


Paper Topics
=========

This call is for papers that present research and developments on all 
aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications, 
such as (this list is not exhaustive):

* information retrieval
* extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora
* semantic ontologies in computer linguistics
* lexical resources
* machine translation and translation aids
* ambiguity resolution
* text classification
* corpus-based language modeling
* POS-tagging
* parsing issues
* proofing tools
* dialogue systems
* machine learning methods applied to language processing
* ontology and taxonomy evaluation
* opinion mining
* question answering
* sentiment analysis
* speech and audio processing
* text summarization
* use of NLP techniques in practical applications


Paper Presentation
=============

The presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of an 
existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool 
(or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.

The presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly 
demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors 
discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test 
their software.

Papers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical 
merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the 
workshop scope by the CLA'09 Program Committee. The paper will be 
assessed by academics as well as industry representatives in order to 
assure fair and balanced assessment.

All accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference 
Proceedings and included in the IEEE XploreÂ® database. The best 
demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience of 
the conference at a plenary session.



Papers Submission Requirements
======================

* Authors should submit full papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).
* The submissions are accepted via conference submission system until 
2009-05-10 (link will be published soon).
* The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style).


==============================

CLA'09 - where science meets reality !
