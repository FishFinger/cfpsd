History
The RIAO conference is a triennial conference, which addresses research
topics related to the design of robust and large-scale scientific
and industrial solutions to information processing.
Previous RIAO editions were held at Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988), Barcelona
(1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997), Paris (2000),
and Avignon (2004), and Carnegie Mellon University (2007).
Past RIAO conferences were constituted by both peer-reviewed scientific
sessions and demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and
advanced research prototypes.

Scope of RIAO 2010

Paper Submission

We welcome submissions from both research and industrial communities
addressing the main conference theme.
Submitted papers must describe an unpublished original work, emphasizing
completed or advanced research, possibly with releted experiments.
A parallel submission to other venues should be clearly indicated to the
program committee.
The submissions (which have to be blind) will be reviewed by at least
three program committee members. The submissions will be evaluated on
the basis of
originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation.
Papers can be submitted in two categories: full papers and short papers,
where full papers are appropriate for describing
substantial research with related evaluations and short papers will
typically describe ongoing research and preliminary results. All
accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk
and short papers will be presented as a poster.
Long papers must not exceed 12 pages (5000 words), in one column format,
starting with an abstract.
Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (2500 words), in one column,
starting with an abstract.
Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees,
and through the CID after the conference.
