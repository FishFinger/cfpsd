Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2010=20

Constructions and Frames is an international peer-reviewed journal,=20
published by John Benjamins, that provides a forum for construction-
based approaches to language analysis. Constructional models=20
emphasize the role of constructions in stating language-specific and=20
cross-linguistic generalizations. Frame Semantics elaborates the analysis=
=20
of form-meaning relationships by focusing on lexical semantic issues=20
that are relevant to grammatical structure.

Constructions and Frames publishes articles which range from=20
descriptions of grammatical phenomena in different languages to=20
constructionally-oriented work in cognitive linguistics,=20
grammaticalization theory, typology, interactional linguistics, poetics,=20
and sociolinguistics. Articles that explore applications to related fields,=
=20
e.g. communication studies, computational linguistics,
lexicography, psychology, and anthropology, are also invited.

Constructions and Frames invites submissions on relevant topics. There=20
is no deadline for submission. We are currently accepting submissions for=
