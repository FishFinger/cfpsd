Translating and the Computer 29 - Conference and Exhibition
(29-30 November 2007, at the Copthorne Tara Hotel, Kensington, London).
An Aslib Conference supported by BCS, EAMT, IAMT, IoL, ITI, LISA and TILP
(www.aslib.com/conferences/tcindex.html)
This conference focuses on the user's perspective of how computers/software is
used in translation. The conference series attracts a wide audience which
includes translators, business managers, researchers and language experts. Once
again, this year the conference will address the latest developments in
translation (and translation-related) software. It will address the needs of the
following conference attendees: industry, public administration, agencies,
freelancers and development.
This call for papers invites abstracts of papers to be presented at the
conference. The papers (and the presentations) should focus on the user aspects
of translation or translation-related software rather than on theoretical
issues. Presentations accompanied by demonstrations are especially welcome.
