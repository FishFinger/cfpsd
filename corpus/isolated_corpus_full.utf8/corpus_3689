Meeting Description:

Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Creativity (CALC-09)
Boulder, Colorado, on June 4 or 5, 2009, in conjunction with NAACL-HLT 2009.
Deadline for paper submissions: February 27, 2009.
Workshop homepage:  http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=CALC-09 

Call for Papers

It is generally agreed upon that "linguistic creativity" is a unique property of
human language. Some claim that linguistic creativity is expressed in our
ability to combine known words in a new sentence, others refer to our skill to
express thoughts in figurative language, and yet others talk about syntactic
recursion and lexical creativity.

For the purpose of this workshop, we treat the term "linguistic creativity" to
mean "creative language usage at different levels", from the lexicon to syntax
to discourse and text (see also topics, below).

The recognition of instances of linguistic creativity and the computation of
their meaning constitute one of the most challenging problems for a variety of
Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation, text
summarization, information retrieval, question answering, and sentiment
analysis. Computational systems incorporating models of linguistic creativity
operate on different types of data (including written text, audio/speech/sound,
and video/images/gestures). New approaches might combine information from
different modalities. Creativity-aware systems will improve the contribution.
Computational Linguistics has to offer to many practical areas, including
education, entertainment, and engineering.

Within the scope of the workshop, the event is intended to be interdisciplinary.
Besides contributions from an NLP perspective, we also welcome the participation
of researchers who deal with linguistic creativity from different perspectives,
including psychology, neuroscience, or human-computer interaction.

Location
The CALC-09 workshop will be held in conjunction with NAACL HLT 2009 in Boulder,
Colorado.

Topics
We are particularly interested in work on the automatic detection,
classification, understanding, or generation of:
- Neologisms;
- Figurative language, including metaphor, metonymy, personification, idioms;
- New or unconventional syntactic constructions ("May I serve who's next?") and
constructions defying traditional parsers (e.g. gapping: "Many words were
spoken, and sentiments expressed");
- Indirect speech acts (such as curses, insults, sarcasm and irony);
- Verbally expressed humor;
- Poetry and fiction;
- And other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity.

Depending on the state of the art of approaches to the various phenomena and
languages, preference will be given to work on deeper processing (e.g.,
understanding, goal-driven generation) rather than shallow approaches (e.g.,
binary classification, random generation). We also welcome descriptions and
discussions of:
- Computational tools that support people in using language creatively (e.g.
tools for computer-assisted creative writing, intelligent thesauri);
- Computational and/or cognitive models of linguistic creativity;
- Metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware systems
- Specific application scenarios of computational linguistic creativity;
- Design and implementation of creativity-aware systems.

Related topics, including corpora collection, elicitation, and annotation of
creative language usage, will also be considered, as long as their relevance to
automatic systems is clearly pointed out.

Invited Speaker: Nick Montfort, MIT

Submissions
Submissions should describe original, unpublished work. Papers are limited to 8
pages. The style files will be available here soon. No author information should
be included in the papers, since reviewing will be blind. Papers not conforming
to these requirements are subject to rejection without review.
Papers should be submitted via START; more information on this will be
available here as well.

We encourage submissions from everyone. For those how are new to ACL
conferences and workshops, or with special needs, we are planning to set up a
lunch mentoring program. Let us know if you are interested. Also, a limited
number of student travel grants might become available, intended for individuals
with minority background and current residents of countries where conference
travel funding is usually hard to find.
