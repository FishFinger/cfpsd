Call for Papers
 
HCSNet Â­ the ARC Network in Human Communication Science Â­ is holding a 2-Day
Workshop on Speech, Perception and Action on Thursday and Friday 10-11 July
2008 at MARCS Auditory Laboratories, University of Western Sydney (Bankstown
campus).  

Day 1: Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method in neuroscience used to
stimulate focal regions of the human brain. TMS utilizes an electromagnet
placed on the scalp that generates magnetic field pulses roughly the
strength of an MRI scan. The magnetic pulses pass readily through the skull
and stimulate the underlying cerebral cortex. TMS provides a means of
momentarily disrupting a given brain area in a focal, reversible, and
noninvasive manner. The theme for day one will be to introduce TMS
(including rTMS), consider the advantages and disadvantages of this method,
the types of inquiry that lend themselves to this approach, the benefits of
complementary methods and practical and theoretical considerations in
conducting TMS and rTMS experiments.

Keynote Speaker: Professor Jason Mattingley, University of Queensland and
the Queensland Brain Institute.

Other Speakers: Day 1 will include a short presentation from a
representative of Medilink Australia of the VISOR 3D Neuro Navigation for
TMS coil positioning system.

Day 2: Action Perception: Perception and Performance.

The theme of day 2 of the workshop will be to discuss neural and behavioural
mechanisms and other factors that mediate perception while people are
acting, and perception-action coupling. Following an introduction to
GibsonÂ¹s notion of the relationship between perception and action, there
will be discussion of perceptions in high-performance environments
especially during performances by musicians, dancers, and so on. Others find
normal environments demanding and perceptions and actions arising from
clinical conditions also will be considered. In addition to those specific
examples the workshop will consider the perception-action relationship in a
broader context, including speech. All researchers with an interest in
perceptions and actions, in any context, are invited to attend and to
present their work. Graduate and Honours and senior undergraduate research
students are particularly encouraged to attend and present their
experimental, neuroscientific or computational research.

Keynote Speaker: Dr Beatriz Calvo-Merino, University College London,
Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience.

Other Speakers:
Professor Catherine Best, MARCS Auditory Laboratories, UWS

Associate Professor Stephen Lord, Prince of Wales Medical Research
Institute.

Papers will be brief (speed) presentations and sessions will be followed by
opportunities for discussion of individual findings and research themes.

Topics for presentation include:
Action observation.
Perception and action.
The perception of performance.
Perceptions during performance.
Intersensory interactions during perception and action.
The role of mirror neurons in perception and action.
The motor speech theory.
Visual and Auditory speech.
Speech and Gesture.
