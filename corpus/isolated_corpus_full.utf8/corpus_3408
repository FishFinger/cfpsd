Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

The goal of the workshop Rhythm beyond the Word' is to bring together
researchers who focus on the role of rhythm in various subdomains of
linguistics. We invite contributions from scholars working in morphology,
phonology and syntax, psycho- and neurolinguistics, aphasiology and language
acquisition. 

Reminder:

Rhythm beyond the word

We are hosting a workshop entitled Rhythm beyond the word to be held from March
4th till March 6th in Osnabrück, Germany, during th 31st annual meeting of the
DGfS. Send us an abstract if you are interested in presenting a paper on any of
the issues dscribed below. The electronic abstract should be one page text plus
one pages for references and other material (for example, graphics) and in pdf
format. Send it to ruben@ling.uni-potsdam.de and ralf.vogel@uni-bielefeld.de by
September 1st 2008. We expect to be
able to provide financial suport for student speakers.

Invited speakers:
- Volker Dellwo
- Dafydd Gibbon
- Carlos Gussenhoven
- Gerrit Kentner
- Sonja Kotz
- Julia Schlüter
- Maren Schmidt-Kassow
- Petra Wagner

As a well-formedness condition on outputs, rhythm plays an important role in
language acquisition, psycholinguistics, language change, phraseology, and, of
course, in morphology and phonology. More recent research by a number of authors
includes the following findings:

1. established that rhythmic constraints affected the morpho-syntactic
development of Early Modern English and Early Modern German; rhythm has an
impact on word order in sentence production; 
2. showed that the rhythmic characteristics of a language are learned extremely
early in language acquisition; rhythm helps children acquire knowledge of the
word order regularities in their language; It has been shown that 5-days old
infants are able to discriminate their mother tongue from other languages based
on its rhythmic characteristics. Experimental studies on healthy and patient
populations in neurolinguistics showed that ''syntactic'' effects observed at
the basal ganglia have to be reinterpreted as emerging from the basal ganglia's
role as organizing the rhythmic sequencing of cognitive and motor activities.
Recent experimental work at the University of Potsdam also revealed that rhythm
affects sentence production. Speakers avoid rhythmically awkward sequences.

Such effects are unexpected in many current syntactic and psycholinguistic
theories in which phonology only interprets syntactic structure. The impact of
rhythm on the various subdomains of linguistics, as illustrated by the effects
mentioned above, is not integrated in linguistic theory yet. To achieve this
goal an exchange of data and ideas across the various linguistic subdomains is
needed.

Similar challenges arise for some psycholinguistic models of speech production
where phonology is attributed the same role. Some researchers have even pleaded
for rhythmicality as the fundamental principle of Universal grammar in the
Chomskyan sense.

The acquisition of rhythm below the word level is fairly well-studied, but
studies dealing with the acquisition of rhythm in compounds and phrases are
still rare. The same holds of many other areas: our knowledge of the role of
rhythm as a well-formedness condition is still incomplete.

Contributions should address one or more of the following questions - or any
other question pertinent to the theme of the workshop:
- What is the role of rhythm in phonology above the word level?
- How is rhythm above the word level acquired?
- What is the role of rhythm in syntax and morphology, both synchronically
and diachronically?
- What is the role of rhythm in psycho- and neurolinguistics?
- Which role does rhythm play in aphasic speech?
- How does rhythm affect speech perception?
- How can linguistic rhythm be detected and defined?
- Is rhythm really as fundamental for language as recent findings
suggest?

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

This workshop 'Morphological Form and Syntactic Function: The Syntax-Morphology
Interface in Child and Adult Second Language Acquisition' is part of the 31st
Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS 2009) at the University
of Osnabrueck, Germany. It aims at a systematic comparison of the
syntax-morphology interface in child versus adult second-language (L2) acquisition. 

Call for Papers

We invite researchers studying early and/or late L2 acquisition of morphosyntax
from different perspectives to contribute presentations and to submit abstracts
to this workshop.

The relation between inflectional morphology and syntax in the development of L2
grammars has been at the forefront of research on early and late L2 acquisition.
While the available evidence to date suggests that inflectional morphology
presents only passing difficulty in child L2 acquisition and may be relatively
closely tied to the acquisition of syntax, inflectional morphology is prone to
protracted problems in late L2 acquisition, yet, with less clear linkages to
syntactic development.

This scenario has led to various approaches claiming either that child L2
acquisition differs from adult L2 acquisition in the domain of morphology, yet
not in syntax (Schwartz 2003), or that they differ in both morphology and syntax
(Blom, Polisenska & Weerman 2006). Against the backdrop of these approaches,
this workshop seeks to relate comparative empirical data to three questions:

1) What are the effects of age in the acquisition of inflectional morphology and
syntax? Do child L2 learners invariably outperform late L2ers, and, if so, is
the relation between age and performance at the syntax-morphology interface
linear or age-bounded, i.e. indicative of a Critical Period?
2) What are the effects of the first language on the acquisition of
morphosyntax? Is morphosyntactic development in child L2 acquisition equally
affected by L1 properties as adult L2 development?
3) What is the nature of problems at the syntax-morphology interface? Some
approaches stress representational problems in syntax (e.g. Hawkins 2001) or
morphology (e.g. Lardiere 2006), while others point to computational problems
(e.g. Prévost & White 2000) or problems at PF (Goad & White 2004). Recent
advances in L2 processing and neuroimaging research can help address the
question as to whether non-convergent production and comprehension of
morphosyntax in L2 development are due to representational deficits or
computational problems in L2 acquisition. In addition, they allow us to consider
the role of cognitive resources in child and adult L2 processing.

In the workshop, we hope to discuss new findings in order to move closer towards
a coherent perspective on age effects in the L2 acquisition of morphosyntax.

We are pleased to announce Bonnie D. Schwartz (University of Hawai'i) as invited
speaker at this workshop.
