Meeting Description:

2nd international MIDP symposium 'Multilingualism from below'

14-16 September 2009
University of Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium
Website: www.ua.ac.be/midp
Contact: mfb@ua.ac.be 

Call for Papers

In standard accounts of language policy and language planning, language users
are too often viewed as the 'passive receivers' of linguistic decisions taken at
the highest levels of state organization. In defiance of this tendency, the
present and 2nd International MIDP Symposium wants to accentuate that
subalternity involves, rather than excludes, agency. Through their everyday
language practices and their discursive perceptions and interpretations of
linguistic realities, those who are supposed to 'live' the language policies
never submissively 'implement' them, but, appropriating them, steer them in
novel, unforeseen directions. It is these dialectic processes of interaction
between what is designed from above and how it is responded to from below which
give shape to societies' overall patterns of multilingualism. 

The Symposium organisers invite papers which aim at shedding light on these
dialectical processes, or to component aspects of it, from a large variety of
perspectives and without restrictions as to areal scope. Some key questions
related to the theme, Multilingualism from Below, include: 

- How are language policies experienced by language users? 
- How are they responded and reacted to? 
- How and why do certain language policies 'work' whilst others don't? 
- How do top-down language policy processes respond to sociolinguistic realities?
- How 'useful' are language policies in empowering people and improving their
lives? 
- How do language users' actions produce and reproduce, from the bottom up,
larger sociolinguistic structures and patterns of multilingualism, both in time
and in space? 

Keynote speakers are Durk Gorter, Sinfree Makoni and Elana Shohamy.

Abstracts should arrive at mfb@ua.ac.be by 27 February 2009. They should be in
MS Word format (use PDF only if absolutely necessary for font rendition) and not
exceed 250 words. The choice of language at this Symposium for each presentation
is free. Unfortunately, given budgetary restrictions there will be no provision
for interpreting services.

A select number of papers are to be taken up in the conference proceedings that
will be published in the MIDP colloquia series, Studies in Language Policy in
South Africa, by Van Schaik Publishers, Pretoria (RSA).

The Symposium organisers are:
Pol Cuvelier, Convenor (University of Antwerp, Belgium)
Reinhild Vandekerckhove (University of Antwerp, Belgium)
Michael Meeuwis (University of Ghent, Belgium)
Lut Teck (Institute for Higher Education in the Sciences and the Arts, Brussels,
Belgium)
Theodorus du Plessis (University of the Free State, Republic of South Africa)
Victor Webb (University of Pretoria, Republic of South Africa)

Registration fees and Accommodation: information will be provided on the website.

Date: 23-Jul-2008 - 24-Jul-2008

Linguistic Field(s): Forensic Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

LINGUA, the scientific unit for linguistic analyses within the Swiss Federal
office for Migration, organizes a Workshop on 'Linguistic analyses within the
asylum procedure' in Lausanne/Switzerland in July 2008. 

Call for Papers 

The academic world has, for a couple of years now, taken interest into the
linguistic analyses carried out and used by different asylum authorities. In
2004, a group of linguists edited a set of Guidelines designed for all
practitioners in this field. Its concern is to ensure and guarantee a sufficient
quality level. Its focus lies particularly on the profile required by people who
carry out such analyses. 

The different units across Europe who carry out linguistic analyses within the
asylum procedure have all different methods and requisites. Discussions among
them and with the scientific world are therefore necessary in order to 1)
explain the different procedures and frameworks that determine the units'
working methods and 2) establish the criteria necessary from a scientific point
of view to define the possibilities and the limits of such analyses since they
can have important consequences on people's lives. 

At the Workshop - which will take place on 23rd-24th July, immediately following
the  IAFPA conference - different European units carrying out linguistic
analyses for the asylum authorities will be presenting themselves. Also, LINGUA
would like to invite different external presentations by people who are, in some
way or other, involved with this kind of forensic analysis. For this, a call for
papers is being opened. 

Abstracts on different topics related to linguistic analyses for the
determination of origin (LADO) within the asylum procedure are welcome. Topics
related to LADO are listed below and, for each topic, a series of exemplary
questions to approach the topic is given: 

- interviews done for LADO
How should interviews be carried out in order to ensure sufficient data basis
for a scientific report? What interview technique should be applied? Which
interlocutors should be involved? What topics should be discussed? What
influence does the presence of an interpreter have on the interview?
 
- forensic sciences
What kind of research has been done since the editing of the Guidelines? What is
currently being done on LADO? What developments are possible in this field? What
other aspects of forensic linguistics could/should LADO bring into its daily
work in order to increase its quality? 

- editing of scientific reports
How should a LADO report look like? What kind of answers can a LADO report
furnish? What information is needed by the case officers/lawyers/courts in order
to be able to reach a sound decision on an asylum case (e.g. minimal criteria,
domains, linguistics analysis, country knowledge, result categories)?
 
- profile of the experts carrying out LADO
Who has to carry out LADO? What competences are necessary to lead an
interview/to write a report/to make a linguistic analysis/to evaluate the
country knowledge/etc.? To what extent does an analyst need/want assistance? To
what extent does the staff of the linguistic analyses units have to be involved? 

- involvement of native speakers in the process
What role can/should native speakers (not) play in LADO? What are the advantages
and disadvantages of being a native speaker vs. a linguist or of being a member
of the community under analysis vs. an outsider. 

- technical aspects
How to ensure the best possible quality of recordings? What technical
possibilities are at hand to ensure the analysts anonymity? How to transfer
recordings to analysts all over the world? How to ensure protection of sensitive
personal data on the recordings and the reports we deal with?
 
- setting
LADO is carried out within a very specific setting, namely that of the asylum
procedure. What role does this setting play on the whole LADO procedure? How
much do the analysts need to know about the setting in order to do a thorough
job? Should legal aspects be considered when writing a LADO report? 

Presentation slots will be 20 minutes long + 10 minutes for questions. Longer
slots for discussion will be planned during the workshop. Abstracts should have
a maximal length of 250-300 words and should be submitted by email as an
attachment (using Microsoft Word or, preferably, pdf) to Simonette Favaro at the
following address:  Simonette Favaro-Buschor

Abstracts should contain: 
Title of the presentation 
Name(s) of the author(s) 
Affiliation of the author(s) 
Both e-mail and postal addresses 
Any special audio-visual/IT requirements (OHPs, PowerPoint, video, DVD etc.) 

Extention of the deadline for the submission of abstracts: May 30th, 2008 
Notification of acceptance: end of May/beginning of June 2008

The workshop is free of charges, except for a small fee covering lunches.
