Objectives:

The conference aims at bringing together and strengthening the network of cognitive linguistics working in France and abroad, to continue the network of discussion and collaboration set in motion by the inaugural conference of AFLiCo (''From Grammar to Mind''), held in Bordeaux, May 2007. This second conference will offer a forum both thematic sessions and general sessions.

Thematic Sessions:

The conference will devote special attention to three major themes of research, viz. typology, gesture and sign language. The last topic ties in with the LSF Interpreter training at the University of Lille.

These three themes all pertain to the relationship between language and cognition. The typological and comparative studies tie in with the question of universal grammar and linguistic relativity. Sign languages are essential to better understand the cognitive dimensions of language. Cognitive Linguistics offers a well-suited model to account for iconicity, metaphor and metonymy that are central to the study of the sign languages of the world. The study of co-verbal gestures, which straddle the boarder between the verbal and the non-verbal offer another window into the mind, revealing cognitive strategies which may or may not be identical to those that one finds in language. The study of gesture, still relatively young, finds a natural place within the framework of Cognitive Linguistics.

General Sessions:

However, the conference will not be limited to these three domains of research. The organisers encourage researchers to submit proposals within other areas of cognitive linguistics, to be presented in the general parallel sessions. In addition to the three thematic areas, these topics include (but are not limited to):
- interaction between lexicon and syntax
- corpus linguistics and cognitive linguistics
- grammaticalization and diachronic linguistics
- semantic ­ pragmatic interface
- linguistic relativism
- iconicity
- cognitive phonology
- cognitive applications in language pedagogy

In line with one of the main goals of AFLiCo, we welcome papers elaborating the affinities between cognitive linguistics and Culioli's ''théorie des opérations énoniciatives''.
   
The organisers further encourage young researchers to submit an abstract.

Note: for organisational reasons, the thematic sessions on sign languages will be grouped on the first day of the conference (10 May).

Submission Procedure:

Abstracts will be submitted to a double, blind review. They should be fully anonymous and not exceed 500 words (references excluded). To be sent via email as attachment (MS-WORD doc or rtf, OpenOffice, PDF) to: 

aflico@univ-lille3.fr

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

This interdisciplinary conference will examine contemporary and historical issues of citizenship, identity, ethnicity and race in the African Diaspora from the era of Dred Scott to the present. 

This interdisciplinary conference will examine contemporary and historical issues of citizenship, identity, ethnicity and race in the African Diaspora from the era of Dred Scott to the present.  The struggle for citizenship that Dred Scott underwent from 1847 to 1857 has been repeated in different forms across the African world.  The organizers welcome proposals from a wide range of disciplines from --history, law, linguistics, economics, literature, sociology, education, and others in order to draw academics and artists to investigate how people of African descent have struggled for, shaped, challenged, or broadened notions of citizenship, identity, ethnicity, and race from disciplinary and inter/multi disciplinary perspectives at both the national and transnational levels.  The conference will convene from March 30-31, 2007 at Gettysburg College.  Please visit the conference website for a fuller description of panels and the conference.
