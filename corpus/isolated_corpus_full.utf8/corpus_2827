GoTAL - 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing
Final Call for Papers: deadline 4 April 2008


Gothenburg, Sweden

25-27 August 2008

www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal

The GoTAL conference will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden on 25-27 August, =

2008.
The conference is hosted by Chalmers University of Technology jointly with
Gothenburg University, as part of the activities of the Centre for =

Language
Technology (CLT). GoTAL is the sixth in the series of the TAL conferences,
following FracTAL (Besan=E7on, France, 1997), VexTAL (Venice, Italy, 1999),
PorTAL (Faro, Algarve, Portugal, 2002), EsTAL (Alicante, Spain, 2004), and
FinTAL (Turku, Finland 2006). The main purpose of the TAL conference =

series
is to bring together scientists representing linguistics, computer science
  and related fields, sharing a common interest in the advancement of
computational linguistics and natural language processing.


SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished =

research
on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural language and =

speech
processing, including, but not limited to:
- Pragmatics, Discourse, Semantics, Syntax, and the Lexicon
- Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology
- Speech Recognition
- Speech Synthesis
- Natural Language Generation
- Ontologies, Semantic Networks, and Lexical Resources
- Corpus Linguistics
- Linguistic, Mathematical, and Psychological Models of Language
- Anaphora Resolution
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Corpus-based Language Modeling
- Machine Translation and Translation Aids
- Text and Speech Interfaces
- Dialogue systems
- Language Learning and Therapy
- Simulation and Visualization
- Knowledge Acquisition and Representation
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Text and Speech Classification
- Systems Evaluation


PAPER SUBMISSION

We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic
that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging =

research
emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay between
linguistics, computer science and application domains such as biomedicine,
communication systems, public services, and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or
well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of =

the
reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results should =

be
rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance for
quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should contain original
material that has not been previously presented to the scientific =

community.
A parallel submission to other publication fora as well as a significant
overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly =

indicated
to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee =

members.
The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical =

quality,
and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories:
- full papers , describing substantial research with well-evaluated =

results
- short papers , typically describing ongoing research and preliminary =

results


All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk =

and
short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions are made using EasyChair: Go to

   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgotall2008

and follow the instructions.

The submissions should be sent anonymous, in PDF format.
(final version format to be specified later).
For the final version, authors should follow the LNCS instructions:

   http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-7-72376-0

The maximum length is 12pp for full papers and 5pp for short papers.


PROCEEDINGS

Accepted papers of both categories will be published in the Conference
Proceedings, in the LNCS/LNAI series of Springer.
