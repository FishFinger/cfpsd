Call for Papers

First NLP4DL Workshop
Viareggio, Italy
15 June 2009

Digital libraries represent a crucial contact point among traditional  libr=
aries, recent advances in Information Technology, and Natural Language Proc=
essing technologies. In a sense, digital libraries represent a *perfect* cr=
ossroads: they are mainly  built out of text, they are consulted by humans =
via natural language, and one of the major tools  for accessing the informa=
tion they hold, metadata, is a mix of structured and unstructured informati=
on. The First Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (NLP4DL) wo=
rkshop, organised under the auspices of the CACAO project (eContentplus Pro=
gramme of the European Commission, ECP 2006 DILI 510035 CACAO), aims to col=
lect all fundamental and innovative research which is done in connection wi=
th Natural Language Technologies applied to the digital libraries universe.=
 The workshop will host invited speakers together with talks/papers concern=
ing:

-free text access to full-text digital libraries;
-access to digital resources via metadata;
-NLP techniques for harmonizing metadata in digital library (DL) federation=
s;
-cross-language access to DLs;
-cross-language harmonization of metadata;
-discovery in DLs: hyperlinking, clustering, user-oriented categorization;
-management of digital collections via NLP-based algorithms;
-adaptation of linguistic resources to thematic DLs;
-fundamental issues: named entity extraction, word sense disambiguation, tr=
anslation disambiguation.

All abstracts papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted contributions will =
be distributed on a CD at the workshop.  A volume from the conference will =
be published in Fall 2009. Depending on the number of high quality submissi=
ons, a poster/demo session may also be held. =
