Full Title: Workshop on Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instrument(al)s 

Date: 03-Jul-2008 - 03-Jul-2008
Location: Sydney, Australia 
Contact Person: Mark Donohue
Meeting Email: instruments08@gmail.com
Web Site: http://www.unr.edu/~donohue/instruments08 

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of instruments and instrumentals, the insights that such studies provide and how they inform theoretical models. We would be particularly interested in papers that investigate the impact of studies of instrumentals on theories of syntax and case marking. 

This workshop is being held in conjunction with LingFest taking place in Sydney during July. Other neighbouring events include AFLA15, LFG2008, ALS 2008 and ALI 2008. 

Workshop to be held at LINGFEST 08:

''Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instruments and Instrumentals''

Organisers: Mark Donohue and Cathryn Donohue 

The phenomena we plan to focus on include:
- syncretisms involving the coding of instruments; this might involve syncretisms with structural or other semantic cases, or syncretisms with other functions entirely; 
- overlaps in syntactic behaviour between instruments and subjects, or instruments and objects; 
- discussion of the termhood of instruments cross-linguistically or in language-specific settings. 

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (20'+10') relevant to the workshop theme. All material is to be submitted in .pdf format. Applicants are limited to one single-authored and one joint-authored abstract. 

Abstracts should be anonymous and should not exceed one A4 page with a 1in/2.5cm margin on each side and in 12 pt font. A second page (in a separate file) should be submitted with the title of your paper and names, affiliations, and preferred contact details of the author(s). 

Abstracts are to be submitted via email to the conference address (instruments08@gmail.com). 

Submission Deadline: May 1, 2008. Notifications of acceptance will be circulated by May 15, 2008 

This workshop will be held in conjunction with a group of linguistics events being held at the University of Sydney in July under the general name of LingFest2008. Other events include AFLA15, ALI 2008, ALS 2008, LFG 2008 and ALAA 2008. For more information on any of these events, please visit the LingFest website at http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au 

Please email the organizers with any questions at instruments08@gmail.com.
