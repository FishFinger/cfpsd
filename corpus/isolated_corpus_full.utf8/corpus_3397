Full Title: AAAI 2009 Spring Symposium on Intelligent Narrative 

Date: 23-Mar-2009 - 25-Mar-2009
Location: palo alto, CA, USA 
Contact Person: Manish Mehta
Meeting Email: mehtama1@cc.gatech.edu
Web Site: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/conferences/aaai-int2/ 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 03-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

This symposium aims to advance research in narrative technologies by bringing
together relevant research communities to discuss innovations, progress and
development in the field. 

Call for Papers

Narrative is a pervasive aspect of all human societies. Human beings make sense
of the world by constructing stories and listening to the stories of others. In
addition, stories as a form of entertainment play a central role in our social
and leisure lives. As a result, story and narrative have become a key interest
for Artificial Intelligence researchers. 

The role of narrative as a primary mechanism for organizing human experience has
been recognized in many fields, spawning multidisciplinary research that
encompasses philosophy, art, psychology, cultural and literary  
studies, drama, and other domains.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Story understanding/generation
- Narrative structure in interface design
- Narrative structure in the design of autonomous agents
- Believable agents
- Interactive storytelling
- Narrative in commonsense reasoning
- Narrative in intelligent learning environments
- Narrative in serious games and edutainment
- Intelligent narrative authoring tools
- Narrative psychology
- Emergent narrative
- Virtual cinematography
- Emotion modeling
- Natural language generation/understanding for narrative

There will be at least two panel discussions on topics such as ''Challenges for
NLP in narrative research,'' ''New challenges in developing novel authoring
paradigms,'' or ''Integrating research advances for building complete narrative
environments.'' If you are interested in hosting a panel discussion, please
contact the organizers at int2@cc.gatech.edu.

The symposium will include three categories of papers: full papers of no more
than eight (8) pages; extended abstracts of no more than four (4) pages; and
demo and poster papers of two to four (2-4) pages. To foster more small-group
discussions, every accepted paper will be presented as a poster regardless of
length. Depending on the number of accepted papers, the full-length accepted
papers will be invited to give 20-30 minute talks in addition to their poster
presentation. The remaining accepted papers will be given five minute
''spotlight'' talks designed to advertise their poster. The full-length talks
will be selected to illustrate the breadth of research in this area, and are not
meant to indicate a higher 'ranking' among the proposals submitted. All forms of
participation in the Symposium are highly valued!

symposium's supplementary web site at
