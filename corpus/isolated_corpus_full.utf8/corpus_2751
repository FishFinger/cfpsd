CULTUS (issue 2) The Journal of intercultural mediation and communication

2nd Issue: =93Training and Competencies in an Intercultural Setting=94

Call for Abstracts: 1st April 2008

Paper submission: 1st  August 2008

Cultus: the Journal of intercultural mediation and communication is an
international refereed journal focussing on the role of culture in
constructing, perceiving and translating reality. The Journal aims to
develop an awareness of the interplay between language and culture in
communication.

Managing diversity is now an issue, as an ever growing number of people
are becoming increasingly involved in communicative interactions with
others from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds: in business,
education, media, tourism and also through immigration and political
conflict. This Journal provides a stimulating forum, focussing on the
experience of both practitioners and academics; their analysis of
languages and cultures, and how the differences have been, or might be,
managed.

The goal of this Journal is to promote research, education and training in
communication by investigating language, languages, cultural models,
conflict, mediation and interculturality. Furthermore, since translation
is considered as mediation between cultures it will be included as a way
of seeing cultural linguistics at work.

A fascinating feature of this Journal is constituted by a debate
discussing a topic of relevant interest to those working in the field. The
first issue, entitled =93Translation at work=94 to be published in August 2=
008
will include an interview between translation scholars Andrew Chesterman
and Mona Baker,  where they debate their views on the role of the
translator, professional ethics, conflict and the (im)possibilities of
mediation.
