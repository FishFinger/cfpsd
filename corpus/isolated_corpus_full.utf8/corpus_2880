Call for Papers  

7th International Symposium on Bilingualism  
Utrecht University
8-11 July 2009

The 7th International Symposium on Bilingualism invites proposals for
presentations on any aspect of research on bilingualism.
Topics may include:
- adult second language acquisition 
- bilingual speech processing
- child second language acquisition 
- contact induced language change
- grammatical development in bilingual children
- grammatical studies of code-switching
- intercultural communication
- language contact phenomena
- language impairment in bilinguals 
- language loss
- language maintenance
- language policy and ideology of bilingualism
- language shift
- multilingualism and education
- multi-modality and multilingualism
- neurolinguistic studies of bilingualism
- psycholinguistic studies of bilingualism
- receptive multilingualism
- sociolinguistic studies of bilingual communities and migration
- sociolinguistic studies of code-switching 
- translation- and interpretation studies

Proposals regarding original, previously unpublished research results on
bilingualism are invited in three formats: individual papers, posters and
colloquia. Each paper presentation should be scheduled for 25 minutes, including
time for discussion.

Proposals for Individual Papers or Posters:
Proposals for individual papers or posters consist of one page plain text
abstract, including examples and references (max. 3000 characters). The abstract
should include enough details to allow reviewers to judge the scientific merits
of the proposal. Abstracts for paper/poster presentations will be double-blind
peer-reviewed. Authors will be asked to specify a format (paper presentation or
poster session) at the time the work is submitted. 

Proposals for Colloquia:
Colloquia are collections of four paper presentations which relate to a narrowly
defined topic of interest. They are submitted as a group, individually reviewed
and offered in 120 min. time blocks. Proposals for colloquia consist of one page
plain text abstract, including examples and references (max. 3000 characters),
describing the colloquium as a whole. In addition, for each of the papers to be
presented one page plain text abstract with author's name, professional
affiliation, and email address must be included. Sufficient details should be
provided to allow peer reviewers to judge the scientific merit of the proposal.
A chair for the session must also be identified. Instead of a fourth speaker,
time can be reserved for discussion lead by a specified discussant. The person
submitting a proposal for a colloquium has the charge of securing the permission
and co-operation of all participants before the proposal is submitted. 

Please submit your proposal online at http://www.let.uu.nl/isb7/
For all submissions holds: one presentation as a first author and one as a
co-author.

Submission Deadline: October 1st 2008

If you have problems with online submission, please do not hesitate to contact
our conference co-ordinator at isb7@uu.nl

can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills
