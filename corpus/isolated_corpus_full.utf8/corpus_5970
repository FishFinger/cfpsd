Full Title: Workshop on the Subatomic Semantics of Event Predicates=20

Location: Barcelona, Spain=20
Contact Person: Berit Gehrke
Meeting Email: events2010@upf.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Typology=20

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2009=20

Meeting Description:

The last 20 years have seen a flowering of approaches to the semantics of p=
redicates that describe different sorts of eventualities, including states,=
 processes, and more complex events (hereafter 'event predicates', for shor=
t). The complexity of these semantics has developed in two directions. On t=
he one hand, increasingly greater richness of detail has been provided in t=
he logical representations for event predicates, from Davidson's 1967 use o=
f event arguments, to so-called neo-Davidsonian representations (e.g. Krifk=
a 1989, Parsons 1990) which represent the entailments associated with event=
 participants separately, to representations which focus on the relation be=
tween events and their parts - often referred to in terms of 'event structu=
re' (e.g. Pustejovsky 1995). On the other hand, the models for event semant=
ics have been enriched, for example, by imposing a mereological structure o=
n the models for the eventuality domain (e.g. Lasersohn 1988), or by propos=
als to expand or restrict the basic ontological inventory of eventualities =
(e.g. Pi=F1=F3n 1997 and Katz 1995, respectively).

In contrast, comparatively less attention has been devoted to an equally im=
portant aspect of the semantics of event predicates, namely the specific se=
ts of entailments that support a theory of the typology of event predicates=
. Since the seminal work of Dowty (1979), in which a small set of primitive=
 predicates were defined to characterize the so-called aspectual classes of=
 verbs, little work on event semantics has explicitly addressed questions s=
uch as whether Dowty's primitives are empirically adequate, particularly cr=
oss-linguistically, or what a typology of the lexical entailments that supp=
ort aspectual classifications across languages might consist in and in what=
 ways it might be parameterized.

Organizers:

The workshop is hosted by GLiF (Grup de Ling=FC=EDstica Formal) at the Depa=
rtment of Translation and Language Sciences of the Pompeu Fabra University =
in Barcelona. It is a satellite event of the XX Generative Grammar Colloqui=
um, to be held at Universitat Pompeu Fabra on March 18-20, 2010.

Scientific Committee:

Boban Arsenijevi?, Berit Gehrke, Graham Katz, Jean-Pierre Koenig, Rafael Ma=
r=EDn,
Louise McNally, Anita Mittwoch.=20

Call for Papers:

The goal of this one-day workshop is to address this latter aspect of the s=
emantics of event predicates - to borrow a term from Terence Parsons, their=
 subatomic semantics. Specifically, we invite proposals for 30-minute prese=
ntations (+ 10 minutes' discussion) on any topic which contributes to our u=
nderstanding of this subatomic semantics, including (though not limited to)=
:

- Alternative means of precisely modeling notions such as change, inchoativ=
ity, causation, resultativity, telicity, dynamicity, and other commonly-ass=
umed components of event descriptions.

- Descriptions and analyses of cross-linguistic differences in the ways suc=
h notions are morphosyntactically manifest.

- Precise characterizations of systematic relations between entailments ass=
ociated with events and those associated with their participants.

- Proposals which address the problem of determining when a predicate refer=
s to an eventuality with a complex structure (e.g. a change and its result)=
 as opposed to a simple eventuality pragmatically related to other eventual=
ities (e.g. a change which simply entails a result).

- Reports on experimental work which contributes to our understanding of th=
is subatomic semantics and its psychological underpinnings

We invite abstracts for 40 minute papers (including 10 minutes for discussi=
on). Authors are asked to submit their abstracts to the following site: htt=
ps://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=3Devents2010.
If you do not have an EasyChair account, please follow the instructions pro=
vided and create one.

Abstracts should be anonymous and at most 2 pages in length, including refe=
rences, using a 12 pt. font with 2,5 cm margins on all sides.

Deadline for abstract submission: October 31, 2009

Notification of acceptance: December 1, 2009

Workshop date: March 17, 2010
