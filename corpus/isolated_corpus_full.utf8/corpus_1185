Meeting Description:

The First Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition (SALC)
Lund, Nov 29 - Dec 1, 2007
http://www.salc-sssk.org/ 

The First Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition
(SALC) will be held at the Centre for Languages and Literature, Lund University
between Nov 29 and Dec 1, 2007. The conference will involve research
investigating the dependence of language on structures and processes of general
cognition (e.g. perception, memory and reasoning) and social cognition (e.g.
joint attention and imitation), as well as affecting such structures and
processes. The conference is intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas
between disciplines, fields of study and theoretical frameworks, involving
researchers in Sweden and abroad. The annual meeting of SALC will be held on Dec
1 2007, to which all members are warmly invited.

The programme will consist of oral presentations, a poster session, 
a discussion panel, as well as invited plenary talks by the following 
speakers:

- Esa Itkonen, Department of Linguistics, University of Turku
- Chris Sinha, Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth
- Östen Dahl, Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University

We invite the submission of abstracts for oral or poster presentations 
related to, but not limited to the following topics:
