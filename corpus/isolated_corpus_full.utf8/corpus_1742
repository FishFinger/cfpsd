Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

Multidisciplinary Approaches to Discourse 2008 (MAD 08) is the seventh in a
series of small-scale, high-quality workshops that have been organised 
(approx.) every second year since 1995. Its aim is to bring together
researchers from different linguistic disciplines to exchange information
and learn from each other on a common topic of investigation. The theme of
MAD 08 is 'Linearisation and Segmentation in Discourse'. 

Language as well as other forms of communication are inseparably tied to
some kind of linear-sequential form of presentation, due to the
linear-sequential nature of the media on which they operate. Linearisation
in its turn presupposes segmentation, i.e. decisions concerning the size
and type of units to be brought into a sequential order at various levels.
In written and spoken language, for example, it has to be decided whether a
piece of information can and should be realised as a word, a phrase, a
clause, a (complex) sentence or even as a sentence sequence or paragraph.
And the relevant units have to be arranged in a certain order that is
determined - in part, at least - by the rules of grammar but also - at
higher levels of discourse - by other principles. We are interested in
identifying and defining such principles. What principles govern the
segmentation of the information to be (explicitly) conveyed? What do the
minimal discourse units look like, which kinds of complex structure do they
build and how are these structures separated from each other?

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different
linguistic disciplines (e.g., psycholinguistics, contrastive
linguistics/translation studies, computational linguistics, discourse
studies), and, if possible, also from other disciplines in which the
linearisation and segmentation of 'content' or information is constitutive
(e.g., in music or film). We invite contributions on topics and questions
such as the following (the list may be extended):


- Discourse units and segmentation:

Which are the (minimal) units of discourse, and how are they marked and
separated from each other? For example, which role does punctuation play in
written discourse, and pauses and intonation in spoken language?


- Linearisation and its relation to nonlinear linguistic and conceptual
structures:

How are linear sequences of discourse units mapped onto complex
(potentially hierarchical) conceptual structures? (Perception perspective)

How are complex (potentially hierarchical) conceptual structures mapped
onto linear sequences of discourse units? (Production perspective)

How do notions like salience, discourse prominence,
foreground(ing)/background(ing) etc. relate to linearity?

Cohesion / coherence and linearity


- Perspective and linearisation:

Perspective and subjectivity in discourse: How is information presented and
what is the role of relations ''in the world'' relative to the order of
presentation by the speaker?

How do the linguistic notions of perspective relate to perspective in other
media?

 
- Linearisation and segmentation across languages:

To what extend do (the grammars of) different languages impose different
constraints on linearisation and segmentation?

What are the implications for multilingual activities such as translation
or multilingual text generation?


- Linearisation and segmentation in different media:

in electronic media such as e-mail and chat

in media combining language and pictures, e.g., film, cartoons

in music (with and without language)


Keynote Speakers:

- Thomas Pechmann (Univ. of Leipzig) on ''Linearisation and segmentation in
music (and language)'' (preliminary title)
- Russel S. Tomlin (Univ. of Oregon) on ''Attention and time: temporal
phasing in event representations and language production'' (preliminary  title)
- Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen (Univ. of Oslo) on ''Segmentation and
linearization from a cross-linguistic perspective'' (preliminary title)


Workshop Location:

The workshop and lodging will be at Lysebu, a conference center in the
middle of one of Oslo's major skiing areas (for cross-country as well as
down-hill) which is accessible by public transport.


Attendance:

Following the tradition of the earlier workshops, the total number of
participants will be limited to (approx.) 30 persons. Speakers of accepted
papers are automatically granted a place; the remaining ones are assigned
on a first-come-first-serve basis.


Abstract Submission:

We invite extended abstracts in PDF, RTF or Word format. Papers must not be
longer than ten pages (including figures and references), using 12 pt font,
1.5 line spacing, with 2.5 cm margins on all sides. Please include your
name, affiliation and e-mail address at the top of the page, directly below
the title. All abstracts will be reviewed by members of the program
committee. For final versions of accepted papers, precise formatting
instructions (for Word) will be issued.

Send your submission by October 1st to mad-08@ilos.uio.no

With previous workshops in the series, selected papers have later been
published in special issues of journals or as an edited volume in a
relevant series (e.g., for the 2005 workshop: M. Grabski et al. (eds.)
''Salience. Multidisciplinary perspectives on its function in discourse'',
to appear in the Mouton-de Gruyter series 'Trends in Linguistics. Studies
and Monographs' [TiLSM]). We are planning on following this approach for
MAD 08 as well.

Subject: Workshop on Contrastiveness and/or Scalar Implicatures 

	

Full Title: Workshop on Contrastiveness and/or Scalar Implicatures 
Short Title: Cand/orSI (CIL18) 

Date: 21-Jul-2008 - 26-Jul-2008
Location: Seoul, Korea, South 
Contact Person: Chungmin Lee

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description

A workshop on Contrastiveness in Information Structure and/or Scalar
Implicatures is held in conjunction with the 18th International Congress of
Linguists (CIL 18, July 21-26, 2008, Seoul, Korea). Deadline: August 31, 2007).
Visit the website (http://cil18.org ) or contact the organizer at clee@snu.ac.kr. 

It is fairly well established by now that meaning is regarded as representing
update potential rather than merely truth conditions, taking a dynamic
perspective on semantics and/or pragmatics. Topic - Focus information structure
becomes more complex because of discourse-connected, largely quantificational,
contrastiveness; sets of alternatives are involved in Contrastive Topic and
Contrastive Focus. Contrastiveness and the range of alternatives must be further
explored. 

At the same time, sets of alternatives are required in the computation of scalar
implicatures. What would be the range of relevant or comparable alternatives?
Gricean, neo-Gricean, relevance-theoretic or other 'relevant'? Utterances with
Contrastive Topic generate scalar implicatures. How other utterances generate
scalar implicatures? Is the exhaustivity operator exh good enough? What would be
an adequate representation - pragmatic, semantic or syntactic? How can a
game-theoretic approach serve as a new model? What other scales work except
Horn's entailment scales? We need a forum to discuss and resolve these
cutting-edge issues.
