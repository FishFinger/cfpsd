Project description:
The notion of stereotype, currently the subject of a renewed growth in
interest among researchers, lends itself to a multitude of approaches by
specialists in many different fields of study. In order to avoid any kind
of dispersion the current issue will deal solely with the linguistic and
discursive dimensions of the subject. While purely theoretical studies are
welcome, priority will be given to empirical analyses based on a corpus
which is defined as below:                                               =
=20
                            =20
We shall focus on the following topics, although of course this list is far
from exhaustive: =20
-=09Stereotypes and lexical combinatronics, that is fixed (congealed)
phenomena, in the broadest sense, collocational facts etc.
-=09Stereotypes and metaphors: especially in the realm of the theory of the
conceptional metaphor
-=09Stereotypes and paremiology: the analysis of proverbs and maxims, both =
in
language and speeches  =20
-=09Stereotypes and lexical semantics: the role of the stereotype in the
construction of lexical sense, meaning and reference=20
-=09Stereotypes and argumentation: the role of stereotypes in sequences of
arguments as well as the construction and use of stereotypes in speeches
  =20
Any other form of linguistic or discursive approach will be taken into
account by the authors and editors of this issue.

Submission of abstracts:
All abstracts are to be submitted in English, German, French, Spanish or
Russian and should consist of a short summary of around 500 words, plus a
bibliography of no more than 5 titles. The summary should present a
theoretical description of how the author intends to broach the subject as
well as the methodological approach he/she will adopt, while presenting
clearly the corpus to be studied along with his/her findings.

Abstracts to be sent to revuetil@u-bourgogne.fr before the dates indicated
below.

to whether to print or not will be based on anonymous peer assessment of
