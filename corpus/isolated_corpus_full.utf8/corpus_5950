Meeting Description:

The theme of this conference 'Research Methodologies in Sign Language Linguistics' highlights the fact that there are many different theoretical approaches that contribute to our understanding of this typological class of languages. Generative and cognitive approaches, quantitative and qualitative approaches all assist in proposing new generalizations about sign languages and, importantly, in independently validating previous proposals made in the field. Each approach provides a fresh perspective which can help our field move forward as a cumulative discipline.

TISLR 10 will include keynote presentations, organized sessions, and poster sessions on such topics as:

- Cognitive linguistics of sign languages
- Corpus linguistics of sign languages
- The emergence of sign languages in a historical context
- Field work on sign languages
- Language acquisition in L1 environments
- Language variation in sign languages
- Neurolinguistics/psycholinguistics of sign languages
- Phonology, phonetics, prosody of sign languages
- Morphology of sign languages
- Sign language and artistic endeavors
- Sign language and literature
- Sign recognition, synthesis, and understanding of sign languages
- Statistical language models of sign languages
- Syntax, semantics, pragmatics of sign languages
- Theoretical innovation in L2 acquisition of sign languages

Keynote Speakers:

Marlon Kuntze (Boston University)
Ceil Lucas (Gallaudet University)
Carol Padden (University of California, San Diego)
Josep Quer (ICREA & Universitat Pompeu Fabra)

Venue: Purdue University is located in Indiana, approximately 1.5 hrs. from  Indianapolis and 2.5 hrs from Chicago airports. Please consult the conference website for further information:
