Meeting Description:

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is o=
rganized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and Information =
(FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around Europe. The main fo=
cus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and computatio=
n. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well a=
s workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of in=
terest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and Computa=
tion.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500
students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into an import=
ant meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers int=
erested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. =
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI'2009 websi=
te: http://esslli2009.labri.fr/.=20

Call for Papers:

The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational, intro=
ductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 22nd annual Summer=
 School on important topics of active research in the broad interdisciplina=
ry area connecting logic, linguistics, computer science, and the cognitive =
sciences, structured within the 3 traditional ESSLLI streams:

- Language and Computation
- Language and Logic
- Logic and Computation

We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories.

Proposal Submission: All proposals should be submitted, using a prescribed =
form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website www.hum.ku.dk/e=
sslli2010, through EasyChair on http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=
=3Desslli2010, no later than Monday, September 7, 2009.=20

Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the guideli=
nes below while preparing their submissions; proposals that do not conform =
with these guidelines may not be considered.=20

Guidelines for Course And Workshop Proposals:

All Courses: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of=
 five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course proposals should give a brie=
f overview of the topic and a tentative content and structure of the course=
, as well as state the course's objectives and clearly specify prerequisite=
s, if any. Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course, should subm=
it two independent one-week courses (for example an introductory course in =
the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second).  T=
he ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two pro=
posed courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submission:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline
Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by the E=
SSLLI'2010 local organizers

Foundational Courses:=20

These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge=
. They are intended for people who wish to get acquainted with the problems=
 and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researcher=
s from other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring discipli=
nes, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research=
 community. Foundational courses should require no special prerequisites, b=
ut may presuppose some experience with scientific methods and general appre=
ciation of the field of the course.

Introductory Courses:=20

Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School. Th=
ey are intended to provide an introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field=
 for students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip t=
hem with a good understanding of the course field's basic methods and techn=
iques. Such courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields=
 to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouragi=
ng the development of a truly interdisciplinary research community. Introdu=
ctory courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can build on some=
 knowledge of the component fields; e.g., an introductory course in computa=
tional linguistics should address an audience which is familiar with the ba=
sics of linguistics and computation.  Proposals for introductory courses sh=
ould indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the =
area (if available).

Advanced Courses:=20

Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or Ph=
D students.  Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisite=
s in detail.

Workshops:=20

Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minute sessions, one per=
 day. The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. stu=
dents and other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops sh=
ould have a well defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialis=
ts in the theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify=
 the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and expe=
cted submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential submitters wo=
rking in the field of the workshop. The organizers are required to give a g=
eneral introduction to the theme during the first session of the workshop. =
 They are also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop=
 including inviting the submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of invite=
d speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible=
 for sending out a Call for Papers for the workshop and to organize the sel=
ection of the submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for wo=
rkshop submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all memb=
ers of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop contribut=
ors must register for the Summer School.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline
Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to ESSLLI'201=
0 PC chair
Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers
Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers
Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers
Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops
May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors
Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop proc=
eedings to the ESSLLI'2010 Local Organizers for reproduction.

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer S=
chool; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate to be deter=
mined by the Local Organizers.

Format for Proposals:=20

A form for submitting course and workshop proposals will be available soon =
on the ESSLLI 2010 website www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010.

The proposers are required to submit the following information:

-Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two per c=
ourse or workshop
-Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if available), of p=
roposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s);
-Title of proposed course/workshop;
-Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)
-Stream (one of: Language & Computation, Language & Logic, Logic & Computat=
ion)
-Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance to ESS=
LLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp. expected partici=
pation in the workshops)
-External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain external fu=
nding for travel and accommodation expenses)
-Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above=
 guidelines should be included here; in particular, course objectives and p=
rerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching experience relevant to the =
proposed course, and generally in the interdisciplinary field scope of ESSL=
LI.)

Financial Aspects:=20

Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all teac=
hing and organizing at the summer schools is done on a voluntary basis in o=
rder to keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organi=
zers are not paid for their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and=
 accommodation (up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to t=
he lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while proposals=
 from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot guarantee full rei=
mbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations outside Europe. Pl=
ease note that in case a course or workshop is to be taught/organized by tw=
o lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodatio=
n expenses for one lecturer; the splitting of that sum is up to the lecture=
rs.

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lect=
urers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover travel and =
accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ES=
SLLI'2010 lower.
