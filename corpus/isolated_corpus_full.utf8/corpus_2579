Full Title: Language Research 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2008 

Language Research is one of the oldest and most prestigious linguistic
journals published in Korea. It has continually published important papers
in diverse areas of theoretical and applied linguistics. More information
and listings of previous publications are available on our web page at
http://language.snu.ac.kr/language/pages/SL00026_00.jsp . 

With this call, we are accepting manuscripts for volume 44.1. The deadline
for submission for this volume is 28 February 2008. 

In addition to all subfields within general/theoretical linguistics, papers
addressing topics in psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics,
historical/comparative linguistics, and computational linguistics are
welcome. Though we see topics in Korean linguistics as the main area of
concentration for the journal, papers need not be restricted to issues
related to Korean.

Anonymous manuscripts should be submitted to the domestic or international
editor via the following addresses (PDF format preferred):
