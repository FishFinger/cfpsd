Full Title: Ehu International Workshop on Ergativity 

Date: 04-Nov-2009 - 06-Nov-2009
Location: Bilbao, Spain 
Contact Person: Itziar Laka
Meeting Email: ergativity@ehu.es
Web Site: http://www.kongresuak.ehu.es/p275-shergahm/en 

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 08-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

Approximately twenty five percent of the world's languages exhibit ergativity in their grammars. Despite the growing amount of recent research on ergativity, there is no shared understanding yet on its nature, or on how to implement it in linguistic theory, and despite advances made in the last decades in the areas of language acquisition and natural language processing, it is still unknown what the impact of ergativity and other associated linguistic phenomena is in language development and processing. 

Second Call for Papers
Deadline for abstract submission: 08-Jun-2009

This workshop intends to gather researchers in theoretical linguistics,
typology, acquisition and processing studies who work on ergative languages, in
order to discuss the latest developments and some resilient problems in the
study of ergativity as a linguistic trait.

Invited Speakers:
Julie Legate (U. of Pennsylvania)
Anoop Mahajan (UCLA)
Esther Torrego (UMass Boston)

Abstract Submission:
Researchers working on issues related to ergativity are invited to submit an
abstract for oral presentation. Presentations will be allotted 30 minutes plus
10 minutes for discussion. Authors are asked to submit their abstracts in two
.PDF files, one anonymous and one with the author's name and affiliation, to the
following address:
ergativity@ehu.es

The body of the message should include the title of the paper, name of the
author(s), affiliation(s), surface mail address and e-mail address. Abstracts
should be no longer than two pages in length (including examples and
references), in Times New Roman 12-point type, single line spacing and 2.5 cm.
margins. The official language of the workshop is English.
