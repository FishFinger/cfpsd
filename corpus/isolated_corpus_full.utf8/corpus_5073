Meeting Description:

Frames and Constructions: A Conference in Honor of Charles J. Fillmore
July 31-Aug 2, 2009
The University of California, Berkeley 

Call for Papers

Abstract submission via http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~fillmorefest, the
conference website, which is now available.

We will accept abstracts until April 30!

The Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley and the
International Computer Science Institute are pleased to announce a conference in
honor of Charles J. Fillmore on the occasion of his 80th birthday. The theme of
the conference is Fillmore's contributions to Linguistics for nearly five decades.

We anticipate major sessions on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar, along
with other presentations linked specifically to Fillmore's work, and its
relation to the allied fields of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and
natural language processing.

Plenary Talks: Speakers include: Gilles Fauconnier, Paul Kay, George Lakoff,
Laura Michaelis, Manfred Pinkal, and Dan Slobin.

Special Guest Lecture: Charles J. Fillmore

Abstract Submission:
Those interested in presenting should send 500-word abstracts by April 30, for a
response by mid-May. Abstract submission information is on the website. Follow
the instructions, submitting both a pdf of the abstract (500-word maximum) and a
short description (100-words) of the paper for the abstract book.

The conference will be relatively small, and contributions addressing Fillmore's
work explicitly will be given priority for oral presentation. However, we will
accept posters on a broader range of cognitive linguistic topics; applicants
should indicate specifically whether they would be willing to consider the
poster medium of presentation.

Lodging:
There are some campus dormitory rooms reserved for the conference period, for
those who want inexpensive lodging, and inquiries about them should be sent
immediately to fillmorefest@berkeley.edu, ideally with header "fillmorefest
accommodation".

Please join us to celebrate a most important figure in Linguistics.
