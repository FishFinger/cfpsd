Call for Papers 

Deadline for abstract submission: 20 November 2009
Notification of acceptance: 1 February 2010

Abstracts are solicited for contributed papers for presentation as 30-minute
oral contributions or as posters. Contributions relating to the conference
themes are especially encouraged; there will also be sessions for non-thematic
papers.

The overall theme for the conference is "Gesture as language, gesture and
language." Our goal is to bring together researchers who have a gestural
perspective on language to encourage cross-fertilization between different
approaches and areas of research. Some specific topics that address this theme
are the following:

- Speech as gesture. How are gestures used to create phonological structure?
What are the fundamental gestural units, and how are they coordinated? How
discrete or continuous are the gestures of language? How parallel or different
are the gestural organization of spoken and signed languages?
- Phonology of signed languages. The same issues are relevant for signed
languages as for spoken languages.
- Gesture with language. How are non-linguistic gestures used in concert with
language? How are these gestures coordinated with speech? How similar or
different are the non-linguistic gestures accompanying spoken and signed
languages, and are their functions similar across modalities?
- Audiovisual aspects of speech. To what extent are visual cues exploited in
spoken language communication? How are aural and visual information integrated? 
- Diversity of speech gestures, focusing on Native American languages. How
varied are the gestures used by different languages? How does this diversity
inform our understanding of phonological structure?
- Modulation of linguistic gestures through prosody or sound change. How are
gestures modified by linguistic or communicative context? What are the natural
paths of change over time in the gestural structure of languages? How are
phonological systems affected by such changes? How is the effect of prosody
similar, or different, in signed and spoken language? What different effects
does prosody have on gestures produced using different articulators, in speech
or in sign?

Abstracts are to be submitted as a PDF file containing an anonymous one-page
abstract at the following address:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=labphon12.

You will need to create an EasyChair account if you do not already have one.
Abstracts must be in 12 point Times or Times New Roman font, formatted for A4 or
US Letter size paper with margins of 2.5 cm or 1 inch. The maximum length for
the text of the abstract is one page; a second page may be used for figures
and/or bibliographical references only. 

The author's name and affiliation should not appear in the PDF file. One
individual may be an author on no more than two submitted abstracts. All
abstracts must be written in English. Presentations may be given in English or
in ASL.

When completing the submission form on Easy Chair, you will see a space which
asks for an abstract to be typed in. This is not the place for your real
abstract! Please enter a short statement (no more than 50 words) summarizing
your paper. Further down the page is where you will upload your real abstract as
an attachment (PDF file). Before uploading, please ensure that all special
characters display properly.

The submission form also asks you to identify which of the conference theme(s)
your paper relates to. You may select one or more than one. If your paper does
not relate to any of the themes, please select "non-thematic".

Authors whose papers are accepted will have the opportunity to submit an updated
abstract for inclusion in the conference program. Authors of papers accepted for
oral presentation will need to submit a complete written version of their paper
for distribution to the discussants, no later than 1 May 2010. It is expected
that the proceedings of this conference will be published as a special issue of
the new Laboratory Phonology journal; further details will be forthcoming.

If you have any question concerning the submission procedure or you encounter
any problems, please send an email to the following address : labfon12@unm.edu .
Additional information, including a list of invited speakers and discussants, is
available at the conference website, http://www.unm.edu/~labfon12/ .

The abstracts will be evaluated anonymously by the scientific committee. Please
feel free to forward this call for papers to others who might be interested.
