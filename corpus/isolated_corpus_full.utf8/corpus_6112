Mining User-Generated Content for Security - MINUCS 2009

9 December 2009, Venice, Italy

web: http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs

email: minucs [ad] cs [dot] helsinki [dot] fi

This event is co-located with the First International Conference on User Ce=
ntric Media - UCMedia 2009 (http://www.usercentricmedia.org) in Venice,
9-11 December 2009

---------------
 AIM AND SCOPE
---------------

The vast and growing amount of user-generated textual content, including on=
line news streams, blogs, electronic encyclopedias (e.g., the Wikipedia), a=
nd other openly accessible and dynamically changing data readily available =
on the Web has led to the emergence of new approaches to extracting valuabl=
e, structured, and previously unknown information from such data. The aim o=
f this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry=
 who develop technologies for mining open-source user-generated textual dat=
a on the Web, as well as end-users interested in exploiting such technologi=
es for knowledge discovery. The emphasis is placed on large-scale text mini=
ng systems and application-oriented approaches to processing on-line textua=
l content in the context of security-related applications.
Examples of such applications include:

 * global medical and epidemic surveillance,
 * conflict early warning,
 * early detection of man-made or environmental hazards,
 * risk assessment,
 * border surveillance,
 * cross-border crime detection,
 * terrorism counterintelligence,
 * other applications relevant for security, law enforcement, and public he=
alth institutions

Due to a multitude of challenges of diverse and complex nature that are rel=
ated to automating the process of mining user-generated content on the Web,=
 we believe that this workshop will serve as a forum to bring together rese=
archers from different areas, including data mining, language technology, c=
omputational linguistics, information sciences, information retrieval and W=
eb mining, for sharing ideas and discussion. In particular, we believe that=
 there is an important gap to be filled, since the aforementioned research =
communities have had limited interaction previously in the context of the t=
opic of the Workshop. The second major goal is to engage governmental and i=
nter-state user communities, and to bring them together with scientists and=
 funding agencies.

--------------------
 TOPICS OF INTEREST
--------------------

 * Mining from news streams, blogs, document repositories, and other openly=
 accessible and dynamically changing data, including Web 2.0 content, for t=
he purpose of identifying threats to security or public health,

 * Emphasis on multilingual approaches, and work on languages other than En=
glish,

 * Applications, such as information extraction, classification, summarizat=
ion, sentiment detection, event detection, event forecasting, trend detecti=
on, information fusion, and more,

 * Contributions in the form of applications (working systems and
prototypes) as well as theoretical results are welcome,

 * Application domains include crisis-related event reporting, political an=
d environmental analysis, and medical intelligence, under the general umbre=
lla of the security intelligence domain,

 * Methods including machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid approaches.

NB: Please note, this Workshop welcomes all work on computational approache=
s to the analysis of textual data for gathering information from openly acc=
essible sources only. Submissions that focus on legal questions stemming fr=
om snooping, spying, privacy infringement or violation, etc., will not be c=
onsidered relevant to the Theme of the Workshop, and the Committee will not=
 be able to review them.

------------
 SUBMISSION
------------

We invite papers addressing primarily the language technology, natural lang=
uage processing, data mining and information retrieval communities, as well=
 as the relevant end-user groups.
Submissions are invited in two categories:

 * regular: research papers presenting novel approaches and solutions, and
 * short (posters): system demonstrations, descriptions, and work in progre=
ss

Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a web-based submission ser=
ver.
Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNICST style for LaTeX in producing =
the PDF document.
More information on this style can be found at:
http://www.springer.com/computer?SGWID=3D3D0-146-6-564009-0

The page limit for regular papers is 6 pages, while short papers are limite=
d to 4 pages.  The information about the author(s) must be omitted in the s=
ubmitted papers, since the review process will be blind.

More detailed information about submission is available on:
http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs/authors.shtml

Each submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program Comm=
ittee.  Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to=
 produce camera-ready versions.

-------------
 PUBLICATION
-------------

All workshop papers will be published in the official proceedings, Springer=
 Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics a=
nd Telecommunications Engineering - LNICST, of the main conference.

Selected workshop papers will be published in "ACM Springer Mobile Networks=
 and Applications (MONET) Journal Special Issue on Mobility and User-Centri=
c Media".

All workshop papers will be also published on the UCMedia2009 Website.
