PURPOSE / HISTORY:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
   fields.  We anticipate to have 2,400 or more attendees from over 85
   countries participating in the 2009 joint conferences.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
   among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
   inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
   outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
   applications) will be covered during the conferences.

   WORLCOMP'09 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
   lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
   poster presentations.  In recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers
   included: Prof. David A. Patterson (U. of California, Berkeley);
   Prof. Michael J. Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John H. Holland
   (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. Brian D. Athey (U. of Michigan,
   Ann Arbor), Prof. H. J. Siegel (Colorado State U.); Prof. Barry Vercoe
   (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U. of California, Berkeley);
   Prof. Jun Liu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys (OLPC + developer of X
   Window); Dr. Chris Rowen (President and CEO, Tensilica, Inc.); and
   many other distinguished speakers.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft papers by
   uploading them to http://worldcomp.cviog.uga.edu/ .
   Submissions must be received by Feb. 25, 2009 and they must be in
   either MS doc or pdf formats (about 5 to 7 pages - single space,
   font size of 10 to 12).  All reasonable typesetting formats are
   acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to
   follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their papers for
   publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited
   to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously
   published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The
   first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,
   name, affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author.
   The first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author
   and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the
   content of the paper.  Finally, the name of the conference that
   the paper is being submitted to must be stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
   impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts
   in the field who are independent of the conference program committee.
   The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of
   the program committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of
   the track that the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make
   the final decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed
   by one member of the program committee.

PROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING SESSIONS/WORKSHOPS:

   Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from
   different authors (12 papers in the case of workshops).  The
   session chairs will be responsible for all aspects of their
   sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...
   The names of session chairs will appear as Associate Editors in
   the conference proceedings and on the cover of the books.

   Proposals to organize sessions should include the following
   information: name and address (+ email) of proposer, title of
   session, a 100-word description of the topic of the session,
   the name of the conference the session is submitted for
   consideration, and a short description on how the session will
   be advertised (in most cases, session proposers solicit papers
   from colleagues and researchers whose work is known to the
   session proposer).  email your session proposal to H. R. Arabnia
   (address is given above).  We would like to receive the proposals
   by January 16, 2009.

IMPORTANT DATES:

   Jan.  16, 2009:    Proposals for organizing/chairing sessions/workshops
   Feb.  25, 2009:    Submission of papers (about 5 to 7 pages)

   of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing; AI;
   imaging science; databases; simulation; software engineering;
   embedded systems; internet and web technologies; communications;
   computer security; and bioinformatics.) The Program Committee for
   individual conferences is currently being formed.  Those interested
   in joining the Program Committee should email H. R. Arabnia
   (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation
   and position, complete mailing address, email address, a short
   biography together with research interests and the name of the
   conference offering to help with.
   Many who have already joined the committees of individual tracks
   are renowned leaders, scholars, researchers, scientists and
   practitioners of the highest ranks; many are directors of research
   laboratories, fellows of various societies, heads/chairs of
   departments, deans and provosts.

LOCATION OF CONFERENCES:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo hotel, Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by hotels).  This is
   a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities and over 3,000
   rooms.  It is minutes from the airport with 24-hour shuttle
   service to and from the airport.  This hotel has many recreational
   attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools, sunning decks, Easy
   River, wave pool, lighted tennis courts, health spa, nightly shows,
   a number of restaurants, ...  The negotiated room rate for
   conference attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within
