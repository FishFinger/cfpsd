Meeting Description:

Organizers: Felix Bildhauer and Philippa Cook

This theme-session will specifically address lesser-studied phenomena invol=
ving
the position preceding the finite verb in German main clause declaratives (=
the
Vorfeld) whilst aiming explicitly to draw in the formal analysis on finding=
s
made available by corpus linguistics and/or psycholinguistics. This is moti=
vated
by the fact that various studies have shown that a reliance on introspectiv=
e
data has led to generalizations being missed or to false assumptions being =
made.=20

The findings of several recent works have led to a call for revision, or ev=
en
rejection, of some standard assumption(s) of theoretical significance for t=
he
analysis of the Vorfeld. For instance, it was long assumed that the Vorfeld
could house precisely one constituent. Recent corpus-based work has, howeve=
r,
shown that multiple-occupancy of the Vorfeld is not as uncommon as previous=
ly
assumed (M=FCller 2003). The exact conditions in which such constructions a=
re
licensed still remain to be explicitly formulated though. In a similar vein=
,
Meinunger (2007) shows that the long-adopted assumption that the German obj=
ect
pronoun es cannot occur in the Vorfeld is not empirically tenable. Again, t=
he
precise licensing conditions are all but clear. Taking a further example,
although it has long been known that a subject and non-finite verb may co-o=
ccur
in the Vorfeld, a detailed account of the semantic and informational-struct=
ural
properties of this construction is still required. Another area of interest=
 is
less well-documented information structural constellations involving the
Vorfeld. For instance, it is often assumed that the Vorfeld corresponds to =
some
information structural category (Topic, Focus, Contrast etc.) yet Fanselow =
&
Lenertov=E0 (to appear) introduce novel data suggesting that the relationsh=
ip
between syntax and information-structure is in need of refinement.=20

In addition to contributions considering data from verb-second languages, w=
e
also welcome proposals addressing related phenomena in other language group=
s
(e.g. the pre-clitic position in Slavic, V2-similar effects in Romance etc.=
).
The theme-session aims to attract researchers working in the fields of corp=
us
linguistics, psycholinguistics as well as researchers in theoretical lingui=
stics
with a strong empirical component.=20
