Meeting Description:

The 1st Bangor Postgraduate Conference on Bilingualism and Bimodalism will be an
oppotunity for postgraduates studying in the UK working on linguistic aspects of
bilingualism and bimodalism to present their research and findings, and to come
into contact with new ideas relevant to their work. The event will be truly
bimodal and biingual by the provision of English-BSL interpreters for the
duration of the conference - enabling Deaf and hearing participants to fully
enagage in all conference activities. 

Call for Papers

The Committee invites submissions for presentations and posters on the subjects
of bilingualism and bimodalism, which can include the disciplines of
linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, education, sociology, & Deaf studies,
though their relevance to language must be explicit. Abstracts of 300 words
maximum (excluding references, title and author information) on any of the above
topics are required by 22 June 2009.

Abstracts will be submitted electronically to bbbconference@bangor.ac.uk. For
further information, please see our website http://www.bilingualism.bangor.ac.uk
or contact the Committee at the above email address.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
