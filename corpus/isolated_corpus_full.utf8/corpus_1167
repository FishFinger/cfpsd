=========================================

                 Second Call for Workshop Proposals
             to be held in conjunction with the
                6th International Conference
      "Recent Advances on Natural Language Processing"
          RANLP-2007 (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007)
                    27-29 September 2007
                     Borovets, Bulgaria

Further to the four successful workshops held in conjunction
to the 5th International Conference "Recent Advances in
Natural Language Processing" (RANLP-2005,
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2005), we are pleased to announce a
call for workshop proposals for RANLP-2007.

RANLP 2007 invites the submission of workshop proposals on
any topic of interest to the NLP community, ranging from
fundamental research issues to more applied industrial or
commercial aspects. The format of the workshop will be
determined by the organisers. Workshops can vary in length
from a half day to a full day and can also feature demo
sessions. Accepted workshops will receive one free
registration to the RANLP-2007 (full registration incl.
tutorials, workshop, conference, reception and conference
dinner). Workshop attendees must pay the workshop
registration fee.

The workshops will be held on Wednesday, September 26,
immediately preceding the technical conference, and after the
three days of the RANLP-2007 tutorials (23-25 September
2007). The workshops will take place at the main RANLP-2007
conference venue (Samokov hotel). If more than four workshops
are selected, the RANLP-2007 organisers will rent additional
premises in the neighbouring hotels at Borovets.

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:



Proposals for workshops should be no more than 5 pages in
length. They should contain the following information:

1.. Title and brief technical description of the workshop,
    specifying the goals and the technical issues that it
    will focus on;
2.. A brief description of target audience, including
    estimates of the numbers of submissions and attendees (a
    tentative list of potential contributors could be
    useful);
3.. A list of related workshops or similar events held in the
    last 3 years, or to be held in 2007;
4.. A list of individuals who have agreed to be part of the
    workshop Programme Committee if the workshop proposal is
    accepted;
5.. The names and contact information (web page, email
    address) of the proposed Organising Committee. This
    Committee should consist of at least two or three people
    competent in the issues to be addressed;
6.. A description of the experience of the proposed
    organisers in the topics covered by the workshop and in
    general, in organising events.


The workshop Organising Committee will be responsible for the
following:

a.. Producing a web page and a "Call for
    Papers/Participation" for their workshop. The URL should
    be sent to the RANLP organisers who will link the
    workshop URL to the main conference site. The call should
    make it clear that at least one author of each accepted
    submission must attend the workshop and that all workshop
    participants must pay the RANLP-2007 workshop
    registration fee. Finally, it should also clearly
    describe the process by which the Organising Committee
    will select the papers and demos - e.g., review by
    experienced Programme Committee members;
b.. Providing a brief description of the workshop for the
    RANLP conference site by March 16, 2007 and workshop
    programme in early September 2007;
c.. Organising the paper submission, review process and
    authors notification entirely independently of the
    RANLP-2007 conference;
d.. Selecting the papers, participants and the format of the
    workshop;
e.. Informing the RANLP-2007 organisers before August 1, 2007
    about the technical facilities and special requirements
    needed to held the workshop;
f.. Advertising the workshop beyond the RANLP conference web
    page and disseminating the calls for papers/participation
    as stated above;
g.. Producing title pages (including Preface) for the
    workshop proceedings before September 4, 2007;
h.. Checking the full proceedings PDF file before September
    7, 2007.


The RANLP 2007 Organising Committee will be responsible for
the following:

a.. Providing a link to a workshop's local page;
b.. Publishing the workshop proceedings and their timely
    delivery to Borovets;
c.. Determining the workshop venue in hotel Samokov or other
    hotel in Borovets (this is to be done together with the
    workshop organisers);
d.. Providing logistics support (e.g. renting the workshop
    lecturing hall, taking care of technical facilities,
    coffee breaks, registration facilities, Internet);
e.. Providing copies of the workshop proceedings to
    attendees;
f.. Advising the workshop organisers as and if needed.

If the workshop organisers intend to host an invited talk, it
is recommended that they invite somebody from the main
conference invited speakers or participants. However, if the
workshop organisers decide to invite another speaker, it is
very likely that they will have to secure the financial
support for the workshop invited speaker themselves.

All full-day workshops will have the same fee. Workshop fees
at RANLP-05 ranged between 40-120 euro, depending on the
different categories of participants:
students/academics/industrial participants, early/late
registration, developed countries/countries will lower
standard. We expect that similar figures for the fees can be
used, with some 10% increase to cover the increasing costs of
rents, publishing, coffee breaks etc.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:

Workshop proposals and any enquiries should be sent by e-mail to

  Kiril Simov - Workshop coordinator - <kivs[AT]bultreebank.org>

with a copy to the ranlp-mail <ranlp07[AT]lml.bas.bg>.

Proposals should be submitted in PDF format. Submitted
proposals that follow the above requirements will be reviewed
by the RANLP-2007 Organising Committee with respect to the
following criteria:

  a.. Relevance, importance, and timeliness of the topic;
  b.. Completeness, clarity, and quality of the workshop
      proposal;
  c.. Experience of the presenters in the proposed topic;
  d.. Viability of the workshop.
