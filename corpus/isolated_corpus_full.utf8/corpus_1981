CULTUS: THE JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL MEDIATION AND COMMUNICATION (1st issue)


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS



Call for Abstracts: 20th November 2007
Paper submission: 20th March 2008
First issue: September 2008

Cultus: the Journal of intercultural mediation and communication is an
international refereed journal focussing on the role of culture in
constructing, perceiving and translating reality. The Journal aims to
develop an awareness of the interplay between language and culture in
communication.
Managing diversity is now an issue, as an ever growing number of people are
becoming increasingly involved in communicative interactions with others
from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds: in business, education,
media, tourism and also through immigration and political conflict. This
Journal provides a stimulating forum, focussing on the experience of both
practitioners and academics; their analysis of languages and cultures, and
how the differences have been, or might be, managed.
The goal of this Journal is to promote research, education and training in
communication by investigating language, languages, cultural models,
conflict, mediation and interculturality. Furthermore, since translation is
considered as mediation between cultures it will be included as a way of
seeing cultural linguistics at work.
A fascinating feature of this Journal is constituted by a debate discussing
a topic of relevant interest to those working in the field.
The first issue will include an interview between Andrew Chesterman and Mona
Baker, where she will discuss her views on conflict and mediation.
