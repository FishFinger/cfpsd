General Chair And Coordinator:

   H. R. Arabnia, PhD
   Professor, Computer Science
   Editor-in-Chief, The Journal of Supercomputing (Springer)
   The University of Georgia
   Department of Computer Science
   415 Graduate Studies Research Center
   Athens, Georgia 30602-7404, USA

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering
   of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing.  Many of the 24 joint conferences in
   WORLDCOMP are the premier conferences for presentation of
   advances in their respective fields.  We anticipate to have
   2000 or more attendees from over 75 countries participating in
   the 2007 joint conferences.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a
   common place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a
   forum for exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that
   interact.  The model used to form these annual conferences
   facilitates communication among researchers from all over the world
   in different fields of computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing.  Both inward research (core areas of computer
   science and engineering) and outward research (multi-disciplinary,
   inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered during the
   conferences.

Proposal for Organizing Sessions/Workshops:

   Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from
   different authors (12 papers in the case of workshops).
   The session chairs will be responsible for all aspects of
   their sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing,
   selecting, ...  The names of session chairs will appear as
   Associate Editors in the conference proceedings and on the
   cover of the books.

   Proposals to organize sessions should include the following
   information: name and address (+ email) of proposer, title of
   session, a 100-word description of the topic of the session,
   the name of the conference the session is submitted for
   consideration, and a short description on how the session will
   be advertised (in most cases, session proposers solicit papers
   from colleagues and researchers whose work is known to the
   session proposer).  E-mail your proposal to H. R. Arabnia
   (address is given above).  We would like to receive the
   proposals by December 1, 2006.

Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft paper
   (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 20, 2007. E-mail submissions in MS
   document or PDF formats are preferable (Fax or postal
   submissions are also fine.)  All reasonable typesetting formats
   are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be
   asked to follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their
   papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
   limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been
   previously published or currently submitted for publication
   elsewhere.  The first page of the draft paper should include:
   title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, email
   address, and telephone number for each author.  The first page
   should also identify the name of the author who will be presenting
   the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that
   would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally, the name
   of the conference that the paper is being submitted to must be
   stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance,
   clarity, impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by
   two experts in the field who are independent of the conference
   program committee.  The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed
   by two members of the program committee who will recommend a
   decision to the chair of the track that the paper has been
   submitted to.  The chair will make the final decision.  Lastly, the
   Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one member of the program
   committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World
   Academy of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific
   computing; artificial intelligence; imaging science; databases;
   simulation; software engineering; embedded systems; internet
   and web technologies; communications; computer security; and
   bioinformatics.) The Program Committee for individual
   conferences is currently being formed.  Those interested in
   joining the Program Committee should email H. R. Arabnia
   (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation
   and position, complete mailing address, email address, tel/fax
   numbers, a short biography together with research interests and
   the name of the conference offering to help with.

Location of Conferences:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort hotel,
   Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by
   hotels).  The Monte Carlo Resort is a mega hotel with excellent
   conference facilities and over 3,000 rooms.  The hotel is
   minutes from the airport with 24-hour shuttle service to and
   from the airport.  This hotel has many recreational attractions,
   including: waterfalls, spa, pools and kiddie pools, sunning
   decks, Easy River water ride, wave pool with cascades, lighted
   tennis courts, health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool,
   sauna, ...), arcade game rooms, nightly shows, snack bars, a
   number of restaurants, shopping area, bars, ...  Many of these
   attractions are open 24 hours a day and most are suitable for
   families and children.  The negotiated room rate for conference
   attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within walking
   distance from most other attractions (major shopping areas,
   recreational destinations, fine dining and night clubs, free
   street shows, Golf courses...).
