Call for Papers

All languages employ some means of classifying lexico-grammatical concepts such
as noun classes, classifiers, quantifiers and grammatical number. These systems
of classification can take diverse and varied morphosyntactic forms and have
relative degrees of lexicalization and grammaticalization.

Noun classification systems, including noun classes and classifiers, shape many
aspects of language structure: in particular, they help expand the lexicon of a
language and contribute to the structuring of discourse by way of reference
tracking and management. Their role in lexical and grammatical structure is
demonstrated by the correlates with human cognition, perception as well as
social and cultural patterns.

In this workshop we would like to focus on the following issues concerning noun
classification: 
a) the role of assignment criteria in noun class languages and their
interdependence; 
b) the semantic and pragmatic functions of noun classification and their
implications for lexical and grammatical structure; 
c) the acquisition of noun class and classifier systems; and finally, 
d) the interface between noun classification and number, as evidenced by the
common expression of noun class and gender, and the complementary relationship
between the processes of unitization and pluralization.

The data will be drawn from a wide range of genetically and typologically
different language families such as Bantu, Indo-European, Semitic, Sino-Tibetan,
Japanese and Iroquoian.

Papers will be 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for discussion. Please submit your
abstract as a file attachment (preferably pdf) to Marcin Kilarski
(kilarski@amu.edu.pl).  The length of the abstract should not exceed 500 words.
The deadline for submission is May 1st.
