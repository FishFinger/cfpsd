The IJCAI-09 Workshop on

Automated Reasoning about Context and Ontology Evolution (ARCOE-09)
http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/ARCOE-09

July 11-12, 2009
Pasadena, California, USA

held at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(IJCAI-09)
http://ijcai-09.org


ARCOE-09 Highlights: McGuinness' and Baader's Invited Talks; IJCAI set
workshop dates to July 11-12, 2009


-- Description of the workshop --

Methods of automated reasoning have solved a large number of problems in
Computer Science by using formal ontologies expressed in logic. Over the
years, though, each problem or class of problems has required a different
ontology, and sometimes a different version of logic. Moreover, the
processes of conceiving, controlling and maintaining an ontology and its
versions have turned out to be inherently complex. All this has motivated
much investigation in a wide range of disparate disciplines -- from
logic-based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning to Software Engineering,
from Databases to Multimedia -- about how to relate ontologies to one
another.

ARCOE-09 aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners from core
areas of Artificial Intelligence (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,
Contexts, and Ontologies) to discuss these kinds of problems and relevant
results. Historically, there have been at least three different, yet
interdependent motivations behind this type of research: defining the
relationship between an ontology and its context, providing support to
ontology engineers, enhancing problem solving and communication for software
agents.

Ontology and Context.  Most application areas have recognised the need for
representing and reasoning about knowledge that is distributed over many
resources. Such knowledge depends on its context, i.e., on the syntactic
and/or semantic structure of such resources. Research on information
integration, distributed knowledge management, the semantic web, multi-agent
and distributed reasoning have pinned down different aspects of how
ontologies relate to and/or develop within their context.

Ontology Engineering.  Ontology engineers are not supposed to succeed right
from the beginning when (individually or collaboratively) developing an
ontology. Despite their expertise and any assistance from domain experts,
revision cycles are the rule. Research on the automation of the process of
engineering an ontology has improved efficiency and reduced the introduction
of unintended meanings by means of interactive ontology editors. Moreover,
ontology matching has studied the process of manual, off-line alignment of
two or more known ontologies.

Problem Solving and Communication for Agents.  Agents that communicate with
one another without having full access to their respective ontologies or
that are programmed to face new non-classifiable situations must change
their own ontology dynamically at run-time -- they cannot rely on human
intervention. Research on this problem has either concentrated on
non-monotonic reasoning and belief revision or on changes of signature,
i.e., of the grammar of the ontology's language, with a minimal disruption
to the original theory.

ARCOE-09 will provide a multi-disciplinary forum, where differences in
methodologies, representation languages and techniques are over-arched and
hopefully overcome. Accordingly, the workshop will be structured into four
tracks: three of them will focus on specific areas, the fourth one will
foster links and integration.

Track 1:  Context and Ontology
This track will select and present works about Context and Ontology, a
well-established research area that has mainly concentrated on the
relationship between contexts and ontologies for distributed information and
for the enhancement of software agents.

Track 2:  Common Sense and Non-Monotonic Reasoning for Ontologies
This track will select and present works about logic-based Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning, a classic area of AI, which since its origins
has produced remarkable results on logic-based methods for supporting
knowledge engineers and for enhancing software agents.

Track 3:  Automated Ontology Evolution
This track will select and present works about Automated Ontology Evolution,
an area which in recent years has been drawing the attention of Artificial
Intelligence and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning on the automation of
ontology evolution.

Track 4: Links and integration
This track will foster links and integration by means of invited talks and
(panel) discussions. Topics that are likely to be covered are: the
formalisation of software engineering concepts for ontology development; the
relationship between automated reasoning and information retrieval;
relationships between representation languages; relationships between
canonical domains; relationships between contexts and ontology evolution and
between Non-Monotonic Reasoning and ontology evolution. Prof. Deborah
McGuinness and prof. Franz Baader have recently accepted ARCOE-09's
invitation to deliver an invited talk. The titles of their contributions
will be made available after the submission deadline.

ARCOE-09 will bring the participants to position the various approaches with
respect to one another. Hopefully, though, the workshop will also start a
process of cross-pollination and set out the constitution of a truly
interdisciplinary research-community dedicated to automated reasoning about
contexts and ontology evolution.
