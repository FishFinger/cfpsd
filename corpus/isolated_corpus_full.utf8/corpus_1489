Inaugural International Conference on Music Communication Science
5-7 December, 2007
University of NSW, Sydney, Australia

Announcement and brief CALL FOR PAPERS
Submissions due July 2

The inaugural International Conference on Music Communication Science (ICOMCS) will be the flagship event of SummerFest '07 and will bring together people interested in an interdisciplinary understanding or application of music cognition, perception and performance. 

This meeting incorporates a celebration of the first 10 years of the Australian Music & Psychology Society (formed in 1996; seeÂ­ http://marcs.uws.edu.au/links/amps/), and will feature four keynote speakers. The Conference is supported by the Human Communication Science Network (HCSNet Â­ www.hcsnet.edu.au), which promotes interdisciplinary research in speech, language, and sonics, and will fall under the organisational umbrella of the HCSNet SummerFest. 

The conference will attract people from all walks of research and performance life, including musicologists, psychologists, educators, linguists, composers, engineers, computer scientists, speech scientists, physicists, philosophers and performance artists. The aim of the conference is to bring a wide range of presenters together, ranging from students to established researchers with an interest in finding or presenting synergies from several disciplines to help solve problems in music, or to use elements of music and music research to address problems in other disciplines.

Performance items and research papers will be considered. Abstracts and 4-page full-papers for peer-review can be submitted. Symposia organised around predetermined themes are encouraged. Sessions will consist of short (4 minute 'Speed' papers) and regular length presentations. Submissions are due on Monday July 2.

Details and the full Call for Papers can be found at the ICOMCS web site: http://marcs.uws.edu.au/links/ICoMusic. For more information contact the conference deputy chair Kate Stevens kj.stevens@uws.edu.au (before June 7) or the conference chair Emery Schubert E.Schubert@unsw.edu.au (from June 7).
