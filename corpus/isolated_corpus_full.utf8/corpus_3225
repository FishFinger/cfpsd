Meeting Description:

The Formal Description of Slavic Languages (FDSL) conference was first held
in 1995 at the University of Leipzig. Up till 2006, the biannual FDSL was
hosted in turn by the University of Leipzig and the University of Potsdam.
Since 2006, when the first 'halftime' FDSL 6.5 was held at the University
of Nova Gorica (Slovenia), FDSL is became an annual conference. This year's
halftime FDSL 7.5 will be held at the Independent University of Moscow on
December 6-8, 2008. 

Call for Papers

We are pleased to announce the next European Conference on Formal
Description of Slavic Languages (FDSL 7.5) to be held at the Independent
University of Moscow on December 6-8, 2008. FDSL 7.5 will be the second
FDSL conference organized in a mainly Slavic-speaking country (after FDSL
6.5 in Nova Gorica, Slovenia).

Tentative list of invited speakers:
John F. Bailyn, Stony Brook University
?eljko Bo?kovi?, University of Connecticut
Hana Filip, University of Florida
Ora Matushansky, Utrecht University
Asya Pereltsvaig, Stanford University

Abstracts are invited for 30-minute presentations (20-minute presentation
plus 10 minutes for discussion) on topics dealing with formal aspects of
Slavic syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology or psycholinguistics.
Following the tradition established by FDSL 6.5, there will be no parallel
sessions at FDSL 7.5, but there will be a poster session.

Abstracts must be anonymous and consist of no more than two pages (margins:
2.5 cm or 1 inch, size of characters: 12 points, spacing: single),
including references, figures and data. The abstract must be submitted as a
.pdf file (make sure that all fonts are embedded). If it was converted from
a .doc file, please attach it too. Note that an individual cannot submit
more than one single or more than one co-authored paper.

Abstracts must be submitted to fdsl7.5@gmail.com by September 1, 2008.

Please include the following information in the body of the e-mail message:

(1) Title of your talk
(2) Your name
(3) Your affiliation
(4) Your mail address
(5) Your e-mail address
(6) Whether you wish your abstract not to be considered for the poster session.

All abstracts will be anonymously reviewed by the board of external
referees. Preference will be given to presentations not duplicated at other
major conferences.

Authors whose abstracts are accepted will be notified by October 13, 2008. 
FDSL 7.5 will have its proceedings published. The deadlines for paper
submission and publication guidelines will be announced in due time.

Prosodic Alignment at the Word Level

Mannheim, Germany
November 20-21, 2008

Deadline for abstracts:  July 1, 2008

Topic:
Organization of segments into prosodic constituents is well known to be
sensitive to morphological boundaries. Thus, the difference between the cluster
'tr' being syllabified as a complex onset in the English word 'nitrate' but
being coda 't' plus onset 'r' instead in 'night rate' evidently is a result of
their difference in morphological structure.

Currently, a widely accepted approach to this kind of phenomenon involves the
notion of 'alignment'. According to this, prosodic domains are in place to
satisfy constraints that demand that all morphological constituent boundaries of
a particular kind (e.g. word, stem, affix) coincide with a prosodic constituent
boundary of a particular kind (e.g. phonological word, foot, syllable).

This specialized workshop is on alignment, with focus on word-internal
morphological and prosodic constituents. The workshop is to be centered on
empirical generalizations rather than being committed to any particular
theoretical framework.

We particularly welcome contributions regarding:

1. Effects of morphosyntactic structure mediated by prosodic constituency,
including both effects at the phonemic level and effects at the phonetic level
-- in particular among the latter, phonetical or laboratory phonological studies
on subliminal boundary effects.
2. From a crosslinguistic perspective: what sorts of morphological distinctions
(e.g. affixes vs. affixoids) are reflected prosodically?
3. Similarly, what sorts of prosodic constituents are involved? Are there
alignment effects that relevantly do not refer to the phonological word but
rather the foot or the syllable?

For practical reasons, our principal interest is in the following languages (in
alphabetical order): English, French, German, Hungarian, and Polish,
but also extends to other languages (esp. of Europe) including nonstandard
varieties of the languages already mentioned.

Presentations will be 35 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of discussion. 
Deadline is July 1, for abstracts of 2 pages maximum (including examples and
references). Two copies -- one anonymous, one showing name and affiliation --
should be submitted in PDF format, to: align@ids-mannheim.de

Working language at the workshop will be English.

Expenses for travel and accommodation can be reimbursed within a limit.
