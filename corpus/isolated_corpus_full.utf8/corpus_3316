Meeting Description:

The eighth conference of the Forum for Germanic Language Studies (FGLS), the
fifteenth Germanic Linguistics Annual Conference (GLAC), and the sixth
conference on Studies in the History of the English Language (SHEL) will be held
jointly in Banff, Alberta, Canada from April 30 to May 3, 2009. There have only
been two joint meetings of these groups in previous year -- FGLS/GLAC met in
London, England in 2003, and GLAC/SHEL in Ann Arbor in 2004. This is the first
time in history that the three groups are meeting together, and we are very
pleased to be building on the great successes of the previous joint meetings. 

Call for Papers and Workshop Proposals

Forum for Germanic Language Studies (FGLS 8)
Germanic Linguistics Annual Conference (GLAC 15)
Studies in the History of the English Language (SHEL 6)
Banff, Alberta, Canada
April 30-May 3, 2009

Please see below for further information on each society.

Papers
Deadline: January 7, 2009
Faculty, graduate students, and independent scholars are invited to submit
abstracts for 20-minute papers for presentation at FGLS, GLAC, and/or SHEL.
Abstracts for FGLS and GLAC may be on any linguistic or philological aspect of
any historical or modern Germanic language or dialect, including English (to the
Early Modern period) and the extraterritorial varieties. Abstracts for SHEL may
be on any linguistic or philological aspect of the history of English. Authors
may submit a maximum of two abstracts. Papers from the full range of linguistic
and philological subfields, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, stylistics, metrics, language
acquisition, contact, and change, as well as differing theoretical perspectives,
are welcome. All abstracts will undergo anonymous review.

Abstracts must be submitted electronically in PDF format as an email attachment to: 

banff09(at)ucalgary(dot)ca.

Abstracts should be a maximum of one single-spaced page in length, and be
written in a standard 12-point font. The page should be headed only by the title
of the paper, and the abstract should contain no self-identification. The
accompanying email should include the author's institutional affiliation, title
of the paper, and conference affiliation (that is, FGLS, GLAC, and/or SHEL).
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by February 15, 2009.

Tips for writing a good abstract are provided by the Linguistic Society of
America at: http://lsadc.org/info/abstract-models.cfm.

Workshops
Deadline: October 19, 2008
The organizers also welcome proposals for two-hour workshops. Proposals
reflecting the broad interests of the three groups (FGLS, GLAC, and SHEL) are
especially encouraged. Please provide a one-page statement of purpose that
includes the name(s) of the organizer(s), the goals of the workshop, and a list
of possible participants, if known. The statement of purpose should be submitted
in PDF format as an email attachment to:

banff09(at)ucalgary(dot)ca.

FGLS 8
The Forum of Germanic Language Studies (FGLS) was founded in 1994 and is an
informal group open to any scholar with an interest in Germanic linguistics.
Most members are based in the British Isles and in many ways FGLS functions as
the subject association of Germanic linguists in the UK. The inaugural meeting
was held in Manchester under the name of the Forum for German Language Studies.
At the 1996 meeting in York, the name was changed to reflect the Forum's broader
focus.

GLAC 15
The Germanic Linguistics Annual Conference (GLAC) is the conference of the
international Society for Germanic Linguistics (SGL), an organization serving
the broad community of scholars teaching and researching in Germanic Linguistics
and Philology. The conference welcomes papers encompassing the full range of
subfields in Germanic linguistics and philology, including phonetics, phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics, language acquisition,
psycholinguistics, and language contact and change, and all Germanic languages
and dialects, including Modern German, Dutch, Yiddish, the Scandinavian
languages, Afrikaans, Pennsylvania German, English (to 1500), and Gothic, as
well as texts and manuscripts in these languages.

SHEL 6
Studies in the History of the English Language (SHEL) has become a biennial
tradition, giving the field of Historical English Linguistics both focus and
recognition in North America and providing the critical opportunity for scholars
in the field to gather and share their research. SHEL follows in the tradition
of the biennial International Conference on English Historical Linguistics
(ICEHL), traditionally hosted at research centres throughout Europe. SHEL
welcomes papers from the full range of linguistic and philological subfields,
including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
sociolinguistics, stylistics, metrics, discourse analysis, corpus linguistics,
language acquisition, contact, and change, as well as differing theoretical and
methodological perspectives.

Linguistic Field(s): Not Applicable 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

The congress aims to give a survey of the actual research on all sorts of
particles (modal particles, focus particles, intensifiers...) 

Call for Papers

In 1969, Harald Weydt's PhD thesis on German modal particles was published. In
its wake, a surge of research and conferences took place, concerning not only
modal particles, but to all other kinds of particles, as well. Since then, 40
years have gone by - time to draw an interim balance. Where is today's particle
research situated?

This is the question posed by the conference

40 years of particle research: 1969-2009
February 11th to 13th, 2009
at the German Department of the University of Bern, Switzerland

Contributions are welcome from all fields of research, with regards to all kinds
of particles and all languages.

Conference languages are German, English, and French.

Preliminary registration:
In order to be able to organise the conference as smoothly as possible, we ask
you to please contact us before August 31st 2008 to let us know the preliminary
title of your paper.

Papers in English: Theo Harden (theo.harden@ucd.ie)
Papers in German and French: Elke Hentschel (partikelkongress@gmail.com)


1969 erschienen die Abtönungspartikel von Harald Weydt, die eine Flut von
Forschungsarbeiten und Kongressen zur Folge hatten, nicht nur zu
Abtönungspartikeln, sondern auch zu zahlreichen anderen Partikeltypen.
Inzwischen sind 40 Jahre vergangen, Zeit für eine kleine Zwischenbilanz. Wo
steht die Partikelforschung 2009?

Diese Frage stellt die Tagung

40 Jahre Partikelforschung: 1969 - 2009 
vom 11. bis 13. Februar 2009
am Institut für Germanistik der Universität Bern

Beiträge aus allen Bereichen der Partikelforschung, zu allen Partikeltypen und
allen Sprachen sind willkommen, um den Stand der Forschung möglichst umfassend
abzubilden. 
Tagungssprachen sind Deutsch, Englisch und Französisch.

Voranmeldung:
Für die genauere Planung bitten wir um Voranmeldungen. Bitte melden Sie sich mit
dem vorläufigen Titel Ihres Vortrags bis zum 31. August 2008 an bei:
