Meeting Description

Generative Linguistics in Poland started in 1999 as an attempt to create a
'Polish generative circle' and a platform for contacts between Polish linguists
and linguists from other countries working in the generative setting. After five
successful meetings there came a break, however, and now we are coming back for
the 6th meeting in April '08. 

The 6th meeting of Generative Linguistics in Poland
GLiP-6: Reactivation

1st Call for Papers

The 6th meeting of Generative Linguistics in Poland will be held on the first
weekend of April 2008. Unlike most of the previous meetings, this one will have
both a (morpho)syntactico-semantic and a (morpho)phonological track. In other
words, we invite abstracts on any aspect of any generative approach, addressing
issues both confined to a single domain and targetting interfaces/mappings
between domains.

Talks will be organized around major topics, depending on the content of the
submissions, with interface topics located at the end of Day One and the
beginning of Day Two.

The format of the conference is 20 min for presentation + 10 min question
time. The language of the presentations is English.

We are planning to publish a volume of conference proceedings (see our web
pages for information on the proceedings of the previous meetings).

Invited Speakers:
Ricardo BermÃºdez-Otero, University of Manchester
Jacek Witkos, University of Adam Mickiewicz in Poznan

Organizing Committee:
Piotr Banski, University of Warsaw
Beata Lukaszewicz, University of Warsaw
Monika Opalinska, University of Warsaw

Accommodation:
Accommodation at the university hotel will be provided. We can also provide
assistance in finding other kinds of hotel accommodation.

Dates:
Deadline for receipt of abstracts: 17 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 2 March 2008
Meeting: 5-6 April 2008

Abstracts:
Should be anonymous (i.e., they should contain no personal data or explicit
self-references) and consist of ca. 700-1000 words, together with examples
and references.

Because abstract forwarding to referees will be done by e-mail exclusively,
the following are the possible formats of attachments, in descending order
of preference:

PDF > plain text > OpenOffice Writer, Word for Windows 

Only one submission per person and one joint submission will be considered.
Abstracts should be written in English.

We will accept e-mail submissions exclusively.

Important: In the plain text part of your email, please supply the
following information:

- name, title,
- title of the paper,
- affiliation,
- email address,
- snail mail address
