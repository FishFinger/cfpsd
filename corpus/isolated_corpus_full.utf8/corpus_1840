Meeting Description

Current Approaches to Spanish and Portuguese Second Language Phonology
February 22-23, 2008
Minneapolis, MN USA 

Current Approaches to Spanish and Portuguese Second Language Phonology

Final Call for Papers

Current Approaches to Spanish and Portuguese Second Language Phonology is a
conference that aims to include a wide range of approaches to the study of
second language phonology, as well as a wide range of contexts. By focusing on
the breadth of approaches that scholars are taking to the study of second
language phonological acquisition in Spanish and Portuguese, this conference
aims to represent the state-of-the-art in second language phonological acquisition.

Abstracts are invited for presentations on any topic related to the second
language acquisition of the Spanish and Portuguese sound systems, and the theme
is intended to be construed as broadly as possible. Possible topics range from
the acquisition of Spanish phonology by English speakers to the acquisition of
Portuguese phonology by Spanish speakers, from classroom-based learning to full
immersion in the culture of the second language, among many others.

Please see the conference website for more information:
