theoretical and methodological perspectives, are welcome.  We also welcome
proposals for workshops and special sessions.

Abstracts are due June 1, 2007. Abstracts for 20-minute papers should be no
longer than 500 words.  Proposals for workshops or special sessions should
provide, in up to 1500 words, a rationale for the proposal and brief abstracts

session. Abstracts and proposals should be submitted as e-mail attachments in MS
Word format. Abstracts will undergo anonymous review. Please provide author name
and contact info and the paper title in the body of the email to which the
abstract is attached, and omit author information from the abstract itself.
Please send abstracts as PDF files as well as MS Word files if they contain any
specialized fonts.

General SHEL Information:

The Studies in the History of the English Language Conference (SHEL) series has
become a biennial tradition, giving the field of Historical English Linguistics
both focus and recognition in North America and providing the critical
opportunity for scholars in the field to gather and share their research. SHEL
follows in the tradition of the biennial conferences known as ICEHL
(International Conference on English Historical Linguistics), traditionally
hosted at research centers throughout Europe. We see the two conference series,
one in Europe and one in North America, as complementary in important ways.
