Meeting Description:

CiE 2009 is the fifth conference in the Series Computability in Europe, which
serves as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of
computability and foundations of computer science, as well as the interplay of
these theoretical areas with practical issues in computer science and with other
disciplines such as biology, mathematics, linguistics, philosophy, or physics. 

Call for Papers

Informal Presentations at CiE 2009:

There is a remarkable difference in conference style between computer science
and mathematics conferences. Mathematics conferences allow for informal
presentations that are prepared very shortly before the conference and inform
the participants about current research and work in progress. The format of
computer science conferences with pre-conference proceedings is not able to
accommodate this form of scientific communication.

Again continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, this year's CiE
conference endeavours to get the best of both worlds. In addition to the formal
presentations based on our LNCS proceedings volume, we invite researchers to
present informal presentations. For this, please send us a brief description of
your talk (between one paragraph and half a page) by the deadline: 1 June 2009.

Please submit your abstract by sending an informal email to our contact address:
 logic@math.uni-heidelberg.de

You will be notified whether your talk has been accepted for informal
presentation usually within a week after your submission.

Let us remind you that we are planning several post-conference publications,
which will contain full articles of selected CiE 2009 presentations, including
informal presentations.

Important Dates:
Submission of applications for ASL Student Grants: April 19
Early registration deadline: May 15
Submission of informal presentations: June 1
Late registration deadline: July 12

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
