Meeting Description:

Workshop on Nominal and Verbal Plurality is organized by the project 'Distr=
ibutive dependencies: nominal and verbal plurality' (CNRS, F=E9d=E9ration T=
UL). This project explores the parallels and interactions between the nomin=
al and the verbal domain by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality, =
and its morpho-syntactic manifestations across languages.

Friday and Saturday, November 6-7 2009

Salle de conf=E9rences, CNRS Pouchet, 59 rue Pouchet, 75017 Paris.

Invited speakers:

- Abdelkader Fassi-Fehri (University Mohammed V, Rabat)
- Susan Rothstein (Bar Ilan University)=20

Call for Papers:

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of plur=
ality are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of event =
plurality and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals, distr=
ibutivity, ''pluractionals'', plural nominalizations) and the nature of cro=
ss-categorial plurality markers.

We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations (plus ten-minute discussi=
ons). Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length (including examples and=
 references) written in French or English.

Abstracts must be anonymous and should be sent by e-mail (plain ASCII, rtf,=
 ps or pdf) to:

pcabredo //AT// univ-paris8.fr

Please write the (first) author's name plus the word 'abstract' in the subj=
ect line of your message (e.g., 'Dupont abstract'), and include author name=
(s), affiliation, contact information and the title of the abstract in the =
body of the email.

For co-authored papers indicate the email address that we should use for co=
rrespondence.

Abstracts should reach us by August 20, 2009.
