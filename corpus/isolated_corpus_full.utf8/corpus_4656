Meeting Description:

Chronos 9 - International Conference on Tense, Aspect and Modality. University
of Paris 7, 2 - 4 September 2009 

2nd Call for Papers

Important Notice : extended deadline for submissions, 30. April 2009

Chronos is a series of conferences dedicated to current research on the
morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense, aspect and
modality. The conferences welcome presentations from scholars who approach
linguistic research from different perspectives and embrace different
theoretical frameworks.

Main Session: morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense,
aspect and modality.

Parasession: Endangered & less-documented languages.

Special associated Workshop: Scalar structure and event structure

The thematic parasession of Chronos 2009 will be dedicated to the
tense/aspect/modality systems of endangered and less-documented languages. Not
only do such languages often face a serious danger of rapid extinction; they are
also a relatively intact source of fecund data, which might shed some new light
on the empirical generalizations and theoretical/formal constructs currently
prevalent within the community - indeed, these have generally been elaborated
through observations bearing on a handful of well-documented languages.

In addition to this special theme, Chronos 2009 will also include a host
workshop dedicated to the relationship between scalar structure and event
structure (co-organized by U. Paris 7 and U. Chicago): this particular empirical
field has proved very fruitful over the past few years, by nourishing a wealth
of new formal and theoretical approaches to aspectual meaning. The Chronos 2009
host workshop will constitute a unique opportunity of bringing together and
confronting different recent approaches to the connection between aspect and
scalarity.

Submissions to the conference are not restricted to the special topics here
listed. We welcome proposals relating to any area in the linguistics of tense,
aspect and modality.

Invited Speakers:
- Alan Dench, University of Western Australia
- Denis Creissels, Université de Lyon 2
- Leora Bar El, University of Montana
- Martina Faller, University of Manchester
- Chris Piñón, Université de Lille 3

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for
discussion). All presentations will be delivered in French or in English.

Preference will be given to presentations not duplicated at any major
conferences (e.g., LSA, LSRL)

Abstracts must be anonymous and written in French or in English. They should be
no longer than two pages in length using 1 inch/2.5 cm margins on all sides and
in 12pt font size (Times New Roman preferred). Any non-standard fonts should be
embedded in the PDF document. Submissions are limited to one individual and one
joint abstract per author.

Agenda :
Abstract submission deadline: April 30, 2009 (extended deadline)
Notifications of acceptance: June, 2009.

Instructions for abstract submission:
Authors are asked to submit their anonymous abstracts as pdf files via the
special Chronos 9 EasyAbs submission page, hosted on the Linguist List server
(see link on conference website).

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
