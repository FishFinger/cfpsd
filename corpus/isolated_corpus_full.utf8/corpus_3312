First Call for Papers
Tenth European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to 
Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2009)
1-3 July 2009, Verona (Italy)


The biannual ECSQARU conferences are a major forum for advances in 
the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty. Contributors 
are expected to come both from researchers interested in advancing 
the technology and from practitioners who are using uncertainty 
techniques in applications. The scope of ECSQARU includes, but is not 
limited to, fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, 
and decision making in qualitative and numeric paradigms.
Previous ECSQARU conferences have been held in Marseille (1991), 
Granada (1993), Fribourg (1995), Bonn (1997), London (1999), Toulouse 
(2001), Aalborg (2003), Barcelona (2005) and Hammamet (2007).
The 10th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches 
to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2009) will be held in Verona, 
Italy, on July 1-3, 2009.


Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
------------------------------------------------

   * Foundations of reasoning and decision making under uncertainty
   * Default reasoning
   * Bayesian networks
   * Belief revision & inconsistency handling
   * Causal networks
   * Argumentation systems
   * Decision theory and graphs
   * Learning for uncertainty formalisms
   * Markov decision processes
   * Automated planning & acting
   * Game theoretic agents
   * Information fusion
   * Belief functions
   * Uncertainty & data mining
   * Fuzzy sets and Fuzzy Logic
   * Classification & clustering
   * Rough sets
   * Algorithms for uncertain inference
   * Possibility theory
   * Empirical studies of algorithms
   * Logics for reasoning under uncertainty
   * Implementation and applications of uncertain systems


Submissions:
------------
The proceedings of ECSQARU 2009 will be published in the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science series of Springer. Authors are requested 
to prepare their papers in the LNCS/LNAI format. Papers must not 
exceed 12 pages and must be submitted as PDF electronically. Papers 
that are not in the stated format or that exceed the page limit will 
not be reviewed.
Submitted papers will be evaluated by peer review on the basis of 
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of 
exposition. All accepted papers will be included in the conference 
proceedings. Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the 
conference and to make oral presentations about their work.
