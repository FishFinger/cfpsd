Meeting Description
The Slavic Cognitive Linguistics Association (SCLA) announces the Call for
Papers for the 2007 annual conference. The conference will be held on the
University of Chicago campus at the Center for the Study of Languages on Friday,
October 12 through Sunday, October 14, 2007. Keynote speakers include William
Croft, Professor of Linguistics, University of New Mexico; Mark Turner,
Institute Professor and Professor of Cognitive Science, Case Western Reserve
University; and Lawrence Zbikowski, Associate Professor of Music, University of
Chicago. Abstracts due July 15, 2007. Please contact Steven Clancy
<sclancy@uchicago.edu> for more information. 

Call for Papers
Abstracts are invited for presentations addressing issues of significance for
cognitive linguistics. We define cognitive linguistics as any linguistic
endeavour aimed at providing explanations of linguistic phenomena which are
psychologically plausible, i.e. characterizing ''the psychological structures
that constitute a speaker's linguistic ability'' (Langacker). As long as there
is a cognitive orientation, papers may be in any of the traditional areas of
synchronic or diachronic phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,
discourse analysis or sociolinguistics. 

Main Sessions (Saturday and Sunday)
Each presentation for the main sessions will be given 20 minutes and will be
followed by a 10-minute discussion period.

Poster Sessions (Saturday and Sunday)
We also welcome submissions for parallel poster sessions. Posters may consist of
traditional posters, handouts, or multimedia presentations. Participants should
plan for 15 minute presentations that will be repeated 3 times during a 60
minute session.

Presentations may be in the native language of the presenter; however, if the
presentation is not to be made in English we ask that you provide the abstract
in English in addition to an abstract in any other language.

Abstracts may be submitted anytime before July 15, 2007 to Steven Clancy
<sclancy@uchicago.edu>. Please indicate if you would like your submission to be
considered for a 20-minute presentation or the poster session. Abstracts should
be 500-750 words, but strict word limits are not required. Notification of
acceptance will be provided by August 20, 2007.

Preliminary Schedule
Friday, October 12: conference begins in evening with reception, keynote
address, and dinner
Saturday, October 13: main sessions and poster presentations as well as two
keynote addresses, lunch and dinner
Sunday, October 14: main sessions and poster presentations continue through

Further Information
Information on transportation, accommodations, and the conference venue will be
forthcoming. Please see the conference website for further information.
