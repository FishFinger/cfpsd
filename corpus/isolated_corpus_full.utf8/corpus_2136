Meeting Description

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL conferences.
The workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their work
and receive feedback. 

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL conferences.
The workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants
will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience
as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers
who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to
the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask
for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by
an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop
will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come
from any topic area within computational linguistics including, but
not limited to, the following topic areas:

- pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
- phonetics, phonology and morphology
- linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
- information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
- summarization and paraphrasing
- speech recognition, speech synthesis
- corpus-based language modeling
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
- spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
- multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
- message and narrative understanding systems

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished
research. The papers should describe original work in
progress. Students who have settled on their thesis direction but
still have significant research left to do are particularly encouraged
to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange
ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for
further development of the work, papers should clearly indicate
directions for future research wherever appropriate. All authors of
multi-author papers must be students. Papers submitted for this
workshop are eligible only if they have not been presented at any
other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Students
who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research
Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their
papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper
has been submitted to another conference or workshop.

3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. These files will be
available soon from the student workshop pages of the conference
site. A description of the format will also be available in case you
are unable to use these style files directly. All the submissions must
be electronic. Please use the submission page to submit your paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance
decision will be based on the results of the review. Note that
reviewing of papers will be double-blind; therefore, please make sure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self identifying references anywhere in the
paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed
previously (Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001)
previously showed ...''.

5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than midnight, January 10th,
2008 . No papers received after January 10th, 2008 will be
accepted. Acknowledgment will be emailed soon after
receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by email)
on February 28th, 2008. Detailed formatting guidelines for the
preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors
with their acceptance notice. 

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: January 10, 2008
Notification of acceptance: February 28, 2008
Camera-ready paper submission deadline: April 14, 2008
Conference date: June 15-20, 2008
(The workshop will be held during the main conference)

6. Contact Information

If you need to contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Workshop, please

Meeting Description

'Lexical meaning' is of particular relevance in argumentation, as it is the
context as a whole that activates interpretation processes: encoded meaning can
be considered as a tool for arriving at the intended (i.e. communicated)
meaning. From this communicative-pragmatic point of view, great attention must
be paid to the implicit communicated meaning (Carston 2002), which can be
presupposed (Greco 2003) or inferred. Textualizing procedures of argumentative
moves have received considerable attention in linguistic research oriented
towards discourse analysis (Rigotti 2005; Rocci 2005; Stati 2002 e 1990). These
studies fall within so-called Argumentation Theory (van Eemeren & Grootendorst
2004; Walton 1996; Plantin 1999), which operates from an interdisciplinary
perspective, where linguists interact with philosophers and communication
theorists. 

Call for Papers

The ''auxiliary lexicon of argumentation'', a set which includes a wide range of
elements (functional words, simple and composite lexemes, free phrases,
locutions, propositions, etc.), communicates the argumentative functions of
utterances as well as the relations between them. They can be made explicit, for
example, through the use of connectors, which allow parts of the text to be
organised whether produced by a single speaker or co-produced by two or more
speakers. On the other hand, they may be left implicit, in which case textual
relations are recognized by means of interpretive processes that can be
''activated'' also by their encoded meaning (cfr. Moeschler 1989; Stati 1990;
Sperber & Wilson 1995; Dascal 2003; Gobber & Gatti & Cigada 2006).
The study of lexical meaning becomes more relevant in contexts, where it is
necessary to compare the structure of argumentative processes in texts produced
in different languages. This is because the inter-linguistic perspective
involves the inter-cultural one, especially in translating processes.
The I.A.D.A. Workshop organized by the Department of Foreign Languages and
Literatures at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan aims to
investigate lexical meaning, in the light of inferential processes implied in
the linear structure of dialogue. The Workshop will also focus on specific
themes in three panels, coordinated by Marcello Soffritti, Margherita Ulrych and
Christian Plantin. From a translational perspective and with reference to German
and English, two panels will address encoded meaning and the encoded
meaning/effective meaning interface in argumentation; while the third will
investigate the emotive dimension of argumentative dialogues.
Following are listed several possible thematic areas of the Workshop which can
be treated, with reference to argumentative dialogue, according to different
perspectives: intra-linguistic,confrontative-contrastive, translational etc.

Suggested thematic areas:
- Argumentative connectors
- Words or expressions introducing illocutive functions and argumentative roles
- Words or expressions used to refer to the speakers or to the source of information
- Expressions introducing fallacies
- Paraphrases of argumentative roles
- Interface syntax/argumentative structure
- Words or expressions introducing figures of word and figures of thought
- Prototypical and peripheral meaning
- Keywords in argumentation
- Emotive meaning
- Argumentation (and emotive argumentation) in conversation
- Strategic use of definition in argumentative dialogues
- ''Logical'' and ''rhetorical'' linguistic means
Contributions concerning other thematic areas will also be accepted on condition
that they are relevant to the general subject of the Workshop.

Workshop languages:
Italian, German, French, English.

Forms of presentation:
Plenary Sessions (45 minutes speaking time, 15 minutes discussion)
Session Papers (20 minutes speaking time, 10 minutes discussion)
Panels (3 to 6 papers on a common topic)

Proceedings:
A selection of the papers in all workshop languages will be published in the
international journal L'analisi linguistica e letteraria edited by the
Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

Deadline for the presentation of abstracts:
Your anonymous abstract (2000 characters in Word format), written in English,
should be posted before 30 November 2007 to the electronic mail address
workshop.iada2008@unicatt.it. The abstract must contain the following information:

- Title
- Workshop Section (General Linguistics, German/French/ English Linguistics)
- Language of the paper or panel: Italian, German, French, English

Acceptance by the Scientific Committee will be communicated before 20 December 2007.
