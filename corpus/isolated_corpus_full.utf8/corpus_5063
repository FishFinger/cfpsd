Meeting Description:

DiSCo 2009: Distributional Semantics beyond Concrete Concepts
July 29th, Amsterdam

Workshop organized as a part of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science
Society (CogSci 2009) 

Call for Papers

Overview:
DiSCo 2009 is a pre-conference workshop organized on July 29th, at CogSci-2009,
Amsterdam. It focuses on distributional models of (lexical) semantics, like LSA
or HAL, that aim to model the meaning of a word in terms of its contexts in a
corpus. To this day, these approaches have mainly been used in the modeling of
concrete concepts, where they have proved very successful. The DiSCo workshop
therefore wants to focus on a number of challenges that have been left
relatively unexplored so far. These challenges include, but are not limited to:
-The modeling of verb meaning.
-The modeling of different aspects of semantics, like the extraction of concept
properties from text.
- The combination of different types of (linguistic and non-linguistic) data.

DiSCo aims to bring together computational linguists and cognitive scientists
interested in distributional models of semantics. We welcome all researchers to
submit novel and interesting work in the field of distributional semantics, with
specific attention to the new challenges set out above. Additionally, we are
interested in receiving other contributions that further research on
distributional models and/or their implications for cognitive science.

Submission Details:
Submissions should adhere to the CogSci style files, and should be no longer
than 6 pages. They need to be submitted in pdf-format. More information can be
found on the workshop's website.

Important Dates:
-Sun June 7, 2009: Submission deadline
-Mon June 22, 2009: Notification of acceptance
-Fri June 26, 2009: Early registration deadline

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
