Meeting Description

Contextual Information in Semantic Space Models (CoSMo 2007): Beyond Words and
Documents.

Context 07: Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and
Using Context 

Call for Papers:

Roskilde University, Denmark
August 20, 2007

Magnus Sahlgren (Swedish Institute of Computer Science)


Topics of the Workshop 

Some variation of the so-called distributional hypothesis - i.e. that words with
similar distributional properties have similar semantic properties - lies at the
heart of a number of computational approaches that share the assumption that it
is possible to build semantic space models through the statistical analysis of
the contexts in which words occur.

However, the very notion of context on which semantic spaces rely on gives rise
to various crucial issues both at the theoretical and at the computational
level, which in turn determine a large space of parametric variations. The aim
of this workshop is to foster a fully cross-disciplinary debate around the major
open questions pertaining to the definition and usage of context in
context-based semantic modeling.

In particular, we invite papers on the following topics:

- using new linguistic and extra-linguistic contexts in semantic space modeling;
- integration of different context sources (linguistic, extra-linguistic, etc.)
to bootstrap semantic spaces;
- plausible contexts for cognitively and neurally realistic semantic space models;
- effect of context choice on the performance of semantic space models in
applicative settings;
- critical analysis of the limits of current context-based models of meaning and
future perspectives.


Paper Submission

The papers should not be longer than 8 pages, and they should be submitted
anonymously in PDF format following the LNCS guidelines (see Workshop's website
for link to style-sheets).

Paper selection will occur through a blind review process. Each paper will be
read by 2 reviewers.

Online paper submission is now open at:
