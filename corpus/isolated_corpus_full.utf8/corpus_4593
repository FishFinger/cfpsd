Call for Papers

The conference will be co-hosted by The University of Montana Linguistics

Papers on all aspects of the study, preservation, and teaching of Salish and
neighboring languages are welcome.

Abstracts should be 150-200 words and should include the paper title, author(s), 
affiliation, and e-mail address. Abstracts should be sent by e-mail to
ICSNL44@umontana.edu as a pdf attachment. If you anticipate any problems sending
your abstract in this way, please contact the organizing committee. Please
include the primary author's snail mail address and phone number in your e-mail.

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is June 15, 2009. The program will be

Following recent changes in the structure of ICSNL conferences, papers will be
published after the conference as a University of British Columbia Working
Papers in Linguistics (UBCWPL) proceedings volume (and not as preprints as had
been done in the past). Details regarding the submission of papers will be
available at the conference. The deadline for completed papers will be mid-October.

Questions about the conference can be forwarded to: ICSNL44@umontana.edu

We look forward to seeing you this summer in Montana!

Leora Bar-el, for the ICSNL 44 Organizing Committee
