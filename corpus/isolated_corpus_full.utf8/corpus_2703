			Call for Papers

         The 2nd International Workshop on Language Resources for =

		Content-based Image Retrieval (OntoImage 2008)

		Held in conjunction with LREC 2008
                           Marrakech, Morocco
			afternoon of May 26, 2008




*Scope *

* *

There are two computer-aided methods for accessing images:

    * indexing textual descriptions (done mostly by public retrieval
      engines)
          o assigned manually on community sharing sites, e.g. Flickr;
          o extracted from the text of the web page associated with the
            image , e.g. Google
          o extracting textual information inside the image using OCR
            techniques
    * indexing low-level visual features (colour, texture, etc.) of the
      images (called Content Based Image Retrieval - CBIR).

Combining these two methods is currently a hot topic since it involves =

developing hybrid approaches using automatic image tagging from text =

along with low level visual features from an image to produce text =

metadata. One of the main limitations within state-of-the-art CBIR =

resides in the mismatch (the =93Semantic Gap=94 in image analysis) between =

low-level visual descriptors and the human-understood semantics of =

picture similarity. There are problems of vocabulary at all levels in =

the description of an image. There is a mismatch between the text found =

around an image, between the keywords that people assign to an image, =

and between the objects that can be recognized in an image. How can =

available language resources (terminology, thesauri, ontologies, etc.) =

help? How much must they be altered to reduce the semantic gap?

This half-day workshop will present up to 9 papers examining the =

intersection of language resources and image analysis and retrieval.

We welcome submissions addressing the following questions:

    * What elements in a lexicon correspond to picturable objects?
    * How can language resources be used to organize and improve user
      contributed image annotations?
    * Which are the roles of language resources in image retrieval?
    * How should language resources and image processing techniques be
      integrated?
    * How can current language resources be adapted for content-based
      image retrieval in real-world applications, like the Web search?
    * Can language resources and low-level visual descriptors be
      organized into a joint knowledge infrastructure?
    * Do we need new semantic structures (ontologies, thesauri) for
      CBIR? Can we build them (semi)automatically?
    * What visual characteristics of objects can be discovered by text
      processing (color, size, location, shape, texture)?
    * What is the relation between the lexicon and image indexing and
      retrieval? What words should be associated with an image? Can this
      be automated?
    * How to combine speech and textual resources related to image data?
    * What are some application areas where this research can be evaluated?

*
*

*Submissions *

We expect extended abstracts describing research addressing one of the =

above questions of about 1500 words to be submitted as WORD, PDF or =

ASCII documents per email to the following address: =

adrian.popescu@cea.fr <mailto:adrian.popescu@cea.fr>

A reception notification will be sent to the authors within 48 hours. =

The final papers should have no more than 6 pages.
