Call for Papers:  Special Issue of the=20
Journal of Information Technology & Politics (http://www.jitp.net)
"Text Annotation for Political Science Research"

Text is an important data source for political science research.  Large, =
digitized text collections are becoming increasingly common.  Yet most =
political scientists have little familiarity with the =
language-processing methodologies available to support research using =
these collections.  Specifically, we are interested in methodologies =
from the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, =
and machine learning.  These techniques facilitate the automatic =
searching, organizing, categorizing, and extracting of information from =
digitized text.=20

At a high level, the goal of language-processing is to provide one or =
more semantic annotations on the text.  The political science question =
of interest can then be explored using these annotations.  Text =
annotation techniques vary not only according to the type of semantic =
annotation required, but also according to the degree of manual =
intervention involved in the annotation process: text annotation tasks =
can be accomplished entirely manually (i.e., via human content coding), =
entirely automatically (e.g. via keyword-based search or text clustering =
algorithms), automatically after a manual training period (i.e. via =
"supervised" machine learning methods), or semi-automatically (e.g. via =
"weakly supervised" machine learning methods that acquire automatic =
annotation systems from very small amounts of manually labeled text).

Although the potential of text annotation methods for political science =
research is enormous, it is understandably difficult for researchers to =
know where to start.  In addition, in contrast to other research =
methodologies in the social sciences, the criteria for evaluating social =
science results that rely on automatic text annotation systems are not =
widely known, accepted, or appreciated.  Keyword searches, for example, =
are commonly used to trace changing political attention across time, but =
rarely is attention given to their reliability or accuracy, raising =
doubts about the validity of researcher inferences.

The aim of the special issue is to solicit and publish papers that =
provide a clear view of the state of the art in text annotation and =
evaluation, especially for political science.  How do the techniques map =
onto major questions addressed by political scientists?  What kinds of =
problems have been addressed in existing work and what text annotation =
methods have proven most successful?  Are standard statistical measures =
of accuracy, recall, and precision adequate for evaluating the =
performance of the text annotation technique, or are new evaluation =
procedures needed that simultaneously consider the social science =
question being investigated? =20



Given these interests, we therefore encourage submissions in the =
following areas:

=B7         tutorial-style surveys of state-of-the-art techniques in =
human language technologies and text annotation;

=B7         surveys of the state-of-the-art in the application of =
language-processing techniques in the social sciences,  particularly in =
political science;=20

=B7         comparisons of competing text annotation methodologies on =
the same corpus/corpora;

=B7         innovative evaluation and diagnostic methods;

=B7         studies of text annotation methods that try to limit the =
amount of costly, manually annotated data for training automatic =
annotators, e.g. active learning;=20

=B7         specific applications and evaluations of language-processing =
and text annotation techniques;=20

=B7         applications of the text-processing techniques on non-social =
science problems that point the way to innovative social science =
applications; and

=B7         surveys of the available language-processing tools and =
resources with guidance for when to use them.

All submissions must be prepared according to the submission guidelines =
available at: www.jitp.net.  Authors must submit via: =
http://www.criticalmath.com/method/sm.php?org_id=3D12789=20

The initial submission is due by November 1, 2007
