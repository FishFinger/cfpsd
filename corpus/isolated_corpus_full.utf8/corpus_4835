2nd Call for Papers

 Workshop on Grammar Engineering Across Frameworks - Geaf 2009

      on August 6 at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference, Singapore

      http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF09/


Workshop Topics

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different 
frameworks to compare research and methodologies, particularly around 
the themes of evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to 
theoretical and computational linguistics, and applications of "deep" 
grammars to real-world domains and NLP tasks.

   Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to 
support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in 
real-world domains and applications. The demands of these types of tasks 
have resulted in significant advances in areas such as parser 
efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic approaches to disambiguation, 
and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The effective acquisition, 
development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a central issue 
in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars makes 
these tasks extremely challenging; indeed, these tasks are often tackled 
in ways that have much in common with software engineering. This 
workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different 
frameworks --- for example LFG, HPSG, TAG, CCG, dependency grammar --- 
to compare their research and methodologies.

The workshop will solicit submissions for papers on the following themes:

1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics 
which can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; 
evaluation techniques which can compare grammars across 
varieties/languages;

2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can 
most easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses 
of separate linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and 
the role of frameworks in promoting or inhibiting modularity;

3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and 
multi-developer maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations 
of maintainability on choices of linguistic analysis;

4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections 
on how to present grammar engineering work to other research communities;

5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies 
and techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in 
day-to-day progress on grammars.

6. Multilingualism: Approaches, techniques and tools improving 
development and maintainability of grammars for multiple system languages.
