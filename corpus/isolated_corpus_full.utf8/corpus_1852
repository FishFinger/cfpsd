The psycholinguistic and cognitive processes underlying the learning of a
foreign or second language have always been a subject of major interest to both
(i) Second Language Acquisition (SLA) researchers and (ii) practitioners
involved in language pedagogy, i.e. Foreign Language Learning (FLL). Most SLA
theories have thus far assumed a top-down operation from Universal Grammar to L1
and L2 grammars. Just as for first language acquisition, it is assumed that,
given sufficient input, a second language system develops in the mind
automatically. The L2 input is said to trigger the language acquisition device,
which is seen to operate quite autonomously, that is, independently from and
without any interaction with other cognitive abilities or faculties such as
bodily experiences, image schemas, perception, attention, categorization,
emotion, or still other mental faculties. 

The Symposium takes a radically opposing view in the sense that language
acquisition and learning can, like all human learning processes, only be
understood and explained if they are seen as bottom-up, exemplar-based and
usage-oriented processes. These can and have to be accommodated in a much
broader framework of how people interact with the world around them, store and
acquire knowledge in some symbolic form or other, and thus establish a link
between cognitive development and language acquisition. 
The Symposium will explore the even more complex process of L2 learning and
acquisition from three different inroads: 

(i)	the cognitive theoretical foundations of language and learning, 
(ii)	the specific acquisition procedures followed by language learners, and 
(iii)	the rational pedagogic strategies required to facilitate and speed up the
acquisition and learning processes seen from the perspective of the cognitive
linguistics enterprise. 
These will be explored in the following three theme sessions:

Theme Session 1: 
Cognition and language: Theoretical frameworks and models
The first session examines the theoretical foundations of language, language
acquisition and language learning. A number of theories have emerged from
empirical research findings on second language learning and language instruction. 
In particular, we invite abstracts on the following topics:

- General: Second language acquisition theories and cognition
- Comparing and contrasting cognition in first and second language acquisition
- The relevance of conceptual knowledge for L2 learning and teaching
- Corpus linguistics, cognition and language pedagogy
- The nature and sequence of the form-meaning pairing 
- Cognitive grammar and SLA 
- Neuro-cognitive issues of language acquisition 
- Process-oriented instruction of second languages by children and adults

Theme session 2: 
The mental processes and acquisition procedures involved in SLA: 
Case studies and empirical findings
A second goal of the symposium is to empirically investigate the mental
processes of language learners within the acquisition process such as the role
of attention as one of the basic explanations of language learning.
In particular, we invite abstracts on the following topics:

- Explicit learning, attention and awareness in SLA research
- Language awareness and motivation in FLT
- Cognition and interlanguage at all linguistic levels (phonological,
morpho-syntactic, 	lexical, constructional, pragmatic)
- The mental process of interlanguage development in SLA
- Interaction of gesture and speech in the development of metaphorical understanding
- Formulaic language as the cornerstone of natural SLA
- Constructions infants  and L2 learners live by

Theme Session 3: 
Cognitive language pedagogy: Pedagogical grammar, lexical expansion, cultural
fluency
The third and main theme of the symposium centers around the theoretical model
of cognitive linguistics, which represents a valid framework within which FLL
research may take place. Various implications for pedagogically oriented
research and for SL classroom practice will be discussed. The contextual facets
of CL including the social, cultural, and discourse ingredients of language can
be exploited for a communicative and usage-based approach to language teaching
in the classroom. 'Applied Cognitive Linguistics', therefore, investigates the
links between the theoretical views of CL and their relevance for applications
in the areas of language acquisition, learning and pedagogy. 
The specific goal here is to discuss the didactic potential field of CL in the
teaching and learning of second and/or foreign languages. 
In particular, we invite abstracts on the following topics:

- The relevance of dynamic usage-based models in language acquisition 
- Corpus-data in a usage-based cognitive grammar
- The acquisition-learning debate in the light of CL findings
- Culture-specific conceptualizations in an FLT context
- Figurative thinking and SLA
- Cognition and pragmatic development in a second language syllabus
- Cognitive-didactic approaches to the English verb phrase (TMA-system)
- Iconicity, construal and prototypicality in  Pedagogical Grammars
- The issue of 'rules' from a cognitive-linguistics perspective
- Idiom and metaphor in lexical expansion and creativity
- From the internet corpus to usable learning materials;
- From classroom experiments to large-scale experimentation

Conference Fees
The conference fee is EUR 75 payable on arrival.

to all participants before March 2008.
Selected papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings.
More information on the city of Landau (1 hour by car south of Frankfurt/Main
and very close to the Alsatian border, France):
Landau or Landau in der Pfalz (pop. 41,821) is an autonomous (kreisfrei) city
surrounded by the Südliche Weinstraße (''southern wineroute'') district of
southern Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is a university town (since 1990), a
long-standing cultural centre, and a market and shopping town, surrounded by
vineyards and wine-growing villages of the Palatinate wine region. Landau lies
east of the Pfälzer Wald, Europe's largest contiguous forest (quoted from Wikipedia)
