Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Journal of Natural Language Engineering (JNLE)
Special Issue on Textual Entailment
Call For Papers

The goal of identifying textual entailment - whether one piece of text can
be plausibly inferred from another - has emerged in recent years as a
generic core problem in Natural Language Understanding. For instance, in
order to answer the question 'Who killed Kennedy?',  a QA system may need
to recognize that 'Oswald killed Kennedy' can  be inferred from 'the
assassination of Kennedy by Oswald'. 

Work in this area has been largely driven by the PASCAL Recognizing Textual
Entailment (RTE) challenges, a series of annual competitive meetings
(http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3). This work exhibits strong
ties to some earlier lines of research, particularly automatic acquisition
of paraphrases and lexical semantic relationships, and unsupervised
inference in applications such as question answering, information
extraction and summarization. It has also opened the way to newer lines of
research on more involved inference methods, on knowledge representations
needed to support this natural language understanding challenge and on the
use of learning methods in this context. RTE has fostered an active and
growing community of researchers focused on the problem of applied
entailment. The special issue of JNLE will provide an opportunity to
showcase some of the most important work in this emerging area. 

Articles for this special issue are invited on all aspects of textual
entailment, aiming at a broader scope than exhibited within the RTE
challenges. Topics include, but are not limited to: 

*Representation levels, such as
   -Lexical, n-gram, and substring overlap
   -Linguistic annotations (POS tags, syntactic structure, semantic
dependencies)
*Utilizing background knowledge, e.g. inference rules, paraphrase 
templates, lexical relations
*Knowledge acquisition methods
  - From corpora/Web, including acquiring entailment/paraphrasing   corpora
  - From semantic resources like FrameNet, PropBank, VerbNet, NOMLEX/NOMBANK
*Inference mechanisms, such as
   - Similarity/subsumption metrics
   - Tree-based distances and transformations
   - Machine learning
   - Logical inference using theorem provers
*The impact of entailment capabilities on applications
*Evaluation methods
*Data analysis
