Meeting Description:

Workshop SLE/2009/Lisbon 9-12 Sept. 2009

Title of workshop:
Theory of mind approaches to linguistic description and communicative explanation.

Conveners: Werner Abraham/Vienna & Elisabeth Leiss/Munich
Conveners' configurations: werner_abraham@t-online.de;
e.leiss@germanistik.uni-muenchen.de 

Second Call for Papers: 

Categories to be addressed: cross-linguistic modal verbs (root vs. epistemics),
modal particles (their polyfunctionality), modal adverbs, mood operators; all
kinds of multiple shifters in the Jakobsonian sense; logical co- and
subordinating operators.

Addressees/participants/contributors: empirical and theoretical linguists,
philosophers of language, L1 and L2 investigators, and theorists of translation.

Outline of workshop topic and particular research questions to be addressed:
While such epistemic adverbials as probably, to the best of my knowledge,
certainly, among a variety of others, as well as analytic declaratives such as
it is probable/ certain that p etc. refer to speaker information and his
knowledge status, both modal verbs and modal particles go be-yond this layer of
speaker concern in that they render access to the source of speaker's knowledge
status, on the one hand, and to the speaker's concern for the addressee's level
of knowledge and thematic concern on the other (cf. German
Fremdbewusstseinsabglich for the somewhat neutral English Theory of mind).
Diewald (1991), referring to Jakobson's (1971) earlier insight and terminology
("shifters"), has called this the "double deixis/shifting/displacement" of the
two categories in question. The fundamental point of departure for research
questions is a dictum by Sperber &Wilson (Relevance 1986: 4-5): Thoughts do not
simply travel from Speaker to Addressee (as in Shannon-Weaver's 1949 telephone
model). We don't send out communications to addressees when we are engaged in
linguistic intercourse. What we do, instead and much rather, is try to ascertain
what exists, on the part of the addressee, in terms of shared knowledge relevant
to the present linguistic interaction and in terms of what is in need of
correction on either part. A very telling illustration may be provided by the
two German modal lexemes "yes-PARTICLE" vs. "flat- PARTICLE": While makes an
appeal to the addressee's full consent on the basis of shared encyclopedic
knowledge about p, the contribution , rather than appealing to a common
knowledge horizon, derives such an appeal from what has been part of the
previous discussion between Sp and Addr. German modal particles are a telling
difficulty for translators from German into other languages.

The present workshop undertakes it to anchor "double" or "multiple deixis" in
syntax and semantics-pragmatics. In pursuing this aim, fundamental claims with
respect to the serialization of adverbs and modal particles as well as modal
particles (notably as opposed to modal adverbs) will be made against the
background of investigations entertained by Cinque 1998 and/or Frey & Pittner
1998, on the one hand, and novel investigations into the classification of
embedded sentences as by Haegeman (2006), Coniglio (2008), and Abraham (2008),
on the other.

The discussion may lead, directly or indirectly, to research questions such as:
- Jakobson's original idea about 'shifters' was that, counter to absolute time
reference as in "on 15 May"/"in England", there is "origo shifting" ('deixis
displacement') involved in "yesterday"/ "here". By contrast, in tenses such as
the PAST tense there is double shifting to the extent that in addition to
speaker origo shifting there is also viewer origo ("Betrachter" in Reichenbach's
sense) shifting. We call this 'double displacement/double deixis', and we try to
find out where such multiple deixis, or origo displacement, is manifested
linguistically. "Epistemic verbs and modal particles vs. modal adverbs"
- Generally speaking, multiple deixis reveals itself in realms of modality (such
as modal particles and modal verbs, both sharing categorial polyfunctionality).
What are other grammatical categories that project multiple deixis? "What is
common to MV and MP? The modal Ur-soup?"
- Illocutive power is generally restricted to independent clauses. What is the
deeper systematic reason behind the fact that some, but by far not all dependent
clauses bear independent illocutive power such that they allow for multiple
deixis categories? "Stacking different illocutionary forces in FORCEP?"
- Is illocution the only category addressing multiple deixis? Is it mood and
modality? "What does mood do in terms of ToM?"
- CP-expansion is required for anchoring information about the speaker involving
FORCEP (Speaker deixis) as the illocutive anchor category in languages like
Germanic languages. Are other categories involved? " Independent German 1st
subjunctive as a modality marker vs. the dependent Romance subjunctive".
- Are there other pragmatic, speaker-oriented anchors beyond FORCEP? "Mood as a
subcomponent of Modality".
- Does the illocutive category of ForceP have to be split up to host more
instances of multiple deixis - and, if so, in which hierarchical order?
"Extending FORCEP by different illocutionary forces"-
- To what extent does Mood establish an instance of multiple deixis? Consider
the Dutch modal verb taking over the German irrealis subjunctive function. Think
of oratio obliqua subjunctive in German.
- Categories nowadays carrying multiple (speaker) deixis have obviously not
always done so in diachrony. How does such a change come about, and what are its
accompanying grammaticalization traits? "The diachronic emergence of modal verbs
and modal particles: origins, hierarchical emergence, epistemics vs. root
meanings in both modal verbs and modal particles."
- Likewise, how does multiple deixis, or theory of mind, develop linguistically
in L1, and which categories are involved in which sequential order and based on
what categorial hierarchy? "ToM in L1 - and how this can be empirically traced.
The scientific history of ToM?".
- L2 may also be a research ground to the extent that certain categories carry
multiple deixis in one language, but not in another. "How is the lack of
epistemic MVs and MPs made up? The type 'translatory artefact"'.
- Is theory of mind the type of investigation that yields a systematic
pragmatics - and the only systematic one -, i.e., a type of pragmatics that is
linguistic and not encyclopedic? "Episodic vs. procedural memorizing, especially
in dementia and aphasia."
- The role of (multiple) accent or the fundamental lack of it may be a source of
multiple deixis (and its total absence). Does this carry over to other
linguistic distributional criteria? Consider the shifter differences between
German ja vs. JA or denn vs. DENN."
- Are multiple deixis, or theory of mind development as well as distinctions,
accessible to brain imaging? What are the categorical essentials of such brain
scanning?
- To the best of our understanding, Relevance theoretical approaches are not
identical to those on theory of mind/multiple deixis. Multiple deixis is far
more restricted linguistically. Grice's maxims appear to have a closer relation
with multiple deixis - which exactly? And one would like to fathom out where
Relevance and multiple deixis converge and maybe even move into intersecting fields.

The conveners invite submissions to this workshop in the form of abstracts no
longer than 350 words.
- The workshop will be part of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Societas
Linguistica Europaea, 9 - 12 September 2009, at the Universidade de Lisboa,
Faculdade de Letras, Portugal.

Specifics for submission of abstracts for this workshop to be sent to the
workshop convenors, , W. Abraham and E. Leiss:
- State exact title and speaker name; keep abstracts to a maximum of 500 words.
They should state research questions, approach, method, data, and (expected)
results.
- Deadline for submission: January 15, 2009
- The abstracts will be evaluated by the scientific SLE-committee; word of
acceptance is expected by 31 March 2009.
- Papers to this workshop will have to be read in 20 minutes, 10 minutes are
reserved for discussion.
