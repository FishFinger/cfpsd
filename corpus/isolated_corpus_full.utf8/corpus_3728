CALL FOR BOOK CHAPTERS
Video Mining
EDITED BY
Dan Schonfeld, Caifeng Shan, Dacheng Tao, Liang Wang
To be PUBLISHED BY
Springer-Verlag in the series "Studies in Computational Intelligence"

Book Description
As cameras become more pervasive in our daily life, vast amounts of video
are generated. The popularity of YouTube and similar websites provides
strong evidence for the increasing role of video in our lives. How to
effectively use the huge and rapidly growing video data accumulating in
large multimedia archives is one of main challenges we are facing in the era
of information technology. Innovative video processing and analysis
techniques will play an increasingly important role in resolving the
difficult task of video search and retrieval. A wide range of video-based
applications will benefit from advances in video mining including multimedia
search, human-computer interface, security and surveillance, copyright
protection, and personal entertainment, to name a few. This book will
provide an overview of emerging new approaches to video mining and promising
methods being developed in the computer vision and image analysis community.
Video mining aims to discover and describe interesting patterns in video
data and has become one of the core areas in the data mining research
community.  Compared to mining of other types of data (e.g., text), video
mining is still in its infancy. There are many challenging research problems
facing video mining. For example, how to extract knowledge from
spatio-temporal data, how to infer high-level semantic concepts from
low-level features in videos, how to exploit unlabeled and untagged video
data. Applying data mining techniques to video data is difficult due to the
large volume of high-dimensional video data. To address these challenges, we
must develop data mining techniques and approaches that are suitable to
video data.
The objective of this book is to present the latest advances in video mining
and analysis techniques covering both theoretical approaches and real
applications. The book is expected to provide researchers and practitioners
a comprehensive understanding of the start-of-the-art of video mining
techniques and a resource for potential applications and successful
practice. This book will also serve as an important reference tool and
handbook for researchers and practitioners in video mining.
The target audience of this book will be mainly composed of researchers and
engineers as well as graduate students working on video analysis in various
disciplines, e.g. computer vision, pattern recognition, information
technology, image processing, artificial intelligence, etc. The book is
meant to be accessible to a broader audience including practicing
professionals working in video applications such as video surveillance,
video indexing and retrieval, etc.

Topics
The call for chapters aims to solicit research contributions that address
theory and practice in video mining and video-based applications. Tentative
topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

o Video clustering and categorization
o Video-based object recognition
o Video segmentation and summarization
o Video feature extraction and representation
o Video indexing and retrieval
o Video search engines
o Video editing and browsing systems
o Visual event and activity detection
o Statistical techniques for video analysis
o Semantic video content analysis
o Video processing for HCI
o Video surveillance (person identification, abnormal activity labeling,
etc.)
o Consumer video applications (sports highlight detection, commercial
message extraction, etc.)

Submission Procedure
Authors are invited to submit chapter proposals before January 15, 2009. The
1-2 page chapter proposals should contain a title, abstract and a
preliminary outline of the organization of the chapter. The abstract must
clearly explain the aim and scope of the proposed chapter. Proposals will be
evaluated based on the relevance of the chapter to the book, contribution to
the video mining community, and balance among the topics covered in the
book.
Authors of accepted proposals will be notified by February 1, 2009. Full
chapters are expected to be submitted no later than May 1, 2009. All
submitted chapters will be reviewed using a double-blind review.

Careful preparation of the manuscripts will help keep the production time
short and ensure publication of the chapter in the book. Please prepare the
manuscript as instructed in Springer-Verlag's author's guidelines for the
series "Studies in Computational Intelligence" at http://tinyurl.com/3wtqxb
.
Submissions and inquiries should be forwarded by email to the editors.

Important Dates
Deadline for chapter proposals (title, abstract, outline): January 15, 2009
Notification of proposal status (acceptance/rejection): February 1, 2009

Deadline for submission of full chapters: May 1, 2009
Notification of acceptance/rejection of chapters: July 1, 2009
Deadline for submission of final chapters: August 1, 2009

About This Series
The series "Studies in Computational Intelligence" (SCI) publishes new
developments and advances in the various areas of computational intelligence
- quickly and with a high quality. The intent is to cover the theory,
applications, and design methods of computational intelligence, as embedded
in the fields of engineering, computer science, physics and life science, as
well as the methodologies behind them. The series contains monographs,
lecture notes and edited volumes in computational intelligence spanning the
areas of neural networks, connectionist systems, genetic algorithms,
evolutionary computation, artificial intelligence, cellular automata,
self-organizing systems, soft computing, fuzzy systems, and hybrid
intelligent systems. Critical to both contributors and readers are the short
publication time and world-wide distribution - this permits a rapid and
broad dissemination of research results.
