The Ninth International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related
Formalisms (TAG+9)

7-8 June 2008
Tuebingen, Germany

http://tagplus9.cs.sfu.ca/

CALL FOR PAPERS

An important subfield of computational linguistics and natural
language processing is research on the formal machinery for describing
language. This covers a wide range of interdisciplinary work in the
cognitive science of language, including the mathematical and
algorithmic properties of this machinery, the grammatical description
of natural language, and the mechanisms of parsing and human language
use. This research is also applied to empirical areas leading to novel
algorithms and models for machine learning.

Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a prominent formalism in the study of
natural language because of its attractive formal properties and its
extended domain of locality. TAG has been studied extensively in the
last three decades with respect to mathematical properties and
computational applications, as well as its role in constructing
grammatical theories, new models of language processing and
applications.

This workshop, the latest in a series that has been running
successfully since 1990, aims at bringing together researchers
interested in various aspects of the TAG formalism including relations
to other grammar formalisms -- this is the reason for the "+" in the
workshop's name. In the past, interaction between such formalisms has
been productive, leading for example to the shared development of
broad-coverage grammars, transfer of parsing and machine learning
algorithms from one formalism to another and to new insights into
properties of different formalisms. Such related formalisms would
include minimalist syntax, categorial grammar, dependency grammars,
HPSG, LFG, and others which share with TAG general properties such as
lexicalization of syntactic structure, a simple notion of local
grammatical dependency, and a formal system strictly more powerful
than context-free but not fully context-sensitive.

Invited speakers:

* Uwe Moennich, University of Tuebingen
* Stuart Shieber, Harvard University

Topics:

We invite submissions on all aspects of TAG and related systems
including the following topics:

* syntactic and semantic theory;
* mathematical properties;
* computational and algorithmic studies of parsing, interpretation and
  generation;
* machine learning models for TAG;
* corpus-based research and grammar development using TAG;
* psycholinguistic modeling; and
* applications to natural language processing or biological sequence
  modeling.


Anonymous abstracts may be submitted for two sorts of presentations at
the workshop: spoken presentations and poster presentations.  Poster
presentations are particularly appropriate for brief descriptions of
specialized implementations, resources under development and work in
progress. Regardless of the type of submission, abstracts may not
exceed two pages in length (not including data, figures and
references).  Both one-column or two-column abstracts are
permissible. However do not use a font that is smaller than 11pt. If
you are using LaTeX for document preparation, then any recent ACL
style file can be used. The final camera ready will be in two-column
format conforming to the most recent ACL style file.

Email contact: tagplus@sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de

Important dates:

* Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 6, 2008. (deadline
  extended)
* Notification to authors of decision: April 10, 2008.
* Deadline for camera-ready submission: April 28, 2008.
* Workshop dates: June 7 to 8, 2008.

Proceedings including full papers for accepted abstracts (including
both oral presentations and poster presentations) will be available
on-line and at the workshop. In addition, we will explore
possibilities for subsequent publication of workshop articles, for
example through a special issue of a journal.
