Summer School of Sociolinguistics 
Short Title: SSS 2010 

Date: 14-Jun-2010 - 20-Jun-2010 
Location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom 
Contact: Anna Strycharz 
Contact Email: sssocio@ling.ed.ac.uk 
Meeting URL: http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~sssocio/SSS2010/Home.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Meeting Description: 

This week-long summer school is organised especially for PhD students in the last years of their research.  All participants will have a chance to take part in hands-on workshops led by renowned academics, present their papers and attend round-table discussions. The programme includes five day-long sessions on the following subjects:

Stance and indexicality
Sociolinguistics and multilingualism
Discourse in context
Children and sociolinguistics
Sociophonetics and gender

In addition this year we will have other workshops and panel sessions led both by academics, other invited speakers and PhD students from the University of Edinburgh (for details, please see Programme on our website).

All prospective student participants are asked to submit an application form with an abstract of a presentation falling within one of the above areas (see Call for Papers on the website).

There is no participation fee. However, student places will be limited, so we will only be able to host students whose submissions are accepted. Selection of student presentations will be on the basis of (i) their academic quality, (ii) potential benefit of the workshop for the participant and (iii) fit with the daily themes. For advice on accommodation, please contact the organisers.
