Subject: Journal Call for Papers

Full Title: Leuvense Bijdragen 


Linguistic Field(s): Dutch;Germanic;Historical Linguistics;Linguistic
Theories;Morphology;Pragmatics;Semantics;Syntax 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2009 

I plan on editing a special volume of Leuvense Bijdragen in the coming year
on the morphology, syntax and/or semantics/pragmatics of particle verbs in
Germanic languages past and present. Submissions within all theoretical
frameworks are welcome; in particular, I especially welcome papers that
focus on interface phenomena (i.e., morphology-semantics,
syntax-semantics/pragmatics), diachronic studies, microvariation with
Germanic languages and language change/attrition. 

Those interested are invited to submit a proposal/abstract of their
contribution to Michael Putnam (mputnam@cn.edu) by October 31, 2009. The
proposal should be approximately 500 words in length (excluding data and
references). Authors will be notified of the status of their papers by
November 30, 2009. 

All other questions and queries regarding the volume should be directed to
Michael Putnam (mputnam@cn.edu). 

Thank you,
Mike Putnam
