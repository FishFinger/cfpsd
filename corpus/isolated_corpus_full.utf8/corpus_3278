First Call for Papers

GENERATION CHALLENGES 2009
--------------------------

To be held in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

Following the NSF/SIGGEN Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative
Evaluation in NLG in April 2007
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/), and the INLG'06
Special Session on Sharing Data and Comparative Evaluation
(http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/inlg06-specsess.html),
there has recently been a lot of activity in connection with shared tasks
in Natural Language Generation (NLG).  The Pilot Attribute Selection for
Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place between May
and September 2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge
2008 has just been completed; the GIVE Challenge is currently underway;
and other challenges are being prepared.  More information about all of
these activities can be found via the links on the Generation Challenges
homepage: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09

To provide a common forum for these activities, we are organising
Generation Challenges 2009, an umbrella event designed to bring together a
variety of shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of
natural language.  Evaluation results and participating systems will be
presented at the Generation Challenges 2009 Special Session at the 12th
European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG'09).


1. Shared Tasks:
- - - - - - - - -

There will be three shared tasks at Generation Challenges 2009 which will
be organised independently (for details, please refer to the Call for
Participation for each task):

1. The GIVE Challenge (Koller, Byron, Moore, Oberlander & Striegnitz):
Generation of natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a
virtual environment. This task has started, for more information go to:

http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/v1akolle/proj/give

2. GREC Task (Belz, Gatt, Kow & Viethen): Generation of references to
named entities in discourse; exact task definition to be announced. For
more information go to:

http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/grec

3. TUNA Progress Test (Gatt, Belz & Kow): An opportunity to improve on
REG'08 Task 3, i.e. mapping from TUNA domain representations to referring
expressions. For more information go to:

http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/tuna


2. Special Track - Proposals for Future Tasks:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared
tasks in the general area of language generation.  Proposed tasks can
be in the area of core NLG, or straddle more than one research area in
which language is generated, e.g. core NLG and MT, or core NLG and
text summarisation.  Submissions should describe possible future tasks
in detail, including information regarding organisers, task
description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application
context, size and state of completion of data to be used, and
evaluation plans.


3. Open Track:
- - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers reporting any language generation
method and results obtained using the training and development data
from any of the shared task tracks.  The task definition should differ
from that in the corresponding shared task track, and submissions will
be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing criteria.


4. Evaluation Methods Track:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing any evaluation method that
can be used to evaluate systems submitted to any of the shared
tasks. Papers should report results for applying the evaluation method
to one or more systems implementing a solution to one of the shared
tasks (although different data may be used).  Submissions will
be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing criteria.


5. Instructions for Paper Submissions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Submissions in the Special Track, Open Track and Evaluation Methods
Track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long, and should follow
the ACL'09 guidelines using the style files provided via the
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 homepage.  Papers should be sent in PDF format by
email to nlg-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk.  Special Track papers should be
submitted no later than 30 November 2008.  Papers in the Open Track
and the Evaluation Methods Track should be submitted no later than 16
January 2009.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the review
committee (see below).  As reviewing will not be blind, there is no
need to anonymise papers.

Accepted submissions will be included in the ENLG'09 proceedings, but
the page limit for camera-ready versions has not yet been finalised
(the final limit will depend on how many submissions there are).
