Full Title: Dutch Dialect Geography and Internal Factors 

Date: 23-Nov-2007 - 23-Nov-2007
Location: Ghent, Belgium 
Contact Person: Gunther De Vogelaer
Meeting Email: gunther.devogelaer@ugent.be

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): Dutch (nld)

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description

Since the publication of the third volume of the Phonological Atlas of Dutch
Dialects (FAND) and the first volume of the Morphological and the Syntactic
Atlas of Dutch Dialects (MAND and SAND) in 2005, the Dutch language area may
very well be the best described area in the world with respect to dialect
variation. The present workshop aims at exploring the relevance of
system-internal factors for the patterns of diffusion that are described in
these atlases. To participate, send your one-page abstract (including
references) to gunther.devogelaer@ugent.be, to arrive no later than June, 30.
Talks are 20 min. (+ 10 min. discussion). We encourage abstracts in Dutch, but
non-native speakers of Dutch may submit English abstracts as well. Decisions on
the acceptance of the abstract can be expected before September, 1. A selection
of papers will appear as a theme issue of Taal & Tongval
(http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/taalentongval/). 

Recent years have seen a renewed interest for dialect geography, including
publications such as Barbiers, Cornips & van der Kleij (2002) on European
dialect syntax; Kortmann & Schneider (2004) on varieties of English; Labov, Ash
& Boberg (2006) on North American dialects. But quite unlike during the earlier
heydays of dialect geography, this 'neo-dialectological' movement seems to be
theory-driven rather than data-driven (see Kortmann 2002, Horvath 2004, and
Filppula et al. 2005: vii for similar observations). In principle, the
availability of geographical data opens up new possibilities as to the use of
patterns of geographic diffusion as an information source, but these
possibilities are currently underused. The main reason for this is probably the
basic assumption in dialectology that system-internal (or 'functional') factors
can only serve to explain the actuation of linguistic innovations, and not the
success with which these innovations are diffused (see, e.g., Milroy
1992:201-202, Labov 1994:598, and especially Croft 2000:166). Recently, however,
this assumption has been challenged (see Haspelmath 1999, Andersen 2005, Seiler
2005; see Rosenbach forthcoming for discussion). 

The present workshop aims at exploring the relevance of system-internal factors
for the patterns of diffusion that are described in these atlases. More
precisely, we invite talks on the following topics: 

1. The relevance of one or more internal factors for the patterns of diffusion
that are found in the Dutch dialect atlases (SAND, MAND, FAND) 
The data can also be found online, via: 
http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/projecten/mand/GTRPdataperitem.html (MAND, FAND) 
http://www.meertens.nl/sand/zoeken/index.php (SAND) 

2. The broader question whether internal factors are indeed relevant for
actuation and/or diffusion, and for language change in general, including the
way in which this relevance is observed in the behaviour of individual language
users 

3. The methodology of theory-driven dialect geographical research, and the
relevance of dialect geographical data for different theoretical frameworks
