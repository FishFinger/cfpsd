Scholars are invited to submit their work on the linguistic study of the
comic arts. The essays in this edited collection will focus on the ways
that linguistic codes function in comics. 

Any aspect of linguistic theory and analysis is welcome, and all
submissions should appeal to both comics scholars and linguists. All forms
of comics will be considered:  graphic novels, comic strips, comic books,
on-line comics, videos, etc.

Scholarship in non-English and multilingual comics is especially encouraged.

Possible topics for this edited collection:
Pidgin/creole studies, politeness theory, conversation analysis, language
variation, speech act theory, bilingual/multilingual texts, intercultural
communication, language & gender, language & sexuality, code switching,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, corpus linguistics, cognitive
linguistics, interactional sociolinguistics, standard/prestige language,
language policy, language & ethnicity/race, constructed languages, critical
discourse analysis, language socialization, language death, and language
preservation.

Contributor Guidelines:
1. Abstracts of 400-500 words accepted. Papers of  5000-8000 words,
including notes and bibliography, accepted.
2. One-page tailored curriculum vitae for each author and co-author.
(Narrative CVs are fine.)
3. All documents should be submitted as Word or Word-compatible files. PDFs
are also acceptable.
4. Submission deadline: Monday, November 16, 2009.
5. Materials should be sent to Frank Bramlett via email: 
fbramlett@unomaha.edu.
