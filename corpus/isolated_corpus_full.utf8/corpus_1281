*************************************************************
The Natural Language Processing Laboratory of the Program in Linguistics at
Purdue University is pleased to announce the fourth meeting of the Midwest
Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-4). This colloquium offers a less
formal forum for computational linguistics researchers to get together and
present ideas and work. It is intended to be primarily for researchers from the
Midwest region, but applications from all regions are welcome.
Submission Guidelines

* Researchers should prepare a 2-page, extended abstract (including the authorÂ’s
names and full bibliographic references) using the ACL style files.

* The abstract should be submitted through the MCLC-4 website:
http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jspartz/mclc4.htm

* Abstracts should be submitted using the online upload form no later than March
16, 2007. The abstract should be attached as a .pdf file.

**************************************************************
Review

MCLC will accept 24 papers for presentation at the Symposium. The organizing
committee will select papers primarily on a first-come, first-served basis,
while also ensuring a broad representation of different computational
linguistics groups. Some or all accepted papers may be published, even if not
presented.

**************************************************************
Publication

Authors of accepted abstracts will be asked to submit a 4-8 page full paper
using the ACL style files for the proceedings, which will be distributed in a
CD.  Copyright of a submitted paper will remains with the author(s).

**************************************************************

Registration for MCLC-4 will be free, but there will be a small fee for the CD
proceedings.
