3rd International Workshop on Information Technologies: status and =

opportunities for the Amazigh.
November 24 & 25, 2008
Institut Royal de La Culture Amazighe, Rabat, Morocco
http://www.ircam.ma/fr/index.php?soc=3Dmanif&rd=3D44 =

<http://www.ircam.ma/fr/index.php?soc=3Dmanif&rd=3D44>

Submission deadline: October 10, 2008


This Workshop aims to be an occasion to gather researchers and =

specialists to present work in relation to natural languages in =

particular the amazighe
language. Let us find there an occasion to identify, on the one hand =

problems to be surmounted so that a language and a particular culture is =

supported in
the NTIC, and on the other hand possible and standard mechanisms to find =

solutions.
Indeed, one of the main aims of this workshop is to discuss steps and =

means which would allow a harmonious integration of the natural language in
computer tools, in particular the amazigh language. It also aims to =

increase interest of specialists and researchers to the field of human =

linguistic
technologies (TLH) applied to the amazigh. To privilege a profitable =

exchange, we propose to debate the following axes which integrate =

theoretical,
methodological aspects and practices of :

1. Cultural diversity and NTIC.
2. Data-processing management of the multilingualism
3. Feasibility of the data-processing localization
4. Data-processing standards of treatment of the languages.
5. The data-processing coding of languages
6. Translation tools and techniques applied to the NTIC.
7. Linguistic engineering.
8. Collect and numerical stock management
9. Electronic dictionaries
Etc.

The workshop wants to be also an opportunity for experts, researchers =

and various actors to discuss relative questions with the blooming of =

the natural
language and its integration in the NTIC. The workshop will be as well =

an occasion to pay a particular homage to the eminent professor LAHBIB =

ZENKOUAR for
his important contribution to the
amazigh culture.
