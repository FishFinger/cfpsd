Meeting Description:

The National Russian Corpus (www.ruscorpora.ru) is an e-archive project that has been launched two years ago. It is a relatively young web-resource, and is not yet used to the extent that fully uncovers its potential. Most of the teachers of Russian are unaware of the Corpus; its broader application could be an important new impact in the development of language teaching in all domains where Russian is taught. 
The issues to be covered are:
- The National Russian Corpus as an innovative teaching technology;
- The National Russian Corpus in teaching Russian to foreign students; 
- The National Russian Corpus in teaching Russian at schools and high schools;
- The use of the National Russian Corpus in writing new reference books and manuals; 
- The role of the National Russian Corpus in determining the content of language teaching;
- The National Russian Corpus and compilation of modern dictionaries and reference books of Russian;
- The use of the National Russian Corpus in language tests; 
- Creating specialized educational corpora. 

The site of the National Russian Corpus project (www.ruscorpora.ru) has been launched two years ago and is a relatively new internet resource, still underused by the Russian audience. Although it could have a significant positive impact on the systemic aspects of teaching Russian, there are not many teachers of Russian who are aware of its existence. 

This letter is an invitation for you to take part in the conference and share your experience of using the National Russian Corpus with other users, both actual and future.

The issues to be covered are:
