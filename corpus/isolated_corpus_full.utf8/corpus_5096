CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

 ISSI 2009 - 12th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics
              July 14-17, 2009, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
                       http://www.issi2009.org

*** Early bird registration deadline: April 30 ***
*** List of accepted papers now online ***


SCOPE

The biannual ISSI conference is the premier international venue for 
research within the areas of informetrics, scientometrics and 
bibliometrics. The purpose of the ISSI 2009 conference is to bring 
together scientists, research managers and authorities, as well as 
information and communication related professionals in an open 
international forum to discuss advancements of theory and 
applications in the field, and to shape future research directions 
through the publication of high quality applied and theoretical 
research findings. ISSI 2009 also includes satellite workshops 
and a Doctoral Forum.

ISSI 2009 is organised under the auspices of ISSI - 
the International Society for Informetrics and Scientometrics 
(http://www.issi-society.info/). 


VENUE

The conference will be held at the Forum of Science and Culture, 
located on the Praia Vermelha Campus, which is one of the oldest and 
most charming buildings of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
The neoclassical palace built in 1852 has special installations 
adapted to host conferences and workshops.

The City of Rio de Janeiro is an awe-inspiring city of contrasts. 
Impossibly steep granite mountains jut out of the ocean between 
glorious stretches of golden sand, impeccable colonial buildings 
nestle in between modern glass skyscrapers and verdant forests 
tumble down hillsides into densely populated residential areas. 
It is a city high on life, a city of beach worship, football, samba 
and Carnival. And high above all this fun and frivolity stands Rio's 
ever-present, iconic landmark - the statue of Christ the Redeemer.
