CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
*******************************************************************

7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
Plus GALA - Gathering of Life-like Agents
17th - 19th September 2007

Paris, France
http://iva07.ntua.gr

deadline for early registration: July 20th -

*******************************************************************

SCOPE

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied 
agents in an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able to 
interact intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and especially 
with human users. The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for 
researchers and practitioners in computer graphics, animation, computer 
games, virtual environments, artificial intelligence, natural language 
processing, cognitive modeling, human-computer interaction and 
artificial life. Since the first IVA back in 1999 firm lines of research 
have been established but there is much that the graphics and AI 
communities can learn from each other.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and 
practitioners from academia and industry with an interest in the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of IVAs and IVA applications.

IVA07 will also host GALA  The Gathering of Life-like Agents
