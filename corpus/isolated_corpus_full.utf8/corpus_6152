Full Title: Semantics of Possession 

Date: 26-Nov-2009 - 27-Nov-2009
Location: Tallinn, Estonia 
Contact Person: Maria Koptjevskaja Tamm

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 10-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

Semantics of adnominal possession and attribution in Uralic and otherwise in
modern linguistics, the issue of a semantic definition of adnominal possession
has been continuously addressed in semantic terms. Indisputably, a semantic
approach has proven to be fruitful over time, especially for the purpose of
cross-linguistic comparison. It is reasonable to isolate the primary semantic
domain of the possessive constructions, thus providing methodological grounds
for a rigorous typological definition of the category and its cross-linguistic
identification. On the other hand, it has always been clear that the possessive
construction only rarely remains within its primary semantic domain. We believe
therefore that the 'extended' semantics and functions of possessive nominal
constructions are best considered paradigmatically, i.e., in their relation to
the semantics and functions of the other nominal constructions in a language and
across languages. 

Our hope is that we can find interesting cross-linguistic generalizations,
primarily, on the form-function correlations within the domain of nominal
relations, both global, areal and genetic (see our website for more information). 

Call for Papers

For this workshop we invite talks and posters that consider these issues in
Uralic languages and otherwise and that can serve as the basis for a further
discussion. The points open for discussion can, for instance, include such as:
-  what relations qualify as nominal and should be included in the list?
-  what constructions should be considered?

Please send your abstract (max. 1 page) to the organizers by November 10, 2009.
