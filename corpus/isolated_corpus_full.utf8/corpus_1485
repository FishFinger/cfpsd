Meeting Description:

This meeting is focused on 'BioNLP,' or biomedical natural language
processing--in particular, on research related to the utility, usability,
portability, and robustness of biomedical text mining applications. 

Biomedical science is now an information-intensive field of study, with
high-throughput experimental techniques generating large amounts of data, and
bioinformatics providing tools for managing and making sense of that data.
However, the information generated and used in biomedical science must be
accessible both to computers and to people. This requires constant translation
between human-readable forms, such as text and figures, to computer-readable
forms, such as biological databases and ontologies. In a recent PLoS
Computational Biology editorial, Philip Bourne posed the following question:
Will a biological database be different from a biological journal? If we had
text mining tools that worked, then the translation from text to database (and
back) would blur these lines. Such tools would enable the seamless incorporation
of semantic information extracted from text with databases and with analytical
tools, as just one of many sources of information in addressing complex
biological problems.

From the many publications in the area, we know that performance has reached
reasonable levels on a number of basic text mining tasks, such as indexing and
the identification of some semantic classes of biomedical entities. We now need
to ask a new set of questions: Do these tools work? Can they be adapted to new
applications? Are they cost-effective in real applications? Who uses these
tools, and how? Can these tools be maintained over time? The answers to these
questions are critical to understanding the apparent gap between the number of
publications on biomedical text mining and the number of deployed text mining
applications. The answers to these questions are also essential to providing the
bioinformatics community with the text mining tools that they are asking for. We
categorize these questions into four attributes: utility, usability,
portability, and robustness.

The session will focus on papers that explore these issues, including questions
such as:  

- What is the actual utility of text mining in the work flows of the various
communities of potential users--model organism database curators, bedside
clinicians, biologists utilizing high-throughput experimental assays, hospital
billing departments?

- How usable are biomedical text mining applications? How does the application
fit into the workflow of a complex bioinformatics pipeline? What kind of
training does a bioscientist require to be able to use an application?

- Is it possible to build portable text mining systems? Can systems be adapted
to specific domains and specific tasks without the assistance of an experienced
language processing specialist?

- How robust and reliable are biomedical text mining applications? What are the
best ways to assess robustness and reliability? Are the standard evaluation
paradigms of the natural language processing world--intrinsic evaluation against
a gold standard, post-hoc judging of outputs by trained judges, extrinsic
evaluation in the context of some other task--the best evaluation paradigms for
biomedical text mining, or even sufficient evaluation paradigms?

Submission information:

The core of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing consists of rigorously
peer-reviewed full-length papers reporting on original work. Accepted papers
will be published in a hard-bound archival proceedings, and the best of these
will be presented orally to the entire conference. Researchers wishing to
present their research without official publication are encouraged to submit a
one page abstract by noon, November 9, 2007 to present their work in the poster
sessions. 

Important dates:

Paper submissions due: July 16, 2007
Notification of paper acceptance: September 5, 2007
Final paper deadline: September 24, 2007 midnight PT
Abstract deadline: November 9, 2007
Meeting: January 4-8, 2008
