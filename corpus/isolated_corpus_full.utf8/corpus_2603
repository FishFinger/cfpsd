Call Deadline: 21-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The SEMDIAL series of workshops aim to bring together researchers working on the
semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such as artificial intelligence,
computational linguistics, formal semantics/pragmatics, philosophy, psychology,
and neural science. In 2008 we will celebrate eleven years of the SEMDIAL series
with the LONDIAL workshop, to be organized at King's College London (KCL) in
conjunction with the Interaction, Media and Communication Group at Queen Mary
London (QMUL). The SEMDIAL workshops are always stimulating and fun, and with
KCL being in the heart of London, just across from the South Bank Centre, there
will be no shortage of evening entertainment. 

Second Call for Papers

LONDIAL: 2008 Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue
King's College London, June 2nd - June 4th, 2008

Leverhulme-funded network Dialogue Matters: Foundations for Technology
Development, initially set up between London (KCL, QMUL), Edinburgh/Glasgow,
Stanford, Stony Brook, Gothenburg, Essex, with additional collaborators now also
participating. This two-day workshop on 1st-2nd June will feature invited
presentations by members of this group and other leaders of the computational
linguistics and human language technology community. This series of workshops
has provided an extremely fruitful synergy of theoretical, historical,
computational and psycho-linguists, with overlapping interests in dialogue
modeling. Confirmed speakers include Susan Brennan, Amanda Stent, Robin Cooper
and Staffan Larsson. 

There is also a planned session on dialogue situated in joint action.

Submission:
Deadline for receipt of papers is 21st March 2008, 23:59 UTC.
Submit your paper via the web at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=londial2008

Before submitting you must register with the website and receive a password by
email; please do this well ahead of your submission, since email is sometimes
unreliable. You will also need to fill out a web form with the author details
and type in (or paste) a plain-text version of your abstract (200 words), in
addition to uploading your paper.

The actual paper should be an anonymous PDF file, 8 pages long (including data,
tables, figures, and references), A4 paper size, 11pt Times font, 2.5 cm (1
inch) margins, 2-column format. Include a one-paragraph abstract of the entire
work (about 200 words). You may find it convenient to use the style files
provided by COLING/ACL 2006.

Multiple submissions by the same author or group of authors are allowed, but
each person may only give one oral presentation at the workshop.

We will have a separate submission of late-breaking system demonstrations and
ongoing project descriptions, to be presented in a poster session during the
workshop. Late-breaking submissions will be two pages long; they will not be
refereed, but evaluated for relevance only by the program committee chairs.
Submission of late-breaking abstracts will be allowed only after review of the
main session papers has concluded. The deadline for late-breaking submissions is
30th April 2008.

Invited Speakers:
David Traum, University of Southern California
Andrzej Wisniewski, University of Zielona GÃ³ra
Susan Fussell, Carnegie Mellon University
(one more to be confirmed)

Proceedings:
Final, 8-page versions of the accepted papers, together with the 2-page accepted
late-breaking abstracts, will be distributed in a proceedings volume at the
workshop. In order to ensure publication in the proceedings, at least one author
of each paper must have registered to attend the meeting by 30th April 2008, the
deadline of submission of the revised paper.

Organization:
Pat Healey (program co-chair)
Jonathan Ginzburg (program co-chair)
Ruth Kempson, Miriam Bouzouita, Eleni Gregoromichelaki (local arrangements)

Meeting Description:

CAFFEi-2008

Workshop on Computational aspects of affectual and emotional interaction
21-22 July 2008, Patras, Greece
http://caffei.iit.demokritos.gr/

The workshop is organized as part of the 18th European Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2008) and will be held in July 2008,
in Patras, Greece. 

Call for Papers

Description and Topics:
A key enabling technology for next-generation artificial intelligence agents for
the service, domestic and entertainment market is natural human-computer
interaction. An AI agent that collaborates with humans on a daily basis requires
interactive skills that go beyond present-day language technology: seamless and
natural interaction requires that the AI agent is able to correctly interpret
(and to some extend also generate) linguistic signals that involve the emotional
state of the person they interact with, to behave differently in different
emotional contexts, to exhibit a different personality in order to co-operate
well with humans having different personalities, and to correctly interpret
humour or irony.

CAFFEi aims to bring together researchers working on the computational
modelling of emotions and affect, and especially their linguistic realization,
for the purposes of affectual human-computer interaction.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- affect and emotion recognition and generation, and particularly linguistic
aspects thereof in text and speech;
- personality trait modelling, and impact of computer personality traits and
affect analysis on natural language generation and dialogue management;
- evaluation of emotional impact of automatically generated text;
- evaluation methods for emotion-sensitive parsing, generation, and dialogue
management;
- emotion text classification and affect text classification, used to evaluate
or analyse human-computer or human-human interaction;
- generating and recognizing humour and irony;
- non-linguistic aspects of human-computer interaction, such as facial, gesture,
and posture recognition, audio signal processing, avatars and virtual faces,
etc., especially when used in conjunction to linguistic interaction modalities.

Invited Speaker:
Prof. Yorick Wilks, Univ. Sheffield (http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~yorick/) will
deliver a talk during the workshop.

Important Dates:
Apr 10: paper submission
May 10: notification
May 26: camera-ready copy and author registration
July 21 or 22: workshop date.

Participation and Paper Submission:
The language of the conference will be English and we invite research papers,
work-in-progress papers, and position papers. All submissions will be reviewed
by an international programme committee.

Workshop proceedings will be prepared in paper and on CD-ROM. Each
participant will receive a hardcopy of CAFFEi proceedings, as well as a CD with
the proceedings of all ECAI'08 workshops. Workshop authors will maintain the
copyrights of their papers, but will be required to sign a form allowing the
local organizers to include their paper in the workshop's proceedings. The
possibility of a journal special issue based on the workshop proceedings will be
discussed during the workshop.

Submissions should follow the style described in the ECAI-08 guidelines and be
up to 10 pages in length, including title, author names, abstract, and body.
Please use PDF as file format. Latex styles files implementing ECAI guidelines
can be found here: http://www.ece.upatras.gr/ecai2008/documents/ecai2008.zip

Paper submission details will be announced at a later date.

Registration:
Workshop attendants are required to register to the main conference and to the
workshop. At least one author of each accepted workshop paper is required to
register by the camera-ready submission deadline. Registration will be done
through the ECAI-08 registration site,
http://www.ece.upatras.gr/ecai2008/registration.htm

CAFFEi authors will be able to register at early-registration dates, regardless
of the early-registration set for ECAI participants in general.
