the Minimalist program, like Remnant Movement, Head versus Phrasal Movement,
Topic and Focus effects as a result of movement, among others. The last day of
the School will be devoted to a day-long conference on the topic "Spec and Head/
Spec or Head?"

The teaching will consist of the following faculty who are established experts
in the above topics:

-	Ian Roberts, University of Cambridge
-	KA Jayaseelan, CIEFL, Hyderabad (retd.)
-	Anders Holmberg, University of Newcastle upon Tyne
-	Nomi Erteschik-Shir, Ben Gurion University
-	Anoop Mahajan, UCLA (not confirmed)

All prospective students for the spring school, are requested to send an email
to fosssil06@gmail.com with the following information latest by 10th February 2007:

their application not exceeding 500 words on the status of specifiers and heads
in the Minimalist Program, with specific attention to the possibility or
impossibility of reduction of one to the other.
