Second Call For Papers

Gesture in Multimodal Systems

Special issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing
http://www.worldscinet.com/ijsc/
  
---------------------------------------------------

Guest editors:
- Craig Martell (Naval Postgraduate School)
- Dan Loehr (MITRE)


This special issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing
(http://www.worldscinet.com/ijsc/) is concerned with models of gesture that
can contribute to semantics for multimodal systems.  We see this as ranging
from simply using gesture to help understand the most salient part of
another modality, e.g., speech, to full-blown gestural interfaces, to the
building of data/corpora to support this research.

We follow Adam Kendon's broad definition: 'Gesture: Visible action as
utterance' (2004, Cambridge).  That is, we consider gesture any body
movement that contributes information.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Interpretation of gestural behavior
- Gesture synthesis
- Gesture as input
- Studies of gesture in interaction with other modalities
- Corpora of gesture in multimodal systems
- What can multimodal systems learn from computational analyses of
  sign language?
- Etc.
