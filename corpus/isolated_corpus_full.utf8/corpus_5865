Meeting Description:

Canadian Association of University Teachers of German (CAUTG) (www.cautg.or=
g) Montr=E9al, Qu=E9bec, Canada, 28-31 May 2010

The CAUTG meeting is part of the annual Congress of the Humanities and Soci=
al Sciences of Canada (www.fedcan.ca). =20

'Germany-France: Meetings and Reunions.'=20

Many chapters of French and German literary history are presented as the de=
velopment of influences or readings coming from Germany or France.  From th=
e learned and popular references which Germany and France shared in the Mid=
dle Ages, to their dialogue at the time of the French Renaissance and the e=
mpire of Charles Quint, to the mythological echoes in Goethe, to the spread=
ing of romantic ideals and romantic imagination, and, later, of Marxist mov=
ements: countless moments offer themselves to the scholar, to trace the fec=
und intellectual filiations between the two neighbours. These moments, some=
times concealed, sometimes revealed by the nationalisms of the two countrie=
s, seem to be foundational of a modernity which explodes with the Dadaist m=
ovement in the midst of WWI. But we cannot be solely satisfied with the ter=
m 'influence': does chronology imply hierarchy? Does the impact lead, in tu=
rn, to influence, recognition, creation? Does the model serve as mirror to =
aesthetic consciences? By suggesting a joint session between our associatio=
ns, the communications of which would be in English, we hope to pave the wa=
y for a pluridisciplinary debate not only on the relationship between natio=
nal identity and creation, but also between influence and self-invention. B=
y focusing on the great dialogues ranging from Enlightenment through Romant=
icism to the first decades of cinema in Europe and up to today, our session=
s will consider influence as meeting and literary history as reunion.'=20

Call for Papers:

The conference welcomes papers on any aspect of German-language studies. Yo=
u are invited to submit proposals for papers to be given at the CAUTG annua=
l meeting at Concordia University, part of the annual Congress of the Human=
ities and Social Sciences of Canada (www.fedcan.ca). Papers presenting orig=
inal, unpublished research on any topic or period of German-language litera=
ture, cinema, cultural studies, German language and language pedagogy are w=
elcome, in English, French or German.

You may submit a proposal in one or more of the following categories:

1) Single paper proposals: maximum 600 words.

2) Panel proposals: panels of three papers on a related theme are welcome. =
 The panel organizer should submit a proposal explaining the theme as well =
as the proposals for the individual papers as a package.  Maximum 2000 word=
s.  The panel proposals will be assessed on their merits as a panel separat=
ely from the single paper proposals.
 =20
3) Joint session: we are especially pleased to announce a joint session in =
conjunction with l'Association canadienne des =E9tudes fran=E7aises.  Propo=
sals for this session should be 600 words maximum.=20

A copy of your proposal should be in the hands of the program chair no late=
r than 15 November 2009; late proposals will not be considered. Proposals a=
re to be submitted electronically as a Word document or .rtf file. Because =
the proposals are refereed blind by an adjudication committee, the authors'=
 names should not appear on the proposal itself. Please include your univer=
sity affiliation and contact information in the e-mail with which you send =
your proposal. Decisions will be announced by the end of December.

Presentation time at the conference is limited to 20 minutes per paper. =20

Primary sources in German should be quoted in the original language (except=
 for the joint session with French studies, where English will be the worki=
ng language). Please note that presenters must be paid-up CAUTG members at =
the time of their presentation.

Submissions and inquiries should be addressed to:
