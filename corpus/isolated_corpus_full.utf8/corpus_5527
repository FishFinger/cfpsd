Meeting Description:

RANLP 2009 Workshop on Partial Parsing 2: Between Chunking and Deep Parsing

Motivation:

After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are happy to=
 announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a standard means of=
 integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as infor=
mation retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which eff=
iciency and robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and de=
ep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer th=
an chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial=
 parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking=
) without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial parsing i=
s not a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to almost f=
ull parsing. This workshop will bring together researchers who work on part=
ial parsing in its different interpretations.=20

Scope:

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted =
to):
=20
- Linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: syntacti=
c and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical structure, semantic i=
nformation (anaphora, disambiguation);=20
- Development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine learning, =
hybrid;=20
- The usability of language resources for the development of partial parser=
s;=20
- Multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;=20
- Experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers=
 for new languages;=20
- Technical aspects of partial parsers: robustness, scalability; time and s=
pace complexity; expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. =
context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);=20
- Applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question answeri=
ng, machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical informatio=
n, etc.;=20
- Evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards, application=
-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different partial parsin=
g tasks, etc.;=20
- Ways of combining multiple partial parsers;=20
- Comparison (classification) of partial parsers.
