3rd International Conference On Hispanic Linguistics: Young Researchers in
Language & Linguistics 

3rd International Conference on Hispanic Linguistics:
Young Researchers in Language & Linguistics
University of Vigo

First Call for Papers

The third International Conference on Hispanic Linguistics: Young Researchers in
Language & Linguistics will be held at the University of Vigo (School of
Philology & Translation) from 18-20 October 2007. The aim of this and past
conferences has always been to provide young researchers (final year
undergraduates, postgraduates, researchers who have obtained their PhDs during
the past three years) with the possibility of delivering papers to present the
result of their work on the field of language and linguistics. 
Apart from the papers delivered by young researchers and promising scholars
we'll also have several plenary lectures given by outstanding academics. The
official languages of the conference will be those spoken in the Iberian
Peninsula (Sign Languages included) together with English and French.  
Scholars and researchers interested in presenting papers must send a 100-to-250
word abstract of their proposal (with an English version of it) before June 20th
2007. Abstracts should include name(s), institutional affiliation(s) and a brief
CV of the author(s), as well as telephone, ordinary mail, email address and
technical support. Acceptance of proposals will be confirmed not later than July
10th 2007 by the scientific committee with a well-reasoned report. It will also
state the guidelines for both the paper delivery and its subsequent publication
in the conference proceedings. 
An early version of the programme and further info on registration,
accommodation and other preliminary arrangements will be posted in the
conference website.

Meeting Description:

Teaching business communication in L1, L2 ... Ln: current research and
reflections on theories and methods
Symposium at the AILA 2008 World Congress of Applied Linguistics in Essen
(Germany), August 24-29, 2008 

Dear all,

Although the abstract submission deadline is very near (or even passed; but I
negotiated with the organizers that being a bit late would not create an
insurmountable problem), I had the idea to convene a symposium at the AILA World
Congress in Essen (Germany), August 24-29, 2008.

The subject would be ''Teaching business communication in L1, L2 ... Ln: current
research and reflections on theories and methods'', and this is the current
version of my proposal:

''In some countries - e.g. the US - there is a tradition in business schools of
teaching business communication practices mainly in L1, i.e. in English. In
other cultures, business communication is strictly associated with foreign
language teaching; rhetorical and textual competences in L1 are only discussed
and trained in para-universitarian, voluntary training courses. Further
differences arise due to different interpretations of the term ''business
communication'', which may be interpreted as a synonym of ''corporate
communication'', but which may also refer to any communication process in a
business context.

This symposium will try to bring these different approaches together. Besides
terminological reflections (about the term ''business communication'' and
related expressions) there should be discussions of the similarities and
differences in teaching business communication in L1, L2 (for non-English
natives mostly English) and other foreign languages learnt with business
purposes in mind. Which synergy effects could be used - and is there a
multilingual business communication didactics possible and useful which might
also include L1?

In applied linguistics, which was originally rather foreign language orientated,
there has been a tendency towards a split into at least two distinct
communities, one interested in foreign language teaching, and one interested in
general communication problems. Due to the special role of English as lingua
franca which is no longer a typical ''foreign language'', these two communities
should and could be brought together again. This symposium is therefore intended
to be a forum for researchers (and practitioners) interested in L1-, L2- and
multilingual didactics and, in particular, in the relationship between English
and other (business) languages.''

If you are interested, I would appreciate it if you could send an abstract as
soon as possible (to me - and I would send the whole package to the organizers);
even more important however would be an immediate expression of interest to
participate - so that I can see rather quickly, if the project can be realized
at all. I would also accept a ''partner'' as second convener - if you could
imagine doing such a ''job'', let me know!

If you have already submitted an abstract to AILA 2008 which you think might fit
into the symposium, it could certainly be 'redirected''. Formal requirements for
proposal submission are available at:

http://www.aila2008.org/how-to-submit-a-proposal.html

I hope to receive many positive and quick replies from you,

With best wishes from Vienna,

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
