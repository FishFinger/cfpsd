Meeting Description:

The aim of this conference is to compare recent experiences in mother tongue
education in two distinct but at times intersecting contexts: the context of
indigenous communities in Latin American countries and Caribbean Creole
communities.  Three main sections are proposed:
1. Educational Planning and IBE;
2. Language Policy and Language Rights; 
3. Empowerment through Language Development. 

First Call for Papers

Language and Mother Tongue Education: From Policies to Classroom Experiences

What's new in Latin America and the Caribbean?

State-bound intercultural bilingual education (IBE) was first developed in Latin
America in the 1980s and 1990s in an effort to meet pressing educational needs
in countries with large indigenous populations such as Bolivia, Ecuador and
Guatemala. IBE, an educational model based on the use of the mother tongue of
the children, additionally contains a strong socio-cultural component that makes
minority language teaching and teaching in the minority language more effective
and meaningful, thus contributing to the empowerment of the speakers. 

In Nicaragua, the Law 571 on Education in the Languages of the Atlantic Coast
(1980) led, first, to a literacy campaign in the native languages of the region
(1980) and later to the establishment of a bilingual education program (1984/5).
The 1987 Law of Autonomy, a unique model in the Latin-American context, provided
a legal framework for the educational process at large.

Caribbean Creole communities, albeit likewise speaking minorized languages, have
only recently started to catch onto educational models comparable to IBE. This
is at least in part due to their even more conflictual self perceptions as
distinct groups: while Latin American indigenous communities were for a long
time considered to represent undesirable cultures and languages which should be
given up for the benefits of the socio-politically dominant language, Creole
communities were led to believe they had nothing of their own, just deformations
of the dominant languages and cultures. The case of Nicaragua can be considered
as an exception in the sense that, along with the indigenous languages Miskitu
and Sumu-Mayangna, Creole was incorporated into the original IBE program. It is
fair to say, however, that although pro-Creole ideology was behind the program
and Creole teachers carried it out, the materials were elaborated in English as
the language had not been standardized.

The aim of this conference is to compare recent experiences in mother tongue
education in two distinct but at times intersecting contexts: the context of
indigenous communities in Latin American countries and Caribbean Creole
communities. This main focus on mother tongue education and IBE requires,
however, that we also examine the language policies and the state of the art in
language planning which allow for the enacting of such curricula. 

Therefore, we propose three main sections into which contributions should fall:
1. Educational Planning and IBE;
2. Language Policy and Language Rights; 
3. Empowerment through Language Development.

We are inviting contributions of 20 minutes, to be followed by 10 minutes of
discussion. The official languages of the conference are English, Spanish, and
English-based creoles. The fact that only English-based creoles are cited as
official languages reflects the venue of the conference, not the Creole
communities to be treated in individual papers. Please submit an electronic
abstract of approximately one page to one of the two addresses below. If you are
unable to send the abstract as an attachment (word or rtf), you may paste it
into the body of the e-mail message. Alternatively, you may send us a hard copy
through ordinary mail. The deadline for sending in abstracts is October 31st, 2006.

Location: Berlin, Germany 
Contact Person: Hans-Martin Gaertner
Meeting Email: bfe@zas.gwz-berlin.de


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Language Family(ies): Austronesian 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Conference 'Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a more comprehensive view
of Austronesian morphosyntax is aimed at bringing together researchers focusing
on aspects of Austronesian morphosyntax other than grammatical relation, voice
and transitivity marking. There will also be a one day special session on
'Sentence Types and Speech Act Marking in Austronesian Languages.' 

Main Session (13-14 Sep 2007): 
Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a More Comprehensive View of Austronesian
Morphosyntax

Austronesian languages are justly famous for their unusual systems of
grammatical relation, voice and transitivity marking. Not surprisingly then the
large majority of studies published on aspects of Austronesian morphosyntax deal
with this subject area. Concomitantly, there is a tendency to overlook the fact
that languages of this family show a host of other morphosyntactic phenomena
which pose fascinating problems for typology and grammatical theory. These include:

- a large variety of multi-predicate constructions, including serial verbs,
complex predicates and auxiliary or ''pseudo-verb'' constructions;
- morphosyntactic restrictions on clause chaining;
- classifier systems of various degrees of complexity;
- clausal and phrasal constituent structures which show both configurational and
non-configurational properties;
- complex systems of directional particles and verbs;
- morphologically marked modality distinctions (realis vs. irrealis);
- large inventories of clitics with heterogeneous functions and formal properties;
- gerunds and other types of nominalizations;
- different types of optional plural marking;
-etc.

We invite proposals for contributions to any of these and related topics.
Studies on these topics often will also have implications for the well-known
issues regarding the analysis of grammatical relations, voice and transitivity,
and contributors are welcome to make these implications explicit. However, the
main topic of the paper should be clearly outside, and go beyond, the 'canonic'
topics just mentioned.

The time slot for contributions is 30 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion.
There will be no parallel sessions and thus only 14 slots for the papers in
addition to the invited papers.

Invited speakers are:
Isabelle Bril (CNRS, Paris)
Daniel Kaufman (Cornell University)
Paul Kroeger (GIAL, Dallas)
Ulrike Mosel (University of Kiel)

There will be an additional lecture by:
Malcolm Ross (ANU Canberra)

Special Session (15 Sep 2007):
Sentence Types and Speech Act Marking in Austronesian Languages

We invite proposals focusing on sentence types and speech act marking in
Austronesian languages. We welcome talks addressing the particular grammatical
means (intonation, word order, particles etc.) a particular language or group of
languages uses for distinguishing sentence types, where by ''sentence type'' we
mean both the major and minor illocutionary force indicating types (declarative,
interrogative, imperative, exclamative) as well as types of subordinate clauses
(relative, conditional, concessive etc.). Analyses of concomitant semantic and
pragmatic peculiarities are equally welcome.

There will be 7 slots for 30+10 minute contributions (talk+discussion).

Deadline for electronic submission of anonymous abstracts (500 words max +
examples and references, if any; abstract submission as PDF): 28 FEB 2007

Abstracts should be sent to: bfe@zas.gwz-berlin.de.

Submission is limited to one single-authored and one co-authored abstract per
person. The body of your e-mail should include title of contribution, name,
affilition, and contact address. It should be indicated there whether the
abstract is contributed to the main or special session.

The conference website will later be available at
http://zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/bfe07.
