Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition

              PsychoCompLA-2007=20

August 1st at CogSci 2007 - Nashville, Tennessee=20

Submission Deadline: May 22, 2007=20

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:=20

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-
motivated computational models of language acquisition. That=20
is, models that are compatible with research in=20
psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics.=20

Invited Speakers:

* Elissa Newport, University of Rochester=20
* Shimon Edelman, Cornell University=20
* Damir Cavar, University of Zadar, University of Indiana=20
* Robert Frank, Johns Hopkins University=20
* Terry Regier, University of Chicago=20
* Alex Clark, Royal Holloway University of London=20
* Charles Yang, University of Pennsylvania=20

Workshop Description:

This workshop will present research and foster discussion=20
centered around psychologically-motivated computational models=20
of language acquisition, with an emphasis on the acquisition=20
of syntax. In recent decades there has been a thriving research=20
agenda that applies computational learning techniques to=20
emerging natural language technologies and many meetings,=20
conferences and workshops in which to present such=20
research. However, there have been only a few (but growing=20
number of) venues in which psychocomputational models of how=20
humans acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus.=20
By psychocomputational models we mean models that are=20
compatible with, or might inform research in psycholinguistics,=20
developmental psychology or linguistics.=20

Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of=20
particular interest in light of recent results in developmental=20
psychology that suggest that very young infants are adept at=20
detecting statistical patterns in an audible input stream.=20
Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical=20
'machinery' to the task of grammar acquisition, with or without=20
an innate language component, remains an open and important=20
question. One effective line of investigation is to=20
computationally model the acquisition process and determine=20
interrelationships between a model and linguistic or=20
psycholinguistic theory, and/or correlations between a model's=20
performance and data from linguistic environments that children=20
are exposed to.=20

Although there has been a significant amount of presented=20
research targeted at modeling the acquisition of word=20
categories, morphology and phonology, research aimed at=20
modeling syntax acquisition has just begun to emerge.=20

Workshop History: =20

This is the third meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of=20
Human Language Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-
2004, held in Geneva, Switzerland as part of the 20th=20
International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING=20
2004) and PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual Meeting=20
of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005)=20
held in Ann Arbor, Michigan where the workshop shared a joint=20
session with the Ninth Conference on Computational Natural=20
Language Learning (CoNLL-2005).=20

Workshop Organizer:=20
William Gregory Sakas, City University of New York=20
(sakas at hunter.cuny.edu) =20

Workshop Co-organizer:=20
David Guy Brizan, City University of New York
(dbrizan at gc.cuny.edu)=20

Submission details:

Authors are invited to submit abstracts of 1 page plus 1 page=20
for data and other supplementary materials. Abstracts should be=20
anonymous, clearly titled and no more than 500 words in length.=20
Text of the abstract should fit on one page, with a second page=20
for examples, table, figures, references, etc. The following=20
formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Please include a=20
cover sheet (as a separate attachment) containing the title of=20
your submission, your name, contact details and affiliation.=20
Please send your submission electronically to=20
Psycho.Comp@hunter.cuny.edu. The accepted abstracts will appear=20
in the online workshop proceedings. Full papers will be=20
considered for a submission for a special issue of a Cognitive=20
Science Society Journal in the fall.=20

Submission deadline: May 22, 2007=20

Topics and Goals:

Abstracts that present research on (but not necessarily limited=20
to) the following topics are welcome:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that=20
incorporate psychologically plausible constraints;=20
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported=20
studies;=20
* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
* Models that address learning bias in terms of innate=20
linguistic knowledge versus statistical regularity in the=20
input;
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus=20
linguistics;
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
* Models of language change and its effect on language=20
acquisition or vice versa;
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing=20
linguistic or developmental theories (e.g., principles &=20
parameters, optimality theory, construction grammar, etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such=20
as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from=20
cognitive psychology, computational linguistics, other=20
computer/mathematical sciences, linguistics and=20
psycholinguistics working on all areas of language acquisition.=20
Diversity and cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal.=20
