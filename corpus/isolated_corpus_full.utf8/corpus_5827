Meeting Description:

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, knowledge
bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the development of language processing
applications that are increasingly important to the global society. Substantial
effort has been devoted to the creation of such resources for the world's major
languages over the past decades, and new projects are developing similar
resources for less widely-used languages. Some standards and best practices have
emerged for representing and linking language corpora and annotations. Efforts
such as the "Global WordNet" and the development of framenets in multiple
languages seek to create and link specific lexical and semantic resources across
languages, and there are efforts to integrate such resources into
general-purpose ontologies such as SUMO.

As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is increasingly
important to develop resources in the world's languages that can be compared and
linked, used and analyzed with common software, and that contain linguistic
information for the same or comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual
development of a "global web" of language resources, wherein, for example,
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are inter-linked via the
use of common categories, or categories that are mapped to one another;
resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked not only to versions in
different languages, but also to each other; and common representations enable
analysis and use of resources in different languages and of different types
within available systems. Interoperability also fosters universal access to
language resources, enabling researchers who have fewer resources for performing
costly and time-consuming transductions to have the same capabilities as others.

The Second International Conference on Global Interoperability for Language
Resources will bring together designers, developers, and users of language
resources, tools, frameworks, and infrastructures from across the globe, in
order to:

-Assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for resource representation,
annotation, processing, interlinkage, and access;
-Consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be used to enable
resource accessibility, interoperability and inter-linkage;
-Consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) full interoperability,
especially with regard to multi-lingual and multi-modal data;
-Consider the requirements for achieving interoperability among multi-lingual
resources of different types, including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases,
ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks that enable their
creation and exploitation;
-Work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and standards language
resource representation, annotation, and use that will enable interoperability;
-Consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in order to better
enable cross-lingual studies;
-Provide direction for developers of resources for less widely used languages;
-Promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of language resources
and tools across the globe;
-Consider ways to provide central or distributed access to language resources
developed throughout the world.

This year's conference will include a special focus on the use of web-based
technologies for interoperability and open access to language resources. 

Call for Papers:

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following topics:

-Web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-linkage, and access;
-Multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus on the
mechanisms enabling interoperability;
-Support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in systems/frameworks for
resource creation, annotation,  use, and access;
-Existing and proposed standards for language resources, including standards for
linguistic annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
-Systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the development and use of
interoperable language resources;
-Evaluation of existing resources, systems and frameworks, and/or standards in
terms of support for interoperability;
-Harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language resources, including
corpora, wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;
-Ontologies for language resources, especially for support of  multi-linguality,
multi-culturality, and multi-modality. 

Submissions:
 
Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in length, including bibliography and
any appendices. Author instructions will be posted on the conference web site.
