STUDIES IN THE SOCIOLOGY OF NIGERIAN ENGLISH

Many of the existing studies on Nigerian English (NE)have examined the
variation of many aspects of the English from Standard English (SE)and have
variously considered the degree of the acclimatisation of SE to the
Nigerian environment. However, we still believe that there are many gaps to
fill in the description of NE. First,none of these studies has exclusively
concentrated on the sociology of Nigerian English in terms of exploring its
development and the domain-specific functions that NE performs in the
country. Secondly,the majority of these studies focus on the written
corporal (except those that pertain to phonology) with the result that
systematic descriptions of the spontaneous usage of NE are being
backgrounded.More importantly, the intertwine of Nigerian English in both
the written and oral corporal needs more attention given the fact that in
the speech of many educated Nigerians, especially in informal settings, the
use of these two codes often manifests. Filling these gaps will not only
reveal specific forms and functions of Nigerian English but will also show
the various registerial forms that have emerged from the constant use of
Nigerian English in all facets of the Nigerian society. This will obvoiusly
facilitate the process of standardising (and lexicographing)Nigerian English.

Studies in the Sociology of Nigerian English, which hopes to address the
problem, will cover aspects of language studies such as phonology,
lexico-semantics, discourse analysis, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, applied
linguistics, stylistics and textlinguistics. Papers which which will apply
insights from these areas to the following (and other related topics)are
invited from scholars:

1. Standard English and second language dialects
2. Hisorical accounts of the development of English in  Nigeria.
3. Standard English and Nigerian Pidgin English
4. Varieties of Nigerian English
5. Domains of Nigerian English Usage:

- Nigerian English in the media
- Nigerian English in Law
- Nigerian English in Education
- Nigerian English in the Academia
- Nigerian English in Religion
- Nigerian English in Telecommunication
- Nigerian English in Computer-mdiated Communication
- Nigerian English in Science and Technology
- Nigerian English in Service Encounters
- Nigerin English in Politics
- Nigerian English in Advertising
- Nigerian English in Trade Learning
- Nigerian English in Medical Practice
- Nigerian English in Literature

`   Papers, which should follow the APA format, and which should not exceed
30 pages, should be sent electronically to the editors at the addresses below:

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
