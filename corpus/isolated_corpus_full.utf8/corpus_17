**** Second Announcement and call for proposals:  DRH 2005 ****
****Submission deadline extended! New Deadline: 31st March, 2005****


DRH 2005: Digital Resources for the Humanities
University of Lancaster, UK
4th - 8th September 2005

 IMPORTANT DATES:

* 31st March, 2005: Deadline for submission of abstracts
* April, 2005:  Notification of acceptance of papers, sessions, posters =
and workshops
* April 2005: Registration opens
* May 2005: Provisional programme announced.

Conference Web Site: http://www.drh.org.uk
Proposals can be submitted via the electronic submission form at the =
conference website.

The DRH conferences have established themselves firmly in the UK and =
international calendar as a major forum bringing together scholars, =
postgraduate students, librarians, archivists, curators, information =
scientists and computing professionals in a unique and positive way, to =
share ideas and information about the creation, exploitation, use, =
management and preservation of digital resources in the arts and =
humanities.

At this, the tenth DRH conference, we plan to encourage papers and =
sessions that focus on critical evaluation of the use of digital =
resources in the arts and humanities.  What has the impact really been?  =
What kinds of methodologies are being used?  What are the assumptions =
that underlie our work?  How do we know that the work that we accomplish =
is truly new and innovative? How does technology change the way that we =
work?

The Conference will also address some of the key emerging themes and =
strategic issues that engagement with ICT is bringing to scholarly =
research in the arts and humanities, with a particular focus on advanced =
research methods.  The kinds of questions that we would like to see =
addressed might include the following: what sort of research does ICT in =
the arts and humanities enable researchers to do that could not be done =
before at all? Does this enable 'old' research to be done in a =
significantly new way? In what ways does the technology serve the =
scholarship?  Similarly, what are the key aspects of virtual research =
environments ("cyberinfrasture") which can facilitate collaborative =
research?

Proposals for individual papers, sessions, workshops and posters are =
invited, and the abstract submission system at the conference website =
will be accepting proposals from January 31st, 2005.


Types of presentation for which proposals are invited:

Papers

Proposals for papers should be no less than 750 words. Papers will be =
allocated 30 minutes for presentation, including questions.

Sessions

Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:

Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement =
describing the proposed session topic, and include abstracts of no less =
than 750 words for each paper. The session organizer must also indicate =
that each author is willing to participate in the session;

or

A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an =
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be =
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each =
speaker is willing to participate in the session.

Poster Presentations

Poster presentations may include computer technology and project =
demonstrations. Posters presentations may be a more suitable way of =
presenting late-breaking results, or significant work in progress. There =
should be no difference in quality between poster presentations and =
papers, and both will be submitted to the same refereeing process.

As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters to the =
conference, the Programme Committee will once again award a prize for =
the best poster presentation.


The Local Organising Committee is headed by Tony McEnery and Andrew =
Hardie, Department of Linguistics and English Language, University of =
Lancaster.
Please contact the local organizers with any questions about =
registration or conference arrangements at Lancaster: =
drhconf@lancaster.ac.uk

The chair of the Programme Committee is Lorna Hughes, Assistant Director =
for Humanities Computing, New York University.
Please contact the Programme Chair with any questions about submitting =
abstracts, or about the reviewing process: (Lorna.Hughes@nyu.edu).

the
