Subject: Workshop on Features 
 

Full Title: Workshop on Features 
Short Title: FEATURES 

Date: 01-Sep-2007 - 02-Sep-2007
Location: London, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Anna Kibort
Meeting Email: a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description

The Workshop on Features (1-2 September 2007) will be associated with 
the LAGB 2007 conference at King's College London. It will bring together
linguists who have grappled with features as a component of theoretical models
together with others who have considered their range and variability in the
world's languages. 

Workshop on Features

2nd Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 09-Apr-2007

Workshop on Features, 1-2 September 2007
King's College London
in association with the 2007 LAGB meeting

Deadline for abstracts: 9th April 2007

In attempting to understand language, a central notion is features. Examples are
person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, plural, dual...) tense (present,
past...), and inflectional class (I, II, III, IV...). Features have proven
invaluable for analysis and description, and have a major role in contemporary
linguistics, right across the range of the discipline. Yet little is firmly
established about features: we have no readily available inventory of which
features are found in the world's languages, no generally agreed account of how
they operate across different components of language and no certainty on how
they interact. Features are widely used, but are little discussed. The
conference will therefore bring together linguists who have grappled with
features as a component of theoretical models together with others who have
considered their range and variability in the world's languages.

There will be six guest speakers who have agreed to talk on the following topics:
- David Adger 'Features and functional categories'
- Peter Austin 'Features and clause linkage'
- Ann Copestake 'Features and computational semantics'
- Ron Kaplan 'Formal aspects of underspecified features'
- Maria Polinsky 'Featural asymmetries in long-distance agreement: why
gender is different from person'
- Ivan Sag 'Feature geometry and predictions of locality'

Abstract format

Abstracts of talks (25 minutes plus 15 minutes discussion) on topics relating to
features must be presented as follows: the complete abstract (with the title of
paper, name of author and e-mail address, and author's affiliation) must be no
longer than one A4 page with margins of at least 2.5cm on all sides. Only the
first page of any abstract submitted will be considered - no appendices or pages
for references can be accepted. You may use single spacing but type must be no
smaller than 12 points. If the paper is accepted, the abstract will be
photocopied and inserted directly into the collection of abstracts given to
participants, so the presentation should be clear and clean.

Abstract submission

Abstracts should be submitted by e-mail to Anna Kibort (a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk).
You will need to send an e-mail with two attachments: one of the attached files
should be an anonymous copy of the abstract (and should be named
yoursurname-anon.pdf, or yoursurname-anon.doc, etc.), and the other should have
your name and affiliation, i.e. be camera-ready (and should be named
yoursurname-name.pdf, etc.). The attached files should be in one of the
following formats: pdf (preferred), or Word, or plain text. Any special
characters should either be embedded in a pdf file, or be in the Doulos SIL
font, which can be downloaded for free from this site:

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=DoulosSIL_download

If several authors are named in the abstract, you should specify one name
and e-mail address for correspondence in the body of the e-mail that you
send the attachments with. In the body of the e-mail you should also specify
any special requirements regarding audiovisual equipment. While we will make
every effort to provide such equipment, we cannot guarantee that it will be
available.

All abstracts must arrive by or on 9th April 2007.

The programme organisers of the Workshop are Greville Corbett and Anna
Kibort, Surrey Morphology Group (www.surrey.ac.uk/LIS/SMG/). The Workshop is
supported by the ESRC, within a project on Grammatical Features (grant number
RES-051-27-0122). The local organisers of the LAGB meeting at King's College
London, Devyani Sharma and Eleni Gregoromichelaki, have kindly agreed to take on
the local arrangements.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
