Call for Papers
9th workshop on
Runtime Verification
RV 2009
Grenoble, France
http://www-rv2009.imag.fr 

Aims and Scope 

The objective of RV'09 is to bring scientists from both academia and industry together to debate on how to monitor and analyze the execution of programs, for example by checking conformance with a formal specification. The purpose might be testing a piece of software before deployment, detecting errors after deployment in the field and potentially triggering subsequent fault protection actions, or the purpose can be to augment the software with new capabilities in an aspect oriented style. The longer term goal is to investigate whether the use of lightweight formal methods applied during the execution of programs is a viable complement to the current heavyweight methods proving programs correct always before their execution, such as model checking and theorem proving. This year RV 2009 is affiliated to   CAV 2009 and is lasting 3 days with one day for tutorials.
Topics of Interests

The subject covers several technical fields as outlined below: 
* Specification Languages and Logics. Formal methods scientists have investigated logics and developed technologies that are suitable for model checking and theorem proving, but monitoring can reveal new observation-based foundational logics and problems.
* Aspect-oriented Languages with Trace Predicates. New results in extending aspect languages, such as for example AspectJ, with trace predicates replacing the standard pointcuts. Aspect oriented programming provides specific solutions to program instrumentation and program guidance. 
* Program Instrumentation in General. Any techniques for instrumenting programs, at the source code or object code/byte code level, to emit relevant events to an observer. 
* Program Guidance in General. Techniques for guiding the behavior of a program once its specification is violated. This includes topics such as fault-protection, self-healing, and diagnosis.
* Combining Static and Dynamic Analysis. Monitoring a program with respect to a specification can have an impact on the monitored program, with respect to execution time as well as memory consumption. Static analysis can be used to minimize the impact by optimizing the program instrumentation. Runtime monitors can be seen as proof obligations left over from proofs - what is left that could not be proved.
* Dynamic Program Analysis. Techniques that gather information during program execution and use it to conclude properties about the program. Algorithms for detecting multi-threading errors, such as deadlocks and data races. Algorithms for generating specifications from runs -- dynamic reverse engineering, this can include program visualization. 

Paper Submission

There are two categories of submissions:
1. Regular Papers: Submissions, not exceeding fifteen (15) pages using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research, and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are strongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses and strength in sufficient depth. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. 
2. Tool Presentations: Submissions, not exceeding six (6) pages using Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented tool and its novel features. A demonstration is expected at the workshop to accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented. 
Papers exceeding the stated maximum length run the risk of rejection without review. The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submission is done with EasyChair. 
Informations about the submission procedure are available at:       http://www-rv2009.imag.fr
