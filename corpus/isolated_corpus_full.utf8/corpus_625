Subject: CFP Volume on Linguistic Annotation 
 


The proceedings of the Workshop on Annotation at the ICAME-27
Conference, Helsinki, May 2006 will be published as the first volume of a
new series of e-publications. The Research Unit for Variation, Contacts and
Change in English (VARIENG), a Finnish centre of excellence for 2006-2011
funded by the Academy of Finland and the Universities of Helsinki and
Jyväskylä, has decided to launch a series of online open-access volumes on
topics related to its research goals. The fields in which the VARIENG unit
is active include corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics,
discourse analysis, contact linguistics, cognitive semantics and typology.
The series is intended to be a prestigious high-end publication aimed
primarily for an audience of professional linguists and philologists and
serve as a forum for contributions illustrating an innovative and
cross-disciplinary approach to theory and methodology. We are also keen to
promote the possibilities for multimedia presentation afforded by
electronic publication. All submissions will be refereed on both their
linguistic and multimedia merits.
 
We would like to offer this publication forum for 4-6 new contributions on
topics related to lexico-grammatical and semantic-pragmatic tagging. For
more details on the publication, please see
