Meeting Description:

The First International Conference in LSP- and Translation Studies-oriented
Textual Analysis at Chouaib Doukkali University, Morocco, 27-29 May 2008. 

Organised by:

-	The Cross-cultural Communication and Translation Studies Research    Group,
English Department, Chouaib Doukkali University  
-	University College London
-	University of Manchester
-	Kent State University
27-29 May 2008
 
at the Conference Room in the Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences,
 Chouaib Doukkali University, Eljadida-Morocco 

Call For Papers

This initiative comes as a result of our research and teaching concerns relative
to the recently accredited Master program in Cross-cultural Communication and
Translation Studies in the English Department at CDU.  Only one year old and
given its interdisciplinary character, the program poses a number of challenging
methodological research and teaching questions for the faculty.

This conference aims therefore to gather scholars in Translation Studies and
Language for Specific Purposes, TRSS alumni, and postgraduate students from
around the world in the fields of cross-cultural communication and Translation
Studies to present their research and exchange ideas on current issues in this
rapidly developing field. The goal is to create a synergy among established and
novice researchers by discussing the participants' current research, opening up
new research horizons, and possibly setting up cross-cultural/linguistic
collaborative research agendas. 

It is well established in the fields of Translation Studies, Contrastive
Rhetoric and language teaching that it is fairly easy to pin down and explain
purely linguistic (e.g. syntactic and lexical) variations across languages, but
that it is not so easy to identify and investigate differences of a more textual
or rhetorical nature.  The goal of this conference is to capture cross-cultural
textual variations underlying the highly conventionalized discourse of language
in use with a particular focus on the concepts of GENRE and REGISTER. The
rational behind this methodological delimitation is to highlight the
significance of variables such as the communicative purpose of an act of
communication and the textual norms prevailing in a particular text type, in a
particular social activity, and for a particular audience. 

The theme may therefore be formulated as follows: 

-	Apart from grammar and lexis, what other semantic, (con)textual, stylistic,
(cross-)cultural, rhetorical, ideological, and multimedia features of a Source
Text come into play in the processing and (re)construction of those texts by
translators and/or language learners?
-	What theoretical and methodological tools are used to analyse texts from the
different angles?
-	How may the various insights gained from the different perspectives to text
analysis contribute to raising greater awareness of these various influences and
therefore allowing a broader margin of creativity in the fields of translation
practice and/or LSP pedagogy?

Papers and Poster presentations:

Participants are invited to focus on any genre category of any register type
(literary, political, religious, journalistic, commercial/promotional,
scientific, etc.) as related, but not restricted, to the following approaches:
-	Anthropology, 
-	(contrastive) rhetoric, 
-	corpus linguistics,
-	(critical) (meta) discourse analysis, 
-	gender studies, 
-	postcolonial theory,
-	poststructuralism,
-	pragmatics, 
-	semantics,
-	semiotics, 
-	social theory, 
-	stylistics, etc.
