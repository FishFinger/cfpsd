Meeting Description

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on a broad range of
problems related to the automatic management of multilingual lexical resources -
their acquisition, maintenance, customization, and re-use. The scope of the
workshop includes evaluation of multilingual lexicons intended for a wide
variety of applications: from personalized glossaries for a translation project
to large-scale machine-readable dictionaries and databases. Specifics topics of
interest to the workshop include: acquisition of bilingual lexical knowledge
from parallel and comparable corpora, and from the Web; acquisition of domain
terminology, multiword expressions, multilingual lexical taxonomies, named
entity transliteration. 

RANLP-07 Workshop on Acquisition and Management of Multilingual Lexicons
Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (ACL-SIGLEX) 

Borovetz, Bulgaria
September 30, 2007

Aims 

The current trend of information exchange on the Internet to become ever more
multilingual has stimulated new important developments in the field of
multilingual NLP. The present workshop is concerned with the problem of
automatic management of lexical resources, which lie at the heart of many
multilingual technologies. 

Recently there has been an increased interest in the automated discovery of
equivalent expressions in different languages. New interesting directions have
sprung up, such as the use of the Web and comparable corpora for this task, and
new kinds of lexical phenomena, such as multiword expressions and named
entities, have come into focus. 

This workshop will bring together researchers working on a broad range of
problems related to the management of multilingual lexical resources - their
acquisition, maintenance, customization, and re-use. The scope of the workshop
includes evaluation of multilingual lexicons intended for a broad range of
applications: from personalized glossaries for a translation project to
large-scale machine-readable dictionaries and databases. 

Topics

Specific topics of interest for the proposed workshop are: 

- Acquisition of lexical knowledge from parallel and comparable corpora, and
from the Web 
- Porting, merging and domain customisation of existing lexical resources using
NLP technologies 
- Acquisition of domain terminology 
- Acquisition of multi-word expressions 
- Acquisition of translations for polysemous words 
- Acquisition of multilingual lexical taxonomies 
- Named Entity transliteration 
- Acquisition of cognates and loanwords 
- Extraction of equivalent phrases and sentences from comparable corpora 
- Applications of multilingual lexicons and their evaluation within: 
      - Statistical Machine Translation 
      - Computer-Aided Translation 
      - Information Retrieval (Question Answering, Text Retrieval, Text
Classification and Clustering) 
      - Knowledge Management 

Submission Instructions 

- Format. Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished
work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should be submitted as a PDF
file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 style files and not exceeding 8
pages. The RANLP 2007 style files are available at:

Program Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed comments, and to
score submitted papers on the following factors: 
      - Relevance to the workshop 
      - Significance and originality 
      - Technical/methodological accuracy 
      - References to related work 
      - Presentation (clarity, organisation, English) 

- Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in

Meeting Description:

Second International Conference: Translating Voices, Translating Regions, 14-15
September 2007, Durham UK 

Dear Members,

We would like to remind those interested in giving a paper at the II
International Conference: 'Translating Voices, Translating Regions that the
deadline for submitting proposals is 20 March 2007. 

Call for papers 

The Department of Italian of the University of Durham, UK, with the support of
the Italian Institute of Culture in London and of the Association for
Contemporary Iberian Studies 

promotes the 

Second International Conference Translating Voices, Translating Regions

Theory and Practice in Translation and Audiovisual Translation of Regionalized
Voices
14-15 September 2007, Durham, UK 

 
http://www.dur.ac.uk/mlac/translatingvoices 
           
Keynote speakers:

Delia Chiaro 
SSLMIT, University of Bologna at Forlì (Italy)

Jorge Diaz-Cintas
University of Roehampton (UK) 

Yves Gambier
University of Turku (Finland) 

Arturo Tosi
Royal Holloway, University of London (UK) 

In the first international conference Translating Voices, Translating Regions,
the debate enriched the understanding of many perspectives on translation of
regionalized languages, whilst emphasizing that there is much more to research.
New areas of research call for widening the scope of the debate, so as to
incorporate areas such as the impact of the SL into the norms and syntax of the
TL and the cultural impact of dominating languages on the languages of
minorities or regional languages. 

Following the success of the first event, the Second International Conference
aims to respond to the many intellectual challenges and issues. Questions
concerning a code of practice and a closer collaboration between theorists and
practitioners have become more pressing than ever. There are still substantial
fields of research and theoretical reflections that can fruitfully and
systematically contribute to the study of translation, not least in the
rendering of regional voices. 

This conference aims to explore the question of practices and theories in the
translation of marginal voices, not only in traditional literature and in
audiovisual translations, but also within sociolinguistic perspectives. The
organisers welcome proposals that explore the major themes of the conference,
and papers are invited on any of the following aspects of translation: 

1) Audiovisual Translation Strategies:

- Accessibility: subtitling, dubbing, voice over, and descriptive translation

- Availability: subtitling, dubbing or hybrid forms?

- Ideological choices of strategies: censorship and political choices

2) Translating into and from regionalized languages or languages of minorities 

- Ideological choices

- Sociological impact

- Policies of language equality

3) Dubbing and rendering a dialect 

4) Regionalised voices in translation 

Papers will be accepted in any of the official languages of the conference:
English, Italian, Spanish, and French. The limit of languages is due to the
centrality of dubbing (mostly from US English) in the French, Spanish, and
Italian traditions, as well as for practical editorial reasons. Clearly,
theoretical approaches fitting into the framework described above will be
welcome from scholars and professionals researching other languages, as long as
papers are offered in one of the four languages of the conference. 

Abstracts must reach the convenor by 20 March 2007.

Abstracts, of not more than 300 words, should be sent via email, in .doc, .rtf,
.pdf format only, to the convenor Dr Federico Federici,
f.m.federici@durham.ac.uk. Abstracts in non-electronic format can be posted to:
Federico Federici, Department of Italian, University of Durham, Room A55, Elvet
Riverside, New Elvet, Durham DH1 3JT, United Kingdom. Information on
professional/academic affiliation and the language in which the paper will be
delivered must be provided with the abstract. 

It is expected to publish a refereed volume including a selection of topics
discussed in the papers delivered at the conference. The deadline for providing
the first draft of papers accepted at the conference and to be considered for
publication will be 31 July 2007. 

Exact costs and details of how to register and book accommodation will be
circulated in April 2007. It is expected that payment of registration fees will
be accepted by cheque and credit card in pounds or euros. 

For further information please contact the convenor f.m.federici@durham.ac.uk
