Call for Papers

"Quotative Markers: Origins and Use"

Convenors:
Dmitry Idiatov (University of Antwerp)
Hubert Cuyckens (University of Leuven)

Keynote Speaker:
Tom Güldemann (University of Zu?rich / Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology, Leipzig)

Quotative markers are linguistic signs conventionally signaling the presence of
an adjacent representation of reported discourse, i.e. the quote. Semantically,
they are largely similar to generic speech verbs, such as say and tell in
English, with which they share the feature of reference to an utterance.
Functionally, however, they differ from the latter in being conventionalized in
relation to reported discourse. That is, either they are not used in other
contexts at all or they lack (fully or partially) the feature of reference to an
utterance when no representation of reported discourse is adjacent. Consider,
for instance, _be like_ in English in _And he's like: "That's great!"_.
Following Güldemann (2008), the quote frame based on a quotative marker or/and a
speech verb is called a quotative index. Güldemann (2008) also provides a
detailed classification of quotative markers. Thus, syntactically, quotative
markers can be either predicative or nonpredicative elements.
Morphosyntactically, predicative quotative markers may behave as regular verbs
and are then classified as quotative verbs. Those predicative quotative markers
that do not fully qualify for the status of verb in a given language are
referred to as quotative predicators. Nonpredicative quotative markers are often
referred to as quotative complementizers, especially when they are also used for
purposes of clause combining.

Historically, quotative markers may derive from a large number of sources, such
as generic speech verbs, generic verbs of equation, inchoativity, action, and
motion, markers of similarity and manner, markers of focus, presentation and
identification. Somewhat surprisingly, according to Güldemann (2008:295), at
least in African languages, generic speech verbs appear to be "far less
important" as sources of quotative markers than is usually assumed in the
literature. At the same time, it is remarkable that quotative markers of various
nonpredicative origins often tend to gradually acquire verbal features up to
becoming full-fledged verbal lexemes through their conventionalized use as core
elements of quotative indexes. In many African languages, quotative markers are
also regularly employed for purposes of clause combining and extended to
constructions expressing intention and various kinds of modal meanings.

The proposed workshop is intended to bring together scholars interested in the
origins and use of quotative markers in individual languages, language families
or linguistic areas from any part of the world. Particularly welcome are papers
based on data from spontaneous and spoken language use and data from less
documented languages. Authors are also encouraged to situate their findings in a
broader cross-linguistic perspective, both as regards the known sources of
quotative markers as well as their typical secondary extensions to contexts not
involving instances of reported discourse in the strict sense.
