=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D




PROPOR2010
The 8th International Conference
on the Computational Processing of Portuguese

Porto Alegre, Brazil
hosted by PUCRS-Pontif=EDcia Universidade Cat=F3lica do Rio Grande do Sul
April 28-30, 2010



The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese
(PROPOR) is the main event in the area of Natural Language Processing
that is focused on Portuguese and the issues related to this language.
It has been hosted in Brazil and in Portugal: Lisbon/PT (1993),
Curitiba/BR (1996), Porto Alegre/BR (1998), =C9vora/PT (1999),
Atibaia/BR (2000), Faro/PT (2003), Itatiaia/BR (2006) and
Aveiro/PT (2008).


Topics of interest:

Any topic of language and speech processing of Portuguese, including
any applied task (e.g. word sense disambiguation, dialect
identification, etc.), basic issue (e.g. parsing, evaluation, etc.),
subdomain (e.g. phonology, dialogue, etc.), application (e.g. speech
recognition, question answering, etc.), type of resource (e.g.
corpora, ontologies, etc.), linguistic phenomenon (e.g. prosody,
anaphora, etc.), or in any area benefiting from language and speech
processing of Portuguese (e.g. information retrieval, subtitling,
e-learning, research in the humanities, etc.), under any
methodological perspective (e.g. machine learning, symbolic, etc.),
from the industry or from any contributing academic discipline,
including but not limited to Computation, AI, Engineering, Linguistics
or Cognitive Science.


Important dates:

September 21, 2009 Deadline for full paper submission
October   31, 2009 Notification of acceptance
November  16, 2009 Camera-ready papers due


Submission:

Authors are invited to submit two kinds of papers:

- full papers: reporting substantial, original and completed work,
especially those that may contribute in a significant way to the
advancement of the area - wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation
results should be included.

- short papers: preference will be given to reports on ongoing work,
position papers and potential ideas to be discussed.

Authors will be able to express their preference for full/short papers
but the final decision is on the program chairs. Short papers may be
selected for oral or poster presentation and should be up to 4 pages
in length. Full papers will be presented in an oral session and should
be up to 10 pages in length.

For the sake of accommodating the widest range of contributors, full
paper acceptance is restricted to two papers per author.

Submissions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers. In order to
ensure blind review, the author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not
appear in the body of the submission and self-reference should be in
the third person. Submissions are written in English.

As in previous PROPOR editions, publication of full papers in an LNAI
volume is planned. Selected short papers will be taken under
consideration for LNAI publication.
