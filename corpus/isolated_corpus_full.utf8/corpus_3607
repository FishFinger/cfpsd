Call for Papers

EACL 2009 Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language 
30 or 31 March 2009
Athens, Greece
http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cognitive/

Workshop Description
This workshop is focused on the relevance of computational learning methods for
research on human language acquisition. Developing and applying such
computational techniques that can improve our understanding of human language
acquisition will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general, but will also
reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop useful language
models.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP,
machine learning, artificial intelligence, (psycho)linguistics, etc. who are
interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding human
language learning. 
The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational and
cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help initiate
interdisciplinary research projects. Success in this type of research requires
close collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. To this end,
interdisciplinary workshops can play a key role in advancing existing and
initiating new research. This was demonstrated by some successful events like
the previous edition of this workshop held at ACL 2007. 

Areas of interest
Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning
- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language
acquisition
- Computational models of various aspects of language acquisition, and their
interaction with each other
- Computational models of the evolution of language
- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human
language acquisition
- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its
impact on the acquisition task
- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to
e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their
relevance to research on human language acquisition
- investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-
supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic,
biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from the
cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information
Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of completion
of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with previously published
work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the EACL 2009 main-
conference proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including
references. We strongly recommend the use of either the LaTeX style file or the
Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be found at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than December 19, 2008 using the
submission webpage that will be available soon.

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. Authors of
accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce camera-ready
versions of their papers for inclusion in the EACL workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.

Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: 19 December 2008
Acceptance notification sent: 30 January 2009
Final version deadline: 13 February 2009
Workshop date: 30 or 31 March 2009
