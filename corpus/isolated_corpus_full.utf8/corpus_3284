Now that the conference season is almost over, you may want to  =

consider submitting an extended version of your conference paper to  =

Research on Language and Computation. RoLaC is a Springer journal that  =

publishes high quality, leading edge research papers in computational  =

linguistics and natural language processing. It features works that  =

deal with theoretical dimensions of research on formal, empirical, and  =

application questions. RoLaC welcomes contributions on syntax,  =

semantics, morphology, phonology, dialogue and discourse, theories of  =

grammar, machine learning and computational learning theory applied to  =

natural language, mathematical and complexity properties of natural  =

language systems, and the implementation of procedures for natural  =

language analysis, generation, and translation.

To see current and past issues, go to:
http://www.springerlink.com/content/1570-7075

We use an on-line submission and reviewing system, available here:
http://www.editorialmanager.com/rolc/
This helps us reduce turnaround times; in the last 18 months, the  =

average time from submission to first decision was 61 days.

We look forward to receiving your submissions!

Shuly Wintner, RoLaC editor-in-chief
