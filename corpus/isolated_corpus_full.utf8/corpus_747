Meeting Description:

Language and Literature: Cross Cultural Currents 

Conference Theme: Language and Literature: Cross Cultural Currents 

The conference has two major objectives. First, to identify the role of the English language and literature in the production and dissemination of African culture. Second, to focus attention on and mobilize research in this critical interface between the English language and literature on one hand and culture, development, democracy, globalization, and peace on the other. The conference presents a forum that will bring together language and literature scholars, historians, politicians, peace makers, journalists, policy makers, culture promoters, and social scientists to elucidate the dynamics and inter links between the English language and literature and socio-cultural issues. It is hoped that these diverse backgrounds will generate exciting and lively discussions as participants from different disciplines explore the linguistic, literary, cultural and social aspects of English in Africa.

Sub-Themes:  Abstracts are invited on the following sub-themes:

	-The faces of English in Africa: linguistic, literary and historic;
	-The faces of English in Africa: political and social;
	-English and democracy in Africa;
	-The role of English in peace and conflict resolution in Africa;
	-The rise of English, the death of Africa;
	-English as a literary tool in Africa;
	-Globalization, the English language and literature.

Date for Submission of Abstracts:

Abstracts of not more than 300 words should be submitted not later than February 15, 2007. These should be emailed as Word documents to bagwasimm@mopipi.ub.bw. We will endeavour to review and send out notices of acceptance within two weeks of receiving the abstract.

Registration Details:

Registration and other conference details will be emailed to prospective delegates by the end of February 2007.

Call for Papers - 30th Child Language Seminar

We are pleased to announce that in 2007 the Child Language Seminar will take place from 18-20 July 2007 at the University of Reading. It will be hosted by the School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences and is being organised by Theo Marinis & Vesna Stojanovik (Department of Clinical Language Sciences), Carmel Houston-Price & Graham Schafer (Department of Psychology), and Brian Richards (Institute of Education).

This year's keynote speakers are:

Anne Baker & Jan de Jong

University of Oxford

Philip Dale
Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences
The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque

Catherine Snow

The CLS is an interdisciplinary conference attracting a diverse audience of among others psychologists, linguists and speech and language therapists, and provides a forum for research on first and second language acquisition in typically and atypically developing children. It was first held in 1977, so in 2007 it will be the 30th Anniversary of the CLS. 

The University of Reading is one of the top 20 most research-intensive universities in the UK, and has a long tradition of research in language development. The School of Psychology & Clinical Language Science was established in 2005 when the Clinical Linguistics section moved to the School of Psychology. The School is set on one of the most beautiful campuses in the UK, with 320 acres of landscaped grounds surrounded by green open spaces, lakes and wildlife. 

Reading is the county town of the Royal County of Berkshire and is located in the heart of the beautiful Thames Valley some 50 kilometers west of London. The city is easily accessible by air (30 minutes to Heathrow airport via frequent bus service to Reading station, and 75 minutes to Gatwick airport through a direct rail connection) and by rail (25 minutes from London Paddington). The M4 motorway provides ready access to London, Wales and the South West and there is an express coach service to London which also stops outside the main gate of the University. 

Proposals are invited for papers and posters on any topic related to child language development and disorders. 
 
Submission deadline is 1 March 2007.
