ACL-07 features a special session for posters and demonstrations.
Topics of interest cover all aspects of computational linguistics, as
outlined in the main conference call for papers. Posters and demos
will be held on June 25 till June 27, at the main conference venue.

Posters should describe original work in progress, and present
innovative methodologies used to solve a problem in computational
linguistics or NLP. Demos should be concerned with mature systems or
prototypes in which computational linguistics or NLP technologies are
used to solve practically important problems. Demo papers should
describe how the system is used to solve practical problems and
should include a discussion of the implementation and case studies of
how the system is applied.

The following five tutorials will be offered at ACL 2007 in Prague,
June 24, 2007:

Tutorial #1: Bayesian Nonparametric Structured Models
-----------------------------------------------------
Percy Liang, Dan Klein

Probabilistic modeling is a dominant approach for both supervised and
unsupervised learning tasks in NLP. One constant challenge for models
with latent variables is determining the appropriate model
complexity, i.e. the question of "how many clusters." While
cross-validation can be used to select between a limited number of
options, it cannot be feasibly applied in the context of larger
hierarchical models where we must balance complexity in many parts of
the model at the same time. Nonparametric "infinite" priors such as
Dirichlet processes are powerful tools from the Bayesian statistics
literature which address exactly this issue. Such priors, which have
seen increasing use in recent NLP work, allow the complexity of the
model to adapt to the data and admit more tractable and elegant
inference methods than traditional model selection approaches.

In explaining how to do inference in these new models, we try to
dispel two myths: first, that Bayesian methods are too slow and
cumbersome, and, second, that Bayesian techniques require a whole new
set of algorithmic ideas. We depart from the traditional sampling
methodology which has dominated past expositions and focus on
variational inference, an efficient technique which is a natural
extension of EM. This approach allows us to tackle structured models
such as HMMs and PCFGs with the benefits of Bayesian nonparametrics
while maintaining much of the existing EM machinery so familiar to
this community. In addition to our foundational presentation, we
discuss both concrete implementation issues and demonstrate the
empirical advantages of these methods.

Tutorial #2: Usability and Performance Evaluation
for Advanced Spoken Dialogue Systems
------------------------------------
Michael McTear, Kristiina Jokinen

This tutorial will focus on methods, problems and challenges in the
evaluation of advanced spoken dialogue systems. It is grounded in
research that combines various speech and language technology
components into an integrated system, and surveys the issues related
to the design, evaluation and comparison of such systems. A number of
different approaches to robust and efficient interaction management
will be reviewed, together with various performance and user
evaluation methods in academic and industrial environments. A closer
look will be taken at the different metrics and usability criteria,
as well as automatic design and evaluation methods. Practical
requirements for dialogue systems, such as robustness, scalability
and portability will also be discussed and exemplified from the point
of view of performance evaluation and usability. Special attention
will be paid to user evaluation, and to the user=E2?Ts expectations and
experience of the system.

The tutorial is targeted at researchers and system developers who
wish to learn more about theoretical and practical issues concerning
development and evaluation of spoken dialogue systems. The tutorial
will consist of two parts. The first part will survey techniques in
spoken dialogue management and motivate the need for evaluation
studies by discussing novel challenges and requirements for
interactive systems. Issues concerning conversational dialogue
modelling, such as knowledge representation, context, adaptation,
learning, error handling, multimodality, ubiquitous computing, as
well as practical requirements for commercial dialogue systems, such
as robustness, scalability and portability, will be discussed and
exemplified from the point of view of performance evaluation,
usability, and user evaluation. The second part of the tutorial will
focus on methodologies and practices of evaluation, and will deal
with basic concepts, methods and metrics for system performance
evaluation and usability. In particular, challenges for the
evaluation of advanced dialogue systems will be discussed.

Tutorial #3: Textual Entailment
-------------------------------
Ido Dagan, Dan Roth, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto

Recognizing Textual Entailment is the task of determining, for
example, that the sentence: "Google files for its long awaited IPO"
entails that "Google goes public". Determining whether the meaning of
a given text passage entails that of another or whether they have the
same meaning is a fundamental problem in natural language
understanding that requires the ability to abstract over the inherent
syntactic and semantic variability in natural language. This
challenge is at the heart of many natural language understanding
tasks including Question Answering, Information Retrieval and
Extraction, Machine Translation, and others that attempt to reason
about and capture the meaning of linguistic expressions. The task has
attracted significant interest over the last couple of years mainly
fostered by the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge
(RTE). A substantial number of papers on these topics have been
published in major conferences and workshops in the last couple of
years.

The primary goals of this tutorial are to review the framework of
applied Textual Entailment and motivate it as a generic paradigm for
natural language semantics. We will present some of the key
computational approaches proposed and some of the obstacles
identified by the research community in this area, as a way to
promote further research. The tutorial will thus be useful for many
of the senior and junior researchers that have prior or new interest
in this area, providing a concise overview of recent perspectives and
research results.

Tutorial #4: From Web Content Mining
to Natural Language Processing
------------------------------
Bing Liu

Web mining is a growing research area. It consists of Web usage
mining, Web structure mining, and Web content mining. Web usage
mining refers to the discovery of user access patterns from Web usage
logs. Web structure mining tries to discover useful knowledge from
hyperlinks. Web content mining aims to extract/mine useful
information or knowledge from Web page contents. This tutorial
focuses on Web content mining and its extensive connection with
natural language processing (NLP).

In the past few years, there was a rapid expansion of activities in
Web content mining. This is not surprising because of the huge amount
of valuable information of almost any imaginable type on the Web and
significant economic benefits of such mining. However, due to the
heterogeneity and the lack of structure of the Web data, automated
discovery of targeted or unexpected knowledge/information still
presents many challenging problems. This tutorial will introduce
several such problems and some state-of-the-art techniques for
dealing with them, e.g., data/information extraction, Web information
integration, opinion mining, and information synthesis. These
problems all have strong connections with NLP. In the tutorial, I
will pay special attention to such connections and discuss how NLP
researchers may contribute towards solving these problems. Many
real-life examples will also be given to help participants understand
research concepts and see how the technologies may be deployed to
real-life applications. The tutorial will thus have a mix of research
and industry flavor, addressing seminal research ideas and looking at
the technology from an industry angle.

Tutorial #5: Quality Control of Corpus
Annotation Through Reliability Measures
---------------------------------------
Ron Artstein

The need for quality control of corpus annotation should be obvious:
research based on annotated corpora can only be as good as the
annotations themselves. In recent years, corpus annotation has
expanded from marking basic morphological and syntactic structure to
many new kinds of linguistic phenomena. Each new annotation scheme
and every individual set of annotation guidelines need to be checked
for quality, because quality inferences do not carry over from one
scheme to another. A standard way of assessing the quality of an
annotation scheme and guidelines is to compare annotations of the
same text by two or more independent annotators. While researchers
are generally aware of this technique, it seems that the inner
workings of the statistics involved and how to interpret them are
understood by few. Mechanical application of agreement coefficients
found in software packages can lead to serious errors, and it is
therefore crucial for people who do research on annotation to become
intimately familiar with these statistics.

This tutorial is a thorough introduction to the statistics used for
measuring agreement between corpus annotators, and hence for
inferring the reliability of the annotation. The tutorial will focus
on the mathematics of the various agreement measures, and
consequently on the implicit assumptions they make about annotators
and annotation errors. A major part of the tutorial will be devoted
to agreement coefficients of the kappa family, which are the most
commonly used reliability measures in computational linguistics, but
the tutorial will also discuss alternative measures such as latent
class analysis. The tutorial will not assume advanced mathematical
knowledge beyond basic probability theory, and will thus be
accessible to most researchers in computational linguistics.

following five tutorials will be offered at ACL 2007 in Prague,<BR>June =
24,=20
2007:<BR><BR>Tutorial #1: Bayesian Nonparametric Structured=20
Models<BR>-----------------------------------------------------<BR>Percy =
Liang,=20
Dan Klein<BR><BR>Probabilistic modeling is a dominant approach for both=20
supervised and<BR>unsupervised learning tasks in NLP. One constant =
challenge for=20
models<BR>with latent variables is determining the appropriate=20
model<BR>complexity, i.e. the question of "how many clusters."=20
While<BR>cross-validation can be used to select between a limited number =

of<BR>options, it cannot be feasibly applied in the context of=20
larger<BR>hierarchical models where we must balance complexity in many =
parts=20
of<BR>the model at the same time. Nonparametric "infinite" priors such=20
as<BR>Dirichlet processes are powerful tools from the Bayesian=20
statistics<BR>literature which address exactly this issue. Such priors, =
which=20
have<BR>seen increasing use in recent NLP work, allow the complexity of=20
the<BR>model to adapt to the data and admit more tractable and=20
elegant<BR>inference methods than traditional model selection=20
approaches.<BR><BR>In explaining how to do inference in these new =
models, we try=20
to<BR>dispel two myths: first, that Bayesian methods are too slow=20
and<BR>cumbersome, and, second, that Bayesian techniques require a whole =

new<BR>set of algorithmic ideas. We depart from the traditional=20
sampling<BR>methodology which has dominated past expositions and focus=20
on<BR>variational inference, an efficient technique which is a=20
natural<BR>extension of EM. This approach allows us to tackle structured =

models<BR>such as HMMs and PCFGs with the benefits of Bayesian=20
nonparametrics<BR>while maintaining much of the existing EM machinery so =

familiar to<BR>this community. In addition to our foundational =
presentation,=20
we<BR>discuss both concrete implementation issues and demonstrate=20
the<BR>empirical advantages of these methods.<BR><BR>Tutorial #2: =
Usability and=20
Performance Evaluation<BR>for Advanced Spoken Dialogue=20
Systems<BR>------------------------------------<BR>Michael McTear, =
Kristiina=20
Jokinen<BR><BR>This tutorial will focus on methods, problems and =
challenges in=20
the<BR>evaluation of advanced spoken dialogue systems. It is grounded=20
in<BR>research that combines various speech and language=20
technology<BR>components into an integrated system, and surveys the =
issues=20
related<BR>to the design, evaluation and comparison of such systems. A =
number=20
of<BR>different approaches to robust and efficient interaction=20
management<BR>will be reviewed, together with various performance and=20
user<BR>evaluation methods in academic and industrial environments. A=20
closer<BR>look will be taken at the different metrics and usability=20
criteria,<BR>as well as automatic design and evaluation methods.=20
Practical<BR>requirements for dialogue systems, such as robustness,=20
scalability<BR>and portability will also be discussed and exemplified =
from the=20
point<BR>of view of performance evaluation and usability. Special=20
attention<BR>will be paid to user evaluation, and to the user=E2=80=99s =
expectations=20
and<BR>experience of the system.<BR><BR>The tutorial is targeted at =
researchers=20
and system developers who<BR>wish to learn more about theoretical and =
practical=20
issues concerning<BR>development and evaluation of spoken dialogue =
systems. The=20
tutorial<BR>will consist of two parts. The first part will survey =
techniques=20
in<BR>spoken dialogue management and motivate the need for =
evaluation<BR>studies=20
by discussing novel challenges and requirements for<BR>interactive =
systems.=20
Issues concerning conversational dialogue<BR>modelling, such as =
knowledge=20
representation, context, adaptation,<BR>learning, error handling, =
multimodality,=20
ubiquitous computing, as<BR>well as practical requirements for =
commercial=20
dialogue systems, such<BR>as robustness, scalability and portability, =
will be=20
discussed and<BR>exemplified from the point of view of performance=20
evaluation,<BR>usability, and user evaluation. The second part of the =
tutorial=20
will<BR>focus on methodologies and practices of evaluation, and will=20
deal<BR>with basic concepts, methods and metrics for system=20
performance<BR>evaluation and usability. In particular, challenges for=20
the<BR>evaluation of advanced dialogue systems will be=20
discussed.<BR><BR>Tutorial #3: Textual=20
Entailment<BR>-------------------------------<BR>Ido Dagan, Dan Roth, =
Fabio=20
Massimo Zanzotto<BR><BR>Recognizing Textual Entailment is the task of=20
determining, for<BR>example, that the sentence: "Google files for its =
long=20
awaited IPO"<BR>entails that "Google goes public". Determining whether =
the=20
meaning of<BR>a given text passage entails that of another or whether =
they have=20
the<BR>same meaning is a fundamental problem in natural=20
language<BR>understanding that requires the ability to abstract over the =

inherent<BR>syntactic and semantic variability in natural language.=20
This<BR>challenge is at the heart of many natural language=20
understanding<BR>tasks including Question Answering, Information =
Retrieval=20
and<BR>Extraction, Machine Translation, and others that attempt to=20
reason<BR>about and capture the meaning of linguistic expressions. The =
task=20
has<BR>attracted significant interest over the last couple of years=20
mainly<BR>fostered by the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment=20
Challenge<BR>(RTE). A substantial number of papers on these topics have=20
been<BR>published in major conferences and workshops in the last couple=20
of<BR>years.<BR><BR>The primary goals of this tutorial are to review the =

framework of<BR>applied Textual Entailment and motivate it as a generic =
paradigm=20
for<BR>natural language semantics. We will present some of the=20
key<BR>computational approaches proposed and some of the =
obstacles<BR>identified=20
by the research community in this area, as a way to<BR>promote further =
research.=20
The tutorial will thus be useful for many<BR>of the senior and junior=20
researchers that have prior or new interest<BR>in this area, providing a =
concise=20
overview of recent perspectives and<BR>research results.<BR><BR>Tutorial =
#4:=20
From Web Content Mining<BR>to Natural Language=20
Processing<BR>------------------------------<BR>Bing Liu<BR><BR>Web =
mining is a=20
growing research area. It consists of Web usage<BR>mining, Web structure =
mining,=20
and Web content mining. Web usage<BR>mining refers to the discovery of =
user=20
access patterns from Web usage<BR>logs. Web structure mining tries to =
discover=20
useful knowledge from<BR>hyperlinks. Web content mining aims to =
extract/mine=20
useful<BR>information or knowledge from Web page contents. This=20
tutorial<BR>focuses on Web content mining and its extensive connection=20
with<BR>natural language processing (NLP).<BR><BR>In the past few years, =
there=20
was a rapid expansion of activities in<BR>Web content mining. This is =
not=20
surprising because of the huge amount<BR>of valuable information of =
almost any=20
imaginable type on the Web and<BR>significant economic benefits of such =
mining.=20
However, due to the<BR>heterogeneity and the lack of structure of the =
Web data,=20
automated<BR>discovery of targeted or unexpected knowledge/information=20
still<BR>presents many challenging problems. This tutorial will=20
introduce<BR>several such problems and some state-of-the-art techniques=20
for<BR>dealing with them, e.g., data/information extraction, Web=20
information<BR>integration, opinion mining, and information synthesis.=20
These<BR>problems all have strong connections with NLP. In the tutorial, =

I<BR>will pay special attention to such connections and discuss how=20
NLP<BR>researchers may contribute towards solving these problems.=20
Many<BR>real-life examples will also be given to help participants=20
understand<BR>research concepts and see how the technologies may be =
deployed=20
to<BR>real-life applications. The tutorial will thus have a mix of=20
research<BR>and industry flavor, addressing seminal research ideas and =
looking=20
at<BR>the technology from an industry angle.<BR><BR>Tutorial #5: Quality =
Control=20
of Corpus<BR>Annotation Through Reliability=20
Measures<BR>---------------------------------------<BR>Ron =
Artstein<BR><BR>The=20
need for quality control of corpus annotation should be =
obvious:<BR>research=20
based on annotated corpora can only be as good as the<BR>annotations =
themselves.=20
In recent years, corpus annotation has<BR>expanded from marking basic=20
morphological and syntactic structure to<BR>many new kinds of linguistic =

phenomena. Each new annotation scheme<BR>and every individual set of =
annotation=20
guidelines need to be checked<BR>for quality, because quality inferences =
do not=20
carry over from one<BR>scheme to another. A standard way of assessing =
the=20
quality of an<BR>annotation scheme and guidelines is to compare =
annotations of=20
the<BR>same text by two or more independent annotators. While =
researchers<BR>are=20
generally aware of this technique, it seems that the inner<BR>workings =
of the=20
statistics involved and how to interpret them are<BR>understood by few.=20
Mechanical application of agreement coefficients<BR>found in software =
packages=20
can lead to serious errors, and it is<BR>therefore crucial for people =
who do=20
research on annotation to become<BR>intimately familiar with these=20
statistics.<BR><BR>This tutorial is a thorough introduction to the =
statistics=20
used for<BR>measuring agreement between corpus annotators, and hence=20
for<BR>inferring the reliability of the annotation. The tutorial will=20
focus<BR>on the mathematics of the various agreement measures,=20
and<BR>consequently on the implicit assumptions they make about=20
annotators<BR>and annotation errors. A major part of the tutorial will =
be=20
devoted<BR>to agreement coefficients of the kappa family, which are the=20
most<BR>commonly used reliability measures in computational linguistics, =

but<BR>the tutorial will also discuss alternative measures such as=20
latent<BR>class analysis. The tutorial will not assume advanced=20
mathematical<BR>knowledge beyond basic probability theory, and will thus =

be<BR>accessible to most researchers in computational=20
linguistics.<BR><BR><BR>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
