Call for Papers and Call For Workshop Proposals

Purpose/ History:

This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of researchers in
computer science, computer engineering and applied computing. Many of the 25
joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the premier conferences for presentation of
advances in their respective fields. We anticipate to have 2,600 or more
attendees from over 80 countries participating in the 2008 joint conferences.

The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research conferences into
a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a common time. The main
goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas in a number of research areas
that interact. The model used to form these annual conferences facilitates
communication among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
computer science, computer engineering and applied computing. Both inward
research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and outward research
(multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered
during the conferences.

WORLCOMP'08 will be composed of research presentations, keynote lectures,
invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations. 
In recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers included: Prof. Michael J.
Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John H. Holland (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. H.
J. Siegel (Colorado State U.); Prof. Barry Vercoe (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U.
of California, Berkeley); Prof. David Cheriton (Stanford U.), Prof. A. K. Dunker
(Indiana U. and Purdue U.); Prof. Jun Liu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys
(developer of X Window, ...); Dr. Chris Rowen (President and CEO, Tensilica,
Inc.); and many other distinguished speakers.

Submission of Papers:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft paper (about 5 to 7 pages
- single space, font size of 10 to 12) to H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 25, 2008. email
submissions in MS document or PDF formats are preferable (Fax or postal
submissions are also fine.)  All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable
(later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular
typesetting format to prepare their papers for publication.)

The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7 (IEEE
style) pages. Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere. The first page of the draft paper should
include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, email address,
and telephone number for each author. The first page should also identify the
name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. Finally, the name of the conference that the
paper is being submitted to must be stated on the first page.

Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, impact, and
soundness. Each paper will be refereed by two experts in the field who are
independent of the conference program committee. The referees' evaluations will
then be reviewed by two members of the program committee who will recommend a
decision to the chair of the track that the paper has been submitted to. The
chair will make the final decision. Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be
reviewed by one member of the program committee.

Proposal for Organizing Sessions/Workshops:

Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from different authors (12
papers in the case of workshops). The session chairs will be responsible for all
aspects of their sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...
The names of session chairs will appear as Associate Editors in the conference
proceedings and on the cover of the books.

Proposals to organize sessions should include the following information: name
and address (+ email) of proposer, title of session, a 100-word description of
the topic of the session, the name of the conference the session is submitted
for consideration, and a short description on how the session will be advertised
(in most cases, session proposers solicit papers from colleagues and researchers
whose work is known to the session proposer).  email your proposal to H. R.
Arabnia (address is given above). We would like to receive the proposals by
January 16, 2008.

Important Dates:

Jan. 16, 2008: Proposals for organizing/chairing sessions/workshops
 Feb. 25, 2008: Submission of papers (about 5 to 7 pages)
March 25, 2008: Notification of acceptance
April 25, 2008: Camera-Ready papers and Registration due
July 14-17, 2008: The 2008 World Congress in Computer Science,
Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
(WORLDCOMP'08 - 25 joint conferences)

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy of Science
(chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing; AI; imaging science; databases;
simulation; software engineering; embedded systems; internet and web
technologies; communications; computer security; and bioinformatics.) The
Program Committee for individual conferences is currently being formed.  Those
interested in joining the Program Committee should email H. R. Arabnia
(hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation and position,
complete mailing address, email address, a short biography together with
research interests and the name of the conference offering to help with.
Many who have already joined the committees of individual tracks are renowned
leaders, scholars, researchers, scientists and practitioners of the highest
ranks; many are directors of research laboratories, fellows of various
societies, heads/chairs of departments, deans and provosts.

Location of Conferences:

The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA
(with any overflows at other near-by hotels). This is a mega hotel with
excellent conference facilities and over 3,000 rooms. It is minutes from the
airport with 24-hour shuttle service to and from the airport. This hotel has
many recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools, sunning decks,
Easy River, wave pool, lighted tennis courts, health spa, nightly shows, a
number of restaurants, ...  The negotiated room rate for conference attendees is
very reasonable. The hotel is within walking distance from most other
attractions (recreational destinations, Golf courses, ...)
