Meeting Description:

MAD10 (Multidisciplinary Approaches to Discourse 2010) aims at bringing tog=
ether
researchers from different disciplines (linguistics, computational linguist=
ics,
psycholinguistics, educational and cognitive psychology, ergonomics and doc=
ument
design, semiotics, information and communication sciences, typography, etc.=
) to
exchange information and learn from each other on the common topic of
investigation: 'Signalling text organisation'.=20

Call for Papers

Signalling text organisation refers to the observation that within texts,
certain features or elements seem to have a special instructional role with
regard to text organisation. These text organisation signalling devices hav=
e
been described under a variety of names: signals, structure indicators, adv=
ance
organisers, discourse markers, layout properties, surface structure feature=
s,
organisational cues, stylistic writing devices and so on. Their scope range=
s
from a very local level to a more global one.=20

Different disciplines have taken an interest in these devices, either as a =
core
object of study or as an element to be taken into account. As a consequence=
,
research concerned with the signalling of text organisation is far from
constituting a unified field. The notion of signal itself may be associated=
 with
different key concepts according to discipline and models: document structu=
re,
discourse organisation, layout structure, text architecture, etc. As far as
function is concerned, they may be seen as discourse construction devices,
traces of metalinguistic segments, as reading or processing instructions, a=
s
traces of the writer's cognitive processes, or as cues revealing the author=
's
intentions, etc.

Since the 1970's, research into the signalling of text organisation has pro=
duced
considerable results. The environment for this research is at present under=
going
a twofold transformation: firstly, new methods are appearing, linked to
technological advances (corpus linguistics, natural language processing, ey=
e
movement recording techniques for the analysis of cognitive processes durin=
g
reading, etc.); secondly, new fields of application are opening (in connect=
ion
with the expanding use of digital documents in the professional and educati=
onal
worlds). In this new context, novel research questions open up, requiring t=
he
integration of contributions from different disciplines or fields of study.

We invite extended abstracts in PDF format. Abstracts must not exceed ten p=
ages
(including figures but not references), using Times 12 pt font, 1.5 line
spacing, with 2 cm margins on all sides. All abstracts will be reviewed by
members of the program committee. For final versions of accepted abstracts,
precise formatting instructions will be issued. Each talk will last 30 minu=
tes,
followed by 10 minutes discussion.

With previous workshops in the series, selected papers have later been publ=
ished
in special issues of journals or as an edited volume in a relevant series1
(http://discours.revues.org/index5842.html). We are planning on following t=
his
approach for MAD 2010 as well. For additional information, please contact
(mad2010@univ-tlse2.fr ), CLLE, UMR 5263.
