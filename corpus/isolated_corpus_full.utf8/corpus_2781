Final Call for Papers

Title of the workshop:
Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge

The host conference:
6th International Conference on Multimedia and Network Information Systems,=
 Wroclaw, Poland, September 18-19, 2008 =


Web site:
http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/
       =

The proportion of Web pages written in English keeps decreasing, but a majo=
rity of text-handling tools and techniques have been developed for English =
and tested on English resources. Many languages have been reasonably well s=
erved by the existing systems, but large typological differences (complex m=
orphology, rich inflection, freer-order syntax, not to mention cultural bia=
ses) tend to make those tools and resources less than fully adequate. This =
may be particularly true of deeper processing, including the acquisition of=
 natural language semantics from text.

The workshop seeks to explore methodologies developed from scratch for a va=
riety of languages, and perhaps their reapplication to the processing of En=
glish texts. We invite submissions on the topics we list below, and on clos=
ely related topics in the general spirit of the workshop. We target the pro=
blem of  automatic extraction of some form of natural language semantics fr=
om corpora and application of the knowledge extracted in that way in system=
s that deal with  natural language. =


Work on any language is welcome; we particularly encourage submissions rela=
ted to "less privileged" languages. The workshop will be held in English, t=
o ensure the broadest dissemination of its contributions. We have room for =
up to 50 papers, including posters, so there will be ample opportunity to r=
eport on work in progress. To suit the host conference, papers on applicati=
ons of the semantic knowledge extracted from text will also be considered; =
such applications include machine translation, parsing, sentiment analysis,=
 information retrieval, information extraction, and text mining.

All submissions must present original work. There will be a strict reviewin=
g process. Formatting instructions appear on the workshop's Web site. The s=
ubmission system is already open.

Publication:

The proceedings will be printed by IEEE.

Selected papers will be considered for publication in a special issue of th=
e International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ht=
tp://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalCODE=3Dijiids) dedicated =
to the MISSI'08 Conference, as well as in the International Journal of Info=
rmation Technologies and the Systems Approach (IJITSA).

A book devoted to the topics of the conference will be published after the =
conference. Those who have presented at the conference will be invited to s=
ubmit extended versions of their papers as book chapters.

Topics:

Distributional semantics, semantic relatedness, semantic similarity
Extraction of lexico-semantic relations
Extraction of logical models for natural language semantics
Extraction of selectional restrictions
Lexicon extraction from corpora
Pattern-based methods in lexical knowledge acquisition
Recognition of expressions of opinions and emotions in text
Resources and tools for word-sense disambiguation
Software support for lexical knowledge acquisition
Thesaurus construction, extension and critique

Schedule:

submission       March 27, 2008
reviews in       April 30, 2008
acceptance       May 7, 2008
camera-ready     May 21-28, 2008
