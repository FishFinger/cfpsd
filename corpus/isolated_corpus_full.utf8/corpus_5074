Location: Ibadan, Nigeria 
Contact Person: Francis Egbokhare

Meeting Description:

IFRA (Institut Fran√ßais de Recherche en Afrique) will organise a conference on
Nigeria Pidgin in the University of Ibadan from the 7th to the 10th of July,
2009. This conference proposes to explore the various dimensions of NP, and set
the foundation for the Nigerian Pidgin Project aiming at producing a reference
grammar, a dictionary and a teaching method for NP. 

Call for Papers

Nigeria Pidgin (NP) is spoken by more than 50 million speakers all over Nigeria,
in a variety of forms that go from the vehicular "broken English" to the more
elaborate and complex varieties developed by standup comedians, song writers,
journalists and students. The broad inter-comprehension that exists between the
Pidgins spoken in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Sierra Leone give it a strong
potential as a language for commerce and regional integration and could be
useful in the present context of globalization. Despite this powerful social and
political potential NP suffers from a lack of recognition that hinders its
development as a potential linguistic integrator for the Nigerian nation. The
conference will center on the essential question:  What is Nigeria Pidgin ?

You are invited to submit researched and data-oriented papers covering the
following topics:
- The sociology/ function(s) of NP
- The geography of NP
- The history of NP
- NP in literature, the arts and entertainment
- The structure of NP
- The vocabulary of NP
- The future of NP
- What orthography for NP?

Deadline
All proposals must be sent by e-mail before May 31st, 2009, in multiple copies, to :
Prof. Francis Egbokhare, University of Ibadan : foegbokhare@yahoo.com

Prof. Bernard Caron, IFRA, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria : ifra.nigeria@gmail.com
