E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: 2009 call for submissions

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize
to outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
Information. We invite submissions for the best dissertation which
resulted in a Ph.D. degree in the year 2008. The dissertations will be
judged on technical depth and strength, originality, and impact made
in at least two of the three fields of Logic, Language, and
Computation. Interdisciplinarity is an important feature of the
theses competing for the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize.


Who qualifies?

Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree
in the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st,
2008 and December 31st, 2008. There is no restriction on the
nationality of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was
granted. After a careful consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept
only dissertations written in English. Dissertations produced in 2008
but not written in English or not translated will be allowed for
submission, after translation, also with the call next year (for
2009). Respectively, nominations of full English translations of
theses originally written in other language than English and defended
in 2007 and 2008 will be accepted for consideration this year, too.


Prize.

The prize consists of:  
- a certificate
- a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
- an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to
   the new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be
   published by Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further
   information on this series is available on the FoLLI site)


How to submit. 

Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are
required:

 - the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
 - a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
 - a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. Self-nominations
   are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by the thesis
   supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely describe the
   scope and significance of the dissertation and state when the
   degree was officially awarded;
- two additional letters of support, including at least one letter
   from a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that
   awarded the Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to:

bethaward2008@gmail.com

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.  Inc ase of any problems with the
email submission or a lack of notification within three working days after
submission, nominators should write to goranko@maths.wits.ac.za or
policriti@dimi.uniud.it, with a cc to bethaward2008@gmail.com.


Important dates:

Extended (strict) deadline for submissions: April 7, 2009. 
Notification of decision: July 1, 2009.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
