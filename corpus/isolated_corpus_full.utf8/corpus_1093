Meeting Description:

Towards collaborative content management of interpretations, hypotheses, and
theories 

Academic research is to a large extent a discussion about how to interpret data.
To facilitate this process, many initiatives are underway using digital
technologies to make the data themselves available to as wide an audience as
possible. However, the development of tools to systematize the 'interpretation'
of data is still in its infancy. Such tools would be especially valuable to
fields of research where data is not (easily) replicable, either because of high
costs associated with its collection or because the data are historically bound
(e.g., archaeological artifacts, fossils, or manuscripts). In such cases, the
same data will often be subject to different interpretations by different
researchers, or even by the same researcher at different points of time, and
consensus can only be achieved by discussing these interpretations, not by
collecting more data. Normally, the bulk of content of such interpretations is
inaccessible since only summaries of them make their way into the published
scientific literature. Furthermore, there is generally no way for an outsider to
discover ways in which a given set of interpretations evolved over time. What is
needed are tools that allow interpretations of data to be systematically
documented and kept track of, so that all of their content, and not just small
pieces, can be made available for inspection by other researchers.

During this workshop, we would like to have both presentations of ongoing
attempts to develop such tools as well as discussion about what functionality
would be found in an ideal system for the documentation of interpretations,
hypotheses, and theories.

We are particularly interested in the following issues:

- the use of web-based collaborative content management systems for scientific
purposes
- tools and methods facilitating the organization and annotation of multimodal data
- the development of means to support team-based research
- models for management of public versus private content
- standards for the publication, citation, and tracking of online interpretive
content
- development of data management techniques allowing interpretations themselves
to be annotated for hypotheses or theories they support

We hope with this workshop to encourage researchers who have similar problems in
content management, but work in fields which normally have little interaction,
to find new opportunities for collaboration. We expect the workshop will be of
interest to linguists, historians, biologists, library scientists, and other
branches of research dealing with the organization and interpretation of
multifaceted data sources.

Call for Papers: 

We invite further presentations pertaining to the subject of this workshop. Send
your one-page abstract to Michael Cysouw at the address below, preferably by
email (in plain text or in PDF format) or as hard copy, to arrive no later than
March 15, 2007. Notification of acceptance is by April 1st, 2007. The normal
time allotted for presentation would be 30 minutes plus 15 minutes for discussion.

We also plan to have a special session for hands-on presentations of software
pertaining to the theme of the workshop. If you would like to present such
software, please send us a one-page abstract describing its current
functionality. In addition, please indicate what equipment you will need for
your presentation.

Subject: Embodied sentence processing 

	

Full Title: Embodied sentence processing 
Short Title: ESP07 

Date: 17-Aug-2007 - 19-Aug-2007
Location: Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Saarland, Germany 
Contact Person: Pia Knoeferle
Meeting Email: pknoeferle@ucsd.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Neurolinguistics;
Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2007 

Meeting Description:
The workshop ESP07 focuses on behavioural, neuropsychological, and computational
research that examines the online interaction of non-linguistic (e.g.,
visuomotor) processing and sentence comprehension. Particular emphasis is given
to bringing together insights from different research traditions (e.g.,
embodiment and language for action), and/or novel methodological approaches. 

Workshop ESP07
Embodied sentence processing: behavioural, neuropsychological, and computational
perspectives

August 17-19, 2007

Organizers: Pia Knoeferle and Matthew W. Crocker

Invited speakers:
Lawrence Barsalou, Emory University, USA
Giovanni Buccino, University of Parma, Italy
Friedemann Pulvermueller, University of Cambridge, UK
Michael Tanenhaus, University of Rochester, USA
Marco Tettamanti, Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Italy
Elke van der Meer, Humboldt University Berlin, Germany
Rolf Zwaan, Florida State University, USA

We invite submissions presenting original behavioural and/or neuropsychological
investigations of embodied and situated language processing, and also welcome
relevant computational modeling results. Submissions will be reviewed by members
of the program committee. 

Examples for topics include but are not limited to:
- The use of non-linguistic information during sentence processing
- Interactions between visual attention and sentence processing
- Interactions between online sentence comprehension and motor activity
- Cognitive computational models of language-vision interaction
- Language processing in embodied cognitive systems (e.g. robots)

Accepted presentations will be presented at the workshop as either papers or
posters. The deadline for submissions is May 1, 2007. Please email submissions
to esp07@coli.uni-sb.de. Notifications concerning the submissions will be made
by June 4, 2007. For further details regarding submission please consult the
homepage of the workshop at http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/conf/esp07/
