MLMI'07 second call for papers (apologies for multiple postings):



                 4th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                  and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI'07)

                          28-30 June 2007
                        Brno, Czech Republic

                       http://www.mlmi07.org


The fourth MLMI workshop is coming to Brno in the Czech Republic,=
=20
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005) a=
nd=20
Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the=
=20
different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine=
=20
learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and human-compu=
ter=20
interaction.  The motivation for creating this joint multi-disciplina=
ry=20
workshop arose from the actual needs of several large collaborative=
=20
projects.

MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual conference of the=
=20
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007), which will=
=20
take place in Prague on June 25-27, 2007.

  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics =
above


* Satellite events

ose=20
other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please contac=
t=20
the organizing committee.


* Guidelines for submission

In common with the previous MLMI workshops, revised versions of selec=

nce=20
series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

Submissions are invited in one of the following formats:
  - full papers for oral or poster presentation (12 pages)
  - extended abstracts for poster presentation only (1-2 pages)
  - demonstration proposals (1-2 pages)

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at=20
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/, following the Springer LNCS forma=
t=20

* Venue

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital=
 of=20
Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the country's=
=20
judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of almost four=
=20
hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also the cultural=
=20
center of the region.

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and=
=20
Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km)=
.

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental=20
(http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet pa=
rt=20
of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The local=
=20
organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology=20
(http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was=
=20
founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
