Deadline: March 27, 2009

The Sixth Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-09)

MCLC offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics  
researchers to get together and present ideas and research results. It  
is intended to be primarily for researchers from the Midwest region,  
but applications from all regions are welcome.  We particularly  
welcome work in progress from graduate students and other young  
researchers.  The first meeting of MCLC was successfully held
at Indiana University, Bloomington in 2004, and we're pleased to bring
it back to Indiana.

http://cl.indiana.edu/~mclc09/

==== Submission Guidelines ====

- Researchers should prepare a 2-page, extended abstract using the ACL
   style files.
- The abstract should be anonymous.
- Abstracts should be emailed to mclc09@indiana.edu no later than
   March 27, 2009. The abstract should be in .pdf format.

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. The major
criteria of evaluation will be the originality, soundness, and clarity
of the research idea presented and the relevance of the topic to the
colloquium.

==== Registration ====

Registration will be free.

==== Publication ====

Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited (but not required) to
submit a 4-8 page full paper using the ACL style files for the
proceedings.  Copyright of a submitted paper remains with the
author(s).

==== Important Dates ====

Abstract submission deadline: March 27, 2009
Notification of acceptance: April 6, 2009
Final papers due: April 24, 2009
Colloquium: May 2-3, 2009
