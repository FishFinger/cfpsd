===========================================
Call for Papers
The 6th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2009)
31 May - 4 June 2009, Crete, Greece
===========================================

The vision of the Semantic Web is to enhance today's Web by exploiting
machine-processable metadata. The explicit representation of the semantics
of data, enriched with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that
provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together a
large network of human knowledge and makes this knowledge
machine-processable. Various automated services will help the users to
achieve their goals by accessing and processing information in
machine-understandable form. This network of knowledge systems will
ultimately lead to truly intelligent systems, which will be employed for
various complex decision-making tasks. Semantic Web research can benefit
from ideas and cross-fertilization with many other areas: Artificial
Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Databases and Information
Systems, Information Retrieval, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social
Networks and Web Engineering. Many advances within these areas can
contribute towards the realization of the Semantic Web.

The 6th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2009) will present the
latest results in research and applications of Semantic Web technologies.
ESWC 2009 will also feature a tutorial program, system descriptions and
demos, a posters track, a Ph.D. symposium and a number of collocated
workshops. The calls for these events are separate and can be found on the
conference Web site (http://www.eswc2009.org/).

ESWC 2009 is sponsored by STI2, Semantic Technology Institutes
International. For more information on STI2, please visit
http://www.sti2.org.


Submissions

ESWC 2009 welcomes the submission of original research and application
papers dealing with all aspects of the Semantic Web. We particularly
encourage the submission of papers on industrial efforts and experiences
with Semantic Web projects. We encourage theoretical, methodological,
empirical, and applications papers.

The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series. Paper submission and reviewing for ESWC
2009 will be electronic via the conference submissions site. Papers should
not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be formatted according to
the information for LNCS authors.

Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format
and will *not* be accepted in any other format. Papers that exceed 15 pages
or do not follow the LNCS guidelines risk being rejected automatically
without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide
semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission -- details of this
process will be provided on the conference Web page at the time of
acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the
conference.


Best Paper Award

An award will be given to the best paper (or papers) submitted to the
conference as judged by the Program Chairs in collaboration with the Program
Committee.

Topics of Interest

Topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:


1. Semantic Web Data and Ontologies
    * Interoperability of data on the Semantic Web
    * Technologies for linked data
    * Database Technologies for the Semantic Web
    * Semantic Annotation of Data
    * Searching, Querying, Visualizing, Navigating and Browsing the Semantic
Web
    * Query Languages and Optimization for the Semantic Web
    * Rule Languages for the Semantic Web
    * Ontology Management (creation, evolution, evaluation, etc.)
    * Ontology Alignment (mapping, matching, merging, mediation and
reconciliation)
    * Ontology Learning and Metadata Generation (e.g., HLT and ML
approaches)

2. Semantic Web Services
   * Service Description, Composition, and Discovery
   * Service Orchestration and Choreography
   * Service Testing, Verification, and Validation
   * Service Monitoring, Adaptation and Management
   * SLA Modeling and Management
   * Quality of Services, Security, and Dependability

Semantic Web In-Use Track
--------------------------
ESWC 2009 also features a "Semantic Web In-Use Track", which aims at showing
the 
benefits of applying semantic technology in various real-life applications.
The kind of contributions and presentations for this track should be
different from 
these submitted to the scientific track. While papers submitted to the
scientific track 
may provide an evidence of the scientific contribution through applications
and evaluations 
(see Topics 4. and 5. above), papers submitted to the "Semantic Web In-Use
Track" 
should be mainly organized with a presentation centered around some of 
or all of the following main aspects:  

 * A description of  concrete problems in specific domains of applications 
   for which semantic technology would provide a solution. 
 * A description of an implemented application of semantic technology in a
specific domain 
 * An assessment of the pros and cons of using semantic technology to solve
a particular 
   business problem in a specific domain 
 * An assessment of the costs and benefits of the application of Semantic
Web Technologies,
   times spent for implementation and deployment, efforts involved, user
acceptance, 
   returns on investment 
 * A comparison to competing approaches using conventional or different
technologies
 * An evidence and/or assessment of deployment and use of the application.
