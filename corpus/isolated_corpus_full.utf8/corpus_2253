Meeting Description

AAAI 2008 Workshop
Wikipedia and Artificial Intelligence: an Evolving Synergy
http://lit.csci.unt.edu/~wikiai08
Call for Papers
                                           
Overview

Since its inception less than seven years ago, Wikipedia has become one of the
largest and fastest growing online sources of encyclopedic knowledge. One of the
reasons why Wikipedia is appealing to contributors and users alike is the
richness of its embedded structural information: articles are hyperlinked to
each other and connected to categories from an ever expanding taxonomy;
pervasive language phenomena such as synonymy and polysemy are addressed through
redirection and disambiguation pages; entities of the same type are described in
a consistent format using infoboxes; related articles are grouped together in
series templates.

As a large-scale repository of structured knowledge, Wikipedia has become a
valuable resource for a diverse set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications. Major conferences in natural language processing and machine
learning have recently witnessed a significant number of approaches that use
Wikipedia for tasks ranging from text categorization and clustering to word
sense disambiguation, information retrieval, information extraction and question
answering. On the other hand, Wikipedia can greatly benefit from numerous
algorithms and representation models developed during decades of AI research, as
illustrated recently in tasks such as estimating the reliability of authors'
contributions, automatic linking of articles, or intelligent matching of 
Wikipedia tasks with potential contributors.

The goal of the workshop is to foster the research and dissemination of ideas on
the mutually beneficial interaction between Wikipedia and AI. The workshop is
intended to be highly interdisciplinary. We encourage participation of
researchers working on Wikipedia from different perspectives, including (but not
limited to) machine learning, computational linguistics, 
information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, knowledge
representation, and others. We also encourage participation of researchers from
other areas who might benefit from the use of a large body of machine-readable
knowledge. 

Topics

We invite submissions of papers addressing the following or related topics::
- Using Wikipedia as a source of training data for AI tasks (both supervised an
unsupervised)
- Automatic methods for improving the quality of Wikipedia pages
- Integrating Wikipedia with existing ontologies (e.g. WordNet, CYC, ODP)
- Extracting annotated data from Wikipedia
- Enriching Wikipedia with new types of structural information
- Wikipedia and the Semantic Web / Web 2.0
- Automatic extraction and use of cross-lingual information from Wikipedia
- Computerized use of satellite projects such as Wiktionary, Wikibooks or
Wikispecies

Workshop Format

The day long workshop will consist of presentations, invited talk, demos
showcasing work presented in the research papers, and a panel session.

Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions of regular full papers (up to 6 pages), short papers
reporting on late-breaking results (up to 3 pages), and descriptions of system
demonstrations (up to 1 page) using the AAAI style. Submissions that have been
accepted for publication elsewhere or are under review for another conference
must clearly state so on the front page of the paper.

Important Dates

Deadline for long papers submission: March 21, 2008
Deadline for short papers and system demos: April 7, 2008
Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2008
Camera-ready papers due at AAAI: May 5, 2008
