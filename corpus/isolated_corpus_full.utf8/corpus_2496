Meeting Description

Language Disorders in Greek

To take place on May 31st to June 1st 2008, at the Department of Speech and
Language Therapy of the Technological Educational Institute of Patras, Greece.

Taking into consideration the ongoing research on impaired language and its
implications for what we know about language and the brain, as well as
research on Greek in particular, the aim of this conference is to bring
together current research on Greek as a result of language disorder(s).
Both theoretical and experimental research is welcome on any topic of
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, or pragmatics.  
Special emphasis is given on comparative work, either between Greek and
some other language(s), or on bilingualism/multilingualism when one of the
languages is Greek.   

This year's meeting will give priority to Developmental Language Disorders 
(although work on other disorders, as well as on early language, will also
be considered).

Meeting Description

Critical Dimensions in Applied Linguistics

The origins of Applied Linguistics were in the application of linguistic
understandings to a wide range of contexts and issues. In the past decades the
field has moved beyond relating language to social contexts to a dynamic
approach to language addressing issues such as difference, access and disparity.
It has become a more open field of interest in language involving an
increasingly interactive approach between social and political contexts,
language and research approaches.

The rapid worldwide increase in migration and reactions to it, the expansion of
media and technology, political changes at international and local levels are
both challenges and opportunities for research in applied linguistics. At the
same time constraints such as market economy-driven research funding and greater
central control of research agendas have limited the ability of the field to
respond.

The theme of this year's conference 'Critical Dimension in Applied Linguistics'
reflects the recent work in Applied Linguistics that examines the
socio-cultural, economic, and political dimensions of language and language use.
