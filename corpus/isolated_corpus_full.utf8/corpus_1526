CfP: Interesting Negative Results in Summarization

The Journal of Interesting Negative Results in ML and NLP invites
members of the summarization community, among them the participants
of the Document Understanding Conference, to contribute interesting
ideas which lead to unexpected negative results. We will welcome
papers and short notes on such results in all forms of summarization,
in particular in NIST-sponsored topic-driven multi-document
summarization and update summarization. For more details, please
visit http://www.jinr.org/ and click on "call for papers".
