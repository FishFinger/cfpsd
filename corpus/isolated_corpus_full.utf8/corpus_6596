Meeting Description:

Following the success of the Northern Englishes Workshops held at Lancaster
University, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Salford, the
series will now continue on a biannual basis.

We are delighted to announce that the 4th Northern Englishes Workshop will be
held at the University of Sheffield from the afternoon of Wednesday 7th April to
lunchtime on Friday 9th April 2010.

The Workshop will adopt the format of previous sessions in combining open 
discussion with the presentation of research on the linguistic 'North'.

We are very pleased to announce that Katie Wales has agreed to provide a 
plenary session.  Further information about other plenary speakers will follow. 

Call for Papers

You are invited to submit abstracts covering any aspect of research on Northern
Englishes.  As with the previous Workshops, Scotland is included in the
linguistic 'North'.  In the past, papers have considered the following topics,
amongst others:

Dialect geography
Language perception
Levelling/diffusion
Divergence and Innovation
External influences
Sociolinguistic methods

Abstracts of no more than 300 words (excluding title, name of presenter(s),
affiliation and references) should be emailed to sheffieldnew4@googlemail.com by
4pm on the 1st December 2009.  PDF files are the preferred format, although Word
documents will also be accepted.  Notification of acceptance will be given in
early January 2010.

Papers will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions.

We hope that the workshop will be as interdisciplinary as possible so please do
forward this call to colleagues in related disciplines (e.g. geography, 
sociology) who might be interested.

Joan Beal (University of Sheffield)
Lourdes Burbano-Elizondo (Edge Hill University) 
Chris Montgomery (Sheffield Hallam University)
