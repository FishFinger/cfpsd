Meeting Description:

This conference aims to bring together researchers working on minimalist
approaches to locality effects exhibited by syntactic dependencies, with
particular emphasis on (dependencies involving) syntactic movement. The
conference will feature a special Workshop on Head Movement and Locality. 

Second Call for Papers

Conference on Minimalist Approaches to Syntactic Locality

This conference is envisaged to serve as a forum to discuss current minimalist
approaches to locality effects exhibited by syntactic dependencies, with
particular emphasis on (dependencies involving) syntactic movement.

Invited Speakers:
Adriana Belletti (Siena)
Cedric Boeckx (Harvard>Barcelona)
Carlo Cecchetto & Caterina Donati (Milano & Roma)
Marcel den Dikken (CUNY)
Gisbert Fanselow (Potsdam)
Gereon MÃ¼ller (Leipzig)
Norvin Richards (MIT)
Eric Reuland (Utrecht)
Luigi Rizzi (Siena)
Ian Roberts (Cambridge)

A number of distinct notions of syntactic locality have been employed and
explored within the frame of the minimalist research program. Some of them have
essentially been developed through reformulations from the immediately
anteceding GB approach, some others have been adapted from elsewhere, and others
again have newly emerged as part of the minimalist enterprise.

It is not clear at present which of these various notions of locality are
concurrently necessary, and which ones are to be eliminated, or
deconstructed---an issue with potentially far-reaching consequences for the
architecture of grammar. From a conceptual perspective, a key consideration is
that on minimalist assumptions locality properties of syntactic dependencies are
expected to fall out from the way syntactic computation (including its locally
minimized use of computational resources) is defined, as well as the way it
interfaces with external systems. Even though significant progress has been made
in the last decade, much work lies ahead before we can derive even some of the
most central locality properties without invoking any auxiliary concepts or
mechanisms.

We invite abstracts for 40-minute presentations (30'+10') that address any
aspect of these major themes from a theoretical and/or empirical perspective. A
non-exclusive list of possible questions for discussion, both for the main
conference and for the special Workshop on Head Movement and Locality, can be
found on the conference website:
http://ny01.nytud.hu/~suranyi/masl

Authors of selected high quality abstracts that do not make it into the main
session will be invited for a poster presentation. Selected papers from the
conference and workshop will be considered for peer-reviewed (book or special
journal issue) publication.

Deadline for abstracts: 15 April 2009

Abstract Submission:
An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract in pdf format
through an upload interface accessible from the conference website. Abstracts
should be anonymous, and at most two A4 pages (including data and references) in
12-point font with 1-inch margins all around.

For the full details of abstract submission, please visit:
http://ny01.nytud.hu/~suranyi/masl

Important Dates:
Deadline for abstracts: 15 April 2009
Notification of acceptance: cca. 30 April 2009
Conference and Workshop: 26-28 August 2009

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
