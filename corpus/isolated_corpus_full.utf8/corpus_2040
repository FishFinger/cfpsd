Meeting Description

The track of Applied Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers
working in natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL),
applied linguistics (AL) and related areas. The rapid pace of development in
natural language processing in textual studies, speech recognition, speech
production, and data mining has led to a revived interest in tools able to
understand, organize and extract information from natural language sources.
These include the analysis of online materials, most of them in textual form or
text combined with other media (visual, audio), the use of innovative
human-computer interfaces, such as interactive agents, which benefit from
language understanding, and the use of computational tools to facilitate
intelligent tutoring systems and instructional methodology. In addition, natural
language processing can facilitate human-computer interaction for people with
special needs, assist in the organization of classification systems, and
coordinate text segmentation.
 
While papers and contributions on traditional issues are welcome, the 2008
special track will emphasize applications by the NLP/CL community, particularly
in areas such as multilingual processing, learning environments, multimodal
communication, bioNLP, spam filtering, language acquisition, textual assessment,
language varieties, materials development, generic classification, and
educational applications etc. We also encourage papers in information retrieval,
speech processing and machine learning that present actual applications that can
benefit from or have an impact on NLP/CL. 

Topics

We invite original papers that describe work in, but not limited to, the
following areas
1. NL-based Knowledge Representations and Systems
2. Applied Linguistics and First and Second Language Acquisition
3. English for Specific Purposes
4. Textual assessment indices
5. Syntax
6. Semantics
7. Coreference Resolution
8. Word Sense Disambiguation
9. Text Cohesion and Coherence
10. Dialogue Management and Systems
11. Language Generation
12. Language Models
13. Human Computer Interfaces - in particular, multimodal human-computer
communication and language as the only acceptable human-computer communication
channel for the handicapped and elderly
14. Machine Learning applied to NL problems
15. Multilingual Processing
16. Standardization, Language Resources, Corpora Building, and Annotation Languages
17. NL in Learning Environments
18. Semantic Web, Ontologies, Reasoning
19. Applications: Machine Translation, Summarization, Intelligent Tutoring,
Question Answering, Information Extraction, etc.
20. Others

Submission Guidelines

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting
guidelines. The papers should be original work and not submitted (or in
submission) to any other conference. Papers should not exceed 6 pages and are
due by November 20, 2007. For FLAIRS-21, the 2008 conference, the reviewing is
not blind. Authors should indicate the special track if one exists that closely
matches the topic of their paper. All submissions will be done electronically
via the FLAIRS web submission system available through the paper submission site
at http://www.easychair.org/FLAIRS-21/
Please, check the website http://www.flairs.com/ for information regarding
submission.
Authors are encouraged, but not required, to offer their services as reviewers
on the program committee. Please contact either Philip McCarthy or Scott
Crossley if you are interested.

Conference Proceedings

Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press. Selected authors will be
invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the
International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) to be published
in 2008.
