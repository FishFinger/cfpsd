Western Interdisciplinary Student Symposium on Language Research (WISSLR)

The Graduate Program in Linguistics at the University of Western Ontario is

Language Research (WISSLR), to be held March 6 (possibly 7), 2009. In keeping
with the interdisciplinary nature of the Masters program at Western, we are

Acquisition, Psycholinguistics, Communication Disorders, Natural Language
Processing, Linguistic Anthropology, Linguistic Interfaces, Philosophy of
Language, and much more.

The symposium will be held at the University of Western Ontario, with the
possibility of streaming live to the internet (using WebCT/ Wimba technology).
We also welcome presentations from other locations via the same means (all

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Sociolinguistics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is on language contact and language change in multiple and bimodal
bilingual minorities. 

Call for Papers

The workshop aims at exploring the language contact and language change
phenomena that characterize multiple linguistic minorities. It focuses on but is
not confined to signed, Uralic and Caucasian languages.

On the one hand, we intend to explore the situation of bimodal bilingualism.
Data from changes in multi-modal bilingual contexts can lead to new insights
into bilingualism, the typology and structure of languages, and language change
and contact in general. Research into bimodal bilingualism can draw upon several
methods and approaches developed for studying the bilingualism of other minority
languages, and vice versa.

On the other hand, we know that it is difficult to reach the bilingual
individuals and communities that are deaf and belong to several linguistic
minorities. Therefore, we approach the bimodal target via individual studies on
minority languages. More specifically, we concentrate on the issue of language
change in contact in the context of a typologically wide range of minority
languages. We are looking for answers to questions such as the following:

- How do deaf children of (hearing) parents belonging to linguistic minorities
(e.g., Nganasan) communicate with the Deaf communities in their country and with
their own parents?
- How does their language change?
- How can we test the change in the structure of the languages in contact in a
uniform way?
- What are the factors that influence the developments?
- Can we work towards a typology?

Invited Keynote Speakers:
Csilla Bartha (hearing)
Ã–sten Dahl (hearing)
Tatiana Davidenko (Deaf) 
Gaurav Mathur (Deaf)
Johanna Mesch (Deaf)
Helle Metslang (hearing)
Christian Rathmann (Deaf)
Don Stilo (hearing)

http://www.dipfilmod-suf.unifi.it/CMpro-v-p-236.html

Submission (deadline January 15, 2009, notification January 31, 2009).
Abstracts (in English, maximum 2 pages, including data and references) have to
be submitted electronically as portable document format (.pdf) or Microsoft Word
(.doc) files via the EasyChair conference management system
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lcc09).

EasyChair Account" on that page and follow the instructions. When you receive a
