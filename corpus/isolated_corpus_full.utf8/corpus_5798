Meeting Description:

Describing, modelling and optimising language competences has long been a k=
ey domain of research in applied linguistics. Over the last few years, the =
notion of language competence has been re-examined and redefined under the =
influence of research in sociolinguistics, language education, and, more la=
rgely, research on language use in various settings. The focus has been on =
teaching and learning (competence-oriented objectives, task-based teaching =
and learning), assessment and programme evaluation as well as the professio=
nalisation of the language teaching field.=20

In the field of education, in particular, communicative and linguistic comp=
etences are presented today as sets of key competences pupils or students n=
eed to acquire. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the introduction o=
f language standards has been on the political agenda, starting at the lowe=
r grades of school.=20

Drawing on this interest in the notion of language competences in education=
 and in the workplace, the conference aims to stimulate reflection and deba=
te on the multiple transitions and transformations at play: transitions fro=
m orality to literacy (for example, the increasing role of writing in the w=
orkplace), transitions from one register to another (from standard to non-s=
tandard, etc.), from monolingual practices to multilingualism, from theory =
to practice, from face-to-face exchanges to virtual interactions, from the =
conceptualisation of the notion of competence to how it pans out in actual =
situations, etc. In concrete terms, discussion is invited about linguistica=
lly manifest transitions and transformations of competences as they occur a=
cross contexts, across age and social groups, and across school level and d=
evelopmental stages: e.g. from primary to secondary school, from high schoo=
l to university or from apprenticeships to the professional world. It is in=
deed during these transitions that the competences developed become crucial=
 to building identities or accessing new resources.=20

Call for Papers:

In line with this thematic orientation, papers or panels will contribute to=
 one of the three tracks below, in addition to more general contributions a=
bout language competence:=20

a) Transforming contexts and social changes: in this track, papers will be =
concerned with the ways in which social and political changes influence lan=
guage competences and the ways in which they are used and validated. How do=
 language competences evolve in contemporary societies? How do political an=
d educational institutions integrate these developments and attempt to infl=
uence them?=20

b) Changing individuals and transforming trajectories: in this track, paper=
s will be concerned with the transitions lived by participants at the vario=
us stages of their biographical trajectories. How are biographical changes =
and transitions affected by language competences? How do learning trajector=
ies, whether in the school context or elsewhere, help build language compet=
ences?

c) Transforming concepts and methods: in this track, papers will examine th=
e changes undergone by the notion of competence, both on the theoretical an=
d the methodological level, in the field of applied linguistics. After the =
founding debates in the 70s and the implementation of communicative approac=
hes to competences, what are perceptible changes in the ways this notion is=
 conceived and discussed? How can we model the dynamic dimension of languag=
e competences? Which tools should be developed to do so?=20

Panels and Papers:

Proposals are invited for papers and for panels (thematically connected ser=
ies of presentations).

Individual Papers:

30-minute slots for presentations (20 minutes for the paper, 5 minutes for =
discussion and 5 minutes for the transition). All individual papers are sch=
eduled for Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, so that they do not run i=
n parallel with panels. Abstracts: 300 words maximum.

Panels:

90-minute blocks, including 3 to 9 thematically or methodologically connect=
ed papers, organised and led by a convenor. Panel abstracts: 500 words maxi=
mum.

Languages:

German, French, Italian and English are the official conference languages.=
=20

Paper Submissions:

Information concerning the submission of abstracts as well as practical inf=
ormation concerning conference organisation (fees, travel, etc.) may be obt=
ained from the VALS-ASLA website (www.vals-asla.ch). Please address any fur=
ther questions to aleksandra.gnach@zhaw.ch

Deadlines:

The deadline for the submission of individual abstract or for panel abstrac=
ts is August, 31st, 2009.=20

Publication:

A publication of selected contributions in the Bulletin VALS/ASLA is planne=
d.
