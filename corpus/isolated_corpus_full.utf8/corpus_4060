Linguistic Field(s): Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

This workshop focuses on combining analysis skills to improve geographic
information processing. We welcome researchers from communities as diverse as
geographic information extraction and retrieval, context aware devices,
geographic information systems or image processing to discuss their ideas in a
challenging and interactive forum.

ECIR 2009, Workshop on Geographic Information on the Internet  (WGII) Toulouse,
France, April 6, 2009

Context & Topics of Interest
Finding geographically-based information constitutes a common use of Web search
engines, for a variety of user needs. With the rapid growth of the volume of
geographically-related information on the Web, efficient and adaptable ways of
tagging, browsing and accessing relevant documents still needs to be found.
Structuring and mashing-up geographic information from different Web data
sources is one appealing alternative to long term efforts of manually creating
large scale geographic resources such as The Alexandria Digital Library  or
Geonames , whose constructions are costly and not necessarily adapted to
specific applications.
Efficient automatic geographical information structuring methods involve coping
with a wide diversity and huge volumes of geographically relevant documents.
Consider Wikipedia (over 200,000 geo-referenced articles for the English
version), or Flickr (over 50 million geo-referenced pictures) or Yahoo! Trip
Planner (over 159,000 publicly available trip descriptions). These sites include
disparate text, images and geo- localisation information. Exploiting this
information requires mixing different competences: information retrieval and
ranking, natural language processing, image processing, geographic information
extraction? Past events, such as the GIR workshops or the LocWeb workshops
series, focused on geographic information retrieval (GIR), but many hard
research questions related to GIR remain unsolved. We will address the following
in this workshop:

- How to move from raw data to structured knowledge? How can we identify,
disambiguate, localize, categorize and rank geographic names?
- What are the best ways to process geographically relevant multimedia
documents? How to combine text, image and/or video analysis in coherent frameworks?
- How to exploit user contributed information? How to filter out noise introduce
and how to leverage information at a community level?
- How to adapt and/or personalize the presentation of results?

We solicit submissions addressing the following topics: 
Web-scale geographic information retrieval frameworks
-Geo-referenced image and video annotation and retrieval
-Ranking for geographical search
-Semi-automatic or automatic structuring of geographic information
-Location based services
-Indexing of geographically relevant multimedia documents
-Visualization of geographic information
-User studies in geographic information search
-Domain specific applications 

We target the edition of a journal Special Issue or of a book as a result of the
workshop.

Submission Instructions
Submissions must be written in English following the LNCS guidelines and must
not exceed 12 pages (for long papers) and 6 pages (for short papers) including
references and figures. All papers and posters will be refereed by at least two

Call Deadline: 30-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

This third edition will be celebrated as special session of IWANN 2009, and will
take place in Salamanca (Spain), in June 2009. 

Call for Papers

Aims and scope:
Formal Language Theory was born in the middle of 20th century as a tool for
modelling and investigating syntax of natural languages. After 1964, formal
language theory developed as a separate branch with specific problems,
techniques and results and with an internal self-motivated life. So, formal
languages, which started being a tool to be applied to natural languages, became
rapidly a theory that studied formal systems independently of possible
linguistic applications. On the other hand, classical formal language theory,
due to its abstract and formal properties, has been applied to a wide range of
fields (besides initial linguistic motivation): economic modelling,
developmental biology, cryptography, sociology... Non classical models of formal
languages present the same abstractness that has facilitate the application of
classical models to many issues, and, in addition, present, several advantageous
features: natural inspiration, parallelism, distribution, cooperation, etc.
Therefore, recently many researchers claim that application of non-classical
models of formal languages can provide approaches to linguistics that can
improve the description, analysis and processing of natural languages. In fact,
the aim of this workshop is to discuss the possible applications of
non-classical formal languages in linguistics.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different areas
that have in common the use of formal language theory to approach different
aspects of natural language.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Mathematical Linguistics
-  Linguistic Applications of Formal Languages
-  Formal Analysis of Linguistic Theories and Frameworks
-  Model-Theoretic and Proof-Theoretic Methods in Linguistics
-  Probabilistic and Statistical Models of Language
-  Linguistic Applications of FSA
-  Logics and Language

Submissions:
Submissions will be done by the IWANN submission procedure.
