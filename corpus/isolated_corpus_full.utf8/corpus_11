Seventh Biennial Summer School

EUROLAN 2005

 

THE MULTILINGUAL WEB:

RESOURCES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PROSPECTS

http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/eurolan2005/  

 

July 25 - August 6, 2005

"Babes-Bolyai" University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania

 

 

    A truly global society will rely heavily on access to information that
can accommodate multiple cultures and languages. To enable this, researchers
in language technology are developing resources and applications to support
a multilingual web that will ensure the requisite trans-lingual
capabilities.

    The EUROLAN 2005 summer school will provide two weeks of intensive study
of the technologies and resources currently under development to support
multilingual processing, as well as the applications that exploit them to
enable multilingual access to information disseminated via the web.
Internationally known scholars and researchers involved in leading-edge work
in relevant areas will serve as professors at the school, giving half- and
full-day seminars and hands-on labs to provide students with in-depth
understanding and experience. Topics to be covered in the school include the
following:

 

- creation and exploitation of multilingual resources, including corpora,
lexicons, wordnets, and ontologies;

- multilingual alignment of syntax, semantics, discourse, and other language
phenomena;

- annotation of various phenomena in multiple languages, including word
senses, time annotations, anaphora;

- annotation transfer, enabling importing in new languages of knowledge
encoded in the mark-up for English, etc.;

- cross-lingual applications, including machine translation, information
retrieval, extraction and summarization, document indexing, etc.;

- the multilingual "knowledge web", its philosophy, state of the art, needs,
and vision for the future.

        The venue of EUROLAN 2005 is Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in the heart of
Transylvania. An excursion to the medieval town of Sighisoara and Bran
("Dracula") Castle is planned for the weekend at the school's mid-point. 

        Whatever the venue, the EUROLAN summer schools are well known for
the degree of camaraderie that develops among students and professors alike
- just ask any previous participant! Students in the school learn an
enormous amount, but at the same time enjoy the warmth of new friendships
with both fellow students and professors.
