e' to industrial and post-industrial societies.

The goal of this workshop, hosted by the 37th Austrian Conference on Lingui=
stics (37. =D6sterreichische Linguistiktagung, 5 - 7 December 2009 in Salzb=
urg) is to bring together researchers of language contact and multilinguali=
sm working in different theoretical and methodological frameworks.=20

Call for Papers:

Topics of Interest:

- Contact induced language change;=20
- Diglossia, polyglossia and similar scenarios;
- Individual vs. social multilingualism;-
- The multilingual brain;
- Problems of standardization in multilingual settings;
- Syntax and pragmatics of code switching and code mixing;
- Mixed language vs. language mixing:=20
- Language death and ''linguicide'';
- Documentation of language contact.

Each presentation slot will be 45 min. (including 15 min. for discussion).=

sbg.ac.at or bernhard.poell@sbg.ac.at no later than 15 October 2009. The ab=
