2009 NIC Conference are:

- Intercultural ICT

These theme are to be taken in the two senses, the first being the sense of

aims to encourage scholars and researchers from different theoretical and 
practical backgrounds to discuss the current issues and prospects of 
intercultural communication (ICC). Emphasis will be placed on views that allow 
for an exchange of ideas and interaction between various practitioners and 
researchers of intercultural communication.

Besides the main theme, the conference committee invites papers that address 
any of the following themes:
