SIGIR 2007:  Call for papers for Doctoral Consortium

    The 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on
      Research and Development in Information Retrieval
         23-27 July 2007, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                  http://www.sigir2007.org

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new
research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques
in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). 

*Call for Papers for Doctoral Consortium*

The ACM SIGIR Doctoral Consortium provides doctoral students with a 
unique opportunity to have substantive interaction with other 
researchers regarding their proposed dissertation research.

The objectives of the Doctoral Consortium are: 

  *  To provide a forum where doctoral students can present and 
     discuss their proposed research with experienced IR researchers 
     the members of the Doctoral Consortium Program Committee. 

  *  To give students an opportunity to establish a supportive 
     community of other doctoral students at the same stage of their 
     dissertation research as themselves. 

The Consortium will take place on the same day as the Tutorials, 
with the format being: student presentations with plenary 
discussions, lunch, individual meetings with experienced researchers, 
and dinner. 

Prospective student attendees should have written, or be close to 
completing, a thesis proposal. Prior to submission, discussion of 
this with the students PhD advisor / supervisor should be held to 
ensure the student meets this criterion. It is also desirable that 
the student not to be so close to completion of their dissertation 
that discussion would have little or no impact on the dissertation 
research. 

Selection for attendance at the Doctoral Consortium will be based on
a written paper, singly authored by the student wishing to attend the 
Consortium. Abstracts of the papers will be published in the SIGIR 
Conference Proceedings. 

Papers must be submitted electronically, via the submission web page. 
We will accept papers only in PDF format. It is the responsibility of 
authors to ensure that their papers use no unusual format features 
and are printable on a standard printer. Submissions must arrive on 
or before March 11, 2007. 

Doctoral students who submit to the Consortium are permitted, and 
indeed encouraged, to submit a full SIGIR paper or poster on their 
research. However, acceptance for participation in the Consortium 
will be based solely on the paper submitted for the Consortium. 

SIGIR will provide travel grants for students attending the 
Consortium, which will cover registration for the Conference and part 
of the travel costs. 

Content guidelines

The Consortium submission paper will be the basis for detailed 
discussions at the Consortium, and to get the most out of the 
discussion, a paper should include the following: 

  *  Motivation for the proposed research 

  *  Background and related work (with key references) 

  *  Description of proposed research including main research questions 
  
  *  Research methodology and proposed experiments (where appropriate) 

  *  Particular issues highlighted for discussion. 

In addition, a one page appendix to the paper (placed after the 
references) should include the following: 

  *  A detailed statement by the student saying why he / she wants to 
     attend the Consortium.
 
  *  A statement by their advisor / supervisor saying how the student 
     would benefit by attending the Consortium. Advisors should also 
     state whether the student has written, or is close to completing, 
     a thesis proposal (or equivalent). 

All papers will be reviewed with respect to overall quality of 
presentation, the potential for future impact of the proposed PhD 
research on the field of Information Retrieval, and the likely benefit 
to the student of attending the Consortium. Given that the abstract 
will be published, the abstract will be critically reviewed.
