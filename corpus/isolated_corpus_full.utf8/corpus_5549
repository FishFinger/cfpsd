Meeting Description:

The workshop is organized as part of this year's Conference of the German S=
ociety for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL), hosted=
 by the Applied Computational Linguistics group in the Department of Lingui=
stics at Potsdam University. The GLDV Working Group on Hypermedia is offeri=
ng a one-day workshop dedicated to usability aspects for hypermedia systems=
 and applications in the E-Humanities (corpus retrieval frontends, web info=
rmation systems, community grids etc.).

Since Jakob Nielsen pointed out the main criteria for user-friendly hyperme=
dia systems - easy to learn, efficient to use, easy to remember, few errors=
, pleasant to use - in the mid-nineties, usability research is engaged in t=
he statistical investigation and empiric validation of ranking methods. One=
 goal is the improvement of usability on the internet, currently focusing o=
n up-to-date topics like Web 2.0 and multimodal interfaces.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum for researchers and practiti=
oners interested in hypermedia systems in the context of natural language p=
rocessing. By offering paper presentations (30 min.) and discussion panels,=
 we hope to stimulate and facilitate an active exchange on unique and inter=
disciplinary ideas, practices, and methods.
