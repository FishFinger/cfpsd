Meeting Description:

Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology (sfcm 2009)
http://sfcm2009.org
Workshop date: September 4, 2009
Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland
Submission deadline: March 1, 2009 

Call for Papers

From the point of view of computational linguistics, morphological resources are
the basis for all higher-level applications. This is especially true for
languages with a rich morphology like German. A morphology component should thus
be capable of analyzing single wordforms as well as whole corpora. For many
practical applications, not only morphological analysis, but also generation is
required, i.e., the production of surfaces corresponding to specific categories.

Apart from uses in computational linguistics, there are practical applications
that can benefit from morphological analysis and/or generation or even require
it, for example in text processing, user interfaces, or information retrieval.
These applications have specific requirements for morphological components,
including requirements from software engineering, such as programming interfaces
or robustness.

In 1994, the first Morpholympics, a competition between several systems for the
analysis and generation of German wordforms, took place at CLUE (Department of
Computational Linguistics at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg).

15 years later, some of the systems that participated in the Morpholympics still
exist and are being maintained. However, there are also new developments in the
field of computational morphology, for German and for other languages.
Unfortunately, the publications about morphologic analysis and generation are
spread over many different conferences and journals, so that it is difficult to
get an overview of the current state of the art and of the available systems. This
workshop tries to bring together researchers, developers, and maintainers of
morphology systems for German and of frameworks for computational morphology
from academia and industry.

This workshop concentrates on actual, working systems and frameworks of at least
prototype quality. To ensure fruitful discussions among workshop participants,
submissions on concrete morphology systems are preferrably for German;
submissions on morphological frameworks are relevant if the framework can be
used to implement components for different languages.

In contrast to, for example, Morphochallenge, this workshop focuses on systems
and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing linguistically
motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of linguistic categories.

The workshop has three main goals:
- To stimulate discussion among researchers and developers and to offer an
up-to-date overview of available systems for German morphology which provide
deep analyses and are suitable for generating specific wordforms.
- To stimulate discussion among developers of general frameworks that can be
used to implement morphological components for several languages.  
- To discuss aspects of evaluation of morphology systems and possible future
competitions or tasks, such as a new edition of the Morpholympics.

Topics
The topics of this workshop include both technical aspects, applications, and
uses of systems and frameworks for computational morphology. While purely
theoretical submissions may be relevant, the focus of the workshop is clearly on
actual, working systems and prototypes.

The workshop will mainly focus on German, but contributions for other languages
are encouraged in order to demonstrate open-source tools and runtime software
for full-scale morphologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Frameworks for developing morphological components.
- Open-source tools and resources for morphology.
- Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms, especially for
German.
- Suitability of morphological components for interactive use.
- Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with respect to
performance, quality, and coverage.
- Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance, hardware/software
requirements, resource usage.
- License models and legal aspects.

There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.

Submissions
We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages (including
references) or short papers of up to 10 pages. Long papers constitute an
excellent opportunity to publish citable, in-depth descriptions of systems and
frameworks. Submissions must be in English. Reviewing of papers will be
double-blind by the members of
the program committee, and all submissions will receive several independent
reviews. Papers submitted at review stage must not contain the authors' names,
affiliations, or any information that may disclose the authors' identity.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research at the
workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the workshop
by Springer in their series Communications in Computer and Information Science.

The papers must use the Springer LNCS format. We recommend to use the LaTeX2e
format. Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format guidelines. Papers must
be submitted electronically in PDF format. For paper submissions we use

Meeting Description:

On the occasion of the Third International Conference of the French Cognitive
Linguistics Association (AFLiCo 3) on "Grammars in construction(s)" 
University of Paris 10, Nanterre, France 27-29 May 2009
http://www.modyco.fr/aflico3/index_ang.html 

Jacques François (Professeur, Université de Caen, CRISCO, France)

We organize a thematic session on Usage-based linguistics: methodological
questions and quantitative aspects. 

Call for Papers

Although cognitive linguistics is intrinsically a usage-based linguistics, it
was enriched only recently by tools enabling the observation and the systematic
use of authentic data. Amongst the recent (and most fruitful) researches
specifically concerned with constructions, the work by Stefanowitsch and Gries,
whose purpose is to quantify the interaction between lexical items and
constructions, proved innovative and delivered empirical evidence for the notion
of construction. Among older works, some are still useful such as approaches in
cognitive modelling which stipulate that learning or acquisition is based on
instances which enable generalizations (see the work by R. Bod or in psychology
by P. Perruchet).
We can also mention the work by and around J. Bybee which delivers convincing
corpus-based evidence for the crucial role of usage in shaping and organizing
linguistic forms.

And in the paradigm of corpus-linguistics, one must keep in mind the distinction
established between corpus-based and corpus-driven analysis. The latter method
is likely to thouroughly account for the usage parameter (E. Tognini-Bonelli, 2001).
In short, the thematic session we propose is concerned with the phenomenon of
usage related to that of construction. It shall be the right place for
discussing various but complementary questions. 
Precisely, the participants are to produce methodological proposals on
identifying and extracting constructions from corpus, about the notion of usage
and the way to work at that parameter (in psychology, linguistics or computer
science), as well as at the quantitative aspects of extraction.

Topics such as the following ones may be tackled : 
- correlation or distinction between usage-based linguistics and
corpus-linguistics : in what sense and how do corpora represent usage ?
- the exemplar based approaches in acquisition or in other fields;
- the corpus-driven analyses and the notion of usage;
- work on collostructions and colligation;
- illustration of statistical models enabling the identification and counting of
constructions;
- didactic means devoted to get linguists used to statistical methods;
- computer strategies or software usable for the job of identifying or
extracting constructions

Submission Procedure
Abstracts (300 to 500 words) , will be sent via email as attachment (Ms-Word doc
or rtf, OpenOffice, PDF) to: 
dominique.legallois@unicaen.fr 
and  
jacques.francois@unicaen.fr

Please put in the subject line: 'abstract AFLICO Usage-based linguistics '
In the body of the mail, please specify:
- author(s)
- title
- affiliation of author(s)

Important Dates:
Submission deadline : February 15th 2009
Notification of acceptance : Early march 2009

Note that : 
- the whole thematic session will be evaluated by the scientific committee. 
- only five contributions will be selected
