Coherence in Spoken and Written Academic Discourse

Within the framework of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica
Europea held at Vilnius University, Lithuania, we would like to propose a
workshop on aspects of coherence in spoken and written academic discourse.
Coherence has been for a long time a topic of intense debate in the
international linguistic community. In recent years it has been possible to
witness a considerable shift in the ways coherence is understood, namely a =
shift
from a static text-based descriptive approach, according to which coherence=
 is
the product of textual connectivity and cohesion, to a more dynamic
understanding, according to which coherence is conceptualized as a potentia=
lly
variable cooperative achievement of the speaker/writer and the hearer/reade=
r and
can be seen as context-dependent, hearer/reader-oriented and
comprehension-based, interpretative notion (Bublitz 1999, Seidlhofer and
Widdowson 1997).=20

This approach stresses the collaborative nature of coherence (Tanskanen 200=
6:
170) and the dependence of discourse interpretation on the entire situation=
al
context, i.e. the linguistic co-text, the social and cultural environment,
communicative principles and conversational maxims, and the interpreter's
encyclopedic knowledge, serving to underscore that the deriving of coherenc=
e
from a discourse is a dynamic process which comes into being in the process=
 of
human interaction (T=E1rnyikov=E1 2002: 56). Since English has become the "=
lingua
franca" of the modern academic world, the  conceptualization of coherence a=
nd
research into coherence relations and related cohesion strategies in spoken=
 and
written academic discourse is considered relevant from a discourse analytic=
al,
socio-critical and pedagogical perspective. Interaction in academic discour=
se is
governed by the effort of the speakers/writers to present the results of th=
eir
research and persuade the  listeners/readers to accept their claims and
viewpoint, while relating their work to previous research (Hyland 2005).=20

The proposed workshop is intended to bring together researchers whose works=
 bear
on topics related to aspects of coherence on the ideational, interpersonal =
and
textual planes of academic discourse. One of the main goals of the workshop=
 is
to explore variation in coherence relations across different spoken and wri=
tten
academic genres. An additional aim of the workshop is to consider how coher=
ence
is achieved in non-native speaker's academic discourse.=20

Among the issues proposed to be addressed in this workshop are:

- Coherence relations, such as contrast/concession, result/inference,
cause-effect, etc.
- Reference strategies
- Stance markers
- Lexical cohesion
- Theme-rheme development
- Explicit and implicit signals of discourse organization
