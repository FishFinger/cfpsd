Meeting Description:

The Stockholm 2009 Metaphor Festival (SMF)
September 10 and 11 

Call for Papers

Deadline for abstract submission: 31 March 2009

The Stockholm Metaphor Festival is an annual two-day conference on the use of
figurative language, arranged by The English Department at Stockholm University.
It brings together researchers from a broad range of academic disciplines,
working within different theoretical and methodological paradigms, in a
creative, internationally oriented and friendly atmosphere. The importance of
figurative language is now generally recognized, and the Festival offers an
opportunity to present and learn about research findings concerning figures of
speech in different types of discourse, and their cognitive, cultural,
narrative, poetic, rhetorical, social or textual functions. Contributions to the
Festival can be about the literary or linguistic character and use of tropes -
metaphor, metonymy, simile, oxymoron, hyperbole, punning, and irony - or the
character and use of rhyme schemes and various types of parallelism, as well as
about communicatively effective interaction of different kinds of figurative
devices.  

Each talk is allotted 30 minutes at the Festival, roughly 20 minutes for the
presentation and 10 minutes for discussion. There is also a separate poster
session that can be visited by all participants in the Festival.  

Abstract Guidelines:
Abstracts should be written in English, and they are expected to be about 300 to
400 words long. The abstract should have a title, but the author's name,
academic affiliation, and email address should be indicated on a separate sheet,
where it should also be specified whether the abstract is intended as a basis
for a talk or a poster presentation. 

All abstracts should be emailed to Metaphorfestival@English.su.se .

Information about acceptances will be emailed by 30 April to all scholars
submitting an abstract.

A selection of papers from each Festival is published in a volume edited by
members of the organising committee.

Conference fee: 50 for early registration, by 31 July; 70 from 1 August.
