Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics;Phonology 

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2009 

Special Issue on the Phonetics-Phonology Interface

Veuillez voir la version fran√ßaise au site suivant :
http://www.sfu.ca/linguistics/research/cjl_cfp.html

Call for proposals for a thematic issue of the Canadian Journal of
Linguistics/Revue canadienne de linguistique exploring the
Phonetics-Phonology Interface.

The fundamental question of how autonomous phonetics and phonology are
continues to stimulate a diverse range of responses. As Kingston (2007)
observes "the field has reached no consensus about what the interface is,
nor has it even agreed that one exists at all."  The diverse complexity of
phonetic realization across languages, genres, contexts, and speakers
continues to challenge core issues:

  -  How are distinctive features defined?
  -  Is there a categorical unit of phoneme? 
  -  What is the relation between physical representations and mental
representations? 
  -  What properties of phonological systems lie outside of 'grounded'
phonology?
  -  What is the role of listener's percepts compared with speaker's goals?
  -  Along what dimensions and to what extent can phonological systems vary?
  -  Is the notion of phonological inventory relevant?
  -  What accounts for phonological patterns?
  -  Are there constraints on variability? If so, what drives such constraints?
  -  What motivates sound change? 
  -  Is diachronic change fundamentally different from synchronic patterning?  

Perspectives on these issues are highly divergent, and stem from a rich
complexity of domains of enquiry where functional explanation, perceptual
interpretation, processing factors, articulatory realization, phonological
behaviour, and frequency effects, among others, each contribute to
different facets of our understanding of phonetics, phonology, and their
interface in a grammar. 

Documentation of a broader diversity of languages and language families -
many critically endangered - has expanded the empirical database of what is
known about what properties languages commonly share and how languages can
differ.

Technological advances have had a profound impact on the methodologies of
both phonetic and phonological inquiry. 

The Theme underlying all these issues: How have these research results
contributed to advancing our insights into the essential classic question
"How abstract is phonology?"

The Call: We invite proposals for full papers that explore any of these
complex dimensions of "the interface" between phonetics and phonology.

Proposals should be one page in length, with representative data and
references on a second page. Font size = 12 point. Authors are encouraged
to use unicode fonts.

CJL style guidelines can be found at: http://www.utpjournals.com/cjl/cjl.html 

Proposals for papers in English or French are welcome.

The guest editors of this special issue are Kimary Shahin, Simon Fraser
University and Patricia A. Shaw, University of British Columbia.

Proposals, and any queries, should be sent to Kimary Shahin at kns3"at"sfu.ca

Deadline for receipt of proposals: 30 June 2009.

Primary criteria for selection of a subset of these proposals for
submission of a full paper to the externally refereed editorial process of
CJL/RCL will be based on originality of data and analysis, as well as on
the depth and breadth of theoretical discussion and implications.

Authors will be notified by August 15, 2009 of the results of this process.
