Description
===========

According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies are
one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The Computer
Linguistics - Applications Workshop is in part a response to the
fast-paced progress in the area.

The workshop will focus on the applied aspect of Computer Linguistics,
i.e. the practical outcome of modeling human language.  

By locating the workshop within the framework of the
IMCSIT conference we hope to initiate dialog between researchers
involved in Computer Linguistics and other areas of information
technology to build bridges between disciplines and find a way of
applying CL-based tools in other areas. In this spirit, we invite
papers that present research on all aspects of Natural Language
Processing such as (this list is not exhaustive):

    * machine translation and translation aids
    * proofing tools
    * semantic ontologies in computer linguistics
    * lexical resources
    * POS-tagging
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora
    * ambiguity resolution
    * parsing issues
    * information retrieval
    * text classification

In addition to theoretical papers, we invite all participants to
present practical demonstrations of existing tools. We require the
papers to include a section describing an existing tool (or a
prototype), which demonstrates the theory.

We intend the workshop to be a demo session. In the first part of the
workshop the authors will shortly (no longer than 5 minutes each)
demonstrate their tools to the audience. For the second part we will
arrange environment in which authors will be able to present their
software and discuss it with other conference participants.

The best demonstrations will be elected to be shown to the audience of
the conference at a plenary session.
