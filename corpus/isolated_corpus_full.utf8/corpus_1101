Subject: Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a More Comprehensive View of Austronesian Morphosyntax 

	

Full Title: Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a More Comprehensive View of
Austronesian Morphosyntax 

Date: 13-Sep-2007 - 15-Sep-2007
Location: Berlin, Germany 
Contact Person: Hans-Martin Gaertner
Meeting Email: bfe@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Language Family(ies): Austronesian 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

The Conference 'Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a more comprehensive
view of Austronesian morphosyntax is aimed at bringing together researchers
focusing on aspects of Austronesian morphosyntax other than grammatical
relation, voice and transitivity marking. There will also be a one day special
session on 'Sentence Types and Speech Act Marking in Austronesian Languages.' 

Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a More Comprehensive View of Austronesian
Morphosyntax

Second Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 Main Session (13-14 Sep 2007):
Beyond 'Focus' and Ergativity: Towards a more comprehensive view of
Austronesian morphosyntax

Austronesian languages are justly famous for their unusual systems of
grammatical relation, voice and transitivity marking. Not surprisingly then
the large majority of studies published on aspects of Austronesian
morphosyntax deal with this subject area. Concomitantly, there is a
tendency to overlook the fact that languages of this family show a host of
other morphosyntactic phenomena which pose fascinating problems for
typology and grammatical theory. These include:

- a large variety of multi-predicate constructions, including serial verbs,
complex predicates and auxiliary or ''pseudo-verb'' constructions;
- morphosyntactic restrictions on clause chaining;
- classifier systems of various degrees of complexity;
- clausal and phrasal constituent structures which show both
configurational and non-configurational properties;
- complex systems of directional particles and verbs;
- morphologically marked modality distinctions (realis vs. irrealis);
- large inventories of clitics with heterogeneous functions and formal
properties;
- gerunds and other types of nominalizations;
- different types of optional plural marking;
-etc.

We invite proposals for contributions to any of these and related topics.
Studies on these topics often will also have implications for the
well-known issues regarding the analysis of grammatical relations, voice
and transitivity, and contributors are welcome to make these implications
explicit. However, the main topic of the paper should be clearly outside,
and go beyond, the 'canonic' topics just mentioned.

The time slot for contributions is 30 minutes plus 10 minutes for
discussion. There will be no parallel sessions and thus only 14 slots for
the papers in addition to the invited papers.

Invited speakers are:
Isabelle Bril (CNRS, Paris)
Daniel Kaufman (Cornell University)
Paul Kroeger (GIAL, Dallas)
Ulrike Mosel (University of Kiel)

There will be an additional lecture by:
Malcolm Ross (ANU Canberra)

Special Session (15 Sep 2007):
Sentence Types and Speech Act Marking in Austronesian Languages

We invite proposals focusing on sentence types and speech act marking in
Austronesian languages. We welcome talks addressing the particular
grammatical means (intonation, word order, particles etc.) a particular
language or group of languages uses for distinguishing sentence types,
where by ''sentence type'' we mean both the major and minor illocutionary
force indicating types (declarative, interrogative, imperative,
exclamative) as well as types of subordinate clauses (relative,
conditional, concessive etc.). Analyses of concomitant semantic and
pragmatic peculiarities are equally welcome.

There will be 7 slots for 30 + 10 minute contributions (talk + discussion).

Deadline for electronic submission of anonymous abstracts (500 words max +
examples and references, if any; abstract submission as PDF): 28 Feb 2007

Abstracts should be sent to: bfe@zas.gwz-berlin.de.

Submission is limited to one single-authored and one co-authored abstract
per person. The body of your e-mail should include title of contribution,
name, affiliation, and contact address. It should be indicated there whether
the abstract is contributed to the main or special session.

The conference website will later be available at
http://zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/bfe07.
