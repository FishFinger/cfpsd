Meeting Description:

Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation, Disambiguation and
Applications (MWE 2009)
Workshop at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference (Singapore), 06 August 2009 

Call for papers:

Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) are an indispensable part of natural languages and
appear steadily on a daily basis, both new and already existing but paraphrased.
Thus, the automated processing of MWEs is important for many natural language
applications. The meaning of MWEs can be either motivated or arbitrary. Native
speakers master most MWEs, while learners of a foreign language have to learn
MWEs by heart. The interpretation of MWEs poses a major challenge for automated
analysis helping both groups easily master MWEs.

The growing interest in MWEs in the NLP community has led to many specialized
workshops held every year since 2001 in conjunction with ACL, EACL and LREC;
there have been also two recent special issues on MWEs published by leading
journals: the International Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation, and
the Journal of Computer Speech and Language.

As a result of the overall progress in the field, the time has come to move from
basic preliminary research to actual applications in real-world NLP tasks.
Following this trend, the LREC-MWE'08 focused on gathering resources and
creating a common repository in order to rank MWE candidates and facilitate
further research.

Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

In MWE'09 we are interested in the overall process of dealing with MWEs, asking
for original research related (but not limited) to the following four
fundamental topics.

Workshop Topics
(1) Identification. Identification is a major problem for MWEs. The MWE
identification task is to determine whether a MWE is used non-compositionally
(figuratively) or compositionally (literally) in a particular context. The
identification of MWEs by automated means is a difficult task, as it does not
suffice to store the MWE into a dictionary database. Rule-based (morphosyntactic
rules) and/or statistical approaches may be needed to identify MWEs in context.

(2) Interpretation. Semantic interpretation of MWEs, particularly noun compounds
and determinerless prepositional phrases, is the task of determining the
implicit semantic relation holding between the MWE's sub-components. This
specific area is inviting research on (linguistically) identifying the semantic
relations (SRs) and automatic SR interpretation in MWEs. The relation
inventories used can be of different granularity and dependent on the particular
type of MWE construction. In some cases, MWE's semantics can be also specified
in terms of a suitable paraphrase.

(3) Disambiguation. Disambiguation (Semantic classification) is the task of
specifying the semantics of MWEs based on an inventory of semantic relations. It
tends to presuppose the ability to classify the (degree of) compositionality of
MWEs and applies only to compositional MWEs. The aim is to specify the semantics
of MWEs in terms of predefined semantic categories, e.g., in WordNet.

(4) Applications. Identifying MWEs in context and understanding their syntax and
semantics is important for many natural language applications, including but not
limited to question answering, machine translation, information retrieval,
information extraction, and textual entailment. Still, despite the growing
research interest, there are not enough successful applications in real NLP
problems, which we believe is the key for the advancement of the field. 

Submission Information
Submissions must describe substantial, original, and unpublished work.
Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength,
significance and relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.
Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages in total (references included)
and will be presented orally. The deadline for paper submission is May 1, 2009
(GMT + 8).
The official style files for ACL/IJCNLP 2009 are available at:
http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/. The workshop
submissions should use the same formatting guidelines. 

Format
Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009
proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files
tailored for this year's conference, which will be available on the conference
website. All submissions must conform to the official ACL-IJCNLP 2009 style
guidelines to be announced in the conference website and they must be electronic
in PDF.
As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, e.g.,"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided.
Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".
Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. 

Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: May 1, 2009
Notification of acceptance of papers: June 1, 2009
Camera-ready copies due: June 14, 2009

Meeting Description:

Workshop on Extracting and Using Constructions in NLP
http://www.sics.se/~mange/construct2009/
Thursday, May 14, Odense, Denmark 

First Call for Papers

A construction is a recurring, or otherwise noteworthy congregation of
linguistic entities. Examples include collocations ("hermetically sealed"),
(idiomatic) expressions with fixed constituents ("kick the bucket"), expressions
with (semi-)optional constituents ("hungry as a X"), and sequences of
grammatical categories ([det][adj][noun]). As can be seen by these examples,
constructions are a diverse breed, and what constitutes a linguistic
construction is largely an open
question.

Despite (or perhaps due to) the inherent vagues of the concept, constructions
enjoy increasing interest in both theoretical linguistics and in natural
language processing. A symptom of the former is the Construction grammar
framework, and a symptom of the latter is the growing awareness of the impact of
constructions on
different kinds of information access applications. Constructions are an
interesting phenomenon because they constitute a middleway in the syntax-lexicon
continuum, and because they show great potential in tackling infamously
difficult NLP tasks.

We encourage submissions in all areas of constructions-based research, with
special focus on:
- Theoretical discussions on the nature and place within linguistic theory of
the concept of linguistic constructions.
- Methods and algorithms for identifying and extracting linguistic constructions.
- Uses and applications of linguistic constructions (information access,
sentiment analysis, tools for language learning etc.).

Submission Procedure:
Submission is now open at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=construct09. Submissions
should not exceed 6 pages, and should use the EACL style files available at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors. Reviewing will not be blind, and
authors will be given a chance to revise their papers and discuss comments with
the reviewers before final submission.

Proceedings will be published as a SICS technical report.

Important Dates:
Submission deadline: April 1
First review: April 15
Discussion period: April 15-April 22
Final papers due: May 1
Workshop: May 14

Location: Nodalida 2009 (http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/nodalida2009/),Odense, Denmark.
