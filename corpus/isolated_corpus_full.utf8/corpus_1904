Full Title: Workshop on Referential Entity Resolution 

Date: 15-Jan-2008 - 17-Jan-2008
Location: Chennai, India 
Contact Person: Sobha L
Meeting Email: sobha@au-kbc.org

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description

We plan to organize an International Workshop on Referential Entities Resolution
at Chennai, India, from 15th to 17th of January, 2008. This is organized jointly
by AU-KBC Research Centre, Anna University, Chennai and Department of Computer
and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad. In this event we would like
to bring to the audience both the Computational and Theoretical aspects of
Entities Resolution in English and other European languages as also in Indian
languages. In the Indian language scenario, not much work has been done on
referential entities from the computational point of view, although a lot of
work has gone on from a theoretical point of view. 

Research and development in Natural Language Processing has been going on in the
Indian language context for the last two decades. Many areas such as Part of
Speech tagging, NP chunking etc have been taken up in many Indian languages. But
there is very little work being done in the area of referential entities.
Referential entities play a major role in understanding a language and resolving
references is very important in many of the applications such as question
answering and machine translation. 

Cohesion in a text is maintained by referential entities such as pronominals,
reflexives and ellipsis. Resolving such references has been considered a
research area both in formal and computational linguistics. Though substantial
work has been done on referential entities in European languages from the
computational point of view, very little work has been done in South Asian
languages, especially in Indian Languages. Theoretical aspects of referential
entities have been worked out extensively in both European and South Asian
languages. 

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers working in Theoretical and
Computational aspects on to a single platform to share their interests in entity
resolution which will further help in this area of research. 

Paper Submission 

Both Theoretical and Computational aspect of Entity Resolution papers can be
submitted. 

Papers have to be written in English. There are two categories of papers: long
and short depending on the review. Maximum length of a paper can be up to 8
pages  (including references, figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be
published in the workshop proceedings. 

The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX or MS Word using suggested
styles/templates and submitted in pdf format. Reviewing will be blind. The draft
papers should not contain any information that can identify the authors. (Kindly
visit the website for style sheets. The website will be up soon.) 

Important Dates 

Paper Submission Deadline: October 15, 2007 
Notification of Paper Acceptance: October 30, 2007 
Camera Ready Submission Deadline: November 15, 2007
