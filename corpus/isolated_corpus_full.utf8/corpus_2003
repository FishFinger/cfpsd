Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Malaysia, 4-7 January 2008
http://www.SustainabilityConference.com

This Conference aims to develop a holistic view of sustainability, in which environmental, cultural and economic issues are inseparably interlinked. It will work in a multidisciplinary way, across diverse fields and taking varied perspectives in order to address the fundamentals of sustainability.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Papers submitted for the Conference proceedings will be peer-refereed and published in print and electronic formats in the International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 13 October 2007. Proposals are reviewed within four weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.SustainabilityConference.com.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Malaysia in January 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Wan Izatul Asma Wan Talaat, Ph.D
Universiti Malaysia Terengganu
