Workshop Description

The workshop on BioCreative II.5 will be held in Madrid at the CNIO
during October 7th and 9th, 2009. It will focus on the tasks created
for the challenge, specifically the extraction of protein-protein
interactions (PPIs), with the background of creating structured
annotations (SDAs, structured digital abstracts) for full-text papers.
These PPIs were generated by the paper authors themselves and MINT
database curators (a PPI DB). There will be four invited speakers
discussing various topics relevant to Information Extraction in Text
Mining and the topic of digital annotations and meta-services in
Bioinformatics.

The workshop will begin after a possible special session in the
morning and will cover presentations from seven to nine participant
systems from the challenge, the result evaluation, an inter-annotator-
and curator to author-agreement study, the SDAs and the FEBS Letters
Experiments, and a talk about the BioCreative Meta-Server, as well as
some plans on the future of BioCreative (BC III). This means we will
continue in the tradition of former BioCreative challenges and - much
like the CASP challenges in Structural Biology - present the final
results of the participants during the workshop.

Given the topic of the SDAs and online digital annotation, we are also
having a special session on this topic the morning before the actual
workshop. This "round table" should cover the topic of electronic/
structured annotations on publications from the viewpoints of the most
important stakeholders: the academic world, (pharma) industry, the
publishers, and the databases. We intend to have at least one
prominent speaker from each of these areas followed by a discourse
about how all stakeholders can cooperate to overcome issues and
achieve the necessary requirements for creating and maintaining an
infrastructure to promote digital annotations.
