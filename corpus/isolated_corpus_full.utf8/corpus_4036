research in a friendly environment. As with last year, we are combining the
conference with the Aston Corpus Symposium, which will take place on the
following day. Postgraduates will thus have the opportunity to hear experts talk
about their past and current projects.

. The preferred file formats are .doc and .pdf.

Presenters will also be invited to submit a 3,000-word conference paper to be
published in the online conference proceedings.

Location: Lisbon, Portugal 
Contact Person: Teresa Brocardo
Meeting Email: grato@fcsh.unl.pt
Web Site: http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/grato 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The International Conference on Grammar and Text - GRATO - will take place in

Sociais e Humanas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (FCSH-UNL)
Av. De Berna, 26-C 1069-061, Lisboa. 

Call for Papers

The GRATO Conference aims at contributing to a broad and coherent approach of
grammatical phenomena and their functioning in texts and discourses. 
The recently created 'Grammar and Text' group of CLUNL develops a linguistic
research that relates different perspectives and theoretical frameworks -
synchronic and diachronic, on morphology, semantics, text theory, discourse
analysis - and the Conference will hopefully provide the discussion of new and
enlightening proposals. 

The interaction of grammatical, textual and discursive phenomena will be given
priority as well as the complementation of different theoretical approaches and
methodologies, aiming at the construction of accurate descriptions and adequate
explanatory hypotheses.

Papers are invited on the following areas and topics*:
(1) Grammar
Marking of tense, aspect and modality; forms and constructions;
compositionality; polysemy; grammaticalization; lexicalisation.
(2) Text, Discourse and Pragmatics
Text genre; text construction; argumentation; compositionality.
Interdiscursivity; discourse devices; construction of meaning in context.
(3) Grammar, Text and Discourse
Studies relating (specific) grammatical phenomena and their functioning in
(specific) textual and / or discursive contexts.
(*Please note that the list of topics is not exhaustive.)
Working languages of the Conference:
Besides Portuguese, the Conference will have as working languages English,
Spanish and French.
