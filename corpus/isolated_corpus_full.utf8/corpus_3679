The 6th International Workshop on
Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science (NLPCS 2009)

6-7 May 2008, Milan Italy



 http://www.iceis.org/Workshops/nlpcs/nlpcs2009-cfp.htm



In conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Enterprise
Information Systems (ICEIS 2009)



Co-Chairs

Bernadette Sharp
Staffordshire University
United Kingdom
B.Sharp@staffs.ac.uk

Michael Zock
CNRS, LIF, Marseille
France

Aim of the Workshop



The aim of this workshop is to foster interactions among researchers
and practitioners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) working within
the paradigm of Cognitive Science.  Research into NLP involves
concepts and methods from many fields including artificial
intelligence, linguistics, computational linguistics, statistics,
computer science, and most importantly cognitive science. Because it
is impossible to cover all aspects of NLP this workshop emphasises the
contribution of cognitive science to language processing, including
conceptualisation, representation, discourse processing, meaning
construction, ontology building, and text mining.



Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



=95 Computational Models of NLP
=95 Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
=95 Evolutionary NLP
=95 Situated (embodied) NLP
=95 Multimodality in speech / text processing
=95 Text Summarization and Information Extraction
=95 Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
=95 Multi-Lingual Processing
=95 Pragmatics and NLP
=95 Speech Processing
=95 Tools and Resources in NLP
=95 Ontologies
=95 Text Mining
=95 Electronic Dictionaries
=95 Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives:
full automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT),
semi-automated processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs
assisting people in their tasks), simulation of human cognitive
process.



Submission of Papers



Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation
in any of the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be
accepted, and the length of the paper should not exceed 10 pages (5000
words). Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex
format) are available at the ICEIS web site
http://www.iceis.org/Submission_Guidelines.htm. Postscript/RTF
versions of the manuscript should be submitted thru ICEIS web-based
paper submission procedure.

Language and Space: a two-level semantic approach based on principles
of ontological engineering



The situated interpretation of natural language concerning space,
spatial relationships and spatial activities is a complex problem
spanning contributions from several disciplines. Space plays a central
role in many theories of cognition and the spatial language observed
in actual contexts of use is extremely flexible.  In this talk, I
present a two-level semantic-based approach to the interpretation of
spatial language, showing how it is beneficial to distinguish a
shallow semantics motivated primarily from grammatical evidence from a
context semantics for expressing situated spatial interpretations. I
show on the basis of examples just why this is necessary and how
adopting modern principles of ontological engineering can help.
Several potential applications will also be suggested drawing on our
ongoing work on natural language generation and analysis in dialogic
contexts.  The general conclusion that the talk will motivate is that
it is beneficial to cleanly separate the linguistic semantics of space
from the non-linguistic, situation-specific interpretation of space.
It is interesting, therefore, to consider the extent to which this may
also be true of other domains.



Workshop Format

The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations of
previously submitted papers that went through a double peer review
process. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the form
of a book.
