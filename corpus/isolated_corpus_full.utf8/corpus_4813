Meeting Description:

After two very successful events, Aston Corpus Symposium returns for its third
year in 2009, bringing together experts in various corpus-related fields. As in
2008, the Symposium will be preceded by the Aston Corpus Conference for
Postgraduate Researchers, which enables postgraduates to present their
corpus-related research in a friendly environment. 

Call for Papers: Deadline 20th April 2009

Aston Corpus Conference for Postgraduate Researchers,
21 May 2009

Sponsored by ISLS
Institute for the Study of Language and Society,
School of Languages and Social Sciences,
Aston University, Birmingham, UK
http://corpus.aston.ac.uk/postgraduate_conference.html

As we received many more abstracts than expected this year and the abstracts
were of a very high standard, we have decided to hold a poster session in
addition to the presentations at the Aston Corpus Conference for Postgraduate
Researchers 2009. We are therefore delighted to open a call for additional
posters and are currently accepting submissions. In addition to new submissions
for posters, we also invite all presenters whose abstracts have already been
accepted to display posters and to take this opportunity to chat informally to
other participants about their work.

New submissions for posters, in the form of an abstract written in English, of
max 300 words (with bibliographical references) should be sent by 20 April 2009
to tanguaye@aston.ac.uk. The preferred file formats are .doc and .pdf. Author's
name, affiliation, and contact details should be provided in a separate
attachment. Posters can focus on any corpus-related topic. 

Those students who have already been accepted to present at the conference will
not need to apply separately, but should inform us by 20 April if they do want
to present a poster.  Authors of accepted posters will be notified by 1 May 2009.

The objective of the Corpus Conference for Postgraduate Researchers, organized
by the ACORN project team of the School of Languages and Social Sciences at
Aston University, is to enable postgraduates to present their corpus-related
research in a friendly environment.

Aston Corpus Conference for Postgraduate Researchers,
will be followed by the Aston Corpus Symposium: Friday 22 May 2009

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
