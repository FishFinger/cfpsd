CALL FOR PAPERS

AISB SYMPOSIUM ON MULTIMODAL OUTPUT GENERATION (MOG 2008)
3 and 4 April 2008, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK

http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/~ivdsluis/mog2008/


SYMPOSIUM PURPOSE

An important aspect of the new generation of intelligent systems is the =
possibility to employ more than one output modality when interacting =
with the user. A quick and successful interaction is expected when, for =
instance, the system's output is presented to the user via =
multimedia/hypermedia in which text and graphics are merged, or by a =
conversational agent that combines the use of speech and gesture. In =
such multimodal systems sophisticated specifications are needed to =
combine the different output modalities in such a way that each bit of =
information is presented in the most appropriate manner (i.e., the =
system should select the most suitable modalities and modality =
combinations to convey information to the user).

The AISB symposium MOG 2008 aims to bring work on multimodal output =
generation from different disciplines together to establish common =
ground and discuss possible future collaborations. Besides contributions =
from research fields such as multimodal language generation and embodied =
conversational agents, we would like to bring in an additional angle by =
investigating how research on multimodal output generation can benefit =
from a non-engineering perspective on multimodality. For example, how =
can research done in psychology and cognitive sciences, related to =
understanding how humans perceive and process multimodal information, be =
properly formalized for the purposes of intelligent multimodal output =
generation? And to what extent is it possible to formalize existing =
theories about how meaning is made in multimodal communication (the =
semiotic perspective, represented by our guest speaker Prof. Eija =
Ventola) and use that for generating more meaningful multimodal output =
in the context of intelligent systems?

Thus, we invite technically oriented contributions as well as work in =
the area of human communication, such as cognitive models of multimodal =
communication and interaction. This way, we hope to combine an =
AI/engineering perspective with input from other disciplines such as =
linguistics and psychology, providing a forum where international =
researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds can exchange ideas =
on multimodal output generation and engage in scientific research =
collaboration.

MOG 2008 is a follow-up of MOG 2007, the workshop on Multimodal Output =
Generation organized on January 25-26, 2007, at the University of =
Aberdeen.


SYMPOSIUM FORMAT

The symposium will take place in two consecutive days. Note that this is =
provisional depending on the number of submissions. Apart from the talks =
in which the participants present their work there will be central =
discussions that should result in useful strategies for future work.

All accepted papers will also have a poster space in the main hall at =
the conference on the same day as their paper presentation, to give a =
chance for questions and interaction between different symposia. There =
will be opportunities to show demos during the AISB poster sessions; see =
Call for Demo's below.


SYMPOSIUM TOPICS

We welcome submissions on issues such as modality choice, integration of =
output modalities, and meaning representation for multimodal output =
generation, where natural language (in the form of either text or =
speech) is one of the modalities. We aim to have a varied programme that =
reflects the different research fields involved in multimodal output =
generation. Possible topics are listed below, but this list is not =
intended to be exhaustive.

     * task-based modality choice (domain and data dependencies)
     * user-based modality choice (constraints, preferences and =
expertise)
     * cross-references between modalities (e.g., text and graphics)
     * dependencies between modalities (e.g., speech, mimics and =
gestures)
     * relation between input and output modalities
     * integration of modalities (models, levels, dependencies)
     * cognitive models for processing multimodal information
     * computational models for multimodal output generation
     * models of modality integration based on multimodal discourse =
analysis
     * usability and evaluation of existing models
     * knowledge representation for multimodal output generation
     * evaluation of (methods for generating) multimodal output
     * development of multimodal corpora from a generation perspective


INVITED SPEAKERS

Justine Cassell (Northwestern University, USA)=20
Eija Ventola (University of Helsinki, Finland)=20
Michelle Zhou (IBM Watson Research Center, USA)


PAPER SUBMISSION

We invite both long papers describing mature research (max. 8 pages) and =
short papers (max. 4 pages) describing plans, ideas and prototypes, =
which could invoke discussion and questions to be addressed in the =
future.

Accepted papers will be published in the AISB proceedings, with an ISBN =
number. Authors must sign a non-exclusive copyright declaration which =
gives AISB the right to publish the paper, but does not prevent the =
author from also publishing it in other venues after.

We intend to publish a special issue journal or book collection (e.g., =
LNCS or LNAI) based on a selection of the best papers from MOG 2007 and =
MOG 2008.

Paper formatting instructions and templates can be downloaded here:
http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb08/download.html

Papers can be submitted by e-mail to: mog2008<at>ewi.utwente.nl =
(Substitute @ sign for <at>)


IMPORTANT DATES

     * Submission of papers: January 18, 2008
     * Notification: February 15, 2008
     * Final paper deadline: February 29, 2008
     * Symposium dates: April 3-4, 2008

(Note that the symposium dates are provisional, subject to the number of =
final accepted papers.)


CALL FOR DEMOS FOR HIGHSCHOOL VISIT

Some schoolkids (15-16 yrs old) are visiting Aberdeen University on =
April 3rd. To make these students enthusiastic about AI, the AISB =
organisers solicit proposals for interactive AI related demos. A small =
number of demos will be run at a few stations, with only a couple of =
kids visiting one station at any one time.

Demos will take place during the lunchbreak/poster session in the main =
hall of the convention, and will also be available to the convention =
delegates.

Please send demo proposals to aisb08@aisb.org.uk by February 29th.
