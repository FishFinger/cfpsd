Meeting Description:

The fifth edition of the Conference on Semantics and Modelisation (JSM07).
The goal of the conference is to promote research on the formalisation of linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal models. 

Journées Sémantique et Modélisation, JSM 07
March 29-30 2007
UMR7023, CNRS & Université Paris 8 Vincennes/Saint-Denis (France)

http://semantique.free.fr/jsm07/

First call for papers

The GDR Sémantique et Modélisation (CNRS) and the UMR 7023 (CNRS &
University Paris 8) organize the fifth edition of the Conference on
Semantics and Modelisation (JSM07). The conference will be held in
Paris, on March 29-30, 2006. (The conference will be preceded by a 3
day school in formal semantics, on March 26-28, with courses given in
French.) 

The goal of the conference is to promote research on the formalisation
of linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal
models. In view of the development of corpus-based research in
semantics and related fields, proposals articulating the use of
corpora and representational problems in semantics and pragmatics are
particularly welcome. 

Topics:

We invite abstracts that address any problem in the modeling of
linguistic meaning and interpretation. This includes but is not
limited to the following topics: 

- syntax / semantics interface,
- logical formalization,
- tense and aspect,
- lexical meaning,
- functional words (determiners, pronouns, etc.),
- information structure,
- presuppositions and implicatures,
- speech acts,
- discourse relations in text and dialogue.

Submission Conditions:

Abstracts must be anonymous. They should be 2 pages long including
references, examples and figures. They should have a 1 inch margin on
all four sides and use at least a 11 points font. Files may be in
plain text, PDF, RTF or MS Word. Names and affiliations should be
indicated in the body of the message. Proposals should be sent at
jsm07{at}free.fr no later than January 5, 2007. Contact
jsm07{at}free.fr for information.  (Replace {at} with @ in the
address)

Recursion in Human Languages -  Final Call for Paper

Date: 27-Apr-2007 - 29-Apr-2007 
Location: Normal, Illinois, USA 
Contact Person: Daniel Everett (dlevere@ilstu.edu)

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics

Call Deadline: 20-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

Recursion on Human Languages will feature presentations that address the typology, psychology, formalization, and grammatical manifestations of recursion in human languages.

Recursion in Human Languages 

In an important paper, Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002) state the following about the narrow faculty of language (FLN): ''We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).'' 

As interesting as this claim might be, it is difficult to evaluate it for various reasons. For example, there is first the fact that recursion has a long and yet often unclear history in the development of formal linguistics (Tomalin (2006)). How is recursion defined? Second, the question arises as to where recursion must manifest itself in FLN. In the morphology? In the phonology? In the syntax? In the semantics? In all components of the grammar? Third, there is the empirical issue as to whether the claim above is in fact true. Is recursion found in all languages? Is it distributed throughout grammars in the same way in all languages? 

As a start towards addressing these and other fundamental questions about the nature of recursion in human languages, the Department of Linguistics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and Illinois State University are sponsoring a conference from April 27-29, 2007, at the campus of Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. Invited speakers for this conference are (topics are listed, rather than actual titles of presentations): 

-Prof. Aravind Joshi (University of Pennsylvania) - ' Uniform and non-uniform recursion 
-Prof. Edward Gibson (MIT) - 'The psychology of recursion' 
-Prof. Marianne Mithun (UCSB) - 'The typology of recursion' 
-Prof. D. Robert Ladd (Edinburgh) - What would 'recursion' mean in phonology?' 
-Prof. Daniel L. Everett (ISU) - 'Cultural constraints on recursion' 
-Prof. Alec Marantz (MIT) - 'Recursion in morphology' 
-(tentative) Prof. W. Tecumseh Fitch (St. Andrews) - 'The evolution of recursion' 

In addition to these invited talks, we would like to invite abstracts for up to sixteen additional talks on recursion. Abstracts may be up to 500 words in length and may address any aspect of recursion, e.g. its history, its formal nature, unusual distributions or manifestations of recursion in specific languages, etc. Abstracts must be received by November 20, 2006. Authors will be notified on abstract decisions by December 20, 2006. A webpage for this conference will be announced soon. 

Please send abstracts and any questions regarding this conference to:
