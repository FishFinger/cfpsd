3rd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009

November 12-13, 2009, Hyatt Regency, Jeju Island, South Korea
http://lbm2009.biopathway.org

LBM is a unique interdisciplinary forum that brings together researchers in biology, chemistry, medicine, public health and informatics to discuss and exploit cutting edge language technology. Language, in its many forms, is the universal means to represent, question, and convey knowledge. Likewise applied technologies such as translation, summarization and information extraction are key technologies for supporting scientific research and healthcare provision. The automation of all these tasks is advancing our ability to discover new knowledge.

Despite these advances the envelope for these technologies is constantly being challenged by user demands and interdisciplinary work, both leading into sustained evolution of language technology.  All the communities involved profit from exchange about progress, but fail to efficiently exploit the approaches from complementary scientific disciplines, although such synergistic interactions are potentially the richest source for significant advancements. More interdisciplinary work is required to efficiently manage data and knowledge.  

The International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009 is the next opportunity for interdisciplinary interaction. LBM was established in 2005 and the remit of this event remains highly relevant today. The symposium focuses on the languages that are in active use for biology and medicine. We call for outstanding contributions to, but not limited to, the topics listed below:

    * Natural language: text mining, retrieval and managements;
    * Ontology language: semantic indexing, ontology construction, induction and management;
    * Logic language: knowledge representation;
    * Sequence language: RNA structure prediction, protein domain prediction;
    * Database language: database interface, query language;
    * Visualization language: information visualization, molecular visualization;
    * Image language: image indexing and retrieval

 
Important dates:
 
    * Paper Submission Deadline: August 31, 2009
    * Paper Acceptance Notification: September 30, 2009
    * Camera Ready Version Due: October 18, 2009
    * Symposium Dates: November 12-13, 2009 

Papers focusing on application aspects of languages in biology, chemistry, medicine, public health as well as theoretical aspects are welcome.

LBM 2009 will consist of oral papers and poster presentations, invited speeches and a panel discussion. In addition to the online conference proceedings whose publication in a journal is currently under discussion, extended versions of selected oral paper presentations will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

This year's symposium will be held on the beautiful volcanic resort island of Jeju in South Korea, a short 1 hour flight from Seoul. The island is well known for its scenic beaches, waterfalls, cliffs and caves that lie in harmony, as well as the mild temperature throughout the year. It also contains the UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site entitled Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes.
 
Program Chairs: Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann and Nigel Collier
General Chairs: Jong C. Park and Limsoon Wong
