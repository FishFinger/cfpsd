Location: Moscow, Russia 
Contact Person: Olga Svarnik
Meeting Email: org@cogsci2008.ru
Web Site: http://www.cogsci2008.ru 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description:

The conference aims at organizing a multidisciplinary forum for researchers
exploring cognition and its evolution, intellect, thinking, perception,
consciousness, knowledge representation and acquisition, language as a means of
cognition and communication, brain mechanisms of cognition, emotion and higher
forms of behavior. Psychologists, linguists, neuroscientists, specialists in
education, artificial intelligence, neuroinformatics and cognitive ergonomics,
computer scientists, philosophers, anthropologists, as well as other researchers
interested in interdisciplinary research on cognition are invited to participate
in the conference. 

The Third International Conference on Cognitive Science 
''Biennale of Cognitive Science 2008''
Moscow, Russia, June 20-25 2008

First call for papers

The Interregional Association for Cognitive Studies, Institute of Psychology
RAS, and the Center for Russian Language Development announce the Third
International Conference on Cognitive Science, to be held in Moscow, Russia,
June 20-25, 2008. This conference succeeds the First and the Second Conferences
on Cognitive Science held in Kazan' (2004) and in St. Petersburg (2006) (see the
Association's website at www.cogsci.ru). 

The central topics of the conference are various aspects of and approaches to
development: from brain plasticity, genetics and evolutionary anthropology to
language acquisition and cross-cultural differences. Within the framework of
these problems, the following issues will also be discussed: development of
emotions, effects of fatigue on learning and working, affective modulation of
cognitive processes, as well as abnormal development of cognition and the
corresponding neurogenetic and neuropsychological mechanisms. At the same time,
papers on all other major issues in contemporary cognitive studies will be welcomed.

The conference program will include invited lectures by leading experts in
multidisciplinary cognitive studies. Invited speakers include the Nobel Prize
winners Gerald Edelman and Daniel Kahneman, as well as Ant√≥nio Damasio, Marc
Hauser, George Lakoff, Michael Tomasello, Anne Treisman, Stella Vosniadou and
others. Some of these lectures will be named in honor of such outstanding
students of cognition, brain and development as Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria.

In addition to sessions and workshops with oral presentations, special attention
will be given to poster sessions; these are planned to incorporate most of the
papers. The working languages of the Conference are English and Russian.
Accepted abstracts will be published by the beginning of the Conference.

The deadline for abstract submission is December 1, 2007. Abstracts should be
submitted online via the conference website: 
www.cogsci2008.ru
Organizers of the Conference hope to keep the registration fee to a minimum. A
competition for Student Travel Fellowships is announced. For further details on
abstract submission and Travel Fellowships see the conference website. The
Program Committee will accept papers on the basis of the criteria of
interdisciplinary relevance, novelty and scientific significance. The Program
Committee reserves the right to assign accepted papers to particular sessions of
the conference. Applicants will be notified of their status by March 1, 2008.

Subject: The L2 Acquisition of the Nominal Domain 

	

Full Title: The L2 Acquisition of the Nominal Domain

Location: Urbana, Illinois, USA 
Contact Person: Tania Ionin

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 10-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

An important goal in second language acquisition research is to describe and
explain the formal properties of grammatical systems that L2 learners construct
(interlanguage grammars). For over two decades, generative approaches to second
language acquisition have played a leading role in this endeavor. The aim of
this colloquium is to focus on grammatical areas of interlanguage development
that have recently come to the fore, such as the acquisition of nominal
structure. When it comes to successful acquisition of a second language, it has
been noticed that interface areas of grammar, or areas that straddle boundaries
between syntax and the lexicon, semantics, pragmatics, and/or prosody, are more
difficult to acquire than grammatical areas that only require knowledge of
principles of the core grammar (or syntax proper). The goal of this colloquium
is to study these interfaces in the L2 acquisition of the nominal domain. In
particular, we want to uncover how exactly linguistic knowledge is represented
in this area of the clause, and what theoretical positions within Universal
Grammar best explain the acquisition facts. Some specific questions include: How
do L2 learners acquire the properties of number and gender agreement
(lexicon-syntax interface)? What role does prosody play in the acquisition of
nominal morphology (prosody-morphosyntax-interface)? How are such semantic
distinctions as definiteness, specificity, and genericity acquired, and how do
these affect the use and interpretation of determiners and differential object
markers (semantics-syntax and pragmatics-syntax interface)? How do L2 learners
acquire adjectival and relative clause modification and the meaning change
associated with different positions for adjectives or other modifiers
(syntax-semantics, syntax-pragmatics interface)? In addition to focusing on
these grammatical areas, which have not received much attention in L2
acquisition, the colloquium will explore the following additional questions,
which are basic to the study of second language development and ultimate
attainment: 1) What is the role of the L1 in the acquisition of the nominal
domain? 2) What do stages of development look like in this domain? 3) How do L2
learners eventually converge on the grammar of the target language, if they ever
do? We hope that some of the answers to these questions can be found in the
variety of approaches generated in current linguistic theory.
