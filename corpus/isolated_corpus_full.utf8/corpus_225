	 **** REVISED PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE: APRIL 10, 2006 ****





+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Large linguistically interpreted corpora play an increasingly
important role for machine learning, evaluation, psycholinguistics as
well as theoretical linguistics. Many research groups are engaged in
the creation of corpus resources annotated with morphological,
syntactic, semantic, discourse and other linguistic information for a
variety of languages.  In the tradition of previous LINC
(http://www.delph-in.net/events/05/linc/) and Frontiers
(http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/Frontiers_Workshop.html) workshops, we
aim to bring together these activities in order to identify and
disseminate best practice in the development and utilization of
linguistically interpreted corpora.

The goals of the workshop are two-fold: (1) to exchange and propagate
research results with respect to the annotation, conversion and
exploitation of corpora taking into account different applications and
theoretical investigations in the field of language technology and
research; and (2) work towards a consensus on issues crucial to the
advancement of the field of corpus annotation. In particular, we would
like to focus on questions like:

 - How can a system developer take advantage of the multitude of
  annotation efforts with completely different underlying assumptions,
  annotation schemata, etc.?

 - How might one merge different annotation of the same data into one
  single unified representation?

 - How can closely related schemes be applied across languages?

The workshop will include presentations of long (8 page) and short (4
page) papers, invited presentations by "working groups", as discussed
below, followed by an open discussion. All papers should use the same
formating guidelines as ACL (http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au).  It is
not necessary to make the corpus itself anonymous, just the authors.

Long papers on any aspect of linguistically interpreted corpora
including:

 - creation of practical annotation schemes
 - efficient annotation techniques
 - automation of corpus annotation
 - tools supporting corpus conversions
 - validation including consistency checking of corpora
 - browsing corpora and searching for instances of linguistic
 - phenomena
 - interpretation of quantitative results
 - automatic induction of linguistic competence through machine
   learning techniques.
 - application of the same linguistic schema to multiple languages

Short papers on these same topics. However, preliminary work and pilot
studies will also be considered.

There will be a few invited "working group" presentations. Each
working group will consist of a group of researchers with the
expressed purpose of laying out the dimensions of some crucial problem
facing the field of corpus annotation, particularly problems involving
merging annotation and extending annotation to new languages, genres
and modalities. 

    * Annotation Compatibility: A roadmap of the compatibility of current annotation schemes with each other.
    * Low-density Languages: A discussion of low density languages and the problems associated with them.

We will attempt to lay out clearly and precisely the assumptions on such
topics held by members of the annotation community and in doing so, we hope to
both: (1) lay the foundations for the meaningful integration of annotation
resources; and (2) assess the limitations of integrated approaches. See here
for progress of each of the working groups.

We will also be giving an Innovative Student Annotation Award to one
student presenter -- please indicate if your paper is a student
paper. This includes waiving of the workshop fee for one student.


WORKSHOP WEBSITE: 

http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/frontiers2006/


TARGET AUDIENCE: Those interested in creating and using existing and
future annotated corpora. This includes annotators, lexicographers,
system developers and those designing NLP system evaluation tasks for
the NLP community.


SUBMISSIONS

Long paper submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length and short papers
should not exceed 4 pages. Format requirements will be the same as for full
papers of ACL 2006. See http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au for style files.

Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format via the START
Conference Manager at:

http://www.softconf.com/acl/W6-COLINGACL2006/

In your submission, please indicate:

1. long or short paper;
2. choose all applicable paper categories from the following list: syntax,
   semantics, predicate-argument structure, morphology, anaphora, discourse; 
3. indicate the language(s) your work applies to, e.g., those being
   annotated as well and those you plan to annotate in the future.

Dual submissions to the main COLING/ACL 2006 conference and this workshop are
allowed, although you must make sure to indicate this in your submission. If
your paper is accepted for the main conference, you should withdraw your paper
from the workshop immediately upon notification.

The deadline for paper submissions is April 10, 2006.



LANGUAGE: All papers must be written and presented in English
