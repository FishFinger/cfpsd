CALL FOR PAPERS



IJCNLP 2008 WORKSHOP ON NER FOR SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES

(http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-07)



Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all
aspects of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for South and South East Asian
(SSEA) languages. At least one of the languages considered should be an SSEA
language. We also invite researchers to be contestants in a shared task (the
second track of the workshop) on NER for SSEA languages.



BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION



Most of the SSEA languages are scarce in resources as well as tools and NER
systems are no exception. It is very important that good systems for NER be
available, because many problems in information extraction and machine
translation (among others) are dependent on accurate NER. However, the
issues involved are significantly different for these languages from those
for European languages or even East Asian languages. For example, these
languages do not have capitalization, which is a major feature for NER
systems for European languages.

Another similarity among these languages is that most of them use scripts of
Brahmi origin. For some languages, there are additional issues like word
segmentation (e.g. for Thai). Large gazetteers are not available for most of
these languages. There is also the problem of lack of standardization and
spelling variation. The number of frequently used words which can also be
used as names is very large for many languages, unlike European languages
where a larger proportion of the first names are not used as common words.
And most importantly, there is a serious lack of labeled data for machine
learning.

Scope



This workshop will be the second stage of an annual event called NLPAI
Machine Learning Contest which focuses on application of machine learning
techniques for one major NLP problem every year. This year the problem was
NER. However, unlike that event, this workshop will have one track for
regular research papers on NER for SSEA languages and the second track will
be on the lines of a shared task.



SHARED TASK



In the shared task, the contestants having their own NER systems will be
given some annotated test data. The participating systems will be ranked
according to their performance on the test data. There may or may not be
training data for a particular language. In either case, the contestants
will have the freedom to use any technique for NER, e.g. a purely rule based
technique or a purely statistical technique.



At present some data is available for Hindi, Bengali and Telugu for the
shared task. Other languages can be included in the contest provided data
for them becomes available. The data released for the shared task will be
made accessible to all researchers, not just the participants.



If the language you are interested in has not been included in the shared
task, you can also prepare the annotated test data and submit it to us. We
will then include that language in the shared task.



The task in this contest will be different in one important way. The NER
systems also have to identify nested named entities. For example, in the
sentence The Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration is
located in Mussoorie, 'Lal Bahadur Shastri' is a Person, but 'Lal Bahadur
Shastri National Academy of Administration' is an Organization. In this
case, the NER systems will have to identify both 'Person' and 'Organization'
in the given sentence.



SUBMISSION



Paper submission is through the centralized workshop submission page at
https://www.softconf.com/ijcnlp/NERSSEAL. Papers have to be written in
English. Note that shared task contestants also have to submit a paper
describing their method and the results etc. Long or short papers can be
submitted to either of the tracks. Long papers can be up to 8 pages long,
while the maximum length for short papers is 5 pages (including references,
figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings.



The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX styles or MS Word templates
recommended for the main IJCNLP conference. These documents are available at
http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/callforpapers.htm. Reviewing will be blind. The
draft papers should not contain any information that can identify the
authors, as far as possible.



IMPORTANT DATES


- Paper Submission Deadline: Sept 21, 2007

- Notification of Paper Acceptance: Oct 26, 2007

- Camera Ready Submission Deadline: Nov 16, 2007
