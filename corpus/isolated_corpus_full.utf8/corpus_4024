Full Title: Journal of South Asian Linguistics 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2009 

The On-Line Journal of South Asian Linguistics is devoted to work pursuing
formal approaches to the study of South Asian Languages. We conceive of
South Asian Languages broadly to cover the languages of Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tibet
and that of the South Asian diasporas.

The journal covers the areas of computational linguistics, historical
linguistics, language acquisition, morphology, phonology, phonetics,
psycholinguistics, semantics, and syntax as well as work on other areas of
linguistics that interfaces with one of the aforementioned areas. The
formal analyses pursued in the articles can be couched in any theoretical
framework. An important goal of the journal is to bring together
theoretically oriented work with the vast range of crosslinguistic
variation found in the South Asian subcontinent and to provide a dedicated
forum for a discussion of the linguistic diversity of this area with a
focus on the understudied and underdocumented languages of the region.

The first issue of the Journal can be found under 'Current' at:

  jsal-journal.org 

In addition, we anticipate that the journal will grow to include responses
and replies to recent work, short squibs, book reviews, and theoretically
oriented descriptions of underdocumented languages. We also expect to have
occasional special issues edited by guest editors devoted to particular topics.

The next issue is scheduled to appear in the Summer of 2009. Please submit
your papers by February 15th, 2009 in order to make that issue.  Author
guidelines can be found under 'For Authors' on the Journal Website.
