Location: New York, New York, USA 
Contact Person: Kathleen McClure
Meeting Email: cathymcclure@yahoo.com

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 05-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

Human language is the product of evolved mechanisms that develop in supportive environments.  To understand language, we need to improve present understandings of evolutionary and developmental processes responsible for its emergence.  This conference proposes to bring together leading scholars in the broad area of language and communication, with a focus on developmental and evolutionary issues.  Abstracts are welcome in such areas as: language acquisition in children, computational modeling, evolution of language, comparative studies, gesture and sign language, biology of language and cognition.  While papers on the main topic are particularly welcome, individuals are encouraged to submit abstracts on any subject in theoretical and applied linguistics. 

Abstracts should be anonymous, titled, single-spaced and not more than 425 words in length.  Please send abstracts as an attachment (in a Microsoft file, if possible) via email to the conference coordinator.  Within the email, indicate your name, affiliation, address, email address, title of paper, and audio-visual equipment needed.  Simultaneously, send to the coordinator via snail mail one hardcopy of the abstract, for editing and verification purposes.

Those wishing to propose panels or special sessions should contact the conference chair.  Time allotted will be 20 minutes for delivery of the paper plus 5 minutes discussion.  Deadline for receipt of abstracts is January 5, 2007.
