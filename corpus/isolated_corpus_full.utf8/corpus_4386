Website: http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea4.html

Workshop Description:
The Innovative Use of NLP in Educational Applications workshops have fostered 
interaction and collaboration among researchers in intelligent tutoring systems
(ITS) using text and speech, scoring of free-response assessments and 
proofreading tools. This workshop will continue to explore NLP technologies with
the goal of identifying novel use of NLP techniques and tools for the
development of educational applications. 

We are increasing the scope of this workshop to include the following:
1. A demo session for accepted papers that involve a system.
2. Preliminary planning session for the first shared task of the workshop:
grammatical error detection of articles and prepositions for 2010.

Full paper and short paper topics will include, but will not be limited to the
following:

1) Automated scoring/evaluation for oral and written student responses
- Content analysis for scoring/assessment
- Grammatical error detection and correction
- Discourse and stylistic analysis
- Plagiarism detection     
- Machine translation for assessment, instruction and curriculum development
 
2) Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods   
- Dialogue systems in education
- Hypothesis formation and testing
- Multi-modal communication between students and computers
- Generation of tutorial responses
- Knowledge representation in learning systems
- Concept visualization in learning systems 

3) Learner cognition
- Assessment of learners' language and cognitive skill levels
- Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional states
- Tools for learners with special needs 

4) Use of corpora in educational tools
- Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
- Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement 

5) Tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers
- NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
- Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify appropriate texts
- Tools that automatically generate test questions - such as multiple choice or
short answer
- Processing of and access to lecture materials across topics and genres
- Adaptation of instructional text to individual learners' grade levels 
- assist in text-based curriculum development
- E-learning tools for personalized course content
- Language-based educational games 

6) Issues involving the shared tasks for the 2010 Workshop: Grammatical error 
detection and correction
 
7) Issues concerning the evaluation of NLP-based educational tools

8) Descriptions of implemented systems
