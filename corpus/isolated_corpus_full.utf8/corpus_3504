Hosted by the Maryland institute of Technology in the Humanities=20

Abstract Deadline: October 31, 2008 (Midnight GMT)

Call for Papers Announcement

I. General

The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts=20
of between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of digital humanities,=20
broadly defined to encompass the common ground between information=20
technology and problems in humanities research and teaching. As=20
always, we welcome submissions in any area of the humanities,=20
particularly interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage=20
submissions on the current state of the art in digital humanities, and=20
on recent new developments and expected future developments in the=20
field.

Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,
* text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing,=20
language learning
* libraries, archives and the creation, delivery, management and=20
preservation of humanities digital resources
* computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of=20
literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including=20
electronic literature and interdisciplinary aspects of modern=20
scholarship
* use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music,=20
film, theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural=20
heritage
* research issues such as: information design and modelling; the=20
cultural impact of the new media; software studies; Human-Computer=20
interaction
* the role of digital humanities in academic curricula
* digital humanities and diversity

The range of topics covered by digital humanities can also be=20
consulted in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic=20
Computing (LLC), Oxford University Press.

The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the=20
Programme Committee is October 31, 2008. All submissions will be=20
refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance February 13, 2009.=20
The electronic submission form will be available at the conference=20
site from October 1st, 2008. See below for full details on submitting=20
proposals.

Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference=20
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local=20
conference organizer as soon as possible.

For more information on the conference in general please visit the=20
conference web site.

II. Types of Proposals

Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1)=20
papers, (2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations, and=20
(3) sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of=20
submission must be specified in the proposal.

Papers and posters may be given in English, French, German, Italian or=20
Spanish.

1) Papers

Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:=20
either completed research which has given rise to substantial results,=20
or the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous=20
theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers=20
will be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for=20
questions.

Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing=20
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to=20
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some=20
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the=20
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the=20
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based=20
approaches to the problem and should include some critical assessment=20
of the computing methodologies used. All proposals should include=20
conclusions and references to important sources. Those describing the=20
creation or use of digital resources should follow these guidelines as=20
far as possible.

2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations

Poster presentations may include computer technology and project=20
demonstrations. Hence the term poster/demo to refer to the different=20
possible combinations of printed and computer based presentations.=20
There should be no difference in quality between poster/demo=20
presentations and papers, and the format for proposals is the same for=20
both. The same academic standards should apply in both cases, but=20
posters/demos may be a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking=20
results, or significant work in progress, including pedagogical=20
applications. Both will be submitted to the same refereeing process.=20
The choice between the two modes of presentation (poster/demo or=20
paper) should depend on the most effective and informative way of=20
communicating the scientific content of the proposal.

By definition, poster presentations are less formal and more=20
interactive than a standard talk. Poster presenters have the=20
opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss=20
their work in detail with those most deeply interested in the same=20
topic. Presenters will be provided with about two square meters of=20
board space to display their work. They may also provide handouts with=20
examples or more detailed information. Posters will remain on display=20
throughout the conference, but there will also be a separate=20
conference session dedicated to them, when presenters should be=20
prepared to explain their work and answer questions. Additional times=20
may also be assigned for software or project demonstrations.

The poster sessions will build on the recent trend of showcasing some=20
of the most important and innovative work being done in digital=20
humanities.

As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters to=20
the conference, the Programme Committee will award a prize for the=20
best poster.

3) Sessions

Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:

Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement=20
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for=20
each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in=20
the session;

or
A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an=20
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be=20
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each=20
speaker is willing to participate in the session.

The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for=20
papers, i.e. October 31st, 2008.

III. Format of the Proposals

All proposals must be submitted electronically using the on-line=20
submission form, which will be available at the conference web site=20
http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/ from October 1st, 2008.
Anyone who has previously used the conftool system to submit proposals=20
or reviews should
use their existing account rather than setting up a new one. If anyone=20
has forgotten their user name and/or password please contact=20
dh2009@digitalhumanities.org.

IV. Information about the conference venue: MITH University of=20
Maryland
Celebrating its 10th anniversary as a working digital humanities=20
center, MITH is the University of Maryland's primary intellectual hub=20
for scholars and practitioners of digital humanities, electronic=20
literature, and cyberculture, as well as the headquarters of the=20
Electronic Literature Organization. Having fostered numerous early=20
adopter projects in the field, MITH continues to innovate with new=20
work on tools, text analysis, electronic editing, virtual worlds,=20
digital preservation, and cyberinfrastructure.

V. Bursaries for Young Scholars
A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made=20
available to those presenting at the conference by the Association of=20
Digital Humanities Organisations. (AHDO) If you wish to apply for a=20
bursary please submit a proposal and indicate your interest in the=20
scheme by emailing dh2009@digitalhumanities.org. More information for=20
applicants will be available from the ADHO website=20
