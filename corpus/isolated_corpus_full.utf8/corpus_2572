Meeting Description:

Second conference on Utterance Interpretation and Cognitive Models. 

Call for Papers

The second edition of the Brussels conference on Utterance Interpretation and
Cognitive Models will take place on July 19-21, 2008. While the first edition
addressed the issue of the semantics/pragmatics interface from a cognitive
perspective, this time we wish to adopt a broader perspective. The conference
aims at reaching across disciplinary boundaries and bringing together
researchers who, though belonging to different schools or traditions, all take a
view of interpretation that is informed by cognitive concerns. We are convinced
that a better understanding of how utterances come to be endowed with meaning
calls for collaboration between various subfields of linguistics -- syntax,
formal semantics, cognitive linguistics, pragmatics, evolutionary linguistics
--, as well as with other disciplines, such as developmental and cognitive
psychology, cognitive sciences, and philosophy of language. However, whatever
the theoretical background and the empirical phenomena to be accounted for, in
our view the ultimate test for any theory of utterance interpretation is that it
should be psychologically plausible. We hope that the second conference on
Utterance Interpretation and Cognitive Models will help popularize this idea.

Keynote Speakers:
Nicholas Asher (Austin University of Texas/CNRS, Institut de Recherche en
Informatique de Toulouse) 
Robyn Carston (University College London)
Herbert Clark (Stanford University)
Jim Hurford (University of Edinburgh)
Ruth Millikan (University of Connecticut)
Robert Stainton (University of Western Ontario)
Leonard Talmy (University at Buffalo)

Abstract Submissions: 
In addition to keynote lectures, the conference will feature parallel sessions
with contributed papers. We welcome submissions of abstracts for 25-minute
papers that focus on the cognitive underpinnings of utterance interpretation or,
conversely, address the implications that theories of any aspect of utterance
interpretation can have for cognitive science. We also welcome papers from
scholars who study utterance interpretation in connection with language
development, impaired communication, non-verbal communication and non-human
communication. Abstracts will be anonymously refereed by members of the program
committee.

Important Dates:
Deadline for abstracts: April 15
Notification of acceptance: May 30
Conference: July 19-21 2008 

Abstract Format: 
- Only electronic submissions are accepted. 
- Abstracts should be submitted to the email address: uicm2@ulb.ac.be, with the
following subject line: ''Utterance Interpretation and Cognitive Models 2'' 
- The abstracts should be sent as an attachment to an email message, in either
MS Word (.doc), Rich Text Format (.rtf) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf ) format 
- The length of the submissions is a maximum of two A4 sides, using 2,5 cm (1
inch) margins and a 12 pt font. Each abstract should clearly indicate the title
of the talk, and may include references. In the interest of fairness these
constraints will be strictly enforced.
- The abstracts should be prepared for blind review, and include no indication
of the name(s) of the author(s). Only anonymous abstracts will be considered.
- The body of the email message should contain the following information: The
name(s) of the author(s), affiliation, title of the paper and contact details
(postal and email address).
- A maximum of one submission as author, and one as co-author will be considered

Meeting Description:

BAAL Language Learning & Teaching Special Interest Group
4th Annual Conference: Attaining second language proficiency
1-2 July 2008, University of Greenwich, London, UK 

Call for Papers

Submissions are invited for papers and posters addressing the theme of the
conference from an L2 learning and/or L2 teaching perspective. Papers and
posters with a focus on research methodology are likewise welcome.

Each submission should provide the name and affiliation of the author(s), a
title, and a 250-word abstract, indicating whether the submission is for a paper
or poster. Papers will be allocated 20-minute slots for presentation plus 10
minutes for discussion. 

Deadline for abstracts: 29 February 2008.
Notification of acceptance: by 25 March 2008.

Abstracts should be submitted to the conference organisers: 
Alessandro Benati (a.benati@gre.ac.uk) and Karen Roehr (kroehr@essex.ac.uk)

Conference theme: Attaining second language proficiency

Much research concerned with L2 learning and L2 teaching seeks to establish how,
why, or when learners progress in their development of L2 skills; yet,
assumptions about what we mean by L2 proficiency often remain implicit. By the
same token, the field of language learning and teaching utilises a wide variety
of tools for measuring learners' progress and achievements as well as variables
associated with these factors. The conference theme highlights these two
strands, and papers and posters addressing the theme in any way are invited. 

We hope that the conference will enable us to discuss questions such as the
following: How can the notion of L2 proficiency be understood in terms of
specific theoretical frameworks? What is the relevance of this notion in L2
teaching? What is the relevance of this notion in L2 assessment? How can the
notion of L2 proficiency be understood in relation to classroom vs. naturalistic
learning? Which methods may be suitable for measuring L2 proficiency? What
factors contribute to the attainment of L2 proficiency?

Invited plenary speakers:
Roger Hawkins (University of Essex)
Jan Hulstijn (Universiteit van Amsterdam)
Bill VanPatten (Texas Tech University)
