Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Advisory Board, we would like to inform you of the:

TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIVERSITY IN ORGANISATIONS, COMMUNITIES AND NATIONS      
Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland      
19-21 July 2010        
http://www.Diversity-Conference.com 

The Diversity Conference has a history of bringing together scholarly, government and practice-based participants with an interest in the issues of diversity and community. The Conference examines the concept of diversity as a positive aspect of a global world and globalised society. Diversity is in many ways reflective of our present world order, but there are ways of taking this further without necessary engendering its alternatives: racism, conflict, discrimination and inequity. Diversity as a mode of social existence can be projected in ways that deepen the range of human experience. The Conference will seek to explore the full range of what diversity means and explore modes of diversity in real-life situations of living together in community. The Conference supports a move away from simple affirmations that 'diversity is good' to a much more nuanced account of the effects and uses of diversity on differently situated communities in the context of our current epoch of gl!
 
 obalisation.

The tenth anniversary of the Diversity Conference will be marked in Belfast, a city both with a past marked by sectarian conflict and a rich heritage of diversity. In addition, ethnic minority communities have increased in number and size since the expansion of the European Union. Belfast, like many cities, continues to work to overcome old divisions.

As well as impressive line-up of international plenary speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in The International Journal of Diversity in Organisations, Communities and Nations. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 8 October 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.Diversity-Conference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Belfast in July 2010.

Yours Sincerely,

Prof. Jock Collins       
University of Technology, Sydney, Australia      
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Diversity in Organisations, Communities and Nations and The International Journal of Diversity in Organisations, Communities and Nations
