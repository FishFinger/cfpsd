In September 2009, the City of A Coruña and the Autonomous Community of Galicia

We would like to invite all scholars and researchers to undertake with rigor and

significant phenomena regarding communication processes. From a semiotic
perspective, the main aim is to analyze and interpret all social and cultural
phenomena which make up the nowadays communication society.

This important Congress will commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the foundation
of the International Association for Semiotic Studies/Association Internationale
de Sémiotique (IASS/AIS), founded in Paris in 1969 by Roman Jakobson, André
Martinet, Roland Barthes, Algirdas Julien Greimas and Umberto Eco, among others.
In addition, it will turn the city of A Coruña into a great World Forum, not
only on the subject of Semiotics, but also on Communication and Culture. 2500
specialists in semiotics are expected to come along with one hundred
international scholars and sociologists and a dozen figures of the highest level
in this scientific researching field, and all of them have been called up by the
International Association for Semiotic Studies (IASS/AIS).
