FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

*Methodological Advances in Corpus-Based Translation Studies*

Hosted by University College Ghent (Belgium)
January 8 and 9, 2010

http://veto.hogent.be/actua/mats2010/


We invite papers or posters for a two-day symposium which will focus on
corpus-based work in the field of Translation Studies. Areas of interest
include:

- The relationship between non-translated texts and translated texts in
one language
- The relationship between source texts and target texts
- Innovative methods and techniques for collecting and analysing data in
Translation Studies


Background

The introduction of a corpus-based methodology in the field of
Translation Studies (Baker 1993) gave rise to a large number of
empirical studies that investigate the fundamental characteristics of
translated texts and their relationship to their source texts and
non-translated texts. These studies have yielded interesting insights
into the nature of translated language and the translation process, such
as the so-called translation universals, the ideology of translation and
stylistic differences between translators.
Nevertheless, important methodological and conceptual challenges lie
ahead. Some languages, for instance, are less well-studied within
corpus-based Translation Studies. Obviously, in order to empirically
verify general hypotheses about translation products and processes, as
many languages as possible have to be studied.
  In addition, some general hypotheses, like the explicitation
hypothesis, need conceptual refinement: to what extent, for instance, is
explicitation at syntactic level identical to explicitation at
discursive level? Most importantly, how can general hypotheses be put to
the test or, in other words, how do we 'translate=92 (operationalise)
hypotheses so that they are empirically testable in a corpus?
The two-day symposium therefore wants to encourage corpus-based work on
translations in less well-studied languages as well as corpus-based work
that pushes methodological and conceptual frontiers in Translation
Studies. Possible questions / hypotheses include (but are not limited =

to) untranslatability or implicitation, deictic shifts in translation, =

information structure asymmetries between source and target texts, =

register differences within translated language. More information can be =

found on the conferene website.


Submission requirements

Abstracts for papers should be written in English and should clearly =

articulate:
- the corpus materials used;
- the research hypothesis as well as the operationalisation of this =

hypothesis in corpus-linguistic terms;
- the results of the analysis and its theoretical implications =

(statistical analysis of the corpus data is a plus).

Abstracts for posters report preferably on work-in-progress in corpus =

based-translation studies. Abstracts should be written in English and =

should clearly articulate:
- the corpus materials used;
- the research hypothesis as well as the operationalisation of this =

hypothesis in corpus-linguistic terms;
- the preliminary results.

Although one of the objectives of the symposium is to stimulate =

corpus-based research on less well-studied languages, contributions on =

well-studied languages will also be welcomed.


Submission procedure

For purposes of easy editing, please download the abstract template
available at our website (http://veto.hogent.be/actua/mats2010/). Send
your abstract  (500 words, excluding references) to
gert.desutter@hogent.be. Specify your name(s), affiliation and contact
details in the message body only.

Abstracts are due on September 30, 2009 and will be reviewed anonymously
by two members of the local organising committee and the scientific
committee. Notification of acceptance is scheduled on October 30, 2009.
