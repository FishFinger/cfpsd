Meeting Description:

Moscow Syntax and Semantics (MOSS)
October 9-11, 2009

The first Moscow Syntax and Semantics (MOSS) conference will be held on October 9-11, 2009 at the Institute of the Russian language of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.

Our young conference is a descendant of two separate conferences that took place in Moscow earlier, the Formal Semantics in Moscow (FSiM) workshop and the Syntactic Structures conference. MOSS's aim is to bring together people working within different theoretical frameworks and to encourage syntacticians and semanticists to have more substantial interaction with each other. Young researchers are especially welcome to apply. 

Invited speakers: 

Artemis Alexiadou, University of Stuttgart 
Rajesh Bhatt, University of Massachusetts 
Sergey Tatevosov, Moscow State University 

Second Call for Papers:

There will be three sessions at the conference: a (mostly) syntax session, a (mostly) semantics session, and also a separate thematic session on the syntax and semantics of adjectives.

The syntactic part is not limited to any particular framework or any particular topic. We invite works in syntactic typology as well as in formal syntax, and theoretically and typologically oriented descriptive works. The participants should be ready to talk to an audience which might not share all of their theoretical assumptions. The semantic part also is not limited to any particular view on the architecture of grammar, and we invite all works in formal semantics and formal pragmatics, and especially ones stressing the interaction of semantics with syntax and the consequences of semantic data and analyses on the choice between different frameworks.

The special thematic session on adjectives and adverbials is designed to bring together researchers working on adjectives and adverbials from inside of semantics and syntax. On the both sides, there has been significant progress made recently, though the area is still heavily understudied, and as in many other areas, there is less syntactic-semantic interaction going on than one would hope there would be.

Official Language: English
