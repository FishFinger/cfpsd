GoTAL - 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing
Final Call for Papers: deadline 4 April 2008


Gothenburg, Sweden

25-27 August 2008

www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal

The GoTAL conference will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden on 25-27
August, 2008.
The conference is hosted by Chalmers University of Technology jointly
with Gothenburg University, as part of the activities of the Centre
for Language Technology (CLT). GoTAL is the sixth in the series of the
TAL conferences, following FracTAL (Besançon, France, 1997), VexTAL
(Venice, Italy, 1999), PorTAL (Faro, Algarve, Portugal, 2002), EsTAL
(Alicante, Spain, 2004), and FinTAL (Turku, Finland 2006). The main
purpose of the TAL conference series is to bring together scientists
representing linguistics, computer science and related fields, sharing
a common interest in the advancement of computational linguistics and
natural language processing.


SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished
research on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural
language and speech processing, including, but not limited to:

- Pragmatics, Discourse, Semantics, Syntax, and the Lexicon
- Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology
- Speech Recognition
- Speech Synthesis
- Natural Language Generation
- Ontologies, Semantic Networks, and Lexical Resources
- Corpus Linguistics
- Linguistic, Mathematical, and Psychological Models of Language
- Anaphora Resolution
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Corpus-based Language Modeling
- Machine Translation and Translation Aids
- Text and Speech Interfaces
- Dialogue systems
- Language Learning and Therapy
- Simulation and Visualization
- Knowledge Acquisition and Representation
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Text and Speech Classification
- Systems Evaluation


PAPER SUBMISSION

We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any
topic that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly
encouraging research emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and
the interplay between linguistics, computer science and application
domains such as biomedicine, communication systems, public services,
and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed
or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of
completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where
appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of
statistical significance for quantitative results is
encouraged. Submissions should contain original material that has not
been previously presented to the scientific community.  A parallel
submission to other publication fora as well as a significant overlap
in contents with previously published work should be clearly indicated
to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members.

The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical
quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories:

- full papers , describing substantial research with well-evaluated results
- short papers , typically describing ongoing research and preliminary 
  results


All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
conference proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be
presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions are made using EasyChair: Go to

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gotall2008

and follow the instructions.

The submissions should be sent anonymous, in PDF format.  (final
version format to be specified later).
For the final version, authors should follow the LNCS instructions:

  http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0

The maximum length is 12pp for full papers and 5pp for short papers.


PROCEEDINGS

Accepted papers of both categories will be published in the Conference
Proceedings, in the LNCS/LNAI series of Springer.
