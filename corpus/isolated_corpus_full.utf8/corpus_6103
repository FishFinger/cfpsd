UTASCILT is a conference open to students from any educational institution to

grammar and evolutionary models of language change. Students who share these
research interests are especially encouraged to submit papers to this year's

Call for Papers

Papers for this conference are invited in all areas of linguistics, (including
TESOL. Our keynote speaker will be Dr. William Croft. Dr. Croft received his
Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1986. He is currently Professor of Linguistics
at the University of New Mexico. Croft's areas of specialty are typology,
semantics, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar and evolutionary models
of language change. His publications include Typology and Universals (2nd
edition, 2003), Syntactic Categories and Grammatical Relations (1991),
Explaining Language Change (2000), Radical Construction Grammar (2001) and
Cognitive Linguistics (with Alan Cruse, 2004). Croft has held visiting positions
at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.

Students from any educational institution are strongly encouraged to submit
their research and share insights they have discovered in the field. Presenters
can choose between oral and poster presentations. Oral presentations will last
20 minutes with 5 minutes for discussion and questions. An allotment of time
will be set aside for poster presentations and discussion. This is a great
opportunity to develop professional skills. The three best presentations will be
awarded the Yumi Nakamura Memorial Prize in Linguistics (up to $400.00 USD). 
Poster and oral presentations are considered, accepted, and judged as equal
counterparts. 

The deadline for submission of abstracts is Monday, November 2, 2009. 
Notifications of acceptance will be distributed in late November, 2009. 

Abstracts should be written on a single page (500 words or less) in Times New 
Roman or a similar font, font 12, with one additional page for graphs and/or 
references. Electronic submissions are preferred and the text of the e-mail (or 
title page) should include:
 1) your name, 2) affiliation, 3) address, phone number, e-mail address, 4)
title of paper, and 5) type of presentation: oral or poster.  Please do not
include your name on the abstract pages.  

Abstracts should be sent as an attachment in MS Word to utascil@ling.uta.edu. 
Please do not submit using an .html or PDF format, as we will need to format 
the abstract for inclusion in the abstract booklet.  If you use fonts or symbols
that are unusual, please submit both MS Word and PDF, and we will make sure the
correct symbols appear.  Late submissions will not be accepted.
