Conference description:

Vagueness is a pervasive phenomenon in natural language, which appears to be
instantiated in nearly all lexical categories (including adjectives, nouns,
verbs, and quantifiers). In recent years, progress has been made, both in
philosophy and in linguistics, to characterize the sources as well as the varieties
of vagueness. At the foundational level, a central debate concerns the epistemic
vs. semantic nature of the vagueness phenomenon, and the proper understanding of
the relation between the notions of vagueness, ambiguity, context-dependence,
and imprecision. In linguistic theory, some significant advances have been made
on the semantics of gradable adjectives and on the role and behavior of
vagueness related adverbs (such as ''clearly'', ''approximately'', and
''definitely'').

These advances raise the question of how empirical studies of language may bear
on the debate about the nature of vagueness, and whether they can help to
adjudicate between competing accounts (epistemic vs. semantic theories,
contextualist vs. non-contextualist accounts). In addition to that, a number of
issues remain open for investigation: is vagueness manifested and resolved in
the same way across lexical categories (nouns vs. adjectives, logical vs.
non-logical expressions)? How is the vagueness of lexical items blocked or
inherited in larger semantic units (e.g. in comparative constructions), and what
can this tell us about its nature? How do various theories explain the fact that
we use vague terms successfully to communicate meaning in spite of their
vagueness? The aim of this conference will be to bring together linguists and
philosophers, with contributions on both the foundational and the empirical
aspects of the phenomenon of vagueness in natural language.
