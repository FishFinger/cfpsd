Announcement

ACL 2008, Columbus, Ohio, USA

The Don and Betty Walker International Student Fund

Call for Student Applications

The Don and Betty Walker International Student Fund was established to  
commemorate the unstinting dedication of Don and Betty in supporting  
both the ACL and the field of computational linguistics for decades.   
This Fund has been set up to assist students in attending the ACL  
conferences worldwide.

The funds may be used for airfare, subsistence, housing or conference  
registrations, as needed.  To qualify for reimbursement, each  
applicant will need to provide a travel expense report after the  
conference that itemizes costs, provide relevant supporting  
documentation, and indicate other support that was received to defray  
travel costs.

Please be advised that there are limited funds and many applicants,  
and we would like to distribute the money as equitably as possible.   
Consequently, please estimate your travel funding requirements based  
on economy airfare and accommodations.  In exceptional circumstances  
we will provide funding in advance, but we prefer to reimburse after  
the conference.  Preference will be given to: 1) those students  
presenting papers in the main conference, 2) those students giving  
posters or demos or presenting papers in workshops, 3) those students  
wishing to attend the conference but not actively presenting.

If you are interested in making an application, please send your email  
application to Priscilla Rasmussen at acl@aclweb.org by May 1st,  
2008.   Ms. Rasmussen will be available to answer any questions you  
may have.  We expect to let all applicants know whether they have been  
selected by May 11th, 2008.
