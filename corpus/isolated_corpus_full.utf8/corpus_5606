Full Title: Dialog.Carnival.Chronotope 


Linguistic Field(s): History of Linguistics;Ling & Literature 

Call Deadline: 01-Nov-2009 

The journal on scientific research on the biography, theoretical works and
epoch of M.M.Bakhtin entitled Dialog.Carnival.Chronotope that was published
from 1992 to 2003 continues to be released. After a break of 6 years, #41
(2009 ?1) has been published. The publication of the next issue is
scheduled for November 2009.

There's no need to remind that Dialog.Carnival.Chronotope won a significant
renown in scientific circles, played a key part in the understanding of
Bakhtin's scientific heritage, contributed to the consolidation of efforts
of scientists in this or that way interested in Bakhtin's works; the
journal featured many critical archive documents (including Bakhtin's
thesis defense file), key works by Western scientists who determined the
perception of Bakhtin's ideas in Europe (J. Kristeva, T. Todorov).

The topics of the journal get extended a bit now but remain within
Bakhtin's scientific interests and personality:

- text linguistics,
- language philosophy,
- problem of genre,
- novel theory,
- time and space categories in text,
- Marxism,
- Freudism,
- formalism in literary studies,
- pre-requisites and consequences of Bakhtin's philosophy,
- Bakhtin's epoch.

Reviews of conferences of related topics are invited, as well as reviews of
books on Bakhtin-related issues.

Materials in Russian, English and French are accepted.

For publication in #42, you should send articles before November 1, 2009,
to nevmenandr@gmail.com 

For all details, please contact the journal's executive secretary, Boris
Orekhov, and please see our website: http://nevmenandr.net/dkx/.
