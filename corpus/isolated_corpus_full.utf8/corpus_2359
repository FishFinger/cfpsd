GoTAL: First Call for Papers


GoTAL - 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing

Gothenburg, Sweden

25-27 August 2008

www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal.html

The GoTAL conference will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden on 25-27
August, 2008.
The conference is hosted by
Chalmers University of Technology jointly with
Gothenburg University, as part of the activities of
the Centre for Language Technology (CLT).
GoTAL is the sixth in the series of the TAL conferences, following
FracTAL (Besançon, France, 1997),
VexTAL (Venice, Italy, 1999),
PorTAL (Faro, Algarve, Portugal, 2002),
EsTAL (Alicante, Spain, 2004), and
FinTAL (Turku, Finland 2006).
The main purpose of the TAL conference series is to bring together
scientists representing linguistics, computer science and related
fields, sharing a common interest in the advancement of computational
linguistics and natural language processing.


==SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE==

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished
research on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural
language and speech processing, including, but not limited to:
- Pragmatics, Discourse, Semantics, Syntax, and the Lexicon
- Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology
- Speech Recognition
- Speech Synthesis
- Natural Language Generation
- Ontologies, Semantic Networks, and Lexical Resources
- Corpus Linguistics
- Linguistic, Mathematical, and Psychological Models of Language
- Anaphora Resolution
- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Corpus-based Language Modeling
- Machine Translation and Translation Aids
- Text and Speech Interfaces
- Dialogue systems
- Language Learning and Therapy
- Simulation and Visualization
- Knowledge Acquisition and Representation
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Text and Speech Classification
- Systems Evaluation


==PAPER SUBMISSION==

We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any
topic that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly
encouraging research emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and
the interplay between linguistics, computer science and application
domains such as biomedicine, communication systems, public services,
and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed
or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of
completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where
appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of
statistical significance for quantitative results is
encouraged. Submissions should contain original material that has not
been previously presented to the scientific community.  A parallel
submission to other publication fora as well as a significant overlap
in contents with previously published work should be clearly indicated
to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members.  The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance,
technical quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two
categories:
- **full papers**, describing substantial research with well-evaluated
  results
- **short papers**, typically describing ongoing research and
  preliminary results


All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
conference proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be
presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions will be made using EasyChair. The URL will be given here
as soon as the GoTAL submission service opens (in January). Also the
lengths and styles of submissions will be specified then.



==PROCEEDINGS==

The previous three TAL conferences had proceedings published in
LNCS/LNAI..  For GoTAL, this has not yet been confirmed (as of 20
December 2007).


==KEYNOTE SPEAKERS==

There will be three keynote speakers, whose names will be announced
here later.
