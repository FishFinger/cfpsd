5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon

Meeting Description: 

GL2009: Generative Lexicons: From Theory to Implementation
5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon
Date: Sept. 17-19 2009
Location: CNR, Pisa, Italy

The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse contributions from theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, and lexicography, which explore compositionality from the point of view of generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed, as a starting point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon Theory (Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). This year's GL conference will be in a new format, combining both an open call for papers and a workshop on semantic annotation.  

The conference will be held over a period of three days and will be organized as a combination of technical paper presentations and posters, break-out sessions, and keynote lectures. The first day will be devoted to the annotation workshop and the second day to conference papers. The final day will be dedicated to the presentation of results from the workshop and an open discussion of remaining issues.  

The workshop and the open discussion are jointly supported by the EC-FLaReNet and the NSF-SILT projects, with the goal of identifying common future directions of research.

This conference is endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups: SIGANN, SIGSEM, and SIGLEX (pending).

Invited Speakers:

Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA
Johan Bos, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy
Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh, UK
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA
