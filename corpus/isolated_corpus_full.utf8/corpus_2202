covering any Turkish linguistics field are accepted.

Reviews of other published linguistic works are also greatly accepted.

The papers should be in Turkish or English and must be an original work,
not published anywhere before. For other languages, please contact us.

There are no length limits for papers, but we prefer papers between 20-50
pages long.

Every paper will be sent to two anonymous reviewers, who are from the same
