Special Issue of Terminology on Pattern-Based Approaches to Semantic
Relation Extraction 14(1), 2008

Guest editors: 	Alain Auger (Defence Research and Development, Canada)
Caroline Barrière (National Research Council, Canada)

In the context of computational terminology, especially for the task of
generating or updating specialized ontologies, important snippets of
definitional information can be found in text, as expressed explicitly in
natural language utterances. Such utterances have been called
knowledge-rich contexts (KRCs) and a popular way of identifying KRCs has
been by looking for so-called 'knowledge patterns' (KPs), which are the
natural language instantiations of semantic relations (Meyer, 2001).

Automatically extracting semantic relations from free text is a way of
minimizing the phase of manual knowledge engineering and thus overcoming
the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.  Specialized ontologies can be seen
as the end-product of the terminological tasks of conceptual clarification
and knowledge structuring.

This special issue of Terminology is primarily interested in pattern-based
approaches, but would also welcome articles suggesting other methods
(applied in a terminological context) for semantic relation extraction if
put in a comparative setting with pattern-based approaches.

Topics include:
-the importance of semantic relations in terminological databases
-the relation between the semantic relation extraction task and the term
extraction task
-the expression of semantic relations explicitly (using knowledge patterns)
versus implicitly (as in the implicit relation between components of noun
compounds) 
-the value of explicit knowledge in text for terminological studies
-the quantification of explicit knowledge in specialized corpus
-domain dependency of knowledge patterns and semantic relations
-text genre dependency of knowledge patterns and semantic relations
-techniques to build, infer or compile knowledge patterns
-noise analysis of knowledge patterns
-evaluation approaches for knowledge retrieved through the use of knowledge
patterns
-comparison of knowledge pattern approaches to other approaches of semantic
relation extraction
-terminology applications which include semantic relations analysis
-terminology applications and the representation of ontological knowledge
-knowledge structuring approaches related to semantic relation extraction

Papers dealing with knowledge extraction of general knowledge (such as
methods to recreate a Wordnet-like ontology) will not be accepted.  The
purpose must be domain-specific (application) even if the method could be
general.

Submissions:
Papers should be written with Word and comprise between 20-30 pages. More
information on formatting requirements can be found on the John Benjamins
website (http://www.benjamins.com). English is preferred but submissions in
French, Spanish or German will be considered.

Please send submissions to Alain Auger: (Alain.Auger@drdc-rddc.gc.ca) 
Each issue of Terminology contains six articles.
