Submission Deadline:  April 15, 2007

SCOPE:
This workshop is dedicated to current research on speaker age, a
speaker-specific quality which is always present in speech. Although
researchers have investigated several of aspects of speaker age,
numerous questions remain, including (1) the accuracy by which human
listeners and automatic recognizers are able to judge child and adult
speaker age from speech samples of different types and lengths, (2)
the acoustic and perceptual features (and combination of features)
which contain the most important age-related information, and (3) the
optimal methods for extracting age-related features and integrating
speaker age into speech technology and forensic applications. The
purpose of the workshop is to bring together participants from
divergent backgrounds (e.g. forensics, phonetics, speech therapy and
speech technology) to share their expertise and results. Further
information can be found on the workshop website.

TOPICS:
The topics cover, among others, the following issues:

	- methods and tools to identify acoustic correlates of speaker age
	- systems which automatically recognize (or estimate) speaker age
	- studies on the human perception of speaker age
	- projects on the synthesis of speaker age


SUBMISSION:
If you are interested in contributing to the workshop, please send an
extended abstract to both of the organizers Christian M=FCller
<Christian.Mueller at dfki.de> and Susanne Sch=F6tz <Susanne.Schotz at
ling.lu.se> by April 15, 2007. Contributions on work in progress are
specifically encouraged. The abstract does not have to be formatted.
=46eel free to send .doc, .pdf, .txt or .tex files.

Sincerely

Susanne Sch=F6tz
