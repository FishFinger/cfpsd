Meeting Description:

Organised jointly by the research team Pluralit=E9 des Langues et des Ident=
it=E9s en
Didactique : Acquisition, M=E9diations (PLIDAM) of the Institut National de=
s
Langues et Civilisations Orientales (INALCO) in Paris, France and the SOAS-=
UCL
Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning 'Languages of the Wider Worl=
d'
(LWW CETL) in London, UK, this International Conference will bring together
lecturers and teachers to discuss topics and theoretical disciplinary
backgrounds for a plurilingual and pluricultural perspective in education.=
=20

Call for Papers

Today, Language Learning and Teaching needs to position itself in relation =
to an
internationalised context of knowledge, tools for assessing competences
adaptable to a globalised world and in relation to societies in which
affiliations are apprehended as diverse. The impact of globalisation can be=
 seen
in political structures (states, national and international institutions), =
in
social structures (urban life, family and individual stories and trajectori=
es)
and in dynamic communications (information and social networks). In this
multidimensional context, characterized by international mobility, mixed
affiliations and social and cultural representations, languages, which have
become less and less foreign as well as those which have a more and more
hegemonic position, are also perceived as both technological and social ins=
truments.

The conference follows the wide debate launched with the publication, in 20=
08,
of the Pr=E9cis du plurilinguisme et du pluriculturalisme (Handbook of
multilingualism and multiculturalism) - Editions des archives contemporaine=
s.
The conference seeks to identify the changes and the new theoretical
disciplinary dimensions which are emblematic of this new perspective within=
 the
field of Language and Culture Pedagogy, by answering the following question=
s:

- How can Language and Culture Pedagogy be redefined as Plurilingual and
Pluricultural?
- How can its fields of reference, first limited to the discipline of "Appl=
ied
Linguistics" in the 20th century, now be widened?

Notions and concepts which have emerged or are gaining acceptance in Europe
(Common European Framework, European Portfolios, etc.) shall be analysed an=
d
developed through the following:

- The social actor and the valorisation of his/her strategies in the field =
of
language and culture teaching.
- The symbolic dimension of languages and cultures in the dynamic construct=
ion
of identities and how it is taken into account into teaching.
- The social role played by languages and cultures in different forms of
mobility-geographic, social, economic- and acknowledgement of experience as=
 a
capital and its dimension in language learning.
- The power struggle between languages and the national, regional and local
representations that make up a plurilingual environment, the resultant
institutional logic and their impact on learning.
- The different forms of mediations- institutionalised or unstable- that
compensate for conflict situations specific to a heterogeneous educational
environment.
- The changes within these notions as they confront other ideologies, tradi=
tions
or communicative patterns, as well as their adaptation in other languages.

Abstract of up to 2500 characters (references included) will be required to
present theoretical background, key words, the kind of data or corpora used=
 as
well as the methodological approach. This should be sent with the attached
questionnaire (to be filled in) to colloque-plidam-2010@yahoogroupes.fr bef=
ore
30th November 2009.

Languages for the conference are French and English. Conference proposals w=
ill
be blindly reviewed by two readers and papers accepted for publication afte=
r the
conference will only be published after a second assessment.
