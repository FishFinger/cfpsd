Manuscripts are invited on a book project on "Language and social awareness
in Africa".  The book is envisaged to offer new insights on language use
and development in any region of Africa in an era of fast-moving globalization.

One of the threads of the book would be its focus on Africa.  Another is
the relevance of analysis to practice or significance in everyday life,
thus highlighting a social-realist approach to research.

The usual requirements of peer-review would apply. Consequently, each
contribution will be evaluated on whether it (i) offers sufficient evidence
to support claims, (ii) states a clear methodological exposition and
demonstrates the suitability of methods; (iii) is firmly rooted in existing
theoretical tradition or proposes a new theoretical avenue (e.g. challenge
to reductive and/or hegemonic interpretations).  Cross- and
inter-disciplinarity in analysis and/or interpretation would be encouraged.

Manuscripts should preferably deal with any (or a combination) of the
following themes/areas: 
?Multilingualism 
?Language contact phenomena 
?Sociology of language/Language planning, policy, standardization or
engineering 
?Critical linguistics, especially in relation to power, gender, race 
?Language and culture/Social psychology of language (research on the
frontiers between languages and cultures and implications for the world of
work; how X language is both shaped by culture Y and X language is the
medium through which culture Y is created) 
?Dialectology, creolistics 
?Intercultural sociolinguistics and/or communication (especially language
socialization)
?Inter- and cross-cultural pragmatics (issues of politeness, deference,
miscommunication, pragmatic failure in different-cultures same-language
use/communication; teachability and learnability of pragmatic skills;
constrative analysis of pragmatic phenomena in distant languages) 
?Analytical/critical discussion of the use of African languages in any
domain of life 
?Globalization and linguistic interactions in transnational processes 
?Conversation/discourse analysis (organization of verbal interaction,
stylistic and conversational strategies) 
?Issues of educational linguistics 
?Lexicography and terminography. 

Manuscripts on other themes are welcome provided they are relevant to
Africa and have clear practical use or significance in everyday life.

Work-in-progress may be accepted if there is an assurance that the relevant
research will come to fruition in the next few months.

Proposals in the form of a 200- to 300-word summary are invited until
mid-January of 2008.  
Please send your text as an MSWord or RTF attachment (even if you wish to
send also an Adobe PDF copy) at the following e-mail address: luangak@yahoo.fr.
Give your full names and affiliation. Surface mail address, telephone and
fax numbers are not required at this stage. 
The submission of a proposal implies that the same text is not being
considered for publication elsewhere.
Please note that this is not a commissionned publication.

Thank you in advance for your contribution.
