Translating and the Computer 29 Conference
(29-30 November 2007, at the Copthorne Tara Hotel, Kensington, London)

An Aslib Conference Supported by: BCS Natural Language Translation
Specialist Group, EAMT, IAMT, IoL, ITI, LISA and TILP

This conference focuses on the user's perspective of how
computers/software is used in translation. The conference series
attracts a wide audience which includes translators, business
managers, researchers and language experts.

Once again, this year the conference will address the latest
developments in translation (and translation-related) software. It
will address the needs of the following conference attendees:
industry, public administration, agencies, freelancers and
development.

Further details can be found at: www.aslib.com/conferences

This call for papers invites abstracts of papers to be presented at
