Full Title: Journal of Child Language 


Linguistic Field(s): Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 28-Nov-2008 

The Journal of Child Language is soliciting submissions for a special issue
entitled 'Computational Models of Child Language Learning'.   This research
area has seen a recent rapid growth, based on the increased availability of
corpus data, better methods for annotating and parsing corpora, and 
innovations in computational modeling.  Submissions are invited for models
of all levels of linguistic structure including lexicon, syntax, phonology,
gesture, conversation, and semantics.  Modeling may focus on monolingual or
bilingual acquisition in both normal and language-delayed populations. 
Models may make use of any well-specified computational framework,
including but not limited to connectionist modeling, Bayesian analysis,
production systems, or logical analysis.  Typically, models will use corpus
data as input and observed patterns in the child's productions as output. 
However, other well-specified computational frameworks are also invited.

The guest editor for this issue is Brian MacWhinney. Papers will go through
the regular review process. They should be submitted electronically though
Manuscript Central at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jcl and should follow
the regular guidelines for the Journal (see below for further information).
Authors should indicate that their paper is to be considered for the
special issue.  

The deadline for submissions is November 28, 2008.  

Questions about possible submissions should be sent to Brian MacWhinney
(macw@cmu.edu)
