			Call for participation

		       Robust WSD CLIR@CLEF2009

		      Word Sense Disambiguation
	      for (Cross-Lingual) Information Retrieval

                      http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/clirwsd


Following the success of the 2007 joint SemEval-CLEF task and the 2008
Robust WSD task at CLEF, a follow-up task will be hold in 2009 with the
aim of exploring the contribution of Word Sense Disambiguation to
monolingual and multilingual Information Retrieval. The 2009 exercise
will be very similar to the 2008 one. Those interested in exploring the
2008 data can check it here:
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/clirwsd/index.php?option=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=
=3D19&Itemid=3D35

The robust task will bring semantic and retrieval evaluation
together. The participants will be offered topics and document
collections from previous CLEF campaigns which were annotated by
systems for word sense disambiguation (WSD). The goal of the task is
to test whether WSD can be used beneficially for retrieval systems.

The organizers believe that polysemy is among the reasons for
information retrieval (IR) systems to fail. WSD could allow a more
targeted retrieval. Robust-WSD at CLEF 2008 showed that some
top-scoring systems improved their IR and CLIR results with the use of
WSD tags. See working notes:
http://www.clef-campaign.org/2008/working_notes/adhoc-final.pdf

The WSD data is based on WordNet version 1.6 and will be supplemented
with data from the English and Spanish WordNets in order to test
different expansion strategies. Several leading WSD experts will run
their systems, and provide those WSD results for the participants to
use.

Participants are required to submit at least one baseline run without
WSD and one run using the WSD data. They can submit four further
baseline runs without WSD and four runs using WSD with in various
ways.

The robust task will use two languages often used in previous CLEF
campaigns (English, Spanish). Documents will be in English, and topics
in both English and Spanish.

The evaluation will be based on Mean Average Precision (MAP) as well
as Geometric Average Precision (GMAP). The robust measure GMAP intends
to evaluate stable performance over all topics instead of high average
performance in Mono- and Cross-Language IR ("ensure that all topics
obtain minimum effectiveness level" Voorhees 2005 SIGIR Forum).
