Unsupervised Morpheme Analysis -- Morpho Challenge 2009

Part of the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL Challenge Program and  =

organized in c
ollaboration with CLEF. Participation is open to all.

The objective of the Challenge is to design a statistical machine  =

learning algor
ithm that discovers which morphemes (smallest individually meaningful  =

units of l
anguage) words consist of. Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units  =

suitable fo
r different tasks, such as text understanding, machine translation,  =

information
retrieval, and statistical language modeling.

The scientific goals are:
     * To learn of the phenomena underlying word construction in  =

natural language
s
     * To discover approaches suitable for a wide range of languages
     * To advance machine learning methodology

Morpho Challenge 2009 is a follow-up to our previous Morpho Challenge  =

2005, 2007
  and 2008. The task of Morpho Challenge 2009 is similar to the Morpho  =

Challenge
2008, where the aim was to find the morpheme analysis of the word  =

forms in the d
ata. There are some changes in the evaluation and a new Arabic task.
New *Machine Translation* tasks are added (from Finnish to English and  =

from German to English) to evaluate the performance of the morpheme  =

analysis.

Participation in the previous challenges is by no means a prerequisite  =

for parti
cipation in Morpho Challenge 2009. Everyone is welcome and we hope to  =

attract ma
ny participating teams. The results will be presented in a workshop.  =

Please read
  the rules and see the schedule at the home page. The datasets are  =

available for
  download.

If you now decided to participate in Morpho Challenge, please contact  =

the organi
zers and ask to be added in our mailing list. We will use this mailing  =

list to p
rovide news about the tasks, data and evaluations.

We are looking forward to an interesting challenge!
