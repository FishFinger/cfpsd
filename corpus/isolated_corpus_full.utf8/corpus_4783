AIM

The International Workshop Series of Finite State Methods and Natural
Language Processing (FSMNLP) is a forum for researchers and
practitioners working on
=A0- NLP applications or language/ language technology research resource=
s=2C
=A0- theoretical and implementation aspects=2C or
=A0- their combinations
having *obvious relevance or an explicitly discussed relation* to
Finite-State Methods in NLP=2E

In the past=2C seven FSMNLP workshops have been organised (Budapest
1996=2C Ankara 1998=2C Helsinki 2001=2C Budapest 2003=2C Helsinki 2005=2C=

Potsdam 2007=2C Ispra 2008)=2E

We invite submissions related to all obvious or traditional FSMNLP
topics=2C see e=2Eg=2E FSMNLP 2008=2E The updated list of topics include=

=A0- all the obvious or traditional topics
=A0- plus some new topics such as=3A
 =A0 =A0* common interfaces=2C portability=2C and shared methods for tes=

SPECIAL THEME

In recognition of its location on the African continent=2C this year=27s=

FSMNLP has Finite-State Methods for Under-Resourced Languages as a
special theme=2E The theme is relevant to finite-state methods

=A0- applied to practical tasks such as language survey=2C elicitation=2C=

 =A0 data collection=2C computer-aided annotation=2C morphological
 =A0 description=2C modelling and normalization=2C
=A0- considering demanding conditions such as linguistic complexity
 =A0 and diversity=2C scarce resources=2C research infrastructures=2C re=
al-
 =A0 time grammar updates=2C
=A0- in language processing fields such as comparative linguistics=2C
 =A0 field linguistics=2C applied linguistics=2C language teaching=2C an=
d
 =A0 computer-aided translation=2E

The special theme does not restrict the scope but attempts to draw the
attention of contributors to the challenges of computational
linguistics in Africa=2E We hope that the theme teases out promising and=

useful applications of Finite-State Methods in this context=2E

RELATED EVENTS

To catalyze discussion and participation=2C three special sessions or
subworkshops will be organized=2C containing presentations of regular
papers and extended abstracts presenting ongoing research=2C tutorials=2C=

competitions etc=2E relating to the following topic areas=3A

1=2E =22Finite-State Methods for African and other Under-Resourced/
 =A0Low-Density Languages=22

Under-resourced/low-density languages=2C including many African
languages=2C often require documentation and language development=2C in
particular including methods for field linguistics=2C localized
information technology and basic language resources=2E However=2C the
conditions for applying large scale statistical methods do not hold in
general=2C while existing knowledge-based methods may not directly
generalise to low-density languages=2E The purpose of this subworkshop
is to take a fresh look at new resources=2C methods=2C collaboration and=

innovative approaches for these (clusters of) languages=2E Submissions
may be concerned with the following aspects of the subworkshop topic=3A

 =A0- project proposals and joint projects
 =A0- basic language resources
 =A0- innovative approaches to language clusters
 =A0- field linguistics and language documentation
 =A0- iterative language description
 =A0- resource-efficient machine learning=2E

The local organizers are Laurette Pretorius and Sonja Bosch=2E The
subworkshop is tentatively accompanied by two tutorials given by Kemal
Oflazer and Colin de la Higuera (see TUTORIALS AND INVITED TALKS
below)=2E

2=2E =22Practical Aspects and Experience of FS Methods and Systems=22

The last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of
toolkits and implementations of finite state systems for NLP=2E Work on
such implementations has highlighted a wide variety of implementation
issues=2E Unfortunately much of this knowledge remains trade-secret or
is only embodied in implementations themselves=2C and is not presented
academically at conferences=2E This special session focuses on such
issues and knowledge and covers the following topics (as they relate
to NLP and real-life implementation issues)=3A

 =A0- user interfaces=2C visualisation=2C tracing and debugging
 =A0- specification formalisms and languages (e=2Eg=2E grammars=2C regul=
ar
 =A0 =A0 =A0relations=2C etc=2E)
 =A0- application programmer interfaces=2C interchange formats
 =A0- performance=2C profiling and tuning techniques
 =A0- classification=2C comparison and evaluation
 =A0- data-structures and representations
 =A0- compression of alphabets=2C lexicons and rules

3=2E =22Tree Automata and Transducers=22

In recent years=2C applications of formal tree language theory in
natural language processing have been on the rise=2C as witnessed by
papers at conferences and in journals on formal language theory=2C
finite automata=2C natural language processing=2C and computational
linguistics=2E FSMNLP 2009 will therefore have a special session/
subworkshop on tree automata and tree transducers in natural
language processing=2E

This subworkshop includes (but is not limited to) the following topics
as long as they relate to natural language processing=3A

 =A0- unweighted and weighted tree languages=2C
 =A0- unweighted and weighted tree transformations=2C
 =A0- the formalisms to represent and model them (including a=2Eo=2E tre=
e
 =A0 =A0 =A0grammars=2C tree automata=2C tree expressions=2C tree transd=
ucers)=2C
 =A0- expressiveness of such models and representations=2C
 =A0- relations to synchronous grammars=2C
 =A0- learning of such models and representations=2C
 =A0- algorithms for pattern matching=2C accepting=2C parsing of tree
 =A0 =A0 =A0languages=2C and
 =A0- large-scale applications (including those in statistical machine
 =A0 =A0 =A0translation)=2E

For each of the three subworkshops=2C a subcommittee of the PC supported=

by further experts from the field is responsible for the program=2E
Please refer to the FSMNLP website for the lists of subcommittee
members and further experts=2E

TUTORIALS AND INVITED TALKS

We expect to have tutorials on the following tentative topics=3A

=A0- =22Developing Computational Morphology for Low- and Middle-Density
 =A0 =A0 Languages=22 by Kemal Oflazer (Sabanci University=2C Turkey)
=A0- =22Machine Learning with Automata=22 by Colin de la Higuera
 =A0 =A0 (Jean Monnet University=2C Saint-Etienne=2C France)
=A0- =22OpenFST=22 by Johan Schalkwyk (Google=2C USA)

The INVITED SPEAKERS will be announced soon=2E

COMPETITIONS

During FSMNLP 2009=2C we hope to announce a small competition / shared
task related to machine learning of morphology=2E

BUSINESS MEETING

FSMNLP will tentatively have a slot for a SIGFSM business meeting=2E
SIGFSM is currently in the final stages of formal approval as a
Special Interest Group in the Association for Computational
Linguistics (ACL)=2E

PAPER CATEGORIES AND FORMATS

We invite submissions of full papers i=2Ee=2E scientific
contributions presenting new theoretical or experimental
results=2E Papers should present original=2C unpublished research result=
s
and should not be submitted elsewhere simultaneously=2E

We also invite submission of extended abstracts containing or

t
outline=22 of the presentation and a detailed description of hardware=2C=

software and internet requirements=2E

Note that the early acceptance notification date for full papers may
help to keep travel costs for international participants reasonably
low=2E If you come from far away and have only an extended abstract=2C t=
he
abstract can be submitted earlier as if it were a full paper=2E

The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted
papers since the review process wil be double blind=2C except for demo
submissions=2E Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a
web-based submission server=2E

Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNCS style (Proceedings and
Other Multiauthor Volumes) for LaTeX in producing the PDF
document=2E For graph visualization=2C Vaucanson-G LaTeX style=2C
Graphviz/dot and XFig are recommended=2E If you use a non-roman script
or Microsoft Word=2C it is advisable to warn the organizers as early as
possible=2E The page limit is 12 pages for full papers and 8 pages for
extended abstracts=2E

PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE

The on-site proceedings will be on CD=2E

The actual proceedings with revised regular papers will be published
after the conference in a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence as a part of the LNCS Series by Springer-Verlag=2E

High quality extended abstracts may be invited to be included in the
LNCS postproceedings=2C while other extended abstracts may be
published as arranged by subworkshop organizers=2E

In addition=2C a special journal issue on Finite-State Methods and
Models in NLP is being planned=2E Extended versions of the papers and
abstracts may be submitted to this special issue (the publication
involves a second review/selection cycle)=2E
