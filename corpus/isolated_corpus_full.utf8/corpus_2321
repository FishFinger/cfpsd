16th Manchester Phonology Meeting 
Short Title: 16MFM 

Date: 22-May-2008 - 24-May-2008 
Location: Manchester, United Kingdom 
Contact: Patrick Honeybone 
Contact Email: patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk 
Meeting URL: http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/16mfm.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Meeting Description: 

The mfm is the UK's annual phonology conference, with an international set of
organisers; it is held in late May every year in Manchester (central in the UK,
easily accessible from the whole of the country, and with excellent
international transport connections). The meeting has become a key conference
for phonologists from all corners of the world, where anyone who declares
themselves to be interested in phonology can submit an abstract on anything
phonological in any phonological framework. In an informal atmosphere, we
discuss a broad range of topics, including the phonological description of a
wide variety of languages, issues in phonological theory, aspects of
phonological acquisition and implications of phonological change.

Special Session: Phonology and the mental lexicon 

We are pleased to announce our Sixteenth Manchester Phonology Meeting (16mfm).
The information available now is a preliminary announcement of our plans for the
16mfm. A full call for papers will be issued soon. Abstract submission will be
as in previous years and the deadline for abstracts will be 25th February 2007.

There is no conference theme for the 16mfm - abstracts can be submitted on
anything, but, following the success of such sessions in previous years, a
special themed session featuring invited speakers is being organised for the
Friday afternoon, entitled 'Phonology and the mental lexicon', and abstracts
which attempt to deal overtly with the issues involved with this (from any
perspective) will certainly be welcome.
