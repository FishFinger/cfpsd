Goals
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Patent Information Retrieval specialists in the 21st century face =

many challenges. They must search very large numbers of documents in
multiple languages expressing complex technological concepts
through sophisticated legal clauses. Despite a great deal of
theoretical development in Information Retrieval techniques,
advanced search tools for patent professionals are still in their
infancy.

The objective of the workshop is to provide a forum for Information
Retrieval and Knowledge Management scientists as well as Patent
Retrieval experts from industry to study the next generation of
patent search tools. We encourage IP professionals to present their
special information needs and IR&KM researchers to present relevant
technical ideas, for example for high recall search in prior art
searching.

We also promote exchange of ideas on measuring the progress of
system performance for retrieval tasks in the intellectual property
domain.


Topics of Interest
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This workshop solicits two types of papers: research and industry
papers. Suggested topics for research papers include, but are not
limited to:

   * Cross-lingual information retrieval (esp. Asian languages)
   * Patent classification
   * Ontology-based retrieval
   * Information retrieval evaluation
   * Evaluation frameworks
   * Test collections
   * Large-scale information retrieval experiments
   * Parallel and distributed information retrieval
   * Ranking strategies
   * Query validation and query quality analysis
   * Query expansion
   * Interactive retrieval
   * Session-based information retrieval
   * User modeling
   * Handling of noisy data (OCR/spelling/typing errors)
   * XML retrieval

Industry papers shall present research challenges.
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

   * Patent search workflow
   * Patent search strategies
   * Information need of the patent researcher
   * Shortcomings of current patent search tools
   * Case studies
   * Challenges in patent search
   * Patent life cycle
   * Quality of patent data


Keynote Speakers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
 - Noriko Kando, National Institute of Informatics, JP
 - IP keynote to be announced


Important Dates
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

 - Individual workshop papers due: July 17, 2009
 - Notification of Acceptance:     August 10, 2009
 - Camera ready version:           August 15, 2009
 - Workshop date:                  November 6, 2009


Submission Guidelines
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Workshop Committee encourages the submission of high quality
research and industrial papers, which are not published or under
consideration elsewhere, with special emphasis on Patent Information
Retrieval methods. Research papers will be peer-reviewed by at least
3 members of the international program committee. Manuscripts should
be formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates (both for MS word
and Latex) available at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates .
There are two styles on the website. Both the Strict Adherence to
SIGS and the Tighter Alternate style are allowed. Papers cannot
exceed 8 pages in length. A website with camera-ready instructions
is available. Full papers should be submitted in PDF format to
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dpair09 .

Selected papers will be invited to provide an extended version to be
edited in a book published by Springer.

Authors of selected papers will be invited to present their work in
course of a poster session. Note that these papers will be included
in the proceedings.

In case of questions, please e-mail us: pair09@ir-facility.org
