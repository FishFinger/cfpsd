            Exploring Syntactically Annotated Corpora
                Workshop to be held on July 14th
                    CORPUS LINGUISTICS 2005
              University of Birmingham, 14-17 July
               http://www.bultreebank.org/ESyntAC/

Workshop motivation and aims

A lot of syntactically annotated corpora have been created 
recently for various languages. Therefore, the question of 
applicability and usefulness of such resources seems to have 
become of big importance. Syntactically annotated corpora can be 
viewed in two ways: 1) as a reliable base for resource creation: 
further annotation (for example, semantic and discourse  
annotation); automatic extraction of linguistic knowledge 
(grammar and lexicon extraction; creation of automatic parsing 
tools etc.) and environment for testing tools.; 2) as a base for 
navigation and search: query languages and support engines.


We envisage a one-day workshop and 10-12 presentations.

Topics of interest:

- creation of resources  on top of syntactic corpora;
- various kinds of knowledge extraction;
- creation and testing of parsing tools;
- search languages;
- symbolic and subsymbolic methods for syntactic corpora   
  exploration;
- software systems for management and accessibility to 
  syntactically annotated corpora;
- various applications of  syntactic corpora.

Important dates

Deadline for workshop abstract submission: 29th May 2005

Notification of acceptance: 15th June 2005

Final version of paper: 30th June 2005

Submissions

Papers should describe existing research connected to the topics 
of the workshop. The presentation at the workshop will be 30
