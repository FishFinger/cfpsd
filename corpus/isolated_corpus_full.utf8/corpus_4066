================================================================  

We'd like to remind readers that the responses to queries are usually
best posted to the individual asking the question. That individual is
then strongly encouraged to post a summary to the list. This policy was
instituted to help control the huge volume of mail on LINGUIST; so we
would appreciate your cooperating with it whenever it seems appropriate.

In addition to posting a summary, we'd like to remind people that it
is usually a good idea to personally thank those individuals who have
taken the trouble to respond to the query.

To post to LINGUIST, use our convenient web form at
http://linguistlist.org/LL/posttolinguist.html.

ResPubliQA exercise at the 

Multilingual Question Answering Track at CLEF 2009


We are glad to announce that a new exercise will be proposed this year
within the Question Answering track at CLEF. For more information and
instructions visit the new ResPubliQA website at:

http://celct.isti.cnr.it/ResPubliQA/index.php

We invite participation, both from academic institutions and industrial
organizations, on this new task. 

Guidelines describing the task will be distributed among the participants
and will be downloadable from the ResPubliQA website. Participants will
also be provided with training data in order to have the opportunity to
test the systems with procedures to be used in the formal evaluation
campaign. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated at the final
workshop which will be organized in Corfu in conjunction with ECDL 2009.

ResPubliQA 2009: Task Overview

Task Description: Systems receive natural language questions as input, and
must return one paragraph containing the answer from the document
collection. No exact answer is required neither multiple responses.

Document Collection: The subset of JRC-Acquis documents that have parallel
aligned translations into all the languages involved will be used, namely
Bulgarian, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian
and Spanish. The sub-collection is available at the ResPubliQA website:

http://celct.isti.cnr.it/ResPubliQA/index.php?page=Pages/downloads.php&option=newTrackSetup

Questions: a pool of 500 independent questions (factoid, definition,
reason, purpose and procedure) is provided
-	No list questions
-	No topic related questions (questions linked to the same topic)
-	No NIL questions

Answers: one of the following two responses must be returned
a) one single paragraph containing the candidate answer. Multi-paragraph
answers are not considered in this task
b) the string NOA to indicate that the system prefers not to answer the
question. 
Systems that give no answers (NOA) instead of wrong answers will be
rewarded by the evaluation measure. Answer Validation techniques (including
Machine Learning) are expected to be used for taking this final decision.

Languages Involved: Basque (EU), Bulgarian (BG), Dutch (NL), English (EN),
French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Portuguese (PT), Romanian (RO) and
Spanish (ES).

A monolingual English (EN) task will also be activated this year, as both
the exercise and the collection are different from TREC. 
Basque has been included exclusively as a source language, as there is no
Basque collection available.
