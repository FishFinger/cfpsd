LAST CALL FOR PAPERS
2008 NooJ Conference
Budapest, Hungary
Deadline: 7 March, 2008


The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of =

Sciences (HAS), LAboratoire de SEmioLinguistique, Didactique et =

Informatique (LASELDI, Univ. de Franche-Comt=E9) and Maison des Sciences =

de l'Homme Claude Ledoux, France, are pleased to announce the 2008 NooJ =

Conference to be held in Budapest, Hungary, 8-10 June, 2008.

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used =

to formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical =

and productive morphology, local, structural and transformational =

syntax) using a large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State =

Automata to Augmented Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes =

tools to construct, test, debug, maintain and accumulate large sets =

linguistic resources, and can apply them to large texts. NooJ is used as =

a linguistic engineering development platform, a corpus processor, an =

information extraction system, a terminological extractor, a Machine =

Translation development tool as well as to teach linguistics and =

computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ, download the software, linguistic resources, =

manual, tutorials and reference papers: www.nooj4nlp.net.

This conference will hopefully provide an opportunity for NooJ users, as =

well as other researchers interested in corpus linguistics, to meet and =

to exchange their experience of development, research or teaching. It =

will also be the occasion to present and discover the recent =

developments of NooJ (v2.0).

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 7, 2008 =

to nooj08 at nytud.hu. The abstract, in French or in English, should =

contain the title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail =

and electronic address of each co-author. All papers will be reviewed by =

the Scientific Committee. Authors will be notified whether their papers =

are accepted or rejected by 30 April, 2008 the latest. The timeslot is =

30 minutes for presentations, including 5 minutes for discussions.

Further information on the conference: www.nytud.hu/nooj08.

Thanks in advance.

 MOTIVATION
 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

 Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic
 knowledge into high level applications such as information retrieval,
 machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and
 robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep
 parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer
 than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses:
 partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike
 simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a
 sentence. However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather
 an area ranging from chunking to almost full parsing.  This workshop
 will bring together researcher who work on partial parsing in its
 different interpretations.

 SCOPE:
 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

 The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not
 restricted to): =


 . linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications:
   syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical =

   structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);

 . development methodologies for partial parsers: manual,
   machine learning, hybrid;

 . the usability of language resources for the development of
   partial parsers;

 . multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;

 . experience and utilization of existing tools for building
   partial parsers for new languages;

 . technical aspects of partial parsers:
   . robustness, scalability;
   . time and space complexity;
   . expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs.
     context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);

 . applications of partial parsers: information extraction,
   question answering, machine translation, web text mining,
   acquisition of lexical information, etc.;

 . evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
   application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for
   different partial parsing tasks, etc.;

 . ways of combining multiple partial parsers;

 . comparsion (classification) of partial parsers.

 SUBMISSIONS:
 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

 Authors are invited to submit original research papers.  Papers
 should indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In
 particular, any overlap with previously published work should be
 clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
 novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, and
 significance/relevance to the workshop.

 Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages and they should follow
 the detailed guidelines at the LREC 2008 web page:
 http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/-Submissions-.html.  Submission is
 via the START system, a link to the submission page can be found at
 the workshop page.

 The publication of selected papers in a special issue of a journal is
 planned.
