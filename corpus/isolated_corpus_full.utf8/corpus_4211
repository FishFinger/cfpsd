SIGIR 2009: Call for Demonstrations

Demonstration proposals are solicited as part of the 32nd Annual  
International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in  
Information Retrieval, which will be held on 19-23 July 2009 in Boston  
(http://sigir2009.org/).

Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes  
or operational systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas  
gained from implementing IR systems and to obtain feedback from expert  
users. Demonstration submissions are welcomed in any of the areas  
identified in the call for papers (http://sigir2009.org/Calls). One- 
page demonstration abstracts will appear in the conference proceedings.

Submissions must be in English and consist of an extended abstract  
(one page in SIGIR format including references and figures) and an  
additional one-page requirements description.

  * The abstract should emphasize what the implemented system aims to  
achieve, the major components of the system, the novelty of the  
techniques that have been implemented, and comparisons with comparable  
systems.
  * The requirements description should identify the hardware,  
software and network access requirements for the demonstration.  
Network connections and computers with standard Web browsers can be  
provided upon request. Proposals to demonstrate systems that require  
more than a standard Web browser (e.g. context-aware mobile systems or  
virtual reality systems) must explain how the systems will be  
demonstrated at the conference.

The only accepted format for submissions is PDF. Templates for SIGIR  
submissions are available from the ACM Website (for LaTeX, use the  
"Option 2" style). This is also the style that will be required for  
final papers.

Unlike posters and research papers, authors of demonstration proposals  
are not expected to take measures to conceal their identity from  
reviewers.

Demonstration proposals must be submitted by February 23, 2009.  
Demonstration proposals must be submitted electronically via the  
demonstration track of the conference submission system. Submission  
details are provided at the conference Web site (http://sigir2009.org/Calls/demonstrations 
).

The submissions will undergo peer review. At least one author should  
register and attend the conference. Any queries regarding  
demonstration proposals should be emailed to the demonstrations chair  
Iadh Ounis (ounis [at] dcs.gla.ac.uk).
