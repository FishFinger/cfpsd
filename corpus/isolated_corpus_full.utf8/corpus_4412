                  Prague Stringology Conference 2009

              14th event of the Prague Stringology Club

                      http://www.stringology.org

                           Call for Papers

        Prague, Czech Republic, August 31 - September 2, 2009

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PSC'09 is the 14th event of the Prague Stringology Club. It is an
international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It
is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club, a research group
in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Czech
Technical University in Prague.


TOPICS:

Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the
processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years
and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last fifteen
years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due
in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms
make important contributions. The topics of the conference include but
are not limited to:

  * algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees
  * data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching
    in strings, images and trees
  * coding and data compression
  * bioinformatics
  * information retrieval
  * string processing algorithms in databases
  * searching for regularities
  * natural language processing



INVITED TALK:

  * "Combining Text Compression and String Matching: The Miracle of
    Self-Indexing" G. Navarro, University of Chile.



SUBMISSION:

Authors are cordially invited to submit their full papers (PostScript
or PDF format, 10-15 pages, A4 page format) by May 11, 2009. The paper
should start with the title, each author's name, affiliation, and
e-mail address, and a one-paragraph summary of the results and
ideas. The paper should be submitted via submission server.

For their final version the papers are required to be prepared using
our new LaTeX style available at http://www.stringology.org/pscproc2
which has an interface compatible to LNCS style.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  * Submission of Papers: May 11, 2009
  * Notification of Acceptance: June 26, 2009
  * Registration: July 12, 2009
  * Final Version Due: July 12, 2009

HISTORY:

PSC'09 was preceded by Prague Stringology Workshops in 1996-2000 and
by Prague Stringology Conferences in 2001-2006, 2008. Each year
proceedings are prepared for the conference. They are published by
Czech Technical University in Prague and are also available from the
PSC web pages. Selected papers from the later workshops were also
published in a special issue of the journal Kybernetika. Selected
papers from the 2002-2006, 2008 conferences were then published in the
Nordic Journal of Computing, Journal of Automata, Languages, and
Combinatorics, and International Journal of Foundations in Computer
Science.


LOCATION:

PSC'09 will be held in the Department of Computer Science &
Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague on August 31 -
September 2, 2009. The working language is English. As usual, accepted
papers will appear in conference proceedings published by the Czech
Technical University in Prague and distributed at the
conference. After further refereeing, selected papers will then be
published in an international journal.

The conference venue is located in the historical center of Prague on
which all cultural epochs left their mark and it is for centuries a
political, social, and cultural center of European significance.
