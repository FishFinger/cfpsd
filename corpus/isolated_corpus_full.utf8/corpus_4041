Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

SECOND GLOBAL STUDIES CONFERENCE
Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates     
30 May to 1 June 2009     
http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com     

The Global Studies Conference and Global Studies Journal are devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization. The conference and journal attempt to do this from many points of view, from many locations in the world, and in a wide-angle kaleidoscopic fashion.

Plenary speakers include:     
	*Georges Corm, Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon      
	*Lena Jayyusi, Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates      
	*Habibiul Haque Khondker, Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates      
	*Vibodh Parthasarathi, Centre for Culture, Media and Governance, New Delhi, India      
	*Mouin Rabbani, International Crisis Group, Amman, Jordan      
	*George Ritzer, University of Maryland, College Park, USA     

In addition, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed Global Studies Journal. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 11 January 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Dubai in 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Jan Nederveen Pieterse     
University of Illinois, Urbana, USA     
For the Advisory Board, Global Studies Conference and Global Studies Journal
