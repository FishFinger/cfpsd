Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

5th biennial conference of the European Association of Chinese Linguistics
hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology,
Department of Linguistics. 

We invite abstracts for 20-minute talks (plus a 10-minute discussion) in all areas of Chinese linguistics (i.e., phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, lexicography, dialectology, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, acquisition, typology, writing, history of Chinese linguistics), including the contact languages of China. Abstracts may also be submitted for the special panels outlined below, as well as for panels organized by groups of participants. Abstracts in the field of Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language will not be considered.

Confirmed keynote speakers:

Bernard Comrie (Leipzig)
Alain Peyraube (Paris)

Special panels:

1. On marking transitivity paradoxes in Sinitic languages and syntactic fluidity
An intriguing problem exists in Chinese linguistics whereby many Sinitic languages make use of the same exponent to mark both agent and object NPs - as in the case of passive and disposal constructions, while still others do not (morpho-)syntactically differentiate (certain) transitive from intransitive structures. The aim of this panel is to address such cases of fluidity in syntactic treatment from all possible viewpoints, including descriptive, typological, historical and theoretical. To broaden our knowledge of these related phenomena, contributions which discuss language data from varieties of Sinitic other than standard Mandarin are particularly welcomed.

Conveners: Hilary Chappell (Hilary.ChappellATehess.fr) and Rint Sybesma (R.P.E.SybesmaATlet.leidenuniv.nl)

2. Classifier/classification in Chinese 
convener: Thekla Wiebusch (thekla.wiebuschAThotmail.fr)
