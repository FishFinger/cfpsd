Meeting Description:

A two-day workshop will be held at Potsdam University as part of the activities
within the special research group SFB 632 'Information Structure', funded by the
German Science Foundation (DFG). The workshop aims at bringing together
descriptive and theoretical perspectives on the analysis of predicate focus,
where we understand predicate focus as a cover term for a number of related, or
even identical phenomena that are discussed in the literature under various
headings, such as verum focus, auxiliary focus, polarity focus, focus on tense
and aspect, event focus, and narrow focus on the lexical verb. What all these
instances of predicate focus have in common is that they are used to highlight
aspects of the verbal or functional meaning of a clause, as opposed to the
highlighting of arguments and adjuncts, which figures more prominently in the
literature. 

2nd Call for Papers - Workshop on Predicate Focus, Verum Focus, Verb Focus

Predicate Focus, Verum Focus, Verb Focus: Similarities and Differences

Among the many interesting aspects of predicate focus are the following:
- Crosslinguistically, predicate focus is often grammatically unmarked and
subject to contextual resolution: Why is predicate focus not obligatorily marked?
- If marked, predicate foci tend to involve non-canonical strategies that differ
from focus marking on arguments and adjuncts. A frequently attested means of
marking predicate focus is the use of specific (ad)verbal focus markers in form
of special stem forms, inflections, affixes, or adverbal particles. Additional
means of marking predicate focus include nominalization, sometimes accompanied
by movement, or particular morphological markers: Why is predicate focus marked
differently from nominal argument/adjunct focus?
- Some languages show an affinity between focus on the truth value, on the
tense/aspect, and on the lexical verb in that all three instances of focus are
grammatically marked in the same way: What are the structural or semantic
reasons behind this affinity?
- Some languages mark predicate focus and all-new/thetic utterances in the same
way: What is the semantic connection between theticity and predicate focus?
- In some languages, discourse particles can be used for emphasizing the truth
or factualness of the event reported, so that they look like markers of
verum/polarity focus: What is the semantic relation between discourse particles
and markers of predicate focus?

From a semantic point of view it is not clear why predicate focus should differ
from argument/ adjunct focus. While predicate focus involves semantically
unsaturated expressions and might therefore involve more complexity in the focus
semantic component, the modeling of predicate focus as such is not different
from that of argument foci. One goal of the workshop is therefore to explore
what are the structural or semantic factors behind the special behavior of
predicate focus.

We invite submissions reporting on descriptive and/or theoretical work relating
to the structural and semantic nature of predicate focus. We particularly
encourage submissions that include discussions of lesser investigated languages. 

In addition to the various issues raised above, contributions to the workshop
could focus on, but are not limited to, the following questions:
- What are the possible focus readings observed with verb-specific focus markers
expressing predicate focus in different languages?
- Is it possible to give a unified account of the meaning contribution of such
verb-specific focus markers in different languages?
- How are verb focus, auxiliary focus and verum/polarity focus expressed in
isolating languages, e.g. in South East Asian?
- Is there really a systematic ambiguity between narrow focus on the verb, on
the one hand, and focus on tense/aspect or the truth value, on the other?
- How do markers of predicate focus interact with other grammatical categories,
such as negation, argument/adjunct focus, sentence type and aspect?
- Can markers of predicate focus occur in embedded environments?
- To what extent can discourse particles be used as markers of predicate focus?

Invited speaker: Tom Güldemann (Universität Zürich)

We are planning to have slots of 45 minutes per speaker, including 10 minutes of
discussion. Depending on the number of accepted papers, the organizers reserve
the right to reduce the individual slots to 35 minutes.

Abstract submissions should reach us no later than 1 June 2008. An author may
submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts must be at most 2
pages in 12-point font with 1'' margins, including data and references. Authors
are requested to submit an anonymous copy of the abstract as pdf-attachment to
the following address: hole@uni-potsdam.de. The name of the pdf file should be
the author(s)'s name(s): name.pdf

The body of the email should contain the following information:
1. Name(s) of author(s)
2. Title of talk
3. Affiliation(s)
4. E-mail address(es)

Important dates:
1 June 2008: deadline for abstract submissions
15 July 2008: notification of acceptance
14-15 November 2008: Workshop in Potsdam

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

We welcome submissions that address problems of East Asian linguistics from a
theoretical perspective. A special session on 'Word-order variation and
universal grammar - areal, dialectal and information-structural perspectives'
will be held on the first day of the workshop. Each paper will be allotted 30
minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for discussion. 

Last Call for Papers - TEAL5 (Theoretical East Asian Linguistics)

General Session:
Submissions from any domain of grammar are welcome

Special Session:
'Word-order variation and universal grammar - areal, dialectal and
information-structural perspectives'

Selection of papers is based on anonymous review of abstracts. A selection
committee will be formed to review the submitted abstracts which are considered
by the reviewers to be of high interest to the development of theoretical East
Asian linguistics and linguistic theory in general. Please follow these
guidelines to submit your abstracts:

All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two
single-spaced pages, complete with examples and bibliography. All texts should
fit within a US letter-size or A4 page, with 1-inch/2.5-cm margin all around.
Each abstract should start with the title (centered) at top, followed by 3
single-spaced blank lines, above the main text. Use font size 12 throughout,
preferably in Times or Times New Roman. Romanize all Asian texts, and avoid
Asian character fonts unless absolutely necessary.

Please leave your name and affiliation out of the abstract (but keep 3 blank
lines between title and text). At most one single-authored work and one
joint-authored work per person will be accepted for presentation.

The body of your email message should include the following information:
paper title
name(s) of the author(s)
affiliation(s)
(a single) e-mail address for correspondence
general session/special session [choose one]

Abstract submission is by email-attachment only. We cannot accept submissions by
postal mail. Save your abstract as a PDF, DOC, or RTF file. Documents in other
formats must be converted before submission. Name your abstract with your last
name followed by the suffix pdf, doc, or rtf (e.g., huang.pdf, kim.doc, or
watanabe.rtf).

Send your abstract to:
teal5@ling.uni-potsdam.de

The TEAL Workshop was first launched in 1990 at the University of California,
Irvine as a mid-size workshop intended to foster research on East Asian
linguistics. It has been an important forum for presenting new theories and
exchanging novel ideas that bear on East Asian languages with theoretical
interests. Since 2002, the TEAL Workshop has been an international event. It was
held at Doshisha University, Japan in 2002, at National Tsing Hua University,
Taiwan in 2004, and at Harvard University, USA in 2005. Last year TEAL was held
in conjunction with the Sixth GLOW in Asia.

Important dates:

Deadline for abstract submissions: April 30th 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 15th 2008
Workshop: September 10th/11th 2008

Local organizers:
Daniel Hole (Universität Potsdam)
Malte Zimmermann (Universität Potsdam)
