INTERSPEECH 2007 - CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS - CALL FOR TUTORIALS

                      August  27-31 2007
                       Antwerp, Belgium
                 http://www.interspeech2007.org

INTERSPEECH 2007 is the eighth conference in the annual series of
INTERSPEECH events and also the tenth biennial EUROSPEECH conference. The
conference is jointly organized by scientists from the Netherlands and
Belgium, and will be held in Antwerp, Belgium, August 27-31, 2007, under the
sponsorship of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA).

The INTERSPEECH meetings are considered to be the top international
conferences in spoken language processing, with more than 1000 attendees
from universities, industry, and government agencies. The conference offers
the prospect of meeting the future leaders of our field, exchanging ideas,
and exploring opportunities for collaboration, employment, and sales through
keynote talks, tutorials, technical sessions, exhibits, and poster sessions.
In recent years the INTERSPEECH meetings have taken place in a number of
exciting venues including most recently Pittsburgh, Lisbon, Jeju Island
(Korea), Geneva, Denver, Aalborg (Denmark), and Beijing.

CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS

ISCA, together with the INTERSPEECH 2007 organizing committee, would like to
encourage submission of Special Session proposals for the upcoming
conference, covering interdisciplinary topics and/or important new emerging
areas of interest related to the main conference topics:

  Human speech production and perception
  Human speech communication
  Speech coding and speech enhancement
  Speech and audio signal processing
  Automatic speech and speaker characterization
  Speech synthesis
  Automatic speech recognition
  Speech technology applications
  Speech and multimodal resources
  Other relevant topics

Persons who would like to organize a special session are invited to submit a
one-page proposal to special_sessions <at> interspeech2007 <dot> org on or
before November 15, 2006.

Special sessions will be allocated one time slot of two hours. In
exceptional cases two consecutive time slots may be allocated. Proposals
should clearly describe the topic and the format of the session and explain
why the topic cannot be covered appropriately in one or more regular
sessions. Proposals also should include a list of at least ten names of
independent persons or research groups who can be expected to make
contributions to the special session. 
All papers submitted for Special Sessions will undergo the normal peer
reviewing process organized by the Scientific Committee of the conference.

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

We also encourage proposals for three-hour tutorials to be held on August
27, 2007. Those interested in organizing a tutorial should send a one-page
description of the proposed tutorial to
tutorials <at> interspeech2007 <dot> org on or before January 8, 2007.

Proposals for tutorials should contain the following information:

       * Title of the tutorial
       * Summary and relevance
       * The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
         the tutorial speakers, with a one-paragraph statement describing the
         research interests and areas of expertise of the speaker(s)
       * Any special requirements for technical needs (display projector,
         computer infrastructure, etc.)
