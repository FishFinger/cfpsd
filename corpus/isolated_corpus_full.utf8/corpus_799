Call Deadline: 23-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

The fourth MLMI workshop is coming to Brno in the Czech Republic, following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005) and Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction. 

MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007), which will take place in Prague on June 25-27, 2007.  

Important dates:

Submission of full papers:  23 February 2007
Submission of extended abstracts:  23 March 2007
Submission of demonstration proposals:  23 March 2007
Acceptance decisions:  17 April 2007
Workshop:  28-30 June 2007

Workshop topics:

MLMI'07 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers), posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine learning and multimodal interaction:
 - human-human communication modeling;
 - human-computer interaction modeling;
 - speech processing;
 - image and video processing;
 - multimodal processing, fusion and fission;
 - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling;
 - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization;
 - annotation and browsing of multimodal data;
 - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above.

Satellite events:

MLMI'07 will feature special sessions and satellite events such as the Summer school of the European Masters in Speech and Language (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/emasters/) and the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge II (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlincol1/SSC2/).  To propose other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please contact the organizing committee.

Guidelines for submission:

In common with the previous MLMI workshops, revised versions of selected papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

Submissions are invited in one of the following formats:
 - full papers for oral or poster presentation (12 pages);
 - extended abstracts for poster presentation only (1-2 pages);
 - demonstration proposals (1-2 pages).

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/, following the Springer LNCS format for proceedings and other multiauthor volumes (http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0).

Venue:

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital of Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the country's judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of almost four hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also the cultural center of the region. 

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km).

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental (http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet part of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The local organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology (http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
