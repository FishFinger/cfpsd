-------- FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION  ----------------------

INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SPOKEN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION

IWSLT - 15-16 October 2007, Trento, Italy

http://iwslt07.itc.it

This year's  IWSLT workshop continues  the tradition of  organizing an
open evaluation campaign for spoken language translation followed by a
scientific workshop, in which  both system descriptions and scientific
papers  are  presented.    IWSLT's  evaluations  are  not  competition
oriented but,  on the  contrary, their goal  is to  foster cooperative
work  and  scientific  exchange.   In  this  respect,  IWSLT  proposes
challenging research tasks and an open experimental infrastructure for
the scientific community working on spoken language translation.

Evaluation

The  IWSLT  2007  Evaluation  Campaign will  feature  two  challenges,
namely,  the translation  of spontaneous  conversations in  the travel
domain from Italian  and Chinese-to English, as well  as two classical
tasks, that is,  the translation of read speech  in the travel domain,
from Arabic  and Japanese into  English.  For all  tasks, participants
will  be provided  with  training and  development  data sets,  useful
linguistic resources, and links  to open software tools for developing
state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems.  In contrast
with  other MT  evaluation  campaigns, input  for  translation is  not
written text but transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition
systems.    Translation  systems  able   to  process   multiple  input
hypotheses will be  able to use n-best lists  and word-graphs produced
by ASR systems.

Workshop

The IWSLT  2007 Workshop will take  place in the  historical centre of
Trento,  on 15-16 October.    The  two-day   gathering   will  include
presentations of systems and research papers, as well as invited talks
and  discussion panels.   Submissions of  technical papers  are highly
encouraged. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-       Text and speech translation systems
-       Word alignment methods
-       MT evaluation
-       Integration of ASR and MT
-       Enriched speech translation output
-       Syntax-based MT
-       Re-ordering models
-       Open source software for MT
-       Search algorithms for MT
-       Language resources for MT
-       Task adaptation and portability in MT
