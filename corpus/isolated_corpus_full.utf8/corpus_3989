Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Psycholinguistics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 08-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

This conference in the tradition of Syntax of the World's Languages seeks to
bring together researchers working on the documentation or analysis of
morphological data from less widely studied languages to broaden the empirical
scope of morphological theory. 

Call for Papers

Contributions are expected to be based either on new data, new generalizations,
or new approaches to analysis. All major theoretical frameworks are equally
welcome, as is work done in analytical frameworks developed in typology or field
linguistics.

Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:
- The Structure of Syncretism
- Productivity in Derivation and Compounding
- Nonconcatenative and Prosodic Morphology
- Systematic and Idiosyncratic Aspects of Allomorphy
- Affix Order
- Boundaries of Morphology to Phonology and Syntax

Papers that adopt a diachronic/historical-comparative perspective or that
discuss language-contact effects are also welcome, as are papers which study the
morphology of understudied languages from the psycholinguistic or
neurolinguistic side.

The fifth meeting of the network which takes place immediately after the
conference (June 14) is also open to the public.

We invite abstracts for 40 minutes presentations (including discussion).
Abstracts should be anonymous, at most one page long (with an optional second
page for data and references), and should be sent as a pdf attachment to:
doreengeorgi[Ã¦t]gmx.de

Notification of Acceptance: February 28 2008
