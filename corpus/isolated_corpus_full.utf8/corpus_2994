WORKSHOP: PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FOR TEXT AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING

9 July 2008, Helsinki, in conjunction with the ICML/UAI/COLT

CALL FOR PAPERS:  *** NOTE THE EXTENDED DEADLINE ***

Abstract submission deadline: 7 May 2008 (extended from 30 April)
Notification to authors: 22 May 2008 (extended from 15 May)
Final version: 30 June 2008
Workshop: 9 July 2008

this page for updates)

CONTEXT: The workshop is part of the Thematic Programme "Leveraging =

Complex Prior Knowledge for Learning" of the PASCAL-2 European Network =

of Excellence starting in March 2008.

GOALS: The aim of the workshop is to present and discuss recent advances =

in machine learning approaches to text and natural language processing =

that capitalize on rich prior knowledge models in these domains.

MOTIVATION: Traditionally, in Machine Learning, a strong focus has been =

put on data-driven methods that assume little a priori knowledge on the =

part of the learning mechanism. Such techniques have proven quite =

effective not only for simple pattern recognition tasks, but also, more =

surprisingly, for such tasks as language modeling in speech recognition =

using basic n-gram models. However, when the structures to be learned =

become more complex, even large training sets become sparse relative to =

the task, and this sparsity can only be mitigated if some prior =

knowledge comes into play to constrain the space of fitted models. We =

currently see a strong emerging trend in the field of machine learning =

for text and language processing to incorporate such prior knowledge for =

instance in language modeling (e.g. through non-parametric Bayesian =

priors) or in document modeling (e.g. through hierarchical graphical =

models). There are complementary attempts in the field of statistical =

computational linguistics (e.g in statistical machine translation) to =

build hybrid systems that do not rely uniquely on corpus data, but also =

exploit some form of a priori grammatical knowledge, bridging the gap =

between purely data-oriented approaches and the traditional purely =

rule-based approaches, that do not rely on automatic corpus training, =

but only indirectly on human observations about linguistic data. The =

domain of text and language processing thus appears as a very promising =

field for studying the interactions between prior knowledge and raw =

training data, and this workshop aims at providing a forum for =

discussing recent theoretical and practical advances in this area.

TOPICS: The workshop aims at presenting a diversity of viewpoints on =

prior knowledge for language and text processing. Discussion of the =

following topics, techniques and issues is encouraged (non-limitative):

     * Prior knowledge for language modeling, parsing, translation

     * Topic modeling for document analysis and retrieval

     * Parametric and non-parametric Bayesian models in NLP

     * Graphical models embodying structural knowledge of texts

     * Complex features/kernels that incorporate linguistic knowledge; =

kernels built from generative models

     * Limitations of purely data-driven learning techniques for text =

and language applications; performance gains due to incorporation of =

prior knowledge

     * Typology of different forms of prior knowledge for NLP (knowledge =

embodied in generative Bayesian models, in MDL models, in ILP/logical =

models, in linguistic features, in representational frameworks, in =

grammatical rules=85)

     * Formal principles for combining rule-based and data-based =

approaches to NLP

     * Linguistic science and cognitive models as sources of prior knowledge

FORMAT: The workshop will consist of a mix of submitted papers, invited =

talks, and discussion/panels in which different viewpoints will be =

emphasized.

CALL FOR PAPERS: Researchers interested in presenting their work at the =

workshop should send an email (preferably plain text or pdf attachment) =

to ws_pktlp@xrce.xerox.com with the following information:

TITLE
AUTHORS
ABSTRACT (corresponding to approximately two plain text pages)

Note: In case you experience problem with the above email alias, please =

contact: marc (dot) dymetman (at) xrce (dot) xerox (dot) com

We expect speakers to provide a final version of their paper before end =

of June for inclusion on the workshop home page, and authors will be =

encouraged to read the included papers prior to the meeting. A compiled =

set of papers will be distributed as working notes at the workshop.
