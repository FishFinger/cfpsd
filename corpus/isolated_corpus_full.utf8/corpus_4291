Call for Papers 

==================
==== OVERVIEW ==== 
==================
The Human Media Interaction (HMI) department of the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering  (ICST) are pleased to announce the Third International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment to be held on June 22-24, 2009 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

INTETAIN 09 intends to stimulate interaction among academic researchers and commercial developers of interactive entertainment systems. We are seeking long (full) and short (poster) papers as well as proposals for interactive demos. In addition, the conference organisation aims at an interactive hands-on session along the lines of the Design Garage that was held at INTETAIN 2005. Individuals who want to organise special sessions during INTETAIN 09 may contact the General Chair, Anton Nijholt (a.nijholt@ewi.utwente.nl).

The global theme of this third edition of the international conference is âPlayful interaction, with others and with the environmentâ.

Contributions may, for example, contribute to this theme by focusing on the Supporting Device Technologies underlying interactive systems (mobile devices, home entertainment centers, haptic devices, wall screen displays, information kiosks, holographic displays, fog screens, distributed smart sensors, immersive screens and wearable devices), on the Intelligent Computational Technologies used to build the interactive systems, or by discussing the Interactive Applications for Entertainment themselves.

==== Journal Special Issue ====

We have secured a special issue of a journal devoted to Intetain 2009, which will publish a selection of the best papers. More information will follow.
