Meeting Description:

Twenty-Fourth International Conference
CerLiCO Cercle Linguistique du Centre et de l'Ouest
Universit=E9 Fran=E7ois-Rabelais, Tours, France  /  4 Friday  - 5 Saturday =
June 2010

Transcribing, Writing, Formalising:

In order to become a science, linguistics eventually departed from philolog=
y. Having turned away from publishing and commenting on texts, it has redef=
ined its field of observation outside vernacular writings and started compa=
ring sound forms. Does it give access to all languages (at whatever stage i=
n their evolution), whether they should have had a written form or not? Thi=
s act that founded the subject can be found at work both in the reconstruct=
ing approach of comparatists, who put forward a transcription of conjecture=
d forms and in the field work of Boas, Bloomfield and Sapir in North Americ=
a, and Troubetskoy in the Caucasus.

The 24th CerLiCO International Conference will focus on linguistics at the =
moment of its creation, in its genesis and its effects, in an attempt to un=
derstand its object. In this perspective it will discuss three fundamental =
notions:

-Transcribing: This amounts to ponder the significance of the conversion of=
 a sound signal into a graphic representation. In addition to phonetics and=
 phonology, the following notions will be discussed: figuration (semiotics,=
 sign language?), acoustics (sound capture and processing, visualisation?) =
and anthropology (the introduction of writing in languages belonging to the=
 oral tradition, predominance of graphic representations in scholarly expre=
ssion).

-Writing: What are the relations between a conventional graphic system of r=
epresentation and the structures of languages (phonological, morphological,=
 syntactic, semantic?)? The relation between spelling and sound, the spelli=
ng conventions and the creation of the IPA partake of an analogical, descri=
ptive notation that led to inventing such tools as the dictionary without e=
xplaining the way languages really work.=20

-Formalising: This answers the necessity of an explanatory approach that wi=
ll lead to the construction of a system-and no longer a mere inventory. A s=
ystem possessing its own internal rules and having universal value in time,=
 space and society. This could be said of Saussure's algebraic linguistics,=
 parts of which can be assessed by automatic processing.=20

Call for Papers:

Presentations will last 25 minutes and will be followed by a 15 minute-disc=
ussion. The Conference will include a poster session, and there will be abo=
ut 15 presentations altogether. The Proceedings will be published in 2010 i=
n Travaux Linguistiques du CerLiCO, Vol. 23, Presses Universitaires de Renn=
es.

Submissions should include, in addition to the author's institutional affil=
iation and e-mail address, an anonymous abstract of around 500 words / 3,00=
0 signs, with a few references attached. Authors should specify whether the=
y wish to present a paper or a poster. The abstracts will be posted on the =
CerLiCO website and sent to participants on registration for the Conference=
.

Submissions should be sent to Gilles Col : col@univ-tours.fr no later than =
15 September 2009

Information about the Conference will be posted on the CerLiCO website: htt=
