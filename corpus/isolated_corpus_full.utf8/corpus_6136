Full Title: AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples 


Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2009 

AlterNative is announcing a general call for papers to be published in
Volume 6, 2010. 

AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples is a
multidisciplinary peer-reviewed journal. It aims to present Indigenous
worldviews from native Indigenous perspectives. It is dedicated to the
analysis and dissemination of native Indigenous knowledge that uniquely
belongs to cultural, traditional, tribal and aboriginal peoples as well as
first nations, from around the world. 

Submissions responding to this general call for papers should relate to one
or more of themes of the journal:	
-	Origins 
-	Place
-	Peoples
-	Community 
-	Culture
-	Traditional and oral history
-	Heritage
-	Colonialism
-	Power
-	Intervention
-	Development
-	Self-determination

AlterNative particularly encourages Indigenous scholars to contribute
submissions. Specialists and practitioners working on Indigenous issues are
also welcome.

Submission and Deadlines
AlterNative primarily publishes substantive articles (up to 7000 words)
that address a particular indigenous topic or theme. Each article should
include a 100 -150 word abstract. Please visit our website for complete
author guidelines and our online submission portal.

We also publish short, timely commentaries (up to 3500 words) that address
critical issues, reviews of Indigenous books and edited volumes, and we aim
to include one article published in a native language in each issue. Please
contact us directly if you are interested in authoring these types of article.

We accept submissions throughout the year through our online portal;
however, for consideration in our first general issue of 2010, articles
should reach us no later than 31st December 2009. 

For all the details, author, please visit our website
http://www.alternative.ac.nz 
Or contact us directly on editors@alternative.ac.nz

Please note:  All submissions will be subject to our peer-review process.
The Editors retain the discretion at all stages of the publications process
to accept or reject an article.
