               CALL FOR POSTERS & DEMOS:

       Biomedical Text Mining and Collaboration

        21-22 February 2008, Glasgow, Scotland

   http://www.bioinformatics-scotland.org/txt_mining/

      ***Submission deadline: 28 January 2008***

         ***Prize for best student poster***

******************************************************


In connection with the workshop Finding the Hidden Knowledge: =

Text mining for biology and medicine, to be held in Glasgow =

(Scotland) 21-22 February 2008, there will be a hosted poster =

and demo session with refreshments.  The poster and demo session =

is open to interested authors from all sectors (e.g. research, =

industry, health).  There will be a prize for the best student =

poster.


CALL DETAILS
------------

The electronic availability of biomedical publications has led =

to a surge of interest in using text mining (TM) as a way of =

accessing this ever expanding knowledge store.

It is clear that future advances in understanding of biomedical =

issues will rely on the discovery of interconnections of data =

and models, which are as yet unrecognised.  TM will provide a =

major contribution to joining up diverse experimental evidence =

and will give new insights into biological processes.

Assembling a picture of the mechanisms of life in a systems or =

pathway context, for example, can be greatly facilitated by the =

use of tools such as intelligent search and knowledge =

distillation over very large document collections.

However, effective tools require cooperation between the =

designers and the users.  This workshop aims to bring the =

biomedical and TM communities together by showcasing the =

possible applications of TM while opening up dialogue that will =

facilitate specification of use cases to drive the next =

generation of applications.

Interested parties from all sectors (e.g. research, industry, =

health) are invited to submit posters or demos on text mining, =

methods which could be adapted for text mining, and aspects of =

biology and health that could benefit from text mining.

We invite posters on original work and work in progress, =

position posters, etc.  Creativity and imagination are =

encouraged.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Approaches to information retrieval, extraction and
   summarisation for biomedical text
* Term identification and normalisation for biomedical text
* Incorporating knowledge, e.g. ontologies, into extraction
   systems
* POS tagging, parsing and shallow parsing for biomedical text

* Specific challenges for TM in the biomedical domain
* General vs. specific solutions for subdomains and subproblems
* Accessing information in full papers
* Accessing information in tables, figures and captions

* Building databases based on information published in textual
   form
* Extracting pathways from text and linking pathways to text
* Building and maintaining ontologies for the biomedical domain
* TM vs. hand curated databases and ontologies

* Interactive tools for annotating biomedical texts
* Interactive tools for database curation, ontology building
* Bootstrapping assistive tools from small amounts of text
* Unsupervised and partially supervised learning

* Difficulties and solutions in eliciting user requirements
* Reconciling annotation and curation
* User interface design for annotation and curation
* Incorporating TM into research and curation workflows

* Assessing impact of assistive technologies on the end task
* Impact of information extraction on research and curation
* Impact of summarisation on on research on curation
* Impact of extraction on ontology building and maintenance


SUBMISSIONS
-----------

Abstracts should be in MSWord or PDF format and no longer than =

300 words. The submission should include the title, authors, =

affiliation, contact details for the corresponding author, and =

the description of the poster (abstract). The posters chosen =

based on this abstract will be displayed at the workshop and =

included in a workshop booklet.

Please email submissions to <fthk2008@googlemail.com> and =

indicate whether you are a student and wish to be considered for =

the prize for the best student poster.  Submissions do not need =

to be anonymised.


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------

* POSTER ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 28 January 2008
* Notification of acceptance: 4 February 2008
* Workshop Dates: 21-22 February 2008


PRIZE FOR BEST STUDENT POSTER
