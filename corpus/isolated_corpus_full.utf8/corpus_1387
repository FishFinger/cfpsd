Call for contributions to participate to the MEDinfo 2007 Workshop

Models of trust for health websites

Organised by 
Health on the Net Foundation (www.hon.ch), Geneva 14, Switzerland
and
Service of Medical Informatics, Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland

Célia Boyer, Natalia Grabar, Arnaud Gaudinat, Antoine Geissbühler


Description: 

Nowadays, one of the major concerns in the field of medicine is
patient safety, which can be addressed through various fields of
medical activity, such as organization and analysis of clinical
trials, public care, prescription and medicine compatibility, medical
imaging, patient information and education. This workshop is devoted
to the management of health information for the general public that
can be found on the web, i.e. the management of health
websites. Following the recent development of the web, the situation
in the medical arena is evolving, particularly since the content
proposed by such websites can have a direct impact on the user's
well-being. Indeed, millions of documents are available on the web,
and users are often overwhelmed by the mass of information. Moreover,
the quality of information is uneven - a fact sometimes ignored by
users. In this context, content reliability must be controlled in
order to help users to efficiently access information that is most
valuable to them. The objective of this workshop is to address
different aspects related to the problem of controlling the
reliability of health websites.

- Initiatives aimed at evaluating the reliability of health websites:
  ie., referencing, accreditation, popularity, self-regulation,
  collaboration in the analysis and comparison of health websites.

- Ways and means of rendering the control and evaluation visible and
  available to users: labels, seals, portals, P3P protocol and tools,
  etc.

- Criteria to determine the quality of health websites: transparency
  of information and information providers, document readability,
  traceability of content, quality of medical content, privacy, etc.

- Automation of quality assessment given the growing number of health
  websites.

- Manual versus automatic quality assessment: advantages and
  limitations.

- Solutions for dealing with the constantly changing content of health
  websites.

- Qualifications and capabilities of persons assessing the content
  reliability of health websites.

- Free versus lucrative solutions for the control of health website
  reliability.

- Promoting the visibility of high quality health websites.

- Multilingual issues of the reliability of health websites.
