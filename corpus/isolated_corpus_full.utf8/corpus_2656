           Announcement of Data Release and Second Call for Participation

                     Second i2b2 Shared-Task and Workshop
         Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data
        Obesity Challenge (A Shared-Task on Obesity): Who's obese and what
 =09=09co-morbidities do they (definitely/likely) have?

                         Data Release: 15 March, 2008
                         Evaluation: 23-25 June, 2008
                     Paper Submission: 1 September, 2008
                 Workshop: 7 November, 2008 in Washington, DC

 =09Organizer: Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside,
 =09=09i2b2, a National Center for Biomedical Computing
 =09=09=09Website: https://www.i2b2.org/NLP

The obesity challenge is a multi-class, multi-label classification task=20
focused on obesity and its co-morbidities. The data for the challenge=20
consist of discharge summaries from Partners Healthcare. All records have=
=20
been fully de-identified. Obesity information and co-morbidities have been=
=20
marked at a document level as present, absent, questionable, or=20
unmentioned in the documents. For each patient, both textual judgments,=20
i.e., what the text explicitly states about obesity and co-morbidities,=20
and intuitive judgments, i.e., what the text implies about obesity and=20
co-morbidities, are provided. The goal of the challenge is to evaluate=20
systems on their ability to recognize whether a patient is obese and what=
=20
co-morbidities they exhibit.

The obesity challenge opened to preregistration on February 1, 2008.=20
Training data for the challenge will be released in installments; the=20
first installment will be released on March 15, 2008. The rest of the=20
installments will follow soon after. Test data are scheduled to be=20
released for only three days and will be used only for evaluation=20
purposes. The results of the challenge will be presented at the workshop=20
organized by i2b2.

Evaluation Dates, File Formats, and Evaluation Metrics.

The obesity challenge evaluation will be on only the test data. Each team=
=20
is allowed to upload up to three system runs. System output is expected in=
=20
the form of standoff annotations, following the exact format of the ground=
=20
truth annotations provided by i2b2. Precision, recall, and f-measure will=
=20
be used as evaluation metrics.

Participants are asked to submit a short paper describing their system and=
=20
analyzing their performance. Authors of top performing systems and of=20
particularly novel approaches will be invited to present or demo their=20
systems at the workshop.
