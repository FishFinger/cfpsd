                 WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

          ACL-PASCAL Workshop on Textual Entailment and Paraphrasing


Date:      June, 28 (afternoon) and 29, 2007
Location:  Prague, in conjunction with ACL 2007

Workshop web page:   http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/WTEP
Conference web page: http://www.acl2007.org/
############################################################################


Based on a lot of resuests to postphone the submission deadline, we
extended the deadline to March 30, 2007.


Recognizing and generating textual entailment and paraphrase are regarded as
important technologies in a broad range of NLP applications, including machine 
translation, information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, 
question answering and text generation. Both textual entailment and paraphrasing 
address relevant aspects of natural language semantics. Entailment is a 
directional relation between two expressions in which one of them implies the 
other, whereas paraphrase is a relation in which two expressions convey essentially 
the same meaning. Indeed, paraphrase can be defined as bi-directional entailment. 
While it may be debatable how such semantic definitions can be made well-founded, 
in practice we have already seen evidence that such knowledge is essential for 
many applications. 

There have been two lines of workshops in this field. One is a series of three 
workshops on paraphrase -- in Tokyo 2001, in Sapporo at ACL-2003 and in Jeju at 
IJCNLP-2005.The other is the Workshop on Empirical Modeling of Semantic 
Equivalence and Entailment (at ACL-2005), and two workshops of the previous 
PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (2005 and 2006).
We combine those two lines of similar effort together at this workshop in order 
to see the convergence of the field and exchange ideas among a wider audience.
The workshop has two parts, one is the general session where submission is open, 
and the other is the concluding workshop of the 3rd PASCAL RTE Challenge. The 
program will include general session papers and selected presentations and a poster 
session of RTE-3 systems. See http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/ for 
details about the RTE-3 challenge (with result submission deadline on March 12).

This CFP calls for papers for the general session. Any research topic related to 
textual entailment and paraphrasing in any language is welcome. More specifically, 
topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Definitions of textual entailment and paraphrasing
* The relationship between the two problems
* Typology of entailment/paraphrasing
* Representation levels
* Utilizing background knowledge
* Acquisition methods (automatic and manual)
* Recognition and generation of textual entailment and paraphrasing
* Inference methods
* Existing and potential applications
* Computational modeling of linguistic theories of entailment/paraphrasing
* Open resources
* Evaluation methods
* Data analysis
