Ontology Learning and Knowledge Discovery Using the Web: Challenges and

Ontologies provide formal specifications of what might exist in a domain to
ensure reusability and interoperability of multiple heterogeneous systems.
Ontologies form an indispensable part of the Semantic Web standard stack.
While the Semantic Web is still our vision into the future, ontologies have
already found a myriad of applications such as document retrieval, question
answering, image retrieval, agent interoperability and document annotation.
In recent years, automatic ontology learning from text has provided support
and relief for knowledge engineers from the labourious task of manually
engineering of ontologies. Ontology learning research, an area integrating
advances from information retrieval, text mining, data mining, machine
learning and natural language processing, has attracted increasing interest=
s
from a wide spectrum of application domains (e.g. bioinformatics,
manufacturing). Being a rapidly growing area, it is crucial to collect the
recent advances in tools and technologies in ontology learning and related
areas.

Objective Of The Book

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The main objective of this book is to provide relevant theoretical
foundations, and disseminate new research findings and expert views on the
remaining challenges in ontology learning. In particular, the book focuses
on the following questions:
# Can ontology learning continue to rely on techniques borrowed from relate=
d
areas that were conceived for other purposes? Has the time arrived for us t=
o
look at certain peculiar requirements of ontology learning and develop
specific techniques to meet these requirements?
# Lightweight ontologies are the most common type of ontologies in a variet=
y
of existing Semantic Web applications (e.g. knowledge management, document
retrieval, communities of practice, data integration). Can these lightweigh=
t
ontologies be easily extended to formal ones? If so, how?
# The poor coverage, rarity and maintenance cost related to manually-create=
d
resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS) and text corpora
(e.g. BNC, GENIA corpus) have prompted an increasing number of researchers
to turn to dynamic Web data for ontology learning. There is currently a lac=
k
of study concentrating on the systematic use of Web data as background
knowledge for all phases of ontology learning. How do we know if we have th=
e
necessary background knowledge to carry out all our ontology learning tasks=
?
Where do we look for more background knowledge if we know that what we have
is inadequate?
# More and more practitioners in the domain of biology, health care,
chemistry, manufacturing, etc are looking up to ontology learning technique=
s
for solutions to their knowledge sharing and reusability needs. How much
more difficult is it to automatically learn ontologies from news articles,
as compared to clinical notes or biomedical literature? To what extent can
the current techniques meet the requirements of learning from texts across
different domains? Is the field of automatic ontology learning from text
ready for the industry?

This proposed book will be an invaluable resource as a library or personal
reference for a wide range of audience, including, graduate students,
researchers and industrial practitioners. Postgraduate students who are in
the process of looking for future research directions, and carving out thei=
r
own niche area will find this book particularly useful. Due to the detailed
scope and wide coverage of the book, it also has the potential of being an
upper-level course supplement for senior undergraduate students in
Artificial Intelligence, and a resource for lecturers in Knowledge
Acquisition, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Text Mining,
Information Extraction, and Ontology Learning.

t retrieval, communities of practice, data integration). Can these lightwei=
ght ontologies be easily extended to formal ones? If so, how?<br>

# The poor coverage, rarity and maintenance cost related to manually-create=
d resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS) and text corpora=
 (e.g. BNC, GENIA corpus) have prompted an increasing number of researchers=
 to turn to dynamic Web data for ontology learning. There is currently a la=
ck of study concentrating on the systematic use of Web data as background k=
nowledge for all phases of ontology learning. How do we know if we have the=
 necessary background knowledge to carry out all our ontology learning task=
s? Where do we look for more background knowledge if we know that what we h=
ave is inadequate?<br>

# More and more practitioners in the domain of biology, health care, chemis=
try, manufacturing, etc are looking up to ontology learning techniques for =
solutions to their knowledge sharing and reusability needs. How much more d=
ifficult is it to automatically learn ontologies from news articles, as com=
pared to clinical notes or biomedical literature? To what extent can the cu=
rrent techniques meet the requirements of learning from texts across differ=
ent domains? Is the field of automatic ontology learning from text ready fo=
r the industry?<br>

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before 15 DECEMBE=
R 2009, a 2-3 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the mission and conc=
erns together with a tentative organisation (i.e. section titles with secti=
on summaries) of their proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals will=
 be notified by 15 JANUARY 2010 about the status of their proposals. Author=
s of accepted proposals will be sent guidelines and templates to prepare th=
e full chapter of 8,000 - 10,000 words. Full chapters are expected to be su=
bmitted by 15 MARCH 2010. All submitted full chapters will be reviewed on a=
 double-blind review basis. All proposals and chapters should be typewritte=
n in English in APA style and be submitted in Microsoft Word=AE format to <=

unately, LaTex files cannot be accepted. Contributors may also be requested=
 to serve as reviewers for this project. This book is scheduled to be publi=
shed by IGI Global (formerly Idea Group Inc.). For additional information r=
