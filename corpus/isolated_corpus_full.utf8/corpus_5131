Meeting description
We are pleased to announce the Second ELC Postgraduate Conference on
English Linguistics(ELC2), to be held at the University of Vigo
(Spain) on 30-31 October 2009. ELC2 aims to provide linguistics
postgraduate students with an opportunity to present and discuss their
research in an informal and intellectually stimulating setting.

The conference is organised by postgraduate students from the English
Departments of the Universities of Vigo and Santiago de Compostela. It
is supported by these two universities and by the English Linguistics
Circle, a research network involving the following research teams:

    - Variation, Linguistic Change and Grammaticalisation (VLCG;
University of Santiago de Compostela; director: Prof. Teresa Fanego)
[http://www.usc-vlcg.es]
    - Spoken English Research Team at the University of Santiago de
Compostela (SPERTUS; University of Santiago de Compostela; director:
Ignacio Palacios Mart=EDnez) [http://www.usc.es/ia303/spertus]
