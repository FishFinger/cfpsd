The 5th International Workshop on "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND =

COGNITIVE SCIENCE"
(NLPCS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/workshops/nlpcs/nlpcs2008-cfp.html

12-13 June, 2008 - Barcelona =96 Spain

In conjunction with the 10th International Conference on Enterprise =

Information Systems (ICEIS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/


Co-Chairs
Bernadette Sharp, Staffordshire University, United Kingdom, =

B.Sharp@staffs.ac.uk
Michael Zock, CNRS, LIF, Marseille, France, michael.zock@lif.univ-mrs.fr


BACKGROUND

Realising that no single discipline will ever suffice to reveal the =

functioning of the human mind, cognitive science was born. The idea was =

to analyse complex behaviour (speaking, thinking, problem-solving) from =

different angles or levels and to build models that could account for them.


GOALS

While ambitious and intriguing, the idea looked promising enough to =

attract numerous researchers, and there were plenty of opportunities =

then to present this kind of work. Alas, the situation has changed, the =

discipline has lost speed during the last decade. And if the reasons for =

this are multiple, ranging from lack of results to unkept promises (=AB =

cognitive science =BB remaining wishful thinking rather than a widely =

shared way of doing research), the fact is that funding has become more =

and more scarce, and so have the opportunities to present work done =

within this framework.

In the meantime statistical approaches have gained in popularity, and =

evaluation has become an obligatory feature for presentation of work in =

the arena of computational linguistics. While there is no doubt that =

evaluation has certain qualities, it does not guarantee progress or =

insights per se. A broader perspective is needed. To get the necessary =

insights and to get the big picture, we probably need to get back to the =

framework in which we worked in those days, which means, we should adopt =

and integrate multiple viewpoints, that is, take a cognitive science =

approach. This is the goal of this workshop.


JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEW NAME AND RELATION TO THE TOPICS

The workshop used to be called NLUCS (Natural Language Understanding and =

Cognitive Science), yet, realising that this is too restrictive, we =

decided to rename it NLPCS (Natural Language Processing and Cognitive =

Science), as NLP is obviously more than just natural language =

understanding. Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Machine =

Translation, Question Answering, Text Summarization, Text Generation, =

etc. are all part of NLP or HLT (Human Language Technology), and they =

all go clearly beyond language understanding. This being so, it might be =

a valuable proposition to integrate them into the debate. In other =

words, we would like to widen the scope and provide a forum for all =

researchers of NLP working within the CS paradigm.

Also, while certain components (dictionaries, grammars, or ontologies) =

are very general, the way they are used varies considerably with the =

task. Hence it is important to show how the task reflects in the use of =

a given resource.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working =

within the paradigm of cognitive science

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

=95 Computational Models of NLP
=95 Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
=95 Evolutionary NLP
=95 Situated (embodied) NLP
=95 Multimodality in speech / text processing
=95 Text Summarization and Information Extraction
=95 Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
=95 Computer Assisted Language Learning
=95 Multi-Lingual Processing
=95 Pragmatics and NLP
=95 Speech Processing
=95 Tools and Resources in NLP
=95 Ontologies
=95 Text Mining
=95 Electronic Dictionaries
=95 Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives: =

full automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT), =

semi-automated processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs =

assisting people in their tasks), simulation of human cognitive process.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation =

in any of the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be =

accepted, and the length of the paper should not exceed 10 pages (5000 =

words). Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex =

format) are available at the ICEIS web site. =

http://www.iceis.org/paper_template.htm Postscript/RTF versions of the =

manuscript should be submitted through ICEIS web-based paper submission =

procedure: http://www.iceis.org/paper_submission.htm


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations of =

previously submitted papers that went through a double peer review =

process. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the form =

of a book.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper Submission: March 3, 2008
