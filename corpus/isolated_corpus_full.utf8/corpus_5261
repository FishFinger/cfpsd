Meeting Description:

The International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP) is one of a series of 
conferences with unique focus on Asian Language Processing. The conference aims 
to advance the science and technology of all the aspect of Asian Language 
Processing by providing a forum for researchers in different fields of language 
study all over the world to meet. The first meeting of IALP was held in 
Singapore in 1986 and was called the International Conference on Chinese 
Computing (ICCC). This meeting initiated the study of Chinese and Asian
languages processing in Singapore and resulted in the formation of COLIPS in 
Singapore in 1988, as well as the publication of the journal titled 'Journal of 
Chinese Language and Computing' since 1991.

Last year, IALP 2008 was held in Chiang Mai University, Thailand and the 
proceedings were indexed by ISTP/ISI. This year's IALP 2009 will be held in 
Singapore and is co-organized by COLIPS and IEEE Singapore Computer Chapter. 
The proceedings have been accepted by IEEE CPS (Conference Publication 
Services) for publication. IEEE CPS will submit it for indexing in EI, ISTP/ISI 
and Current Contents on Diskette (http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps)

IALP2009 is now organized into 6 tracks:
1.Linguistics and Language Studies
2.Computational Linguistics
3.Language Information Processing (Information extraction, analysis etc)
4.Language Technologies (Input, output, font, recognition, synthesis etc)
5.Computer-aided Language Learning
6.Machine Translation

Paper Submission:
The guidelines for paper submission are as follows:

Submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished 
work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be 
included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical 
strength, significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the 
attendees. Each submission will be reviewed by three program committee members. 
Accepted papers will be presented in one of the oral sessions or poster 
sessions as determined by the program committee. Papers must be written in 
English.

All submissions must be electronic and in Portable Document Format (PDF) only, 
using paper submission software at: https://www.softconf.com/a/IALP09/.

Format:
Full paper submissions should follow the IEEE Proceedings' format without 
exceeding six (6) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of 
the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's 
conference according to IEEE Proceedings' format, which will be available on 
the conference website soon. Submissions must conform to the official style 
guidelines, and they must be electronic in PDF.

As the reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the authors' names 
and affiliations. Authors should ensure that their identities are not revealed 
in any way in the paper. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will 
be rejected without review.
