Full Title: Sociolinguistics Symposium 18 
Short Title: SS18 

Date: 01-Sep-2010 - 04-Sep-2010
Location: Southampton, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Clare Mar-Molinero
Meeting Email: ss18@southampton.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ss18 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 16-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Sociolinguistics Symposia were begun in the 1970s by a group of
sociolinguists who saw the need for a forum to discuss research findings and to
debate theoretical and methodological issues concerning language in society. The
symposium has since grown into a large, international, biennial conference, now
attracting more than 600 participants. 

Call for Papers

The SS18 Organising Committee welcomes papers on any aspect of sociolinguistics.
Proposals related to the conference theme 'Negotiating Transnational Space &
Multilingual Encounters' are particularly welcome.

Three categories of proposal will be considered: 
- Individual papers
- Thematic panels
- Posters 
Proposals should be submitted via the SS18 website.

Each author may submit no more than one individual abstract and one co-authored
abstract. Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by the SS18 Scientific
Committee and will be evaluated in terms of their relevance to the theme of the
conference and/or their theoretical background and research design.

Papers and Posters:  

Papers describe original work; either completed research which has given rise to
substantial results, or the development of significant new methodologies,
orrigorous theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers
will be allocated 30 minutes (20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for
questions). The time limit will be strictly adhered to, in order to allow
movement between sessions.  

Posters may be a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking results, work in
progress or fieldwork, or when large amounts of data need to be displayed.
Poster presenters have the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with
attendees and to discuss their work in detail. Each presenter will be provided
with 120 x 90 cm of board space (portrait). They may also provide handouts with
examples or more detailed information. 

Submitting a Proposal for a Paper or Poster:

Proposals for a paper or for a poster have to be submitted under 'submission' on
our site. Before you can submit the title and abstract (maximum 500 words,
including references) you will first need to register and fill in your personal
information.  After having submitted your abstract, you will receive an
automatic notification of the receipt of your proposal.

Thematic Panels:

A panel is intended to cluster several independent papers around a central
theme. The participants submit their papers to the panel organiser a minimum of
4 weeks prior to the conference. This way papers can be circulated in advance to
all panel members which will guarantee a focused debate at the meeting itself.
All contributions adhere to the general presentation format of 20 minutes for
presentation + 10 minutes for discussion to allow for movement to other panels. 

Panel Organisers Should:

- Submit a proposal (see below) including the list of invited contributors
and/or discussants by the deadline (16 November 2009) and confirm that all
invited contributors have agreed to participate
- Coordinate the submission of abstracts by contributors (max. 500 words each)
before the same deadline as above
- Chair the session at SS18
- Act as mediators between the contributors and the SS18 Organising Committee
(ensuring, for example, that all speakers register for SS18 by the deadline for
speaker registration)

Submitting Panel Proposals:

Proposals for a thematic panel should be submitted electronically via the SS18
website. Before you can submit your proposal (up to a maximum of 900 words) you
will first need to register and fill in your personal information.

Your Proposal Should Include:

- The list of invited contributors and/or discussants (name, affiliation, email
 address)
- A maximum of 8 keywords covering subject, domain, methodology and paradigm
- The topic and how it relates to the conference themes
- Rationale for the panel and its aims and objectives
- Discussion questions
- How the session will be organised (discussion format, number of papers,
discussants/participants)
- A short list of key references

After having submitted your abstract, you will receive an automatic notification
of the receipt of your proposal.
