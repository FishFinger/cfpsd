Call Deadline: 13-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
A one-day, international, English-French bilingual conference entitled 'Language
Learning and Teaching in Multilingual and Multicultural Contexts' will be held
October 6, 2007 at the American University of Paris (AUP) in Paris, France. AUP,
with a student body that represents approximately one hundred nationalities and
a vast array of first, second, and third languages, will serve as a natural
meeting place for individuals interested in research on second language
acquisition and pedagogy in linguistically diverse settings. Whether "natural"
or "institutional", such settings provide both a challenge and an opportunity
for scholars and practitioners alike. The challenge lies in understanding the
processes involved in how adults learn a non-native language in such a
linguistically diverse environment and in identifying how to more efficiently
and effectively teach our students a non-native language given the variety of
languages and cultures involved. The opportunity lies in the growing awareness
of and interest in our world's multilingual and multicultural landscapes. The
goal of this conference is to discuss and build upon current research conducted
in these areas. 

Proposals for papers are welcome in either French or English. Papers will be
presented during two parallel sessions for 30 minutes (20 minutes for the
presentation and 10 minutes for questions). Abstracts should be submitted
electronically as an attached Word document.

In the body of the e-mail include: name(s) of proposer(s), full contact details
of the lead proposer (institutional affiliation, postal address, telephone
number, e-mail address), title of paper.

In the Word attachment include: title of the paper, text of the proposal (300
words or less including title and references).

Proposals should be sent to the relevant address below:
For proposals in English: rrast@aup.fr
For proposals in French: etaieb@aup.fr

Calendar for submissions:
Deadline for proposals: April 13, 2007
Notification of acceptance: May 18, 2007
Dissemination of program details: June 15, 2007
