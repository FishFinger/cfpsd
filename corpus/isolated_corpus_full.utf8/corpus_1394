- designing and evaluating dialogue systems

Submission

Deadline for receipt of poster/demo abstracts is 22 April 2007, 23:59 UTC.
(Since we have to close the system manually, submissions will probably be
accepted for a few hours after the deadline, but we're not making any promises.)
Submit your paper via the web at

http://www.easychair.org/DECALOG2007/

Before submitting you must register with the website and receive a password by
email; please do this well ahead of your submission, since email is sometimes
unreliable. You will also need to fill out a web form with the author details
and type in (or paste) a short plain-text abstract (up to 200 words), in
addition to uploading your full abstract.

The full abstract should be a PDF file, 2 pages long (including data, tables,
figures, and references), A4 paper size, 11pt Times font, 2.5 cm (1 inch)
margins, 2-column format. You may find it convenient to use the style files
provided by COLING/ACL 2006. Submission is NOT anonymous: please include the
authors' names, affiliations, and e-mails.

Submissions will not be peer-reviewed, but evaluated for relevance only by the
program committee chairs. Due to limited space at the workshop site, we ask
authors to limit their submissions to one poster/demo.

Proceedings

The accepted 2-page abstracts will be distributed in a proceedings volume at the
workshop.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/donation/fund-drive2007/ 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
