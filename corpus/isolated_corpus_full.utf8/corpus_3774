Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 05-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

As the key that opens the gates to all education, imagination embodies the
creative approach to language learning and teaching. Traditional methods are
rooted almost exclusively in linguistics and focus on syntactic rules,
memorization based on the lexicon, and practice in oral and silent reading.
Imaginative methods, on the other hand, embrace nontraditional approaches where
music, dance, art, theater, dreams and creative writing are indispensable
elements or pegs to the learning and teaching processes. These methods are
powerful in their ability to motivate and reach children and adults as well as
special populations such as persons with learning disabilities. By engaging the
imagination, we can effectively promote the students' creativity and
imagination, lead them to a higher level of cognitive development, and help them
reach a new level of intellectual possibilities. 

Call for Papers

This conference elaborates the above principles and exemplifies related methods
of instruction by bringing together scholars in the broad area of language and
imagination. While papers on the main topic are particularly welcome,
individuals are encouraged to submit abstracts on any subject in theoretical and
applied linguistics.

Submit abstracts in an anonymous, titled, single-spaced attachment of not more
than 425 words in length, with name, address and affiliation in the body of an
e-mail. Please send abstracts as a camera-ready attachment (in a Microsoft Word
file, if possible) to the conference coordinator. Within the body of the e-mail,
please also indicate any audio-visual equipment needed. Those wishing to propose
panels or special sessions should contact the conference chair (Ninah Beliavsky)
before submitting an abstract for the panel together with abstracts for each of
the constituent papers.
Time allotted will be 20 minutes for delivery of the paper plus 5 minutes
discussion.

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is January 5, 2009.

Conference Chair: Ninah Beliavsky (beliavsn@stjohns.edu)
