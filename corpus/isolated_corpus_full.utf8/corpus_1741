Meeting Description:

Languages and Linguistics section of the annual conference of the British
Association for Slavonic and East European Studies 2008 

Annual Conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies 2008

Call for Papers in Languages and Linguistics

The annual conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies (BASEES) will take place at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge
(UK), between 29-31 March 2008. Abstracts are invited for individual 20-minute
papers or for entire panels (2-3 papers) in any area of Slavonic philology,
linguistics, language teaching, and translation studies. The working languages
of the conference are English and Russian.

At this year's conference we had around thirty papers in formal linguistics,
historical linguistics, applied linguistics, semiotics, language teaching, and
translation studies presented by academics and graduate students from
institutions in the UK and abroad. The annual convention as a whole brings
together scholars from a wide range of disciplines including literary studies,
linguistics, cultural studies, history, economics, politics, sociology, film and
media studies as they pertain to Central and Eastern Europe and to the former
Soviet Union.

Abstracts for languages and linguistics papers or panels should be sent, with
full contact details, by 1 October 2007 to David Willis at:

dwew2@cam.ac.uk

or at the following address:

Department of Linguistics
University of Cambridge
Sidgwick Avenue
Cambridge
GB-CB3 9DA
United Kingdom

Second Call for Papers
 
Rightward Movement in a Comparative Perspective

The workshop is part of the 29th Annual Meeting of the German Society
for Linguistics (DGfS) at the University of Bamberg, Germany
(27th-29th February, 2008)

Organizers:
Manfred Sailer (University of Goettingen)
Heike Walker (University of Goettingen)
Gert Webelhuth (University of Goettingen)

Goals and background:

Phenomena of Rightward Movement (e.g. Extraposition, Heavy-NP-Shift) still raise
a lot of questions and problems in linguistic theory. The literature provides
competing analyses in which the constituent that appears in non-canonical
position is (1) base-generated and interpreted in situ, or it undergoes a
movement process (2) in the syntactic component or (3) on the level of PF
(Göbbel 2007). These theories make different predictions whether movement to the
right is subject to syntactic, semantic and pragmatic restrictions at all (see
the discussion in Buering and Hartmann 1997) and differ, partly extremely, with
respect to the mechanisms they provide for the semantic interpretation of the
dislocated constituent. Another controversial discussion concerns the cause of
these movements: in addition to purely syntactic triggers, prosodic and
psycholinguistic (e.g. Hawkins 1994) arguments are proposed (Gesetz der
wachsenden Glieder, preferences in production and parsing, etc.). The goal of
the workshop is to collect linguistic and psycholinguistic studies from
different languages in order to cast light on the following questions.

We invite contributions which address the following questions:

Can all phenomena of rightward movement be described as a uniform
cross-linguistic type of construction that is subject to universal restrictions
and which contrasts systematically with the type of leftward movement? Does each
rightward movement process need a trigger and what are possible triggers? Why
does rightward movement often correlate with the complexity of the moved
constituent and are the criteria for complexity the same across languages? In
which grammatical component does movement take place? Can a prosodic or
psycholinguistic trigger induce movements in the syntactic component?
What is the status of the moved constituent with respect to the semantic
integration and the discourse? Does word order in the sentence influence the
possibility and the characteristics of rightward movement?
