Journal of Natural Language Engineering

*** Call for special issue proposals ***


The area of Natural Language Engineering is following the trend of
many other areas, becoming highly specialised with a number of
application-orientated and narrow-domain topics emerging or growing in
importance. These developments, often coincident with a lack of related
literature, necessitate and warrant the publication of specialised
volumes focusing on a specific topic of interest to the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research community.

The journal of Natural Language Engineering (NLE) invites proposals for
special issues on a competitive basis on any topics about applied NLP
which have emerged as important developments in Natural Language
Engineering and which have attracted the attention of a number of
researchers or research groups. After the Call for Proposals for special
issues in 2006 which has resulted in two very high quality special issues,
we are pleased to announce another such call this year.

Topics could cover a variety of NLP methods, tasks and resources as well
as NLP-related applications but should focus on the practical
implications of operation on the large scale. Topics covering NLP methods,
tasks and resources could include but are not limited to POS tagging,
parsing, semantic role labelling, word sense disambiguation, anaphora
and coreference resolution, named entity recognition, natural =

language generation,
speech recognition, speech synthesis, multimodal processing, =

statistical methods
in Natural Language Engineering, machine learning, evaluation methodologies,
corpora and ontologies. Topics covering NLP applications could include
but are not limited to machine translation, translation memory and translat=
ion
tools, summarisation, information retrieval, information extraction, questi=
on
answering, text and web mining, opinion mining and NLP for biomedical
texts.

Calls for special issue proposals may be based on a successful
workshop or a body of work associated with a particular group or
section of the community. In all cases, however, the reviewing
process of the accepted proposals will be rigorous and all submissions
must be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Guest
Editorial Board or other suitable reviewers agreed by the NLE
Editors. In the case of papers previously submitted to workshops, the
Guest Editors will not be able to re-use previous workshop reviews.
In addition, the call for papers of the accepted proposals must be
open to all interested parties and all authors will be given equal
treatment; in the case of proposals based on previous workshops,
submissions cannot be limited to workshop participants only.

Interested editors have the option of preliminary feedback by
emailing expressions of interest accompanied by a brief description of
the intended special issue to the Executive Editor
(<mailto:R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk>R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk). He will give a brief
indication of whether the topic is appropriate to Natural Language
Engineering.

In the case of initial positive feedback, the prospective Guest Editors
will be asked to submit a proposal for a special issue which will be
reviewed by the Editors of the journal and by other members of the
Journal Editorial Board. At least one proposal will be selected on a
competitive basis for each call with the envisaged publication date for
the successful proposal(s) from this call on or after October 2009.

The proposal for a special issue should include a brief outline of
the field and rationale as to why it is important to launch a special
issue on the particular topic of interest. It should include a =

relevant literature
survey (related previous special issues, volumes, workshop and conference
proceedings) and should explain the added value of the proposed special iss=
ue
against the background of other relevant or competing publications and volu=
mes
(if applicable). It is desirable that a rough estimate on expected =

submissions to
the special issue be provided. The proposals should also include a tentative
Guest Editorial Board (it is desirable that one of the members of the =

Guest Editorial
Board be a member of the journal Editorial Board), tentative time-scale for=
 the
production of the special issue and information about the prospective
Guest Editors (relevant experience, publications etc.).


    Time-scale

- Deadline for submission of special issue proposals:
    15 December 2008
    (proposals to be emailed to
<mailto:R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk>R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk)

- Notification of acceptance/rejection:
    15 January 2009

- Final version of the successful proposal(s) and call for papers:
    31 January 2009
