Meeting Description:

This workshop seeks to attract work on resources and tools that span the range
of the Semitic language family as well as work on specific Semitic languages. 
It will also be a meeting for the newly formed ACL SEMITIC SIG. 

2nd and Revised Call for Papers
ACL 2007 Workshop on

Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages:
Common Issues and Resources

28th June, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic
NEW Submission deadline: 26 March 2007

Workshop Website: http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/~mros/casl07
Paper Submission Site: http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS3

The ACL 2007 Workshop on ''Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages:
Common Issues and Resources'' will be held in conjunction with the 45th
Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and will 
take place on June 28th in Prague, Czech Republic.

Scope and Topics:

The Semitic family includes many languages and dialects spoken by a large
number of native speakers (around 300 million). However, Semitic languages
as a whole are still understudied. The most prominent members of this family 
are Arabic (and its dialects), Hebrew, Amharic, Aramaic, Maltese and Syriac. 
Their shared ancestry is apparent through pervasive cognate sharing, a rich
and productive pattern-based morphology, and similar syntactic constructions.
An increasing body of computational linguistics work is starting to appear
for both Arabic and Hebrew. Arabic alone, as the largest member of the Semitic
family, has been receiving much attention lately via dedicated workshops and
conferences. Tools and resources for other Semitic languages are being created
at a slower rate. While corpora and some tools are necessarily
language-specific, ideally there should be more cross-fertilization among
research and development efforts for different Semitic languages.

The proposed workshop aims to bring together researchers working on Semitic
languages to share and discuss common issues and approaches to the processing of
these languages. We invite submissions of novel work on all Semitic languages,
including work describing recent state-of-the-art NLP systems and work
leveraging resource and tool creation for the Semitic language family. We
especially welcome submissions on work that crosses individual language
boundaries and heightens awareness amongst Semitic-language researchers of
shared challenges and common solutions. The workshop will also include a meeting
of the Special Interest Group on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages
(the ACL SIG). Examples of topics include, but are not limited to:
- Computational approaches to phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and 
pragmatics of Semitic languages
- Tools for processing of Semitic languages (e.g. POS taggers, parsers, etc.)
- Computational resources for Semitic languages
- Comparative computational studies of Semitic languages
- Leveraging resources in other languages (Semitic or other) to create
  resources and tools for Semitic languages
- Empirical studies of unique/specific phenomena in Semitic languages
- Text and speech applications for Semitic languages such as:
  - speech recognition,
  - machine translation,
  - summarization,
  - language generation,
  - speech synthesis,
  - co-reference resolution,
  - mention detection,
  - information retrieval,
  - spoken dialog applications
  - etc.

Submissions:

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop. Papers should be submitted electronically and no
later than March 26, 2007 through the following site:
           http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS3.
Submissions should not exceed 8 pages and should be formatted using
the ACL 2007 style files, which are available at:
           http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.
The only accepted formats for submitted papers are Adobe PDF or postscript. The
submissions interface provides for automatic conversion of postscript to PDF.

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the program
committee. The reviewing of the papers will be blind. In preparing your
manuscript, do not include any information which could reveal your identity, 
or that of your co-authors. The title section of your manuscript should not
contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliation status. If you do
include any author names on the title page, your submission will be
automatically rejected. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate
all direct references to your own previous work. That is, avoid phrases such as
''this contribution generalizes our results for XYZ''. Also, please do not
disproportionately cite your own previous work. In other words, make your
submission as anonymous as possible. We need your cooperation in our effort to
maintain a fair, blind reviewing process, and to consider all submissions
equally. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

Important Dates:

March 26  --  Submission deadline for workshop papers
April 22  --  Notification of acceptance
April 29  --  Camera-ready version due
June 28  --  Workshop held at ACL 2007

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

Aims and Objectives:
- To Create Awareness among the people about Pakistani languages and how modern
technology can be used for their promotion.
- To provide a platform for researchers in this field of study.
- To ultimately establish centers of excellence in computational linguistics
throughout the country for the detailed study and research. 

Background:
The fields of linguistics and computational linguistics are very important.
Throughout the world there are hundreds of institutes offering degrees in these
disciplines and people are doing research for their languages. Unfortunately,
the importance of these disciplines is not realized (as it should have been) in
Pakistan. Research in this area is mostly limited to individual efforts that
need to be transformed into institutionalization. The conference is
an effort to educate the masses and the decision-making authorities to realize
the importance of these extremely needed disciplines especially in this modern
age of computers.

Areas of Research:
Some of the areas of research include (but not limited to):

- Ambiguity resolution
- Anaphora Resolution
- Character Recognition
- Corpus Linguistics
- Discourse Analysis
- Ellipses Resolution
- Fonts
- Information Retrieval
- Localization
- Machine Translation
- Morphology
- OCR
- Part-of-Speech Tagging
- Pattern Recognition
- Phonology
- Semantics
- Speech Recognition
- Syntax
- Text-to-Speech
