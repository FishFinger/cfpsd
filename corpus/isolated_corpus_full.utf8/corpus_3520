Call for Papers Announcement

I. General

The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts
of between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of digital humanities,
broadly defined to encompass the common ground between information
technology and problems in humanities research and teaching. As always,
we welcome submissions in any area of the humanities, particularly
interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage submissions on the
current state of the art in digital humanities, and on recent new
developments and expected future developments in the field.

Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,
* text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing,
language learning
* libraries, archives and the creation, delivery, management and
preservation of humanities digital resources
* computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of
literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including
electronic literature and interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship
* use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music,
film, theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural heritage
* research issues such as: information design and modelling; the
cultural impact of the new media; software studies; Human-Computer
interaction
* the role of digital humanities in academic curricula
* digital humanities and diversity

The range of topics covered by digital humanities can also be consulted
in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic Computing
(LLC), Oxford University Press.

The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the
Programme Committee is October 31, 2008. All submissions will be
refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance February 13, 2009.
The electronic submission form will be available at the conference site
from October 1st, 2008. See below for full details on submitting proposals.

Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local
conference organizer as soon as possible.

For more information on the conference in general please visit the
conference web site.

II. Types of Proposals

Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1) papers,
(2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations, and (3)
sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of submission
must be specified in the proposal.

Papers and posters may be given in English, French, German, Italian or
Spanish.

1) Papers

Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:
either completed research which has given rise to substantial results,
or the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous
theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers will
be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches
to the problem and should include some critical assessment of the
computing methodologies used. All proposals should include conclusions
and references to important sources. Those describing the creation or
use of digital resources should follow these guidelines as far as possible.

2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations

Poster presentations may include computer technology and project
demonstrations. Hence the term poster/demo to refer to the different
possible combinations of printed and computer based presentations. There
should be no difference in quality between poster/demo presentations and
papers, and the format for proposals is the same for both. The same
academic standards should apply in both cases, but posters/demos may be
a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking results, or significant
work in progress, including pedagogical applications. Both will be
submitted to the same refereeing process. The choice between the two
modes of presentation (poster/demo or paper) should depend on the most
effective and informative way of communicating the scientific content of
the proposal.

By definition, poster presentations are less formal and more interactive
than a standard talk. Poster presenters have the opportunity to exchange
ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss their work in detail with
those most deeply interested in the same topic. Presenters will be
provided with about two square meters of board space to display their
work. They may also provide handouts with examples or more detailed
information. Posters will remain on display throughout the conference,
but there will also be a separate conference session dedicated to them,
when presenters should be prepared to explain their work and answer
questions. Additional times may also be assigned for software or project
demonstrations.

The poster sessions will build on the recent trend of showcasing some of
the most important and innovative work being done in digital humanities.

As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters to the
conference, the Programme Committee will award a prize for the best poster.

3) Sessions

Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:

Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for
each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in
the session;

or
A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each
speaker is willing to participate in the session.

The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for
papers, i.e. October 31st, 2008.

III. Format of the Proposals

All proposals must be submitted electronically using the on-line
submission form, which will be available at the conference web site
http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/ from October 1st, 2008.
Anyone who has previously used the conftool system to submit proposals
or reviews should
use their existing account rather than setting up a new one. If anyone
has forgotten their user name and/or password please contact
dh2009@digitalhumanities.org.

IV. Information about the conference venue: MITH University of Maryland
Celebrating its 10th anniversary as a working digital humanities center,
MITH is the University of Maryland's primary intellectual hub for
scholars and practitioners of digital humanities, electronic literature,
and cyberculture, as well as the headquarters of the Electronic
Literature Organization. Having fostered numerous early adopter projects
in the field, MITH continues to innovate with new work on tools, text
analysis, electronic editing, virtual worlds, digital preservation, and
cyberinfrastructure.

V. Bursaries for Young Scholars
A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made available
to those presenting at the conference by the Association of Digital
Humanities Organisations. (AHDO) If you wish to apply for a bursary
please submit a proposal and indicate your interest in the scheme by
emailing dh2009@digitalhumanities.org. More information for applicants
will be available from the ADHO website
