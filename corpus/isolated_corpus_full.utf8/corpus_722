Fifth East Nusantara Conference
Kupang, Indonesia
1-4 August 2007

In the past, four International Conferences for East Nusantara Linguistics have
been held; three in Leiden (1998, 2001, 2005), and one at the ANU in Canberra
(2000). With this fifth conference the location moves to Indonesia, and more
specifically to the East Nusantara region. Also, the focus of the conference has
been expanded to include both language and culture. The conference will be
hosted by Universitas Nusa Cendana (UNDANA), with the support of Prof. Dr. Frans
Umbu Datta, Rektor. 

The aim of this conference is to bring together linguists, anthropologists,
ethnolgraphers, musicologists, and others who work in the east Nusantara region
to share the results of their research with each other. The East Nusantara
region includes eastern Indonesia and East Timor, and Austronesian as well as
non-Austronesian languages. 

The confernce will be held at the UNDANA Language Center (Pusat Bahasa) on the
Penfui campus. A welcome gathering will be held on the evening of 1 August. Main
conference presentations will take place 2-3 August, with a conference dinner on
2 August. The main conference will be followed by a one-day workshop on
Alor-Pantar(-Timur) languages on 4 August. More information on this workshop
will be circulated through a separate announcement. 

Call for papers
Papers are invited on any topic relating to East Nusantara languages and
cultures. In order to encourage focussed discussion on issues relevant across
the region, the presentations will be organised in four thematic sessions (see
the topics listed in the more complete call for papers). If you would like to
present a paper, please select one topic to talk about in some depth, using the
suggested background readings as a guideline. 

Each thematic session will be followed by 30-45 minutes of general discussion of
the topic. In order to participate in this general discussion, you are
encouraged to also think about the other themes of the conference in relation to
your research language(s), although you will be presenting more formally on one
topic only. Abstracts of no more than one page should be submitted no later than
30 March 2007. Abstract submission via email is strongly encouraged. Papers in
either English or Indonesian are welcomed. Please send abstracts to
gary.holton@gmail.com and hanson2003@yahoo.com more
