Meeting Description

This conference aims to outline the different linguistic operations of
identification that involve the construction of identity and the different
linguistic devices through which the identity of a person or object is constructed.

Construction of identity and the process of identification

http://langrep.univ-tours.fr

Tours, France

29 - 30 November 2007

The world's languages use diverse means to construct and express the identity of
people and objects. These means include denomination (e.g. proper nouns, noun
phrases, denominal adjectives, etc.) in the sense of categorising living beings
and/or inanimate objects through the act of naming, and reduplication (e.g. a
salad salad, I mean up-up, etc.) which in some of its uses amounts to typifying.
Categorisation is a way of identifying an element with a group while marking its
singularity (see e.g. Folkbiology). On the other hand, to produce a sequence
like 'un parfum pour les femmes femmes' is tantamount to setting up a
subcategory of women par excellence and consequently, introducing a difference
among women.

In recent years, identification has received a great deal of attention in
linguistics. In some theoretical models it has even come to be regarded as a
form of linguistic operation.

The aim of this conference is to outline the different linguistic operations of
identification insofar as they involve the construction of identity and the
different linguistic devices through which the identity of a person or object is
constructed.

We welcome contributions that show how the two notions of identity and
identification are articulated in both language and discourse. Contributions can
stem from any theoretical background, be based upon any methodological approach
and address the issue in any of the world's languages. 

Languages 

The conference will feature presentations in French as well as in English.

Abstracts

Please submit your abstracts in both RTF and PDF (2 pages minimum and 3 max, in
12-point Times New Roman, simple spacing) by e-mail to the following address:
langrep@univ-tours.fr no later than 31 May 2007, submission deadline. Please
include the title of the paper but do not mention the name of the author as
abstracts will be refereed anonymously. A separate page should contain the title
of the paper, the author's name, affiliation, postal and email addresses.

Publications

We intend to publish the papers accepted for the conference. To this effect,
revised versions will be reviewed anew by the members of the scientific committee.

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 26-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop provides a forum for researchers to present and discuss
theories and methods for semantic content acquisition and representation.
Participants will also be encouraged to apply their methods, or relate
their theories, to a specific test corpus. In this workshop, the relevance
of an approach to meaning is judged only by what it can tell us about real
language data. 

Final Call for Papers
Workshop on Semantic Content Acquisition and Representation
(SCAR 2007)
http://www.sics.se/~mange/scar2007/
Pre-conference workshop NODALIDA
Thursday, May 24, Tartu, Estonia

Text (and language in general) has aboutness; it has meaning, or semantic
content. We as (computational) linguists are highly adept at dissecting text on
a number of different levels: we can perform grammatical analysis of the words
in the text, we can detect animacy and salience, we can do syntactic analysis
and build parse trees of partial and whole sentences, and we can even identify
and track topics throughout the text. However, we are comparatively inept when
it comes to identifying the semantic content, or meaning, of the text. Or, to
put matters in more concise terms, even though there are theories and methods
that claim to accomplish this, there is a striking lack of consensus regarding
both acquisition, representation, and practical utility of semantic content.

The aim of this workshop is not only to provide a forum for researchers to
present and discuss theories and methods for semantic content acquisition and
representation. The aim is also to discuss a common evaluation methodology
whereby different approaches can be adequately compared. As a first step in this
direction, participants will be encouraged to apply their methods, or relate
their theories, to a specific test corpus that will be available in several of
the Nordic languages and English. Participants will be expected to demonstrate
what kind of results their methods can yield. In this workshop, the relevance of
an approach to meaning is judged only by what it can tell us about real language
data. The overall purpose of this workshop is thus to put theories and models
into action.

Questions of interest include:

- Is there a place in linguistic theory for a situation- and
  speaker-independent semantic model beyond syntactic models?

- What are the borders, if any, between morphosyntax, lexicon and
  pragmatics on the one hand and semantic models on the other?

- Are explicit semantic models necessary, useful or desirable? (Or
  should they be incidental to morphosyntactic and lexical analysis on
  the one hand and pragmatic discourse analysis on the other?)

We encourage submissions in the following areas:

- Discussions of foundational theoretical issues concerning meaning
  and representation in general.

- Methods for supervised, unsupervised and weakly supervised
  acquisition (machine learning, statistical, example- or rule-based,
  hybrid etc.) of semantic content.

- Representational schemes for semantic content (wordnets, vectorial,
  logic etc.).

- Evaluation of semantic content acquisition methods, and semantic
  content representations (test collections, evaluation metrics etc.).

- Applications of semantic content representations (information
  retrieval, dialogue systems, tools for language learning etc.).

Submission procedure:

Online submission is now open at http://www.easychair.org/SCAR2007/.
Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, and should use the ACL style
files available at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/. Since reviewing will
be blind, papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations, and
self-references should be avoided. Proceedings will be published electronically.

Important dates:

Submission deadline: March 26
Notification of acceptance: April 26
Final papers due: May 7
Workshop: May 24

Location:

NODALIDA 2007, Tartu, Estonia.

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.
