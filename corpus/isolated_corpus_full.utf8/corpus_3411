computer-mediated communication. 

Call for Papers

The Linguistics Student Organization at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign is proud to announce ILLS 1: LOL (Illinois Language and
Linguistics Society 1: Language On-Line), the first in a series of conferences
on language and linguistics-related themes. ILLS 1 will be held at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on the weekend of May 29-May 31, 2009. 

ILLS welcomes the submission of general empirical and theoretical papers
relevant to the field of linguistics and language sciences. Primary
consideration will be given to submissions relevant to the field of
computer-mediated communication, which is understood to include the multiple and
diverse uses of language on the Internet, as well as similar technological modes
of communication such as text messaging. 

Current invited speakers: Alexandra Georgakopoulou (King's College London),
Susan Herring (Indiana University), John Paolillo (Indiana University), Randall
Sadler (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)

Workshop on

Corpus, Colligation, Register Variation

Final Call for Papers

Register variation, i.e. functional linguistic variation according to
situational context, has been the subject of numerous studies addressing a wide
spectrum of features deemed to be characteristic of specific registers. Many
register studies focus on single or relative small sets of texts instead of
being based on studies of larger corpora. This limits the possibilities of
systematically evaluating register features in larger and more diverse sets of
registers and, thus, the wider applicability of the results. Furthermore, most
registers are not reliably characterized by features that are exclusively found
in a single register, but rather by sets of lexical and grammatical features
that are principally found in any text, albeit to varying extent. It has been
shown that methodologies based on qualitative as well as quantitative corpus
studies are well suited to the study of registers from different perspectives
(e.g. synchronic, diachronic, comparative, cross-linguistic etc.). Advances in
corpus-based methodology in combination with the increasing availability of
corpora and tools for their annotation and analysis at different levels of
linguistic organization make more extensive and systematic register studies
feasible. In particular, they enable the investigation of a more diverse set of
types and combinations of register features that require qualitative and
quantitative corpus analyses.

The main interest of this workshop is the exploration of the methodological
possibilities and limitations of present-day corpus-based register studies with
a focus on lexico-grammatical and grammatical register features. Central issues
are lexical co-occurrence patterns such as collocations and other types of
multi-word expressions and lexico-grammatical patterns such as colligations
which are postulated to characteristically co-occur in individual registers.

For this workshop, we invite papers on synchronic and diachronic register
studies with a focus on the following topic areas:
- lexical, grammatical and semantic analyses of colligation and collocation,
- methods in exploring register features,
- corpus compilation and annotation for register studies.
The focus of this workshop is going to be on methodology in corpus-based
register studies, yet contributions on theoretical issues are also welcome.
