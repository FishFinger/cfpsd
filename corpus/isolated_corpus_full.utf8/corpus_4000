ABOUT THE WORKSHOP
In multilingual situations, language technologies are crucial for =

providing access to information and opportunities for economic =

development. With somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 different languages, =

Africa is a multilingual continent par excellence and presents acute =

challenges for those seeking to promote and use African languages in the =

areas of business development, education, research, and relief aid. In =

recent times a number of African researchers and institutions have come =

forward that share the common goal of developing capabilities in =

language technologies. This workshop provides a forum to meet and share =

the latest developments in this field. It also seeks to include =

linguists who specialize in African languages and would like to leverage =

the tools and approaches of computational linguistics, as well as =

computational linguists who are interested in learning about the =

particular linguistic challenges posed by African languages.

The workshop will consist of an invited tutorial on African language =

families and their structural properties by Prof. Sonja Bosch (UNISA, =

South Africa), followed by refereed research papers in computational =

linguistics. The focus will be on the less-commonly studied =

lesser-resourced languages, such as those of sub-Saharan Africa. These =

include languages from all four families, Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, =

Khoisan and Afro-Asiatic with the exception of Arabic which is covered =

by the SIGSemitic workshops. The workshop will also not cover variants =

of European languages such as African French, African English or Afrikaans.

We invite submissions on any topic related to Language Technologies and =

African languages including, but not limited to, the following:
+ Corpora and corpus annotation,
+ Machine readable lexicons,
+ Morphological analyzers and spelling checkers,
+ Part of speech taggers and parsers,
+ Speech recognition and synthesis,
+ Applications such as machine translation, information extraction, =

information retrieval, computer-assisted language learning and question =

answering.

Other topics of interest are:
The role of language technologies in economic development, education, =

health care, and emergency and public services. Documentation of =

endangered languages and the use of language technologies to enhance =

language vitality, Language technologies delivered on mobile platforms, =

e.g. phones.

TRAVEL FUNDING
A very limited amount of travel funding is available. Preference will be =

given to authors of accepted research papers who are traveling from Africa.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work in the topic =

area of this workshop. Submissions should follow the two-column format =

of the EACL 2009 main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight =

(8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of either =

the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be =

found at http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.
The reviewing will be blind and the paper should therefore not include =

the authors' names and affiliations.
Submission will be electronic. Papers must be submitted no later than =

January 19, 2009 using the submission webpage:
https://www.softconf.com/eacl09/african/

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. =

Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines on how to produce =

camera-ready versions of their papers for inclusion in the EACL workshop =

proceedings.
Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission deadline: January 19, 2009 (EXTENDED)
Notification of acceptance: February 2, 2009
Camera-ready papers due: February 13, 2009
Workshop: either March 30 or 31, 2009 (to be announced)
