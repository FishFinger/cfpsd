Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Advisory Board, we would like to inform you of the:

SEVENTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LEARNING      
Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong     
6-9 July 2010      
http://www.LearningConference.com      

The International Conference on Learning is for anyone with an interest in, and concern for, education at any of its levels and in any of its forms, from early childhood, to schools, to higher education and lifelong learning - and in any of its sites, from home to school to university to workplace.

In present-day Hong Kong, traditional Chinese practices are met with a Westerly modern way of life. In similar fashion, education, too, has developed under this analogous balancing act, having integrated a western-style education model with a Colonial Hong Kong school system of education by the mid-nineteenth century. The Hong Kong Institute of Education, in the same vein, brings teacher education into the 20th and 21st centuries - the result of merging the five former Colleges of Education in 1994.

Learning Conference plenary speakers include:      
Katerine Bielaczyc, National Institute of Education, Singapore      
Yasmin B. Kafai, Journal of the Learning Sciences      
Kerry Kennedy, Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong      
Samuel Leong, Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong      
Bob Lingard, The University of Queensland, Queensland, Australia      

The Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in The International Journal of Learning. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 17 September 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.LearningConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Hong Kong in July 2010.

Yours Sincerely,

Prof. Nicola Yelland      
Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong      
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Learning and The International Journal of Learning
