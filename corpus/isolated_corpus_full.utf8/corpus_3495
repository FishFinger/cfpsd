3rd CFP: EACL 2009 Student Research Workshop

1. General Invitation for Submissions

EACL-2009 will continue the tradition of providing a forum for student
researchers who are investigating various areas related to
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing. Participants will have the opportunity to get feedback
both from a wide audience in general and from selected panelists --
experienced researchers who prepare in-depth comments and questions in
advance of the presentation.

The European Association of Computational Linguistics would like to
invite student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. Original and unpublished research is invited on all aspects
of computational linguistics, including, but not limited to these
topic areas:

    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
    * phonetics, phonology and morphology
    * linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
    * information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
    * summarization and paraphrasing
    * speech recognition, speech synthesis
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
    * spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
    * multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
    * message and narrative understanding systems


The main conference will also feature tutorials, workshops and
research notes. Further information on these is available at the main
conference website: http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/. =


2. Submission Requirements

Seeing that the main mission of the student workshop is to provide the
participants with a wide audience and useful feedback, the emphasis of
the workshop will be on work in progress. It will therefore normally
be open to students who have settled on their thesis direction but who
still have significant research left to do; those students in the
final stages of their thesis are encouraged to submit to the main
conference. Papers should clearly indicate directions for future
research where appropriate. The papers can have more than one author,
however all authors must be students.

A paper accepted for presentation at the Student Workshop cannot be
presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly
available proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other
conferences must indicate this immediately after the title material on
the first page. Students who have previously presented at an
ACL/EACL/NAACL student session will not be eligible to present again
at the student session of any of these conferences. These students are
instead encouraged to submit to the main conference.  =


3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column formal of EACL/ACL
proceedings.The maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages of
content and one (1) additional page of references. The page limits
have to be strictly observed. We strongly recommend the use of ACL
LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this
year's conference.  They are available at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.  A description of the
format will also be available in case you are unable to use the style
files directly. Papers must conform to the official EACL 2009 style
guidelines, and we reserve the right to reject submissions that do not
conform to these styles including font size restrictions. Submissions
should be in PDF format and must include all fonts, so that the paper
will print (not just view) anywhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.


The deadline for submission is 23:59 CET on October 24, 2008. Please
submit your paper via the following link:
https://www.softconf.com/eacl09/student/submit.html

Additional instructions for electronic submission will be posted on
the conference website at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/studentresearchworkshop.


4. Reviewing Procedure

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs and a team of reviewers. Each
submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior
researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on
the results of the review.

5. Student sponsorship
The EACL has a limited number of student sponsorships available
to student participants of the EACL 2009 main conference, the EACL
2009 poster/demo session and/or the EACL 2009 student research workshop.

Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more generally,
to students from countries with hard currency problems
(within the geographical area covered by EACL).

A request for student sponsorship for EACL 2009 should include the
following information:

* Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of the  candi=
date
* Source and amount of yearly income
* Letter of motivation
* Proof of student status
* Copy of acceptance letter from programme chair / student workshop
chair or poster/demo chair
* Letter of recommendation from supervisor
* Overview of the estimated costs

Requests for student sponsorships can be directed to the
EACL at secretary@eacl.org
