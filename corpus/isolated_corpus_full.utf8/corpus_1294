BioNLP 2007

An ACL 2007 workshop
Prague, Czech Republic
June 29, 2007
http://compbio.uchsc.edu/BioNLP2007

Natural language processing has a long history in the medical domain,
with research in the field dating back to at least 1963.  In the late
1990s, a separate thread of research involving natural language
processing in the genomic domain began to gather steam. It has become a
major focus of research in the bioinformatics, computational biology,
and computational linguistics communities. A number of successful
workshops and conference sessions have resulted, with significant
progress in the areas of named entity recognition for a wide range of
key=20
biomedical classes, concept normalization, and system evaluation.=20
A variety of publicly available resources have contributed to this
progress,
as well.

Recently, the widely recognized disconnect between basic biological
research and
patient care delivery stimulated development of a new branch of
biomedical
research--translational medicine. Translational medicine, sometimes
defined as the facilitation of "bench-to-bedside" transmission of
knowledge, has become a hot topic, with a National Center for
Biocomputing devoted to this theme established last year.

This workshop has the goal of addressing and bringing together these
three threads in biomedical natural language processing, or "BioNLP:"
biological, translational, and clinical language processing.  We will
solicit work in any topics of current interest in the field, especially:

- Extraction and normalization of...
       - complex biomedical relations
       - biomedical entities, including experimental methodologies
- Resources for BioNLP, including....
       - ontologies
       - knowledge bases
       - lexicons
       - annotated data sets
       - corpora
- The economics of text mining for biomedical applications, including...
       - quantifying utility to end users
       - usability and portability for non-developers
- Novel strategies for system testing and evaluation, including...
       - evaluation methods
       - resources
       - test suites
- Applications and analysis techniques that use the output of text
mining systems...
      - knowledge discovery
      - integration of publications with databases
      - visualization

Two types of submissions are invited: full papers and poster abstracts.
Submissions are due by 11:59pm EST on March 26, 2007. Submit your
paper or abstract via the ACL BioNLP 2007 site at
http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS5/.

Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages including references.
These are intended to be reports of original and mature research.

Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages. Accepted abstracts
will be published in a separate section of the workshop proceedings.
Appropriate poster topics include preliminary results, application
notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Format: Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format, and should
follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. Please see the
conference website for detailed typesetting specifications. Authors
are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files
available on the ACL meeting website
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/). Authors who cannot submit a
PDF file electronically should contact the workshop organizers well in
advance of the submission deadline.

Reviewing of submissions will be blind. Do not include author names in
the paper. Avoid self-references -- instead of "As we showed in Smith
et al. 1999...", say "As Smith et al. 1999 showed...." The paper
submission software will allow you to enter full author information
separately from your paper. Each submission will be reviewed by at
least two program committee members.
