Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 20-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description
Cycles of language change have not been studied in generative linguistics and
only sporadically in other frameworks. This workshop is an attempt to bring
together linguists who do work on these cycles and discuss their current
research. It also aims to come up with (a) description of linguistic cycles (in
as many languages as possible) in terms of structural principles, and (b)
explanations of the internal changes, e.g. by applying insights from language
acquisition to this debate. 

Cycles have been discussed by Hodge (1970) and Tauli (1956). Some well-known
cycles involve Negatives, where an initial single negative such as not gets to
be reinforced by nothing or replaced by never, and subjects, where full pronouns
are reanalyzed as endings on the verb. Clauses, aspect markers, articles, and
copula verbs also undergo cycles of internal change followed by external change.
In these cycles, both internal and external mechanisms are involved: internal
because, for example, all languages have negatives that 'weaken', but also
external since the renewal may be determined by social factors.
