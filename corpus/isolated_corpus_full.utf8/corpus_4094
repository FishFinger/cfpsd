Meeting Description:

Following the success of MemoQ in 2008, Kilgray Translation Technologies
organizes its first MemoQ user conference in Budapest, Hungary on 23-24 April 2009. 

Call for Papers

The industry appreciates MemoQ because it does not only respect the interests of
one user group but strives to offer value for enterprises, language service
providers and translators alike. Similarly, the conference aims to establish a
forum where companies, LSPs and translators can discuss workflows and best
practices that relate to MemoQ or translation technology in general in a very
friendly atmosphere. Both existing users and future users are welcome to join
for the two days packed with workshops and meaningful presentations.

MemoQFest will not only be a traditional conference - social networking programs
hosted by Kilgray's staff will already start on Tuesday 21 April and last the
whole week long, including the weekend.

The topic of the conference will be Streamlining workflows with MemoQ. Papers or
proposals for workshops are invited in the following fields:

- Getting the most out of MemoQ
- Processing complex jobs with MemoQ
- Integrated systems with MemoQ being a component (machine translation, workflow
systems, etc.)
- Best practices in translation management
- Comparison of MemoQ with other tools

Submission of papers:

We invite abstracts of full papers or proposals for workshops (up to one page),
with the following content:
- Presentation Title
- Brief Description (maximum 100 words). If your presentation is chosen, this
text will be published on the website.
- Long Description. This text is used to evaluate your proposal.
- Intended Audience's Proficiency in MemoQ. Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / All

Meeting Description:

Conference on Semantics and Modelisation, JSM09
April 9-10 2009
Paris, France
http://jsm.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/jsm09 

Second Call for Papers

The GDR Sémantique et Modélisation (CNRS) and the UMR 7110 (CNRS & University
Paris Diderot-Paris 7) organize the seventh edition of the Conference on
Semantics and Modelisation (JSM09). The conference will be held in Paris, on
April 9-10, 2009.

The goal of the conference is to promote research on the formalisation of
linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal models.  In view
of the development of corpus-based research in semantics and related fields,
proposals articulating the use of corpora and representational problems in
semantics and pragmatics are particularly welcome.

Topics
We invite abstracts that address any problem in the modelling of linguistic
meaning and interpretation. This includes but is not limited to the following
topics:
- syntax / semantics interface,
- logical formalization,
- tense and aspect,
- lexical meaning,
- functional words (determiners, pronouns, etc.),
- information structure,
- presuppositions and implicatures,
- speech acts,
- discourse relations in text and dialogue.

Submission Conditions
Abstracts must be anonymous. They should be 2 pages long including references,
examples and figures. They should have a 1 inch margin on all four sides and use
at least a 11 points font. Files may be in plain text, PDF, RTF or MS Word.
Names and affiliations should be indicated in the body of the message. Proposals
should be sent at jsm09@free.fr no later than January 8, 2009.
Contact jsm09@free.fr for information.
