*
HLT & NLP within the Arabic world: Arabic Language and **local ** =

languages processing: Status Updates and Prospects *

Please refer to http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/Workshops.html for =

details.

* Motivation and Aims*

This Workshop intends to add value to the issues addressed during the =

main conference (Human Language Technologies (HLT) & Natural Language =

Processing (NLP)) and enhance the work carried out at different places =

to process Arabic language(s) and more generally Semitic languages and =

other local and foreign languages spoken in the region.

It should bring together people who are actively involved in Arabic =

Written and Spoken language processing in a mono- or cross/multilingual =

context, and give them an opportunity to update the community through =

reports on completed and ongoing work as well as on the availability of =

LRs, evaluation protocols and campaigns, products and core technologies =

(in particular open source ones). This should enable the participants to =

develop a common view on where we stand with respect to these particular =

set of languages and to foster the discussion of the future of this =

research area. Particular attention will be paid to activities involving =

technologies such as Machine Translation, Cross-Lingual Information =

Retrieval/extraction, Summarization, Speech to text transcriptions, =

etc., and languages such as Arabic varieties, Amazigh, Amharic, Hebrew, =

Maltese, and other local languages. Evaluation methodologies and =

resources for evaluation of HLT are also a main focus.

* Topics of Interest *

The submissions should address some of the following issues:

=B7 Issues in the design, the acquisition, creation, management, access, =

distribution, use of Language Resources (Standard Arabic, Colloquial =

Arabic, other Semitic languages, Amazigh, Coptic, Maltese, =

English/French spoken locally, etc.)

=B7 Impact on LR collections/processing and NLP of the crucial issues =

related to "code switching" between different dialects and languages

=B7 Specific issues related to the above-mentioned languages such as role =

of morphology, named entities, corpus alignment, etc.)

=B7 Multilinguality issues including relationship between Colloquial and =

Standard Arabic

=B7 Exploitation of LR in different types of applications

=B7 Industrial LR requirements and community's response;

=B7 Benchmarking of systems and products; resources for benchmarking and =

evaluation for written and spoken language processing;

=B7 Focus on some key technologies such as MT (all approaches e.g. =

Statistical, Example-Based, etc.), Information Retrieval, Speech =

Recognition, Spoken Documents Retrieval, CLIR, Question-Answering, =

Summarization,

=B7 Local, regional, and international activities and projects;

=B7 Needs, possibilities, forms, initiatives of/for regional and =

international cooperation.

* Submission Details (more on =

http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/Workshops.html) *


Submissions must be in English. Abstracts for workshop contributions =

should not exceed Four A4 pages (excluding references). An additional =

title page should state: the title; author(s); affiliation(s); and =

contact author's e-mail address, as well as postal address, telephone =

and fax numbers.

Submission is to be sent by email, preferably in Postscript or PDF =

format, to: arabic@elda.org <mailto:choukri@elda.org> to arrive before * =

15 February 2008 * .

Registration to LREC=9208 will be required for participation, so potential =

participants are invited to refer to the main conference website for all =

details not covered in the present call ( =
