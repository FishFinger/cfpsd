Call for Papers

DiSCo 2009: Distributional Semantics beyond Concrete Concepts
July 29th, Amsterdam

Workshop organized as a part of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive
Science Society (CogSci 2009)

Overview

DiSCo 2009 is a pre-conference workshop organized on July 29th, at
CogSci-2009, Amsterdam. It focuses on distributional models of
(lexical) semantics, like LSA or HAL, that aim to model the meaning of
a word in terms of its contexts in a corpus. To this day, these
approaches have mainly been used in the modeling of concrete concepts,
where they have proved very successful. The DiSCo workshop therefore
wants to focus on a number of challenges that have been left
relatively unexplored so far. These challenges include, but are not
limited to:

    * The modeling of verb meaning.
    * The modeling of different aspects of semantics, like the
      extraction of concept properties from text.
    * The combination of different types of (linguistic and
      non-linguistic) data.

DiSCo aims to bring together computational linguists and cognitive
scientists interested in distributional models of semantics. We
welcome all researchers to submit novel and interesting work in the
field of distributional semantics, with specific attention to the new
challenges set out above. Additionally, we are interested in receiving
other contributions that further research on distributional models
and/or their implications for cognitive science.

Submission details

Submissions should adhere to the CogSci style files, and should be no
longer than 6 pages. They need to be submitted in pdf-format. More
