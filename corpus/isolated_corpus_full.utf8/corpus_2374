                          FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

             Natural Language Processing resources, algorithms
                       and tools for authoring aids

                           LREC 2008 Workshop
                           Marrakech, Morocco
                         Sunday, June 1st 2008

Workshop Aims
-------------

Writing is a very complex task, involving many subtasks and constraints,
including goal setting, content determination, outline planning, linguistic
expression, discourse flow, and emphasis control. Finally, formal output
aspects (spelling, layout choices, etc.) need to be checked. In sum, writers
are juggling many, possibly even contradictory constraints; without proper
control, they might be overwhelmed, losing orientation.

The aim of this workshop is to attract participants from both academia and
industry interested in this topic and to address questions such as the
following:

- How can we get a clearer picture of the writers=92 processes, strategies
and needs (for example, by looking over their shoulders, or asking them
to annotate text or make their needs explicit via the use of verbal
protocols)?

- Which components of the overall task could be and should be supported?

- What specific resources, algorithms and tools exist that could be used
to improve existing authoring aids or to build new ones?

- How do we evaluate such tools ?

One potential outcome of the workshop would be a roadmap for future research
in the field, as well as some awareness-raising with regard to the needs and
potential of authoring aids.


Workshop Topics
---------------

The topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to:

- writing processes, and computational tools to support the writer;
- resources to assist in writing;
- NLP techniques that can be used or have been used for assisting in
writing, including: grammar checking, document structuring, thematic
segmentation, and information retrieval for the writer;
- development of practical tools and resources for assisting writers and
their evaluation.

Submissions
-----------

Submissions of papers on original work are invited on any aspect
(empirical research and theoretical/methodological issues) of the topics
of the workshop, and should address the relevance for the development of
tools. Submitted papers should not exceed 6 pages (style files will be
provided later by LREC for camera-ready versions of accepted papers), and
should be sent by email in PDF format to aurelien.max@limsi.fr. As
reviewing will be blind, submitted papers should be anonymized.
