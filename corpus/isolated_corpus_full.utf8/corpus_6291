Meeting Description:

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research
results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad
field of information retrieval (IR). 

Call for Papers

The Conference and Program Chairs invite all those working in areas related to
IR to submit original papers, posters, and proposals for tutorials, workshops,
and demonstrations of systems. SIGIR 2010 welcomes contributions related to any
aspect of IR theory and foundation, techniques, and applications. Relevant
topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Document Representation and Content Analysis (e.g., text representation,
document structure, linguistic analysis, non-English IR, cross-lingual IR,
information extraction, sentiment analysis, clustering, classification, topic
models, facets)
- Queries and Query Analysis (e.g., query representation, query intent, query
log analysis, question answering, query suggestion, query reformulation)
- Users and Interactive IR (e.g., user models, user studies, user feedback,
search interface, summarization, task models, personalized search)
- Retrieval Models and Ranking (e.g., IR theory, language models, probabilistic
retrieval models, feature-based models, learning to rank, combining searches,
diversity)
- Search Engine Architectures and Scalability ( e.g., indexing, compression,
MapReduce, distributed IR, P2P IR, mobile devices)
- Filtering and Recommending (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative
filtering, recommender systems, profiles)
- Evaluation (e.g., test collections, effectiveness measures, experimental design)
- Web IR and Social Media Search (e.g., link analysis, query logs, social
tagging, social network analysis, advertising and search, blog search, forum
search, CQA, adversarial IR)
- IR and Structured Data (e.g., XML search, ranking in databases, desktop
search, entity search)
- Multimedia IR (e.g., Image search, video search, speech/audio search, music IR)
- Other Applications (e.g., digital libraries, enterprise search, vertical
search, genomics IR, legal IR, patent search, text reuse)
