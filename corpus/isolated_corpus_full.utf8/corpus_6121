Meeting Description:

Speech Prosody 2010
Every Language, Every Style: Globalizing the Science of Prosody 

Call for Papers

Prosody is a universal characteristic of human speech: prosodic prominence and
phrasing give listeners a window into the mind of the talker. Prosody improves
human-computer interface, aids clinical diagnosis, improves the quality of
second language instruction, increases the robustness of speech communication,
and serves as the only channel for communicating many types of meta-linguistic
and para-linguistic spoken information.

Speech Prosody 2010, the fifth international conference on speech prosody,
invites papers addressing any aspect of the science and technology of prosody.
Speech Prosody, the biennial meeting of the Speech Prosody Special Interest
Group (SProSIG) of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA), is
the only recurring international conference focused on prosody as an organizing
principle for the social, psychological, linguistic, and technological aspects
of spoken language. Past conferences in Aix-en-Provence, Nara, Dresden, and
Campinas have each attracted 300-400 delegates, including experts in the fields
of Linguistics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Speech and Hearing
Science, Psychology, and related disciplines.

Speech Prosody 2010 seeks, in particular, to discuss the universality of
prosody. To what extent can the observed scientific and technological benefits
of prosodic modeling be ported to new languages, and to new styles of spoken
language? Toward this end, Speech Prosody 2010 especially welcomes papers that
create or adapt models of prosody to languages, dialects, sociolects, and/or
communicative situations that are inadequately addressed by the current state of
the art.

Topics
Speech Prosody 2010 will include keynote presentations, oral sessions, and
poster sessions covering topics including:
-  Prosody of under-resourced languages and dialects
- Communicative situation and speaking style
- Dynamics of prosody: structures that adapt to new situations
- Phonology and phonetics of prosody
- Rhythm and duration
- Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics
- Meta-linguistic and para-linguistic communication
- Signal processing
- Automatic speech synthesis, recognition and understanding
- Prosody of sign language
- Prosody in face-to-face interaction: audiovisual modeling and analysis
- Prosodic aspects of speech and language pathology
- Prosody in language contact and second language acquisition
- Psycholinguistic, cognitive, and neural correlates of prosody
- Prosody in computational linguistics
- Voice quality, phonation, and vocal dynamics

Submission of Papers
Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length, four-page papers,
including figures and references, at http://speechprosody2010.illinois.edu/. 
All Speech Prosody papers will be handled and reviewed electronically.

Venue
The Doubletree Hotel Magnificent Mile is located two blocks from North Michigan
Avenue, and three blocks from Navy Pier, at the cultural center of Chicago.  The
Windy City has been the center of American innovation since the mid nineteenth
century, when a railway link connected Chicago to the west coast, civil
engineers reversed the direction of the Chicago river, Chicago financiers
invented commodity corn (maize), and the Great Chicago Fire destroyed almost
every building in the city. The Magnificent Mile hosts scores of galleries and
museums, and hundreds of world-class restaurants and boutiques. 

Important Dates
Current shorter visa processing times allow us to extend the conference
deadlines to:

Submission of Papers: November 15, 2009 (http://speechprosody2010.illinois.edu)
Notification of Acceptance: January 15, 2010
Conference: May 11-14, 2010
