researchers while focusing on providing a supportive environment for those still

Languages and Language Varieties.  In addition to paper presentations, we will
also be hosting a panel discussion on the Role of Theory in Language
Description.  While contributions from all subfields of linguistics are welcome,
we are especially seeking contributions from researchers whose work involves
less-commonly-studied language and language varieties, including (but not
limited to) fieldworkers, sociolinguists, phoneticians, syntacticians, and
discourse-researchers.  

Invited Plenary Speaker: Claire Bowern (Yale University)
Invited Panel Speakers: 
Jim Stanford (Dartmouth University)
Claire Bowern (Yale University)
Robert Englebretson (Rice University)
Laura Robinson (Rice University)

our conference theme, papers on any subfield of linguistics are also welcome. 
Please send abstracts of no more than 500 words in .pdf or .doc format to
rls@rice.edu by December 20th.  The paper should not include the authors' names
and affiliations.  Furthermore, self-citations and other references that could
reveal the author's identity should be avoided. Any questions regarding
