Workshop on Embodied Interaction in Mobile, Physical and Virtual Environments 

Description

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December 1st-5th 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Embodied Interaction in Physical, Mobile, and Virtual Environments.

This workshop focuses on the use and impact of body on interaction, in physical or virtual environments, and including the role of localisation in mobile situations. Topics will cover human-human, human-system, and human-robot interactions, as well as interactions between humans and artefacts in their physical space. Interaction may involve multiple modalities such as speech, physical and facial gestures, haptics, or more standard computer inputs, as well as computer-mediated interaction for distributed teams. Potential interested parties are encouraged to stretch the boundaries of what they consider "embodied" and "interaction"---we are interested in all aspects of the Human Communication Sciences, and how any aspect of locality, presence, or embodiment may impact on them.

The workshop will include a keynote address by Catherine Pelachaud, who is a leading researcher in the creation of embodied conversational agents.

We plan to invite 1 or 2 other eminent speakers in the areas of physical and mobile interaction.

Intended Audience

This workshop is designed to appeal to anyone from mobile application designers, museum curators, architects, interaction designers, sociologists and psychologists, to HCI and CSCW designers, roboticists, game developers, and more!

For enquiries about the workshop, contact Lawrence Cavedon at lcavedon@gmail.com.

Submissions

Submissions for presentation at the workshop are sought. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

communication involving haptics and/or gesture 
human-robot interaction 
embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and virtual humans 
telepresence and localisation for distributed workgroups 
effective teleconferencing and remote work 
interaction design for physical and mobile environments 
mobile applications that involve knowledge of locale 
context-aware mobile social networking 
mobile services for health care 
computer game design, especially involving physical location and/or an accelerometer 
signed language or non-spoken communication 

Submission Format

Submit a title and 250-word abstract via the HCSNet wesbite at http://sf08.hcsnet.edu.au/submissions. A limited number of travel bursaries will be available to Australian-based presenters of accepted abstracts.
