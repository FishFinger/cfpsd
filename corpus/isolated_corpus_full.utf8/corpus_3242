CALL FOR PAPERS

International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2008 (IALP 2008)
Chiang Mai, Thailand, Nov. 12-14, 2008
http://www.colips.org/conference/ialp2008

International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2008 (IALP 2008) will
be held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, from Nov. 12-14, 2008. This conference is
jointly organized by Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Processing
Society (COLIPS) of Singapore and Department of Computer Science, Chiang Mai
University of Thailand. A post-conference tour will be arranged from Nov. 15-16,
2008.

Chiang Mai is the old capital city of the LannaKingdom with a history of more
than 700 years. It is a city of distinct beauty that has its own
cultural heritage.
The city is regarded as something of a national Shangri-La, thanks to
its distinctive
festivals, historic temples, arresting scenic beauty, temperate fruits and
a crisp, invigorating cool season climate. Along with its numerous ancient
temples and building, Chiang Mai is also famous for its handicrafts. Nature
has made it stand out, thanks to the majestic mountains and valleys and its
beautiful scenery: hills, mountain streams, lakes, field, waterfalls, caves,
hill tribe villages, orchid, butterfly farms, elephant camps & trekking tours
and river rafting expeditions. It would be great experience that we discuss
Asian languages in a city with rich Asian culture.
