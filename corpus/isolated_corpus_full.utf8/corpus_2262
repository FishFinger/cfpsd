                CoNLL Shared Task 2008

             First Call for Participation

The shared task at the Conference on Computational Natural
Language Learning (CoNLL) 2008 will be devoted to the joint
parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies. This effort
unifies the shared task evaluations of the past four years
under a common umbrella. The task has several novel points:

1. Performing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) on a
   dependency-based representation,
2. The SRL problem will address not only propositions
   centered around verbal predicates (from PropBank) but
   also around nominal predicates (from NomBank).
3. The syntactic dependencies to be modeled will be more
   complex than the ones used in the previous CoNLL
   evaluations. We now include dependencies internal to
   base noun phrases, a cleaner representation of gapping,
   traces, etc.

This shared task evaluation is separated into two challenges:
a closed challenge, where systems have to be built strictly
with information contained in the given training corpus, and
an open challenge, where the participants are encouraged to
use any kind of external tools and resources.

The shared task will be part of the CoNLL conference to be
held in conjunction with Coling-07 in in Manchester, UK,
August 16-17, 2008.

The important dates for the shared task are as follows (please
note that this is a tentative timeline and it may shift
slightly before the shared task starts):

1. Registration of participants - February 20th
2. Release of a small trial data set - February 25th
3. Release of training and development data sets - March 10th
4. Release of test data - May 9th
5. Submission of test runs - May 16th
6. Submission of papers - May 30th
7. Notification of acceptance - June 16th
8. Camera-ready deadline - June 30th

In order to take part in the shared task, participants should
register their intent to participate, in either or both of the
two tracks, by sending an e-mail to conll08st@lsi.upc.edu.

The website for the CoNLL shared task 2008 is

This site is updated continually, so please make sure
to check it out from time to time.

Questions about the CoNLL shared task 2008 can be sent to
conll08st@lsi.upc.edu.
