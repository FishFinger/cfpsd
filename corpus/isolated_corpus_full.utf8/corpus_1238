FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
REVISED DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS; 22nd MARCH
Exemplar-Based Models of Language Acquisition and Use
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~davec/workshop.htm
13 - 17 August 2007

organized as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organizers:
Rens Bod		rb@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
Dave Cochran		davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk

Workshop Purpose:
Exemplar-based models conceive of linguistic representations as being =20=

directly shaped by speakers' memories of specific tokens of =20
linguistic items. Such models are being considered by a growing =20
number of researchers in virtually all areas of linguistics, from =20
language acquisition and psycholinguistics to computational =20
linguistics and statistical natural language processing. This =20
workshop aims at bringing together linguists working to expand their =20
exemplar-based models by computational modeling, and computational =20
linguists interested in extending exemplar-based models to aspects of =20=

language cognition. The workshop is open to all members of the =20
Language, Logic and Information community, and is in particular =20
intended as a forum for advanced PhD students and more senior =20
researchers to share their research.

Workshop Topics:
=95 Unsupervised exemplar-based systems for parsing and other NLP =20
tasks; Statistical grammar induction; bootstrapping in exemplar-based =20=

models of language, in computers and infants.
=95 The interaction between language and other cognitive modalities in =20=

exemplar-based systems; exemplar based semantics and pragmatics.
=95 The nature of linguistic knowledge and representations in exemplar-=20=

based systems.
=95 Distributional learning; Pattern matching and language acquisition
=95 Statistical, item-based and corpus-based language acquisition
=95 Exemplars, recency and priming.
=95 Cognitive consequences of the problems of computational complexity =20=

in exemplar-based algorithms and their solutions.
=95 Computational approaches to exemplar-based construction grammar; =20
computational approaches to usage-based linguistics.
=95 Comprehension and generation in exemplar-based systems.
=95 Learning as abstraction vs. learning as storage; or, proposals for =20=

integration.
=95 General theoretical/philosophical considerations regarding the =20
relation of computational models to experimental cognitive research

We are particularly eager to receive submissions of an =20
interdisciplinary nature, especially those bridging the gap between =20
computational and experimental approaches.

Submission details:
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 1000-2000 words. =20
The following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Submissions =20=

must be suitable for anonymous review; reviewing will be double-=20
blind. Please do not include name, contact details, affiliation, or =20
any self-identifying references (eg; =93We proved in Smith 2003=85=94, =20=

rather than =93Smith 2003 proved=85=94) in the text of the submission; =20=

please include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment) containing =20
the title of your submission, your name, contact details and =20
affiliation. Please send your submission electronically to =20
davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk by the deadline listed below. The =20
submissions will be reviewed by the workshop=92s programme committee =20
and additional reviewers. The accepted papers will appear in the =20
workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The format for the final =20
versions will be MS Word.

Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI =20
participants. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over =20
five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 =20
slots for paper presentation (30 minutes) and discussion (15 minutes) =20=

per session. On the first day the workshop organizers will give an =20
extended lecture to familiarize the audience with the topic.

REVISED DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: March 22, 2007
Notification: April 21, 2007
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2007

Final papers for proceedings: May 17, 2007
Final programme: June 21, 2007
Workshop dates: 13 =96 17 August, 2007

Local Arrangements:
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required =20
to register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a =20=

paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker =20
registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants =20
will be made available by the OC on a competitive basis and workshop =20
participants are eligible to apply for those.

There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. =20
Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should =20
contact the local organizing committee to ask for the possibilities =20
for a grant.
