Meeting Description:

We propose this 1st Workshop on Definition Extraction as such an exchange forum,
with the hope that this workshop could become an academic space to share and
assess new methodologies, tools and techniques, in the spirit of promoting the
DE as a consolidated research area. This workshop will provide an opportunity to
discuss, both theoretical and practical views in DE.

1st. Workshop on Definition Extraction
September 18, 2009
Borovets, Bulgaria
http://www.iling.unam.mx/wde

Motivation:
Nowadays, the automatic extraction of definitions from textual data is a common
task in different domains of Natural Language Processing. Briefly, we can sketch
two main research directions:

-The use of Definition Extraction (DE) as a methodological resource in areas
such as Computational Semantic, Information Extraction, Text Mining, Ontologies,
WEB Semantics or E-Learning.
-The conception of DE as a self-challenging task, particularity in Computational
Lexicography and Terminology, toward the design and implementation of electronic
resources such as lexical knowledge bases, machine- readable dictionaries,
terminological databases, thesauri.  Such resources can be monolingual or
multilingual.

However, in contrast to the generalised use of DE in multiple domains, there is
no specific forum for sharing information about methodologies, tools, evaluation
techniques or applications related directly with DE.

We propose this 1st Workshop on Definition Extraction as such an exchange forum,
with the hope that this workshop could become an academic space to share and
assess new methodologies, tools and techniques, in the spirit of promoting the
DE as a consolidated research area.

Topics:
This workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss, both theoretical and
practical views in DE. The following are examples of topics that are relevant,
but not exclusive, for the workshop:
- Discussions, analysis, positions around the state of art on DE.
- Concrete uses of resources obtained from DE in scientific or technical areas.
- Original methodologies considering the use of symbolic and/or statistical
methods for the recognition and extraction of possible candidates of textual
definitions.
- Comparisons between DE from structured (such as Wikipedia) and unstructured
textual data.
- Development of computational tools for extracting definitions from large corpora.
- Concrete applications of DE within larger projects in Language Learning,
Automated Reasoning, Text Mining, etc.
- DE in multilingual environment.

Target Audience:
Lexicographers, terminographers, linguists, computational linguists, NLP 
community and those people interested in DE field.

Tentative Program (1 Full Day):
1 Invited speaker (to be determined)
8-10 papers
4-5 software demonstrations

Official Language
The official language of the conference is English.

Paper Submission Process:
-Submission process will be independent for RANLP-2009: papers should be
submitted to the e-mail address wde@iingen.unam.mx.
- However, all submissions should follow RANLP-2009 papers format (no longer
than 7 pages, including cover page, figures, tables and references).
