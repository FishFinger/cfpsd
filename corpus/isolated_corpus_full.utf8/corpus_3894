First Call for Papers

EAMT 2009

The 13th Annual Conference of the

European Association for Machine Translation

Barcelona, Spain, May 14-15, 2009

The annual conference of the European Association for Machine Translation i=
s intended to provide a forum for researchers, commercial developers and us=
ers to exchange ideas concerning all aspects of Machine Translation and tra=
nslation-related tools and resources. The aim is to present recent research=
 and the current state of the art in the area, explore emerging R&D trends,=
 provide information about evaluation techniques and tools and review the t=
ranslation needs for and uses of translation technologies on the part of go=
vernment and industry.

Scientific Programme

This year the central theme of the conference is:

Translation among European languages, especially for languages with smaller=
 speech communities and limited digital resources

There are 23 official languages in the EU almost half of which have fewer t=
han 10 million speakers. In addition, there are perhaps as many as 80 addit=
ional recognized languages or dialects spoken within its territory, the maj=
ority of which have fewer than 2 million speakers. The problems faced by go=
vernment and industry in providing goods and services to people in their na=
tive language, in many cases a matter of law, is at the very least daunting=
. At the same time, current MT development methods require large amounts of=
 human and/or digital resources. Thus, the focus of this EAMT conference is=
 on methods for developing translation technologies for and among languages=
 with fewer speakers and more limited digital resources.

At the same time, contributions are welcome on all topics related to MT or =
translation-related technologies including:

=B7      MT methodologies and techniques

=B7      Speech-to-speech translation

=B7      Translation aids (translation memory, terminology databases, etc.)

=B7      Practical MT systems (MT for professionals, MT for multilingual eC=
ommerce, MT for localization, etc.)

=B7      Translation environments (workflow, support tools, conversion tool=
s for lexica, etc.)

=B7      MT embedded in other services (web search, eGovernment, etc.)

=B7      MT evaluation techniques and tools

=B7      Dictionaries and lexica for MT

=B7      Text and speech corpora for MT

=B7      Standards in text and lexicon encoding for MT =


=B7      Human factors in MT and user interfaces

=B7      Multilingual technologies (natural language generation, informatio=
n retrieval, text categorization, text summarization, information extractio=
n, etc.) =


The two-day programme will include invited talks, oral presentations and po=
ster sessions. =
