Abstract: The present research examines MIS exemplar articles, analyzing 
their citation patterns in MIS and other scientific fields. Using MIS 
Quarterly articles of the year and peer-nominated articles, we identified 
36 exemplar MIS articles. 117 all, 421 journals contained articles that 
cited the exemplars. Our five findings are: (1) the HIS exemplars cover a 
wide range of themes, (2) the average life-time for an exemplar article 
(as expressed through the citations mode to the article) is 17 years , as 
compared with an 11 year expected life time for scientific journal 
articles, (3) the dominant life-cycle pattern for an an exemplar takes the 
form of a bell curve, (4) exemplar articles that were conceptual in nature 
are not cited any more frequently than articles treating contemporary, 
issues, and (5)conceptual contributions have a longer lifetime of citation 
activity than contemporary exemplars. Future research will in ore closely 
examine HIS and its reference disciplines, as is revealed through 
extensive citation analysis of the exemplars.
