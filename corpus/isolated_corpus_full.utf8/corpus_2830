- different kinds of speech situation;
- affect (attitudes and emotions);
- gestures;
- morpho-syntactic constraints.

The analysis could be pursued in theoretical frameworks such as Information Structure theory, Grice's theory, Relevance theory, grammaticalization theory, Gussenhoven's biological codes, prosodic modelling, etc.

Time for Papers: 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for questions.

Conference Language: English

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
