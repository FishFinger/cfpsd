Dear Subscribers:

This is LINGUIST List's seventeenth year of operation. And-you guessed it - this 
month is the beginning of our thirteenth Fund Drive. Those of you who have lived 
in the United States know that non-profit organizations like Public TV, Public 
Radio, and, yes, LINGUIST List, have to depend on subscriber donations for a large 
portion of their operating expenses. But Public TV and Radio are partially subsidized 
by the government: LINGUIST List is not. We mention this because every year we 
receive a message or two suggesting that we apply for government money instead of 
depending on donations.

Alas, in the American system, such funding isn't available for institutions like 
LINGUIST List. We do get office space and server support from Eastern Michigan 
University; and the English Department (in which the Linguistics Program is housed) 
generously supports two graduate assistants, who each work 20 hours a week. But 
if you have looked at the LINGUIST List website recently, you know that two grad 
students working half-time for 8 months a year couldn't possibly maintain our 
services.

Most of our standard posting services-e.g., jobs postings, conference and call 
postings, book postings, book reviews-require at least two students. The Jobs category 
alone has had well over 650 postings this year, and a large proportion of these 
'routine' postings require email correspondence with the submitters. We even classify 
all postings by linguistic subfield and subject language in order to make them 
more easily retrievable and more useful to you. We take pride in meeting a 48-hour 
turnaround time on all postings, which means that some students have to be available 
on weekends and holidays. And LINGUIST is a year-round operation. For the year 
2007, we posted close to 3,900 issues for you to read-at your leisure, of course! 
And we archive all our postings so that you can easily search our site for past 
messages.

But posting is just part of what we do. Our website has over 2000 pages which 
have to be maintained and updated for missing or bad links. Reflect for a moment 
on what these pages contain: information on 18,040 linguists (many of whom move 
often!); publications that include 6,700 book notices, 1520 dissertation abstracts, 
2010 book reviews, 1970 academic papers, and 520 journals. We list the websites 
of 490 publishers, 180 professional societies, and maintain a database of 130 
linguistics mailing lists and their discussions. Finally, there's our searchable 
database of information on more than 7,000 unique languages and their families.

This past year, we have been developing several new services that you should know 
about. One of these is a free abstract submission and review service designed 
especially for organizers of small conferences. This will enable organizers to 
customize an abstract submission template to fit their needs, and link it to their 
conference website. We'll host the resulting abstract submission and review 
facility for free, and give them a service that normally only the bigger conferences 
can afford.

Another new service, currently under development, is our "Student Portal." This is
designed for students who are interested in human language. It will provide future
linguists with a broad range of information on the discipline and show them how 
to pursue it as a career: how to find appropriate programs, how to pay for one's 
education, how to improve one's academic writing and presentation, how to find 
the right research tools and resources and good career counseling. It will even 
give information on the best ways to find a job.

A third service under development is a facility for advertising linguistic internships.
Similar to our Jobs postings, this will be a list of current linguistic internships
available around the world. It will even include a few summer internships right 
here at LINGUIST. This service will feature an upload function for students who 
wish to provide resumes, giving both employers and potential interns an easy place 
to exchange information.

Some supporters have asked us-very politely-why it takes so many graduate students 
to run LINGUIST. If you look at the large number of things we do, you can see why. 
Other supporters wonder whether we have other external means of support for the 
work we do. We are proud of some of the external grants that LINGUIST has received 
over the years: a Sun Microsystems server equipment grant, for example, as well 
as several National Science Foundation grants that have helped us develop our web 
infrastructure. This is one of the reasons why we have a sophisticated database, 
search facilities, and mailing list software. We also received the 5-year E-MELD 
grant, Electronic Metadata for Endangered Language Data, which was aimed at developing
linguistic infrastructure for the discipline, and in particular for those involved 
in endangered languages work.

As generous as this support has been, however, it only builds facilities which we 
must then support all by ourselves. It does not support the many graduate-and some
undergraduate-students who do all the hard work, nor for the training they receive. 
For seventeen years, LINGUIST has been dedicated to providing our email and website 
services to linguists across the world without cost to the users. And we are 
determined to keep it as a free service to you. But this doesn't mean that the 
services themselves don't cost money!

Your support is helping produce the next generation of linguists, linguists who 
not only have a good grounding in linguistics, but who are especially sophisticated 
in the use of language technologies and tools that will ultimately contribute to 
preserving knowledge of the world's languages and linguistic structures. We are 
very proud indeed of how many of our bright and dedicated LINGUIST assistants go 
on to enroll in Ph.D. programs at some of the world's best graduate schools.

So, once again, we are asking those of you with the means to do so to contribute 
to the LINGUIST List 2008 Fund Drive. Remember: all of your support and donations 
go exclusively to paying our graduate students for their work at LINGUIST. It goes 
to those who most need it, and who are the future of our discipline.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/ fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

 Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
