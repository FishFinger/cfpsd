The 17th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference will be held November 9-11,
2007, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This
conference aims to provide a forum for presenting research in Japanese and
Korean linguistics, thereby facilitating efforts to deepen our understanding of
these two languages, which have striking typological similarities. This year in
addition to the general session, two workshops with guest speakers are scheduled
during the conference.

Papers in all sub-areas of Japanese and Korean linguistics are invited.
Presentations will be 20 minutes long and will be followed by a 10-minute
question and answer period. Please submit abstracts (one page, 500 words
maximum) as a PDF file attached to an email message to JK17@humnet.ucla.edu by
July 15, 2007 (Please note this new deadline). You may use a second page for
references and/or example sentences. The first line of your abstract should
indicate the category (Formal or Functional), followed by the sub-field (e.g.,
Formal/Syntax, Functional/Discourse, etc.). The second line should be the paper
title, followed by the number of words used on the first page of the abstract,
excluding the first two lines with the category, the sub-field, and the paper
title (e.g., Title (492)). Omit your name and affiliation from the abstract. In
the body of your email message, include name(s) and affiliation(s), address,
phone number, and email address, followed by the category, the sub-field, and
the paper title (e.g., Title (492)) copied from the top of the first page of the
abstract. Use the following subject header for your email: ''JK17, Last name,
First Initial.'' Please note that only one abstract from each individual can be
considered for acceptance. One individual abstract or one jointly authored
abstract may be submitted.  All the necessary information about the conference
will appear on our conference website: http://www.alc.ucla.edu/jk17/.

Meeting Description:
Annual meetings of the Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and
Computation (PACLIC) have provided places where scholars in theoretical and
computational linguistics mainly from the Pacific Asia region get together to
share new ideas about language, information and computation. The conference
focuses on studies of diverse languages used in the Pacific-Asia region like
Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. 

Call for Papers

The 21st PACLIC, organized under the auspices of the PACLIC Steering Committee,
will be held at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea, on November 1-3,

Following the tradition of previous PACLIC meetings in Hong Kong (2001), Jeju,
Korea (2002), Singapore (2003), Tokyo, Japan (2004), Taipei (2005), and Wuhan,
China (2006), PACLIC21 emphasizes the integration of theoretical frameworks with
applied fields, cognitive accounts for language processing, and computational
modeling of language. 

We invite prospective authors to submit abridged versions of original and
unpublished papers on all aspects of theoretical and computational linguistics.
Possible topics include but are not limited to: (1) language, (2) information,
and (3) computation. Priority will be given to papers that are interdisciplinary
and cover a wide range of languages in Asia. Outstanding papers will be
considered as candidates for the best paper prize.
 
Abridged papers should not exceed 3,000 words including the bibliography. Author
information should appear on a separate page with (1) the topic area of the
paper: (language and/or information and/or computation), (2) the title of the
paper, (3) name(s) of the author(s), (4) affiliation(s), (5) postal address(es),
(6) e-mail address for correspondence, and (7) the preference for oral or poster
presentation. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings
(Previous PACLIC proceedings are indexed by ISTP/ISIProceedings). The deadline
for paper submission is June 30, 2007. Papers should be submitted online at
http://paclic21.snu.ac.kr .
