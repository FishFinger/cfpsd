Meeting Description:

Grammaticalization in East Asia 

Call for Papers

Previous research on grammaticalization in East Asian languages mainly focuses
on the individual changes occurring in a specific language as well as comparison
between examples from Asian languages and previous studies in European languages
as an isolated phenomenon.  For example, while TAM markers in these languages
have been studied extensively, most of the work concentrates on the development
path of individual markers, rather than change in TAM system as a whole.  In
addition, the research data is often collected from the standard variety of a
language, while the dialectal data is often neglected.  Therefore, this section
adopts a systematic approach; the emphases will be given to an example of
grammaticalization which triggers paradigmatic change, as well as typological
findings in East Asian languages as a whole, in a specific language family, or
among dialects of one language, which differ from the rest of the world.  The
systematic approach to grammaticalization will not only enable us to amalgamate
the previous findings of the individual changes, it will also evaluate their
validity.

The workshop is a part of the ICHL19 conference. Anonymous abstracts should be
submitted via the ICHL-19 website: http://www.ru.nl/cls/ichl19/

The 2009 ESSLLI Student Session will take place from July 20 to July 31 in
Bordeaux, France, as part of the annual European Summer School in Logic,
Language, and Information. We invite paper submissions from students in the
areas of logic and computation, logic and language, and language and computation
for presentation in the oral session or in the poster session. All submissions
will be reviewed by three experts in the field, and those selected for
presentation will be published in the proceedings. The Student Session is an
excellent venue to present work in progress, and also to gain experience
presenting one's research to a wide audience. As in previous years, Springer is
offering 500 Euro in textbooks for the best paper award, and 250 Euro in
textbooks to each of two runners-up.
