~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CALL For Papers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special Issue on Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP)
http://talip.acm.org/
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arabic is a Semitic language spoken by over 250 million people, in an
area extending from the Arabian Gulf in the east to the Atlantic Ocean
in the west. It is one of the six official languages of the United
Nations. It is also the language in which some of the world's greatest
works of literature, science, and history have been written.

Arabic is a strongly structured and highly derivational language.
Arabic language processing requires the treatment of the language
constituents at all levels. Each level requires extensive study and
exploitation of the associated linguistic characteristics. Over the
last few years, Arabic natural language processing (ANLP) has been
gaining increasing importance, and has found a wide range of
applications including: machine translation, information extraction,
and tutoring systems. These applications require developing innovative
approaches and techniques for natural language analysis, natural
language generation, and linguistic resources.

Various forums have been dedicated to ANLP:
* Special track on Natural Language Processing, The  International
Conference on Informatics and Systems (NLP-INFOS 2008), Cairo Univ.,
Egypt.
* Workshop on HLT & NLP within the Arabic world: Arabic Language and
local languages processing: Status Updates and Prospects, LREC, 2008
* Computational Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages, workshop
series (04, 07).
* International Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools
(NEMLAR 2004), Cairo Egypt.
* ACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages (2005, 2007)

This special issue of the ACM Transactions on Asian Language
Information Processing (TALIP) is intended to present the
state-of-the-art in research on Arabic natural language processing,
Arabic computational linguistics, applied Arabic linguistics and
related areas. This call is intended to be as broad as possible. We
solicit original research papers on topics including, but not limited
to:

* Linguistic resources (corpora, electronic dictionaries, treebanks, etc.)
* Transliteration, transcription and diacritization
* Part of speech tagging
* Morphological analysis and generation
* Shallow and deep parsing
* Machine translation
* Word sense and syntactic disambiguation
* Semantic analysis
* Information extraction and retrieval
* Question answering
* Text clustering, and classification
* Text summarization
* Text and web content  mining
* Named entity recognition
* Colloquial-based language processing

>>>> Important Dates <<<<<
* Submissions due for review: 1 April 2009
* Notification of 1st decision: 1 July 2009
* Revisions due: 15 August 2009
* Notification of acceptance: 1 October 2009
* Final version submitted: 1 November 2009
* Issue publication: March 2010

>>>>> Submission Guidelines <<<<<
Papers should be formatted following the style guidelines for the ACM
Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing
(http://talip.acm.org). The instructions for preparing manuscripts for
submission can be found at
http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions. Please submit papers in
PDF format using the web-based submission system Manuscript Central
(http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/talip). In order to identify the
submission as for the special issue, please indicate "This paper is
being submitted to the Special Issue on Arabic NLP" on the first page
of the paper. Please notice that the typical paper length is 20-30
pages.
