Meeting Description:

Moscow Syntax and Semantics (MOSS)
October 9-11, 2009

The first Moscow Syntax and Semantics (MOSS) conference will be held on October
9-11, 2009 at the Institute of the Russian language of the Russian Academy of
Sciences in Moscow.

Our young conference is a descendant of two separate conferences that took place
in Moscow earlier, the Formal Semantics in Moscow (FSiM) workshop and the
Syntactic Structures conference. MOSS's aim is to bring together people working
within different theoretical frameworks and to encourage syntacticians and
semanticists to have more substantial interaction with each other. Young
researchers are especially welcome to apply. 

Invited Speakers: 

Artemis Alexiadou, University of Stuttgart 
Rajesh Bhatt, University of Massachusetts 
Sergey Tatevosov, Moscow State University 

Call for Papers

There will be three sessions at the conference: a (mostly) syntax session, a
(mostly) semantics session, and also a separate thematic session on the syntax
and semantics of adjectives. 

The syntactic part is not limited to any particular framework or any particular
topic. We invite works in syntactic typology as well as in formal syntax, and
theoretically and typologically oriented descriptive works. The participants
should be ready to talk to an audience which might not share all of their
theoretical assumptions. The semantic part also is not limited to any particular
view on the architecture of grammar, and we invite all works in formal semantics
and formal pragmatics, and especially ones stressing the interaction of
semantics with syntax and the consequences of semantic data and analyses on the
choice between different frameworks. 

The special thematic session on adjectives and adverbials is designed to bring 
together researchers working on adjectives and adverbials from inside of
semantics and syntax. On the both sides, there has been significant progress
made recently, though the area is still heavily understudied, and as in many
other areas, there is less syntactic-semantic interaction going on than one
would hope there would be. 

Official Language: English
