Meeting Description:

Anaphora is a central topic in the study of natural language and has long been
the object of research in a wide range of disciplines such as theoretical,
corpus and computational linguistics, philosophy of language, cognitive science,
psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. On the other hand, the correct
interpretation of anaphora has played an increasingly vital role in real-world
natural language processing applications, including machine translation,
automatic abstracting, information extraction and question answering. As a
result, the processing of anaphora has become one of the most productive topics
of multi- and inter-disciplinary research, and has enjoyed increased interest
and attention in recent years. 

Second Call for Papers

DAARC2009
The 7th Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium
Goa, India
hosted by AU-KBC Research Centre, Anna University, Chennai
November 5-6, 2009
http://www.au-kbc.org/daarc2009/

In this context, the Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquia (DAARC)
have emerged as the major regular forum for presentation and discussion of the
best research results in this area. Initiated in 1996 at Lancaster University
and taken over in 2002 by the University of Lisbon, and moving out of Europe for
the first time in 2009, to Goa, India, the DAARC series established itself as a
specialised and competitive forum for the presentation of the latest results on
anaphora processing, ranging from theoretical linguistic approaches through
psycholinguistic and cognitive work to corpus studies and computational modelling.

The seventh Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium DAARC2009) will
take place in Goa, India, in November 5-6, 2009.  We would like to invite anyone
currently researching in the areas of discourse anaphora and anaphor resolution,
from any  methodological perspective or framework, to submit a paper to DAARC2009.

The closing date for submission is April 7, 2009. Notification of acceptance
will be sent by June 15, 2009. Final versions of selected papers to be included
in the proceedings are expected by June 30, 2009.

Submissions (extended abstracts) must be anonymous and at most 3 pages in
length. For further details on the submission procedure and other relevant info
on the colloquium visit its website at: http://www.au-kbc.org/daarc2009/
