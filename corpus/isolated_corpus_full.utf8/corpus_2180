INTEROPERABLE EUROPEAN LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY

A workshop organised within the Intelligent Information Systems 2008
conference in the Polish mountain resort of Zakopane on 18 June 2008.

The aim of this workshop is to review the state of art in the area of
European language resources and technology and their development,
especially, from the perspective of the CLARIN project
(http://www.clarin.eu/), scheduled to start on 1 January 2008.

The focus of the workshop will be resources and technologies for
Polish and related languages and, in particular, we expect all Polish
CLARIN participants to take an active part in the workshop, to present
their resources and to discuss plans concerning their
interoperability. There will also be space for more general CLARIN
talks and for talks concerning related languages and issues, so we
would like to cordially invite other CLARIN participants to contribute
to this workshop.

See the conference page, http://iis.ipipan.waw.pl/, for deadlines,
submission requirements and other practical information.  (Submission
deadline is 31 January 2008.)
