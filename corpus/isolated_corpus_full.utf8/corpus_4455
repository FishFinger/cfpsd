Full Title: The 5th Web as Corpus Workshop 
Short Title: WAC5 

Date: 07-Sep-2009 - 07-Sep-2009
Location: San Sebastian, Spain 
Contact Person: Igor Leturia
Meeting Email: igor@elhuyar.com
Web Site: http://www.sigwac.org.uk/wiki/WAC5 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 17-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop will be held on 7 September, 2009, in San Sebastian, preceding
SEPLN, the Spanish NLP conference: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/sepln2009/ 

Call for Papers

We invite papers on various topics concerning the use of Web resources for
corpus research and NLP applications, including (but not limited to) the following:

- linguistic Web crawler technology and Web corpus collection projects
- applications of Web-derived corpora and other kinds of Web data
- how far does the "easy way" get you? (using search engines, or Google's n-gram
lists; we are particularly interested in a critical discussion of the usefulness
and limitations of such approaches)
- methods and tools for "cleaning" Web pages to turn them into a corpus
- automatic linguistic annotation of Web data: tokenisation, POS tagging,
lemmatisation, semantic tagging, etc. (established tools often perform very
poorly on Web data)
- search engine architectures for linguists: bringing linguistics to commercial
search engines, or high-performance search technology to linguistics?
- search engine-related topics such as result ranking (e.g. how to identify
"typical" uses rather than returning 50 very similar matches on the first page)
- duplicate detection, interactive query refinement, etc.
- reviews and clever uses of search engine APIs (Google, Yahoo, Altavista, and
in particular Microsoft's current generous Live Search API)

We particularly welcome submissions on the use of languages other than English.
One of the bottlenecks in corpus linguistic research on a particular language
consists in availability of corpora for this language: translation studies for,
say, Ukrainian or Vietnamese are limited by the existence of diverse corpora for
these languages. The Web gives the opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, as
millions of Ukrainian or Vietnamese texts are available on the Web, but we still
do not know many parameters of what is there and how useful it is for
translation, language teaching, linguistics research, etc.

Submission Information:
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop. Submissions should follow the format of ACL
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files tailored
for this year's conference
(http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/).

Submissions are managed via Easy Chair. In order to submit a paper, login at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wac5 (or register an account with
Easy Chair if you don't have one yet), then click New Submission and fill in the
