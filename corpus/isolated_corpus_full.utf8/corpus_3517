I'm not mixing up anything: I'm saying that in the same way as you're
expected, when writing a paper, to justify and prove every single bit you're
asserting unless you call it "hypothesis", "heuristic" or "oracle", the same
should apply to the results for which you should "open the source", as we've
been talking about. The conversation is indeed also relevant to the cleaning
bits and other scripts, but the question of "opening the source" is still
open -- so to speak. The problem,as I understand it, goes beyond -- even
though it includes it -- the cleaning bits.
