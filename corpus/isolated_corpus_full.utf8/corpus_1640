Meeting Description
OIC 2007: Ontology for the Intelligence Community

Towards Effective Exploitation and Integration of Intelligence Resources
Hilton Hotel, Columbia, MD
November 28-30, 2007 (30th is CLASSIFIED: those with TS/SCI clearances
only and will be in Hanover, MD, near Columbia, MD).

The increasing volume, variety and velocity of intelligence analysis requires
new approaches that will enable greater flexibility, precision, timeliness and
automation of analysis to maximize valuable human resources in responding to
fast-evolving threats. 
Ontology-based technology as applied in areas such as bioinformatics has
demonstrated the possibility of gains along all of these dimensions. The time is
ripe to extend these gains also to other spheres.

This conference will bring together experts on ontology-based technology with
particular experience in the problems facing the intelligence community. It will
feature invited talks from prominent ontologists and intelligence community
leaders, as well as submitted papers focusing especially on the creation of
public-domain ontology resources to support the work of intelligence analysts.

Further information regarding submission will be provided in due course at
http://ncor.us/oic2007 

OIC 2007: Ontology for the Intelligence Community

Towards Effective Exploitation and Integration of Intelligence Resources
Hilton Hotel, Columbia, MD
November 28-30, 2007 (30th is CLASSIFIED: those with TS/SCI clearances
only and will be in Hanover, MD, near Columbia, MD).

Conference Director: Barry Smith (National Center for Ontological Research,
Buffalo) Scientific Committee
Kathleen Stewart Hornsby (Maine) (Chair); Bill Andersen (Ontology Works);
Selmer Bringsjord (Rensselaer); Werner Ceusters (Buffalo); Randall Dipert
(Buffalo); Terry Janssen (Lockheed); Kathryn Laskey (George Mason
University); Kevin Lynch (CIA); Leo Obrst (MITRE); Chris Welty (IBM
Research)

Call for Papers
Submissions are invited of short papers in pdf format (up to 1500 words)
designed to serve as the basis for 20-minute oral presentations at the
conference. Accepted papers will be published (at speaker discretion) in the
proceedings, in both an online version and prospectively a printed version. The
authors of selected papers will be invited to submit longer versions for
publication in volume 1 of a new series on Ontology for the Intelligence Community. 

Papers may address a wide variety of issues addressing the ontology needs of the
intelligence community. We are especially interested in papers devoted to the
task of creating an interoperable suite of public-domain ontologies relevant to
intelligence analysis, covering areas such as:

emergency response
urban settings
geospatial / cartographic
ethnicity
social networks
images and imaging
transportation
moving object tracking
religion and politics
biology and health

The ontologies should be combinable at will in such a way as to support the
integration of data describing different domains. We encourage submissions that
describe scenarios where multiple ontologies are linked to support higher-order
analysis and reasoning over complex data. Questions to be addressed might
include: which domains should be included in such a suite of ontologies? how can
we ensure that ontologies interoperate in useful ways? how can we address the
specific problems arising in virtue of the partiality and uncertainty of
intelligence data? how can we use domain ontologies to organize, display and
share intelligence analysis hypotheses while also maintaining a clean
distinction between types and instances in knowledge representation artifacts?

Classified Session
A classified paper and presentation/demo day will be held on the 30th only for
those holding TS/SCI Clearances. Related Intelligence Community project
participants are encouraged to submit unclassified and classified presentations.
Because we are still in the process of determining the submission procedure for
this, Unclassified inquiries about Classified submissions or procedures can be
addressed to Leo Obrst (lobrst@mitre.org) or Terry Janssen
(terry.janssen@lmco.com).  Unclassified paper submissions with Classified
Demonstrations are also encouraged. We will have more general guidelines for
Classified submissions shortly. Details on how to pass clearances, and to whom,
will be provided to those who sign up for the Classified day on the 30th.

Deadlines
Receipt of papers: July 15, 2007
Notification of acceptance: August 31, 2007

Further information regarding submission will be provided in due course at
http://ncor.us/oic2007

For inquiries please write to: ncor@buffalo.edu.
