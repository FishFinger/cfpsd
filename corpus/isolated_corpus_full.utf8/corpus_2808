ACL-08 Workshop on Parsing German 

3rd Call for Papers

ACL 2008
Workshop on Parsing German
(PaGe 08)
June 20, 2008
Columbus, Ohio

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/acl08parsinggerman/

German possesses an interesting set of configurational properties on the syntactic level which make it far less flexible with respect to word order than other free word order languages.  Analyses of these properties, which have formed a part of the traditional syntax of German since the early 19th century, only re-entered the mainstream of generative linguistics research within the last twenty years or so. In computational linguistics, however, their realization has varied quite widely: ''topological fields'' in HPSG-style analyses, multiple parse trees, special constraints on liberation in constraint-based dependency-style analyses, various hybrid ''deep/shallow'' approaches, and agnostic parameter estimation over graphs. This variation can also acutely be felt in the annotation of German treebanks. Many corpora have historically elected to annotate only a few of the different senses of the term ''constituent'' inherent to German syntax, resulting in standards that make Ger!
 man appear either more like English or more like Czech.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for theoretical discussion as well as a shared task, based on the TIGER and TueBa-D/Z German treebanks, for these various approaches to make their case on empirical grounds. This combination we believe to be essential to balancing the considerations of what structure merits learning versus the ease with which it can be learned. Both treebanks are annotated collections of German newspaper text on similar topics. They are annotated with POS, morphology, phrase structure, and grammatical functions. TueBa-D/Z additionally uses topological fields to describe fundamental word order restrictions in German clauses. The treebanks differ significantly in their annotation schemes, however: while TIGER relies on crossing branches to describe long distance relationships, TueBa-D/Z uses pure tree structures with designated labels for long distance relationships. Additionally, the annotation is TIGER is flat on the phrasal level while TueBa-D/!
 Z annotates phrasal structure more hierarchically.

Participation in the shared task is optional.

Topics
- constituent based approaches to parsing German
- dependency based approaches to parsing German
- treatment of long-distance relationships in German
- comparisons of parsing results for German to other free word order languages

Shared Task

The workshop will feature a shared task on parsing German. We will provide the following data sets:

- TIGER in constituent structure
- TIGER in dependency structure
- TueBa-D/Z in constituent structure
- TueBa-D/Z in dependency structure

The task will be to parse both treebanks using one structural encoding. The final ranking of systems will be based on averages computed between both treebanks. The data sets will be made available free of charge for the shared task, but they do require a license.

In order to take part in the shared task, participants should register their intent to participate by sending an email to skuebler@indiana.edu. More information will be made available to registered participants.

Important Dates
Release of training data: February 5, 2008
Release of test data: March 5, 2008
Submission of test results: March 10, 2008
Evaluation results available: March 12, 2008

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: March 17, 2008
Notifications sent to authors: April  4, 2008
Camera ready due: April 18, 2008
Workshop Dates: June 20, 2008

Paper Submission Information:

In addition, shared task participants will be invited to submit short papers describing their systems and/or their evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled via the START system:

Full Title: Constraints in Discourse III 
Short Title: CID III 

Date: 30-Jul-2008 - 01-Aug-2008
Location: Potsdam, Germany 
Contact Person: Anton Benz
Meeting Email: benz@zas.gwz-berlin.de
Web Site: http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 25-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

Semantics and Pragmatics of Discourse Interpretation and Generation.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for presenting recent research on constraints in discourse. The target areas include the recognition of discourse structure as well as the interpretation and generation of discourse in a broad variety of domains. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from diverse formal approaches, including but not limited to:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
- Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
- Tree Adjoining Grammars
- Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
- The QUD Modell
- Plan Based Reasoning
- Abductive Reasoning
- Gricean Pragmatics
- Speech Act Theory 

Second Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 25-Apr-2008
Workshop on Constraints in Discourse III

Location: Potsdam, Germany
http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org

We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of the role of constraints in discourse, as well as empirical studies that shed light on their empirical validity. The conference is explicitly intended for discussion and comparison of theoretical accounts that lay the ground for applications. It is not intended as a platform for system demonstrations. Specific topics might relate to:
 - Anaphora Resolution
 - Co-reference
 - Dialogical vs. Monological Discourse
 - Questions and Answers
 - Lexicon and Discourse Relations
 - Cognitive Modeling
 - Underspecification and Nonmonotonic Inferences
etc.

The organisers are planning to publish a book based on the contributions to
this workshop.

Publication (and workshop) language is English.

This is the third in a series of workshops entitled ''Constraints in Discourse''.

It is a linguistic commonplace to say that the meaning of text is more than the conjunction of the meaning of its sentences. But what exactly are the rules that govern its interpretation, and what are the constraints that define well-formed discourse? For a long time, the development of precise frameworks of discourse interpretation has been hampered by the lack of a deeper understanding of the dependencies between different discourse units. Recent years have seen a considerable advance in this field. A number of strong constraints have been proposed that restrict the sequencing and attaching of segments at various descriptive levels, as well as the interpretation of their interrelations.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for presenting recent research on constraints in discourse. The target areas include the recognition of discourse structure as well as the interpretation and generation of discourse in a broad variety of domains. We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of the role of constraints in discourse, as well as empirical studies that shed light on their empirical validity. The conference is explicitly intended for discussion and comparison of theoretical accounts that lay the ground for applications. 

Invited Speakers:
Laurence Danlos, Universite Paris 7
Julia Hirschberg, Columbia University

Bonnie Webber, U Edinburgh, UK

Paper Submission:
Researchers interested in contributing a paper to the workshop are invited to submit an abstract that spans not more than 3 pages in PDF or PS (single column, 10pt font size, A4 paper, including a bibliography) using the form at the workshop website (http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org). Reviews will be done blindly; the abstracts may accordingly not include explicit hints that
allow the identification of the authors (such as ''in paper (...) we show that'').
