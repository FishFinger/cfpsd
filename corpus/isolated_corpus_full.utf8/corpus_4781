CALL FOR SOFTWARE DEMONSTRATIONS
at the joint conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the ACL and the 4th I=
JCNLP

Suntec, Singapore
August 2-7, 2009

http://isoft.postech.ac.kr/~hernus/acl_demo/

Deadline for submission: March 30, 2009

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACL-IJCNLP-09 Program Committee invites proposals for the
Demonstrations Program. We encourage both the submission of early
research prototypes and interesting mature systems. Commercial sales
and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations
Program, and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program.


Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and
applied computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the
topics listed for the conference paper submission:
http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/callforpapers.html

The systems may be of the following kinds:
* Natural Language Processing systems or system components
* Application systems using language technology components
* Software tools for computational linguistics resesarch
* Software for demonstration or evaluation
* Development tools


Format for Submissions

Demo proposals consist of the following parts, which should all be
sent to the Demo Chairs. Please use the main ACL-IJCNLP paper
formatting guidelines.

* An extended abstract of the technical content to be demonstrated,
  including title, authors, full contact information, references, and
  acknowledgements.

* A "script outline" of the demo presentation, including accompanying
  narrative, and either a Web address for accessing the demo or visual
  aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams).

* A detailed description of the hardware, software and internet
  service requirements expected to be provided by the local organizer.

The entire proposal should not be more than four pages.


Submissions Procedure

The deadline for proposals is March 30, 2009. Submissions must be
received electronically. Please submit your proposals and any
inquiries to (both chairs):

Gary Geunbae Lee (gblee@postech.ac.kr) and
Sabine Schulte im Walde (schulte@ims.uni-stuttgart.de)

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to
computational linguistics, innovation, scientific contribution,
presentation, as well as potential logistical constraints.

Accepted submissions will be allocated maximum four pages in the Companion
Volume to the Proceedings of the Conference.
