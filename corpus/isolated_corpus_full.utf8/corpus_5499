Teachers College, Columbia University Working Papers in TESOL & Applied
Linguistics is an online journal
(http://www.tc.columbia.edu/tesolalwebjournal) dedicated to publishing
research in progress in the fields of TESOL and Applied Linguistics. Within
a conceptual framework that values an integration of theory and practice,
the journal publishes full-length articles dealing, in a principled way,
with language, language acquisition, language teaching, and language
assessment. The journal also publishes interviews, short commentaries, and
book reviews.

The Editorial Board is currently accepting manuscripts for review for the
Fall 2009 issue. Submissions from both within and outside the Teachers
College community are welcome. The deadline for submission is September
6th, 2009.

Articles submitted to the journal should normally be no longer than 8,000
words. Each paper must begin with an abstract not exceeding 200 words. No
information that identifies the author should be included in the paper. A
separate title page should be provided, with the following information:
title, the author's name, affiliation, address, e-mail address and both a
daytime and an evening telephone number. Contributors may submit their
papers in either of two ways. Three printed copies (double-spaced
throughout) or an electronic version of the initial submission should be
sent/e-mailed to:
