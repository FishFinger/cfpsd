Meeting Description:

International Symposium
Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Ambiguity: 
Linguistics, Literary Studies and Rhetoric

Eberhard-Karls University Tübingen
Postgraduate Program "Dimensions of Ambiguity"
Schloss Hohentübingen
November 5-7, 2009 

Call for Papers

Phenomena of ambiguity provide an interesting and controversial area of research
for linguistics and literary studies as well as for rhetoric. A particularly
rewarding field of enquiry is the resolution and production of ambiguity in
text, speech, gestures and images. 

The aim of this conference is to bring together the stimuli of these
perspectives and focus on the dimensions of ambiguity within an
interdisciplinary dialogue. We intend to address the following questions:

How is ambiguity processed and resolved?
How does ambiguity arise? How can it be generated?
What is the communicative value of ambiguity?

The following aspects may provide a first approach to the discussion:
Ellipsis and ambiguity in public speeches at the interface between syntax,
semantics, pragmatics and psycholinguistics;

The relationship between linguistic ambiguities and ambiguous subject matter in
literary texts (possible examples are the different versions of the last
sentence of Dickens's Great Expectations or the letter A becoming an ambiguous
sign in Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter);

The status of mishearings and mondegreens at the prelexical and lexical level
within a model of language processing;

Beyond the ambiguity of linguistic signs: the ambiguity of the signified, e.g.
conceptual figure-ground-effects and their manifestations in language;
Ambiguity in visual sign systems, e.g. in images, films or gesture-based texts.

We invite abstracts for 30-minute-talks (plus 30 minutes for discussion). Please
send your abstracts (200 - 300 words) to ambiguity@nphil.uni-tuebingen.de until
May 31, 2009.
