and post-graduate students, post-doctorial researchers plus academic and
industrial researchers and system developers with backgrounds in Computer
Science, Information Science, Language Technologies and related areas. The

.         System Architectures and Multilinguality

.         Information Extraction in a Multilingual Context

.         Machine Translation for Multilingual Information processing

.         Interactive Aspects of Cross-Language Information Retrieval

An optional student mentoring session where students can present and discuss
with lecturers their research ideas will also be organised.
