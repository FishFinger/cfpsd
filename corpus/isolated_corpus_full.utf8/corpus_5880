CALL FOR PAPERS

Special Issue on Pushing the frontier of Statistical Machine Translation

THE MACHINE TRANSLATION JOURNAL

http://www.springer.com/computer/artificial/journal/10590


Guest editors:
Lucia Specia (University of Wolverhampton)
and Nicola Cancedda (Xerox Research Centre Europe)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many current approaches to statistical machine translation are based
on incremental improvements over a standard framework: word-alignments
produced by IBM-models, rules extracted from word alignments using
heuristics, a log-linear model combining commonly used features whose
weights are optimized on a development set using reference translations,
and a beam-search decoder to generate final translations.

This special issue is dedicated to alternative approaches to
statistical MT radically diverging in as many as possible of the
aspects involved in the process, including (but not limited to) the
following:

- Word / phrase alignment (including hierarchical alignment)
- Rule / phrase extraction
- Statistical translation models
- Features / factors and ways to combine them
- Combination of linguistic and statistical methods
- Language modelling
- Real-time adaptation of MT with user feedback
- Domain adaptation of MT
- Parameter optimization
- Decoding

Contributions on approaches which still achieve performance levels
below the state of the art can be suitable for inclusion in this
issue, provided they stem from sound directions with clear potential
for further developments.
