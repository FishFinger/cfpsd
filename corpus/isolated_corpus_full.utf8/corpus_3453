Francis,

I agree with you: no flame war!

However, you should know that the only people who ever bought INTEX did not
buy it from my university, but from an organization called ASSTRIL run by
the same guys who brought you Unitex; Unitex was born a few weeks after a
lawyer forced them to stop selling INTEX, after a year-long battle.

I am puzzled by your argument: does GPL philosophy really advocate copying
other people's work without proper authorization or citation? Call me naive
but I thought GPL licensing was created to *protect* original authors, not
to pirate them. It took me 10 years to write INTEX and I was devastated when
unscrupulous colleagues plagiarized it.

Actually I believe that Unitex is an insult to the GPL community: how does
Unitex-style behavior help academics feel confident that they can indeed
give away the source of their work without fearing that they will be
plagiarized?

Finally, your argument against the right of a small lab (which has no access
to CNRS funding) to decide on its distribution policy is used by pirates to
advocate copying movies/CDs/software. Don't you think there ought to be some
minimal respect of author's rights, especially within the academic
community?

By "free software" I assume you mean free as in price as opposed to free
as in freedom. Unitex is licensed under the GPL and is truely free
software, which means people are free to: =


* Use it for any purpose
* Study how it works
* Share it with their friends and colleagues
* Improve it and adapt it to their needs, and then release these changes
so that everyone can benefit.

Compared to the INTEX licence where people,

* Can use it for unambiguously non-commercial purposes only
* Cannot study how it works
* Cannot share it with friends and colleagues
* Cannot improve it and adapt it to their needs, and then release these
changes so that everyone can benefit.

I'd write more, but I think the above speaks for itself and don't want
to risk getting into a flame war ;)

Not quite sure how one defines "wasting money". In this context it is
probably equivalent to spending any money at all when there is a free
alternative available.

I have seen the Sketch Engine <http://www.sketchengine.co.uk> (c. 50 Euro
p.a.) perform very rapidly on a corpus of 1,000 mill (a.k.a. billion) words.
And it includes Corpus Builder which allows you to, erm, build your own
corpus.

Speaking of wasting money, I am writing from the Eurocall Conference where
my Hungarian hotel costs are far in excess of 50 Euro per night. But one
deserves a little luxury, n'est pas?

I do not condone unauthorised copying of software code (what you refer
to as "piracy"). However, if someone writes something that works the
same as your software with their own code and their own hands, this
should not be a problem. I don't believe in software patents.

My understanding of the original post was that someone had replicated
the functionality of your software as a piece of free software. This is
something I completely endorse. There are many pieces of free software
which have started out as "clones" of other pieces of non-free software,
and have in time become better. If this wasn't the case, my apologies
for the "holier than thou" earlier response.

Regards,

Fran

Obviously it is impossible to prove that they used the copy/paste command.
However, there are clues that they had full access to INTEX's whole source
and resources while "designing" (their word) Unitex. The least technical
ones:

-- INTEX was sold by ASSTRIL (the same guys). How could they sell it without
my knowing, and yet be able to generate the right decryption license keys
for their customers to run INTEX?

-- You really need to check out the analysis report on the "similarities"
between the two pieces of software, manuals, file formats and linguistic
resources at:

http://mshe.univ-fcomte.fr/intex/Unitex.htm

If you don't read French, at least check out the screen shots, for instance
of the Sentence graph (search for section "2.4.2 D=E9coupage en phrases (p.
13)"): a few weeks of work, just stolen. Do you really believe the Unitex
graph was "designed" to be compatible with INTEX, rather than just copied?
by the way the comments "regle #1", "regle #2", etc. are references to the
INTEX manual; why would Unitex contain links to INTEX's manual?

-- half a dozen features of INTEX are exactly the same in Unitex, even
though they no longer make any sense in a Unicode environment. For instance,
INTEX which is based on 8-bit ASCII, needs functions to deal with
alphabetical order, accented and foreign letters; why are these functions
even exist in a Unicode Unitex ? don't they know about Char.IsALetter () ?
how come they ended up writing C functions with the same names as INTEX's if
they did not have access to INTEX's source?

-- etc. (there are other funny clues)

Just in case you wonder how they could do it and even capitalize on it,
really big time: in the French academic world,  a researcher has no right on
his/her work, which it is owned by his university solely. Therefore he/she
cannot defend himself/herself legally. And French universities do not sue
other French universities, because they are all state-controlled by the same
minister. And then some researchers just love open software so much that
they don't want to know! There is also the big-CNRS-vs-little-provincial-lab
thing. And other considerations. Checkmate.

If they stole the code, they stole the code. Nobody is condoning that.

My arguments are only valid for work-the-same or work-a-like programs
where the code has been written from scratch.

A general algorithm for that task would be a solution to the
problem of "language understanding".  And no computer system
can truly be said to understand natural language with anything
remotely resembling human ability.

In any case, I would first ask what you mean by "semantic structure".
Most people who propose a theory of semantic structure have also
proposed some method for relating a syntactic structure, such as a
parse tree or a dependency graph, to a semantic structure of the
type specified by the theory.

There are many good parsers that produce correct syntactic
structures for a reasonable percentage of sentences of some genre.
However, the percentage of completely correct semantic structures
generated from those syntactic structures is much, much lower.
