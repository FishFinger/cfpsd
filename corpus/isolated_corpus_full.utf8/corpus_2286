Meeting Description

The objective of the International Summer School 2008 is to draw together the
current debates about regional identity and the structural elements of culture
upon which regions are based. 

Regional Identity has long been a dynamic branch of research, to which more and
more interdisciplinary approaches are finding access. Against this backdrop, the
question arises whether and how regions can be described from a cultural
perspective and distinguished from each other. Are region defined by certain
parameters, such as state or administrative borders, the prevalence of elements
of a particular material or intellectual culture, or the realms of certain
linguistic interactions or other social practices? What role is played by
perception and attribution, both from the outside and from within the region in
question, in the process of rooting a regional identity in the collective
consciousness? How can the various levels of scale be brought to bear in the
comparison of regions? 

The objective of the International Summer School is to draw together the current
debates about regional identity and the structural elements of culture upon
which regions are based. This discussion will provide a starting point for the
interdisciplinary comparison of innovative PhD projects. The centre of
reflection will by no means be a functional analysis of administrative or
strategic regions, but rather a perspective that could best be captured in the
coupling of the concepts "Region of Culture" and "Region of Identity". Which
phenomena and concepts, from history, language, academia as well as popular and
high culture, can make regions tangible? And does this attempt to define
correlate with the diverse aspects of identification and identity management
connected to regions? Accordingly, we particularly welcome PhD projects that
address the following issues:

- the structural persistence of "Regions of History", regions as sites of
memory, regional historiography and the regional politics of history and the past; 
- the genesis of cultural identities in linguistic contact regions and phenomena
of linguistic standardization on a regional level;
- identity formation through regional literatures and the stylization of regions
in literary works, music and the fine arts;
- the identity-forming effect of practices of popular culture within a
particular local and regional space

On which level of scale to approach these issue is a question deliberately left
open to candidates so that the example regions they use can range in scale from
local to medium-sized regions (e.g. the Basque region, Alsace, Silesia or
Transylvania), over trans-border regions, to European sub-regions (like
Scandinavia or the Balkans).

The International Summer School 2008 is interdisciplinary but does place
emphasis on the study of culture. From the perspective of various academic
disciplines, high-ranking scholars from Germany and abroad will shed light on
current debate and lay open questions for further discussion. Proposals for PhD
projects should stem from the academic fields of history, linguistics and
literary studies, art history, musicology, ethnology and anthropology, but
projects informed by the study of culture from other disciplines (such as
Geography, Sociology and Political Science) are very welcome. 

The International Summer School is hosted jointly by the International Graduate
Centre for the Study of Culture (GCSC), the Centre for Eastern European Studies
(Giessener Zentrum Östliches Europa - GiZo) at the University in Giessen and the
Herder Institute in Marburg. The involvement of the Herder Institute (which
holds unique collections about Eastern European history and culture) and the
Centre for Eastern European Studies in Giessen (GiZo) are reflected in the
emphasis of the Summer School on Eastern Europe. The Herder Institute also
offers participants the opportunity to pursue their studies on relevant topics
at the Herder Institute after the Summer School has ended. However, the aim is a
far broader, pan-European comparative perspective, which can also include papers
on German regions.

The International Summer School will take place from 13th to 23rd July 2008. The
first five days in the castle of Rauischholzhausen (close to Marburg) will be
dedicated to the discussion of central concepts and the differing approaches of
various disciplines. Then, the participants will be divided into groups working
in three parallel sections, where prevailing methodological and theoretical
questions will be examined more closely and individual PhD projects will be
presented (in talks of 20-25 minutes) and discussed. An excursion offering
concrete examples for the interconnection of regional identities and cultural
management will also be part of the International Summer School that will,
finally, be rounded up by a practical course of one and a half days to be
completed optionally at the Herder Institute, the GiZo or the GCSC. 

Confirmed keynote speakers for the castle of Rauischholzhausen: Prof. Dr.
Christian Prunitsch (Dresden), Ana Pizarro (Santiago de Chile).

The conference languages are English and German. About a month prior to the
International Summer School, a reader will be made available as a basis for
discussion. The hosts will as a rule bear the expenses for travel and
accommodation, as well as much of the maintenance costs. PhD students from
abroad are particularly encouraged to apply. If you have any further questions,

Meeting Description

The Fifth International Contrastive Linguistics Conference (ICLC5) will be
held on July 7 - 9, 2008 at the University of KULeuven 

Final Call for Papers

(Abstract Deadline: December 31, 2007)

The Fifth International Contrastive Linguistics Conference (ICLC5) will be held
July 7 - 9 2008 at the University of Leuven (Belgium).
The aim of ICLC 5 is to encourage the comparison between two (or more) languages
from a theoretical linguistic perspective. Although contrastive linguistics has
long been associated primarily with applied linguistics (in particular foreign
language teaching), it is defined here as a subdiscipline of linguistics with
major theoretical implications, which may contribute to our understanding of
linguistic structures and functions.
We invite papers or posters with a comparative approach to topics related to one
of the following domains: discourse analysis and pragmatics, syntax and
semantics, lexicon and morphology, phonetics and phonology. Empirically founded
studies with theoretical implications will be especially welcomed.

We are pleased to announce the following keynote speakers: 

Kasia Jaszczolt (Cambridge University) 
Meaning merger: An object of study for contrastive semantics and pragmatics?

Ekkehard König (Freie Universität Berlin) 
Reviving Contrastive Linguistics: A Programmatic Sketch

Peter Koch (Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen) 
Lexical typology and contrastive linguistics

Antoinette Renouf (University of Birmingham) 
A comparison of idiom construction in English and French mainstream journalism

Anne Zribi-Hertz (Université de Paris 8) 
Plural as a non category: some teachings from language comparison

Paper presentations will be 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for discussion. To
facilitate communication among participants, papers should preferably be
presented in English. However, if necessary, presentations in Dutch, French,
Spanish, German or Italian are also acceptable.

Submission Information
Participants can only present one paper. Exceptionally, two papers may be
presented by the same participant, provided that both are co-authored. There is
a maximum of three named authors/participants per paper.
Acceptance is based on anonymous review of submitted abstracts. The abstract
should specify the subject addressed as well as the main conclusions. It should
also outline the empirical data on which the analysis is based, and cite the
main references to previous work on the subject. 
Abstracts should comply with the formatting of the MS Word template available
here and sent by e-mail to ICLC5@arts.kuleuven.be before December 31, 2007. 
Please use ''ICLC5 abstract'' as subject header of your e-mail and name the
attachment: ''ICLC5_your_full_name.doc''.

Fees/ Accommodation and Social Programme
The registration fee is 150 Euros. The registration form will be available on
the conference website as of early January 2008. Payments can be made by bank
transfer or credit card (Visa or Mastercard).

The registration fee includes three lunches, coffee breaks, the book of
abstracts and the social programme, which consists of a guided tour of the
mediaeval city of Leuven (Sunday evening, 6 July) and a reception with drinks
and refreshments (Monday, 7 July). The conference dinner is offered at an
additional price of 40 euros, and takes place on Tuesday evening (8 July) in the
historical surroundings of the Beguinage, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
A list of hotels and hostels can be found on the conference website. Early
booking is recommended, since many conferences are held in Leuven at this time
of year.

Publication
The Scientific Committee will select papers of outstanding scientific quality
for publication in a blind refereeing process.
