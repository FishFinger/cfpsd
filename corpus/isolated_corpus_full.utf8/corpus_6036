This conference will take place on September the 7th 2010 at the University=
 of
Cergy-Pontoise and concerns all PhDs and Young researchers who have graduat=
ed a
year from now.=20

Call for Papers

LDI's international conference of PhDs and Young researchers aims at questi=
oning
the various processes that governs the lexicon, whether it is about its
standardization or its transgressive uses. These processes will be consider=
ed
through various disciplines, since linguistic, literary and artistic fields=
 will
be covered.

The lexicon is the privileged area of the language where speakers-writers/u=
sers'
creativity is requested. The learning of the lexicon is accompanied by an
empirical acquisition of lexical matrices. The creation of new lexical unit=
s (by
using affixal morphems, etc.) is not a regulated field. Because it's not ru=
led,
lexical creativity is multidirectional. Many lexical units can be created i=
n
order to nominate a single meaning at the same time. As for the literary do=
main,
many writers base their poeticity and their aesthetics on the reject of
constraints, whether inside of literary movements that claimed their deviat=
ion
from standardization as an aesthetic=20
project (symbolism and decadence, avant-garde movements such as Dada and
Surrealism, OuLiPo, etc.) or individual, isolated linguistic experimentatio=
ns,
without time limitation regarding the literary history.

Beyond the units, trends can oppose, complete or invalidate themselves. In =
order
to regulate the neological flow, authorities appear. Some are official (suc=
h as
Commissions de terminology), some are not (approval or rejection of the
neologism). Standardization laws, implicits or explicits, are at work. Alon=
gside
with the standardized domain, lexical rules are still violated: poetic crea=
tion,
play on words and puns, orthographic variations, non-standard productions a=
re
proof of that observation.

This conference takes place around 6 principal axes:
- Lexicon and morphology
- Diachrony/History of language
- Lexicography
- Variation and bilingualism
- Literary studies
- Linguistic policies

Submissions (8 to 10 pages in French or English, bibliography included) sho=
uld
be anonymous and accompanied by an abstract in French language.
Please, send your articles as attached .pdf or .doc files following the sty=
le
sheet by using the online submission page before March the 15th 2010.
Notifications of acceptance will be communicated before May the 15th 2010.=
=20

French and English will be the languages of this conference.

Inscription fee of 30=80 will be asked to each speaker. This fee includes t=
he
proceedings, breaks and lunch. This fee is to be paid before July 1st 2010.
