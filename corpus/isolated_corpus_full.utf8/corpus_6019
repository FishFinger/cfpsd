Full Title: Names: A Journal of Onomastics 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Oct-2009 

Second Call for Papers
Special Issue of NAMES: Names and War 

The American Name Society (ANS) is issuing its second and final call for
papers for upcoming special issue of NAMES on Names and War. The purpose of
this issue is to explore the unique ways in which the language of names can
affect individuals, communities, societies, and/or the international
community before, during, and after war. Authors interested in submitting
an article for possible publication should take care to clearly identify
the critical historical, political, and sociocultural components of the
specific war(s) in question. Furthermore, although interdisciplinary
approaches are encouraged, the core focus of the article should be placed
firmly within onomastics. All methodological approaches are welcome.
Special care should be taken, however, to specify the exact scientific
procedure followed. 

While cross-cultural comparisons are allowed, studies that provide a
detailed look at the specific relationship between armed conflict and
naming within a well-defined sociocultural, historical, and geopolitical
context will be preferred. Detailed case studies are therefore particularly
encouraged. It is hoped that the broad range of submissions received will
then provide the necessary breadth from which more general patterns may be
identified. All areas of onomastic research are welcome. All contributions
must be in English. However, the topic chosen may be from any culture or
period of time. Contributions outside of the Anglo-American experience are
then heartily welcomed. Possible sub-themes include the following: genocide
and naming; language policy, war and names; ideology and pre-war naming;
war crimes and naming; war victims and naming; war, memory, and naming;
re-building, peacetime politics, and post-war naming. An additional purpose
of this special issue is to explore the reciprocal relationship between
naming and war. Thus, this call is not only issued for submissions which
deal with the ways in which war and armed conflict can influence naming
patterns, but also the reverse as well; namely, the ways in which disputes
over names can eventually perpetuate, facilitate, or even precipitate armed
conflict. 

Authors wishing to have their article considered for publication are
instructed to send an electronic version of their submission directly to
the Special Editor Dr. I. M. Laversuch (mavi.yaz.@web.de) no later than
October 9, 2009. In addition, each submission is to be accompanied by an
electronic cover letter containing the following information: author name;
author affiliation; author email and postal address; title of submission;
total number of words.  All submissions will be subject to anonymous and
external review. Please note that to be considered for publication, article
submissions may not exceed 5000 words, may not have appeared elsewhere in
print, and must follow the NAMES style sheet
(http://www.maney.co.uk/journals/notes/nam). Once an article has been
accepted for publication in the special issue of NAMES, the author must
join the American Name Society.  Authors will be notified about paper
acceptance by February 1, 2010.  The projected date of publication is for
one of the issues of volume 58 (2010).

Specific inquiries regarding this call may be sent directly to the Series
