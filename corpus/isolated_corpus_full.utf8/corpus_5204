Meeting Description:

Root Phenomena, 
ZAS Berlin 
Sept. 2-4, 2009

In their classical paper, Hooper and Thompson 1973 described root 
phenomena as occurring unembedded and under assertive embedding. 
Unembedded environments include what would today be unintegrated (Reis 
1997) or peripheral (Haegeman 2004) adjunct clauses as well as 
appositive relatives (see de Vries 2006, Citko 2008). Matrix verbs that 
allow assertive embedding show interesting parallels to those verbs that 
embed indicative (as opposed to subjunctive) mood in Romance, a parallel 
explored early for English parenthetical formation in Bolinger 1968. A 
helpful recent review of the literature on embedded root phenomena is 
Heycock 2006.

The workshop is planned as a syntactic enterprise, with a warm welcome 
to semanticists. Questions of interest include, but are not limited to: 
Non-uniformity of embedded root phenomena (e.g. de Haan 2001), Germanic 
V2 as a root phenomenon (Reis 1997, see Bentzen et al. 2007), root 
phenomena in non-Germanic languages, modal particles and root phenomena 
(see e.g. Coniglio 2007), root phenomena and speech acts, more precise 
characterizations of 'assertive' embeddings, the grammatical 
representation of root phenomena, the semantic interpretation of root 
phenomena (see e.g. Potts 2005).
