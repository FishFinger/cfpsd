***********************************************************************
Workshop on Advanced Technologies for Digital Libraries 2009 (AT4DL  =

2009)
8 September 2009, Trento (Italy)
http://www.cacaoproject.eu/at4dl

Submission deadline: 18 June 2009
***********************************************************************

AIM and SCOPE
The fast growth of digital material is challenging for research in  =

many disciplines. The EU has funded many projects to advance research  =

in this field and facilitate end-user access to cultural and  =

scientific heritage. The ENRICH, Europeana, CACAO, GAMA, NEEO and  =

TELplus projects, funded by the eContentplus programme, have joined  =

forces to organise a workshop as a satellite event of ICSD 2009 (http://www=
.icsd-conference.org/ =

).

The workshop aims to bring together stakeholders in order to present  =

an overview of state-of-the-art systems in the field and identify open  =

research problems that require further work.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts describing running  =

projects in the field of Digital Libraries. Research projects of any  =

size are welcome, ranging from EU to PhD projects. Preference will be  =

given to projects that will be able to demonstrate a functioning  =

prototype. We also invite the submission of posters describing  =

research in progress that will be on display during the workshop.

We are particularly interested in the following topics:

  * Analysis of users' requirements and use of DL systems.
  * DL systems for supporting e-research.
  * Integration of Classification Systems, Subject Headings and IR  =

methods.
  * Multi-modal indexing of DLs.
  * Language Technologies: cross document co-reference and temporal  =

information extraction.
  * Linking and clustering data in DLs.
  * Ontology learning for DL systems.

SUBMISSION
Each extended abstract may consist of up to three (3) pages of content  =

and one (1) extra page for references.
Submissions should be made following the Author's Instructions for  =

Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).
Submission/reviewing will be electronic, managed by the EasyChair  =

system. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF.
The PDF file of the paper must be uploaded to the system by the  =

submission deadline. See details at the workshop website: http://www.cacaop=
roject.eu/at4dl


IMPORTANT DATES
  * Paper Submission: 18 June 2009
  * Notification of Acceptance: 30 July 2009
  * Camera Ready Deadline: 25 August 2009


WORKSHOP STRUCTURE:
  * In the morning, short presentations of accepted abstracts
  * In the afternoon, posters and demos time

PUBLICATIONS
All the accepted abstracts and posters will be made available online  =

before the Workshop as pre-prints published in "Bozen-Bolzano  =

University Press" series and will be distributed on a CD at the time  =

of the workshop. Following the workshop, it is planned to publish the  =

full papers as post-proceedings in Springer LNCS, the publication of  =

which is expected in early 2010.
