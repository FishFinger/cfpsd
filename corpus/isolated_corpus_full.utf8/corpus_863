                           CALL FOR PAPERS

        Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative Evaluation in
                     Natural Language Generation

                          Arlington, VA USA
                          April 20-21, 2007
          http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/

OBJECTIVES

The aim of this workshop is to bring together leading international =
researchers
in the field of natural language generation (NLG), with the aim of =
establishing
a clear, community-wide, position on the role of shared tasks and =
comparative
evaluation in NLG research. There are many views held in the NLG =
community as to
the proper role of evaluation, but so far there has been little scope to =
hammer
out these positions in a forum that provides the time and involvement =
required
to subject the different views to rigorous debate. (See the web site for =
further
background.) Our aim is for this workshop to provide that forum. We =
expect the
workshop to result in the working out of a number of clearly argued =
positions on
the issue that will serve as a base resource for the field moving =
forward.

POSITION STATEMENTS

To spark discussion at the workshop, we invite the submission of short =
position
statements that make explicit arguments for or against the adoption of =
shared
evaluation campaigns in NLG; and/or argue for specific approaches to =
comparative
evaluation in NLG. Position statements will be reviewed by the committee =
listed
below. Authors of accepted statements will be invited to attend the =
workshop.

REVIEW COMMITTEE

Dr Anja Belz            University of Brighton, UK
Prof Robert Dale        Macquarie University, Australia
Dr Helmut Horacek       University of Saarbr=FCcken, Germany
Prof Donia Scott        The Open University, UK
Dr Michael White        The Ohio State University, USA

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Position statements should follow the two-column format of ACL =
proceedings
(http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/styles/), should be in =
PDF
format, and should not exceed two (2) pages, including references. These
statements should be accompanied by a short (half page) biographical =
sketch,
also in PDF, highlighting previous work in NLG. Reviewing will not be =
blind.
Please send your position statement and biographical sketch to Michael =
White
(mwhite at ling.ohio-state.edu) and Robert Dale (rdale at ics.mq.edu.au) =
by no
later than Monday January 15, 2007.

WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION

Our intention is to hold the workshop at the Hilton Arlington adjacent =
to the
NSF's offices in Washington, DC. The workshop is planned for April =
20-21, 2007,
immediately prior to the HLT-NAACL conference in Rochester, NY, to =
maximize
opportunities for attendance by overseas participants who are already =
coming to
that event. The workshop program will contain ample time for intense and =
focused
discussion, and will include breakout sessions where groups of 4-5 =
attendees
will each elaborate on a specific proposal for how to address the =
evaluation
question in NLG. The outcomes of the workshop will be documented in a =
report,
brought together by the organizers, summarizing the workshop discussions =
and
including the participants' contributions. These proceedings will be =
made
publicly available on the workshop website.

TIMETABLE

January 15, 2007        Deadline for submitting position statements
February 15, 2007       Acceptance decisions returned
April 20-21, 2007       Workshop in Arlington, VA

TRAVEL SUPPORT

We are currently looking into ways to provide travel support to attend =
this
meeting. If you do not have access to appropriate funds, please let us =
know so
we can gauge the level of need. Note, however, that international =
participants
will be encouraged to seek travel funds from their respective countries.

QUESTIONS

Questions regarding the workshop, its topics and submission procedure =
should be
directed to the organizers, Michael White (mwhite at =
ling.ohio-state.edu) and
Robert Dale (rdale at ics.mq.edu.au).
