  * Integration of business information systems
  * Enterprise modeling for Interoperability
  * Interoperability architectures and frameworks
  * Interoperability of business standards
  * Service-oriented architectures and web services for interoperability
  * Model-driven architectures for interoperability
  * Intelligent mediators
  * Coupling of information systems
  * Interoperability of classification systems
  * (Semi-)Automatic transformation of standards
  * Interoperability of (meta) models
  * Semantic integration concepts
  * Interoperability between domain specific standards
  * Semantic analysis of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
  * Interoperability of catalog based information systems
  * Cooperation in heterogeneous information systems
  * Ontology matching, merging and aligning
  * Semantic combination of heterogeneous standards
  * Ontology- and model management
  * Interoperability of sector specific systems


Authors are encouraged to submit high quality articles online at http://www.ibis-journal.net. Please carefully look at the 
submission guidelines to prepare your submission. A template is provided for download on our website. All submissions 
should be performed online using our online submission system.
