                     Coling 2008 Call For Papers


     22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics

                        18th-22nd August 2008
                           Manchester, UK

                    http://www.coling2008.org.uk/



            *** Submission deadline: 30TH MARCH 2008 ***



Programme Co-Chairs:
    Donia Scott (Open University)
    Hans Uszkoreit (Saarland University and DFKI)

Local Organization Chair:
    Harold Somers (University of Manchester)

The International Committee for Computational Linguistics is pleased
to announce its 22nd meeting, to be held in Manchester UK on the
18th-22nd August 2008. We invite papers on substantial, original,
and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics,
including, but not limited to:

- pragmatics, semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon;
- lexical semantics and ontologies;
- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;
- parsing, generation and summarization;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- language models, spoken language recognition and understanding;
- linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, question answering, information extraction
  and text mining;
- machine learning for natural language;
- corpus-based modelling of language, discourse and dialogue;
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;
- multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- applications, tools and language resources;
- system evaluation.



REQUIREMENTS

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work or -- in the case of posters -- ongoing research rather than
intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of
the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation
results should be included. Submissions will be judged on
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

Submissions presented at the conference should mostly contain new
material that has not been presented at any other meeting with
publicly available proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in
parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the
title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with
previously published work.


REVIEWING

Reviewing will be managed by an international Conference Programme
Committee consisting of Area Chairs and associated Programme Committee
Members.

Area Chairs:
    Paul Buitelaar (DFKI, Germany)
    Robert Dale (Macquarie University, Australia)
    Mary Dalrymple (University of Oxford, UK) =

    Bill Dolan (Microsoft Research, USA)
    Eva Hajicova (Charles University, Czech Republic)
    Julia Hirschberg (Columbia University, USA)
    Chu-Ren Huang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)
    Pierre Isabelle (NRC Institute for Information Technology, Canada)
    Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)
    Miles Osborne (University of Edinburgh, UK)
    Stephen Pulman (University of Oxford, UK)
    Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)
    Junichi Tsujii (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan; Univ. of Manchester, UK)
    Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield, UK)


The reviewing process will be blind and each submission will be
reviewed by at least three programme committee members.


CATEGORIES OF PAPERS

Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: as a REGULAR PAPER
or as a POSTER. Authors must designate one of these categories at =

submission time. Regular papers will be presented a single time to a =

potentially large audience during one of the parallel paper sessions =

at the conference, and poster presentations will be repeated several =

times before small groups of people (using paper posters) at one of =

the conference poster sessions. Regular papers are most appropriate =

for presenting substantial research results, while posters are more =

appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort. The maximum =

submission length will be the same for both regular papers and posters =

(8 pages). However the final published versions will be 8 pages for =

regular papers and 4 pages for posters. Regular and poster papers =

will appear in separate volumes of the proceedings.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 30th
March 2008. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
document template that will be made available on the conference Web
site. A description of the format is also available, in case you are =

unable to use these style files directly. Papers must conform to the =

official Coling 2008 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to =

reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including =

font size restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references =

(e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's =

identity should be avoided. For example, instead of "We previously =

showed (Smith, 1991)...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...". =

Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without =

review.

For details of the submission procedure, please consult the submission =

web page at
         http://www.coling2008.org.uk/submission.html

DEADLINES

Paper submission deadline: 30th March, 2008

Notification of acceptance: 30th May, 2008
Camera ready papers due: 30th June, 2008
Coling 2008 Conference: 18-22 August, 2008


CONFERENCE VENUE

Manchester is the largest city and urban area of Northern England.
The City of Manchester itself has a population of 452,000. But with a
population of more than 2.2 million, the Manchester metropolitan area
is the second largest urban zone in the UK and the fourteenth most
populated in Europe. Manchester's international airport is a major
international hub with 220 direct destinations, more than offered by
Heathrow or Gatwick.

The city gained global fame as one of the capitals of the Industrial
Revolution.  Today Manchester is a city in transformation. The dark
satanic mills of Lowry's paintings belong to the 19th and 20th
centuries. Twenty-first century Manchester is a city of canalside
restaurants and cafes, famous for its cultural and sporting activity
as much as its business, science and education. Easily accessible by
road, rail and air, and easy to get around once you're here,
Manchester has become one of the world's most attractive, exciting
and vibrant cities, with great attractions, friendly people, and a
decent climate with -- contrary to popular belief -- about the same
rainfall as any other British city.

The city has undergone massive refurbishment in recent years, and
offers a superb range of accommodation, shopping, recreation and
dining possibilities, including the UK's second-biggest Chinatown,
the world-famous curry mile, with restaurants serving cuisine from
more than 30 different cultures, and more entries in the Good Food
Guide than any other city outside London.

Coling 2008 will take place at the brand new University Place, a
purpose-built conferences centre, one of several stunning buildings
recently built as part of the university's expansion following the
merger of UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester, making it
the biggest university in Britain.

As a birthplace of modern computing, and one of the pioneers in
computational linguistics in the UK, Manchester is delighted to host
the first Coling to be held in this country and looks forward to
welcoming you in August 2008.
