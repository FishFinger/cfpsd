Meeting Description

The Hopkins Workshop on Language (HOWL) has been created as a venue for research
into human language that is both theoretically grounded and informed by the
range of methodologies of the cognitive sciences. Each year, a topic is chosen,
and scholars present and energetically debate their ideas from the perspectives
of theoretical linguistics, acquisition, processing, breakdown, computation, and
neural representation. In past years, HOWL has given rise to lively discussion,
and speakers from all disciplines have found the discussion to be very rewarding.

HOWL 4 will take on the topic of Grammar in Cognition.
The first day of the workshop will be devoted to the interface between grammar
and conceptual structure, specifically with respect to relationships between
syntax/semantics and conceptual notions of number and quantity. The second day
will focus on how being in the cognitive system shapes phonology. As in the
past, oral presentations at HOWL 4 will be by invitation. In addition, we are
also inviting submissions for a poster session. 

We invite submissions on the place of grammar in cognition, particularly ones
which fit with the topics of the two days of HOWL 4, from any of the
perspectives of cognitive science. Anonymous abstracts may not exceed two pages
in length (not including data, figures and references). All abstracts must be
submitted electronically to howl@cogsci.jhu.edu. Please use 'Abstract' as the
Subject header and include, below the abstract, the following information, which
should constitute the body of the message:
1. Name(s) of author(s)
2. Affiliation(s)
3. E-mail address(es)
4. Postal address(es)
5. Title.

The anonymous abstract may then be included either in the body of the message in
ASCII format, or else as a PDF attachment. Presenters will be
notified of acceptance of their abstract around September 21, 2007.

Meeting Description:

What counts as learning? In the current public discourse of ever-narrowing
definitions of learning, achievement, and educational value, ethnographic
research offers powerful evidence that not everything that matters is being
counted. Ethnographers of education around the world continue to reveal the
importance and complexity of social, cultural, and linguistic life in schools,
of processes of learning, and of the intricate relationships upon which it
depends. How can we make accounts of this complexity heard within a popular
discourse and public policy that seem ever more committed to simplifying
definitions and solutions? With all that we know and continue to discover
through ethnography in education, how do we go public? How do we engage with the
media, with popular discourse, and with public policy on burning social and
educational issues in ways that will influence what counts as learning and what
counts as research?	

The Ethnography in Education Research Forum invites papers that explore and
expand upon what counts as learning and achievement, what counts as research and
gets counted as research, and what methods of data analysis and representation
can be used to communicate findings about the complex and processual nature of
learning and education to audiences outside, as well as inside, the academy.
