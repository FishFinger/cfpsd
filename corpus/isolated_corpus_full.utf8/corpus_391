Swarmanoid project:
Postdoctoral research position available

Start date: October 1st, 2006, or later.
Position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.


The Swarmanoid project is a Future and Emerging Technologies (FET-OPEN) 
project funded by the European Commission. The main scientific objective 
of this research project is the design, implementation and control of a 
novel distributed robotic system. The system will be made up of 
heterogeneous, dynamically connected, small autonomous robots. 
Collectively, these robots will form what we call a swarmanoid. The 
swarmanoid that we intend to build will be comprised of numerous (about 
60) autonomous robots of three types: eye-bots, handbots, and foot-bots.

The Swarmanoid project is the successor project to the SWARM-BOTS 
project, and will build on the results obtained during the SWARM-BOTS 
project. Information on the SWARM-BOTS project can be found at the 
following address: <http://www.swarm-bots.org>www.swarm-bots.org.

IRIDIA, the Artificial Intelligence laboratory of the Université Libre 
de Bruxelles and co-ordinator of the Swarmanoid project, has a vacancy 
for a postdoctoral research position. The successful applicant can start 
any time from October 1st 2006 onwards. The vacancy will remain open 
until a suitable candidate is found. There is, therefore, no submission 
deadline.

The area of competence and/or interest of the person we are looking for 
should be in at least one of the following disciplines: Computational 
Intelligence, Autonomous Robotics, Self-organizing Systems. He or she 
should be an experienced researcher with publications in the 
above-mentioned fields. The working language of the laboratory is 
English, though French, German and Italian are spoken by most of its 
members. The right person will have a commitment to research and 
publication, and possess good communication and presentation skills (in 
English). He or she will be available for traveling between European 
labs participating in the research project. The ability to work as part 
of an international team producing pre-defined deliverables to fixed 
deadlines is essential.

The project is coordinated by Professor Marco Dorigo, director of the 
IRIDIA lab. Other participants include Prof. Mondada and Prof. Floreano 
(both at EPFL, Lausanne), Prof. Gambardella (IDSIA, Universit'a della 
Svizzera Italiana, Lugano), and Prof. Nolfi (CNR, Rome, Italy).

IRIDIA is dedicated to equal opportunities. Indeed, we explicitly 
encourage female researchers to apply for this position. We guarantee 
that the selection process will be based solely on scientific merit.

If you wish to apply, please send an email containing (preferably as a 
PDF attachment) your CV and a research interests statement to:

Dr. Elio Tuci, Ph.D.
Email: <mailto:swarmanoid@iridia.ulb.ac.be>swarmanoid@iridia.ulb.ac.be
