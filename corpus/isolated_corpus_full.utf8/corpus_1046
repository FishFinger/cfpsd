                  WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

           ACL2007 - A Broader Perspective on Multiword Expressions

	Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon =
(SIGLEX)


Date:      June, 28 (AM), 2007
Location:  Prague, Czech Republic

Workshop web page: http://www.let.uu.nl/~Nicole.Gregoire/personal/=20

########################################################################=20=

###########

In recent years, the NLP community has increasingly become aware of =20
the problems that multiword expressions (MWEs) pose. A considerable =20
amount of research has been conducted in this area, some within large =20=

research projects dedicated to MWEs. Although progress has been made =20
especially in the area of multiword extraction, a number of =20
fundamental questions remain unanswered.

Following up workshops on various aspects of MWEs at previous ACL =20
conferences, we want to address these questions in this year's MWE =20
workshop:

- Is it sufficient to use purely statistical methods for the =20
extraction of MWEs from corpora, or is it necessary to harness human =20
knowledge and linguistic insights?
- Is fully automatic MWE extraction feasible, or will manual =20
validation always be required?
- What is the nature of MWEs, and how can they be defined formally?
- To what extent can definitions and extraction procedures be =20
generalised to other languages, other text types and other types of =20
MWEs?
- Can and should we distinguish subtypes of MWEs for NLP applications?

In addition to these fundamental issues, we want to address the =20
practical question of what is needed for a successful treatment of =20
MWEs in NLP:

- What properties should be specified for MWEs or subtypes of MWEs in =20=

the lexicon?
- Can we detect these properties automatically with sufficient accuracy?
- How can existing grammars be adapted in order to deal better with =20
MWEs?
- What role do the semantics of MWEs play in NLP applications and can =20=

they be determined automatically from large corpora?

We therefore solicit papers describing linguistically motivated =20
approaches to MWEs, comparative studies across languages or different =20=

subtypes of MWEs, and the treatment of MWEs in NLP applications. This =20=

includes (but is not limited to) research on:

- Linguistic, Empirical and Cognitive Properties of MWEs: research =20
into the definitions and characteristic properties of MWEs and the =20
impact that such information has on NLP applications.

- Classes of MWEs: investigating classes (or subtypes) of MWEs and =20
the extent to which computational techniques transfer to different =20
classes and different languages.

- Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs: combining the =20
computational treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic =20
and/or psycholinguistic analysis.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings =20
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' =20=

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other =20
references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal =20=

the author's identity should be avoided. For example, instead of "We =20
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", write "Smith previously showed =20
(Smith, 1991) ...".

Submission will be electronic, using the workshop's START paper =20
submission webpage (http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS6/=20
submit.html). The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe =20
PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 7pm US
Eastern time March 26, 2007 (23:59 GMT March 26, 2007). Papers =20
submitted after that time will not be reviewed.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

This is a half-day workshop. The accepted papers will be presented as =20=

20-minute talks followed by a 10-minute discussion.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline: March 26, 2007
Notification of acceptance: April 30, 2007
Camera ready papers due: May 9, 2007
Workshop date: June 28 (AM), 2007
