ACL 2008 Student Research Workshop

June 15-20, 2008, Columbus Ohio

=20

Call for Papers

------------------------------------------------------

=20

1. General Invitation for Submissions

=20

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL =
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers =
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language =
Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants will =
have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience as well =
as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers who will =
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

=20

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to the =
workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask for =
suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by an =
international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop will =
be on work in progress. The research being presented can come from any =
topic area within computational linguistics including, but not limited =
to, the following topic areas:

=20

    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon

    * phonetics, phonology and morphology

    * linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language

    * information retrieval, information extraction, question answering

    * summarization and paraphrasing

    * speech recognition, speech synthesis

    * corpus-based language modeling

    * multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids

    * spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems

    * multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems

    * message and narrative understanding systems

=20

2. Submission Requirements

=20

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished research. =
The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who have =
settled on their thesis direction but still have significant research =
left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their papers.

=20

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange =
ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for further =
development of the work, papers should clearly indicate directions for =
future research wherever appropriate. All authors of multi-author papers =
MUST be students. Papers submitted for this workshop are eligible only =
if they have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly =
available published proceedings. Students who have already presented at =
an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop may not submit to this =
workshop. They should submit their papers to the main conference =
instead. It must be indicated if a paper has been submitted to another =
conference or workshop.

=20

3. Submission Procedure

=20

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and =
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly =
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files =
tailored for this year's conference. These files will be available soon =
from the student workshop pages of the conference site. A description of =
the format will also be available in case you are unable to use these =
style files directly. All the submissions must be electronic. Please use =
the submission page to submit your paper.

=20

4. Reviewing Procedure

=20

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by =
the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of =
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student =
and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be =
based on the results of the review. Note that reviewing of papers will =
be double-blind; therefore, please make sure your paper shows the title, =
but no author information. You should likewise not have any self =
identifying references anywhere in the paper submitted for review. For =
example, rather than this: "We showed previously (Smith, 2001), ...", =
use citations such as: "Smith (2001) previously showed ...".

=20

5. Schedule

=20

The papers must be submitted no later than midnight, January 10th, 2008 =
. No papers received after January 10th, 2008 will be accepted. =
Acknowledgment will be emailed soon after receipt. Notification of =
acceptance will be sent to authors (by email) on February 28th, 2008. =
Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final =
camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance =
notice.
