IGCL
First International Conference on Global Interoperability for Language =
Resources

City University of Hong Kong
Hong Kong
9-11 January 2008
 <http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/> http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, =
knowledge bases and
ontologies, grammars, etc. support the development of language =
processing applications
that are increasingly important to the global society. Substantial =
effort has been devoted
to the creation of such resources for the world's major languages over =
the past decades,
and new projects are developing similar resources for less widely-used =
languages. Some
standards and best practices have emerged for representing and linking =
language corpora
and annotations, efforts such as "Global WordNet" and the development of =
framenets in
multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical and semantic =
resources across
languages, and there are efforts to integrate such resources into =
general ontologies such
as SUMO. As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, =
it is increasingly
important to develop resources in the world's languages that can be =
compared and linked,
used and analyzed with common software, and that contain linguistic =
information for the
same or comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a =
"global web" of
language resources, wherein, for example, linguistically-annotated =
corpora in multiple
languages are inter-linked via the use of common categories, or =
categories that are mapped
to one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked not =
only to versions
in different languages, but also to each other; and common =
representations enable analysis
and use of resources in different languages and of different types =
within available
systems.

The First International Conference on Global Interoperability for =
Language Resources
(IGCL) will bring together designers, developers, and users of corpora =
and other language
resources from across the globe, in order to:

=95 assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for resource =
representation,
annotation, interlinkage, and access;
=95 consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) multi-lingual and =
multi-modal
interoperability and standardization;
=95 consider the requirements for achieving interoperability among =
multi-lingual resources
of different types, including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases, =
ontologies, etc., as
well as the systems and frameworks that enable their creation and =
exploitation;
=95 consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be used to =
enable resource
interoperability and inter-linkage;
=95 work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and standards =
for language
resource representation, annotation, and use that will enable =
interoperability;
=95 consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in order =
to better enable
cross-lingual studies;
=95 provide direction for developers of resources for less widely used =
languages;
=95 promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of language =
resources across the
globe;
=95 consider ways to provide central or distributed access to language =
resources developed
throughout the world.


Topics

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following =
topics:

=95 multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus on =
the mechanisms
enabling interoperability;
=95 support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in =
systems/frameworks for resource
creation, annotation,  use, and access;
=95 existing and proposed standards and best practice guidelines for =
language resources,
including standards for linguistic annotations at any and all =
linguistics levels;
=95 systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the development =
and exploitation of
interoperable language resources;
=95 evaluation of existing resources, systems and frameworks, and/or =
standards in terms of
support for interoperability;
=95 harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language resources, =
including corpora,
wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;
=95 web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-linkage, =
and access;
=95 interoperability of ontologies for language processing research;
=95 support for multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and multi-modality.

In addition to full-length paper presentations, the Programme Committee =
invites proposals
for posters addressing any of the above topics. Posters describing =
existing or developing
resources or tools that provide an assessment of needs and/or =
considerations for
interoperability are especially encouraged.


Proceedings

Accepted papers will be included in conference proceedings. A selection =
of outstanding
conference presentations will be published in a special issue of the =
journal Language
Resources and Evaluation.


Submissions

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in length, including =
bibliography and any
appendices. Author instructions are provided on the conference web site
(http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/2008/html/paper.jsp
<http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/submissions.html> ).

Submissions will be handled electronically by the START system. To =
upload your paper,
