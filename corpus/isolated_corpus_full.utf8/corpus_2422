Meeting Description
ELRA Workshop on Evaluation
Looking into the Future of Evaluation: when automatic metrics meet task-based
and performance-based approaches
 
To be held in conjunction with the 6th International Language Resources and
Evaluation Conference (LREC 2008)
27 May 2008, Palais des Congrès Mansour Eddahbi, Marrakech 

Background
Automatic methods to evaluate system performance play an important role in the
development of a language technology system. They speed up research and
development by allowing fast feedback, and the idea is also to make results
comparable while aiming to match human evaluation in terms of output evaluation.
However, after several years of study and exploitation of such metrics we still
face problems like the following ones:

- they only evaluate part of what should be evaluated
- they produce measurements that are hard to understand/explain, and/or hard to
relate to the concept of quality
- they fail to match human evaluation
- they require resources that are expensive to create
etc. 

Therefore, an effort to integrate knowledge from a multitude of evaluation
activities and methodologies should help us solve some of these immediate
problems and avoid creating new metrics that reproduce such problems.

Looking at MT as a sample case, problems to be immediately pointed out are
twofold: reference translations and distance measurement. The former are
difficult and expensive to produce, they do not cover the usually wide spectrum
of translation possibilities and what is even more discouraging, worse results
are obtained when reference translations are of higher quality (more spontaneous
and natural, and thus, sometimes more lexically and syntactically distant from
the source text). Regarding the latter, the measurement of the distance between
the source text and the output text is carried out by means of automatic metrics
that do not match human intuition as well as claimed. Furthermore, different
metrics perform differently, which has already led researchers to study
metric/approach combinations which integrate automatic methods into a deeper
linguistically oriented evaluation. Hopefully, this should help soften the
unfair treatment received by some rule-based systems, clearly punished by
certain system-approach sensitive metrics.

On the other hand, there is the key issue of ''what needs to be measured'', so
as to draw the conclusion that ''something is of good quality'', or probably
rather ''something is useful for a particular purpose''. In this regard, works
like those done within the FEMTI framework have shown that aspects such as
usability, reliability, efficiency, portability, etc. should also be considered.
However, the measuring of such quality characteristics cannot always be
automated, and there may be many other aspects that could be usefully measured.

This workshop follows the evolution of a series of workshops where
methodological problems, not only for MT but for evaluation in general, have
been approached. Along the lines of these discussions and aiming to go one step
further, the current workshop, while taking into account the advantages of
automatic methods and the shortcomings of current methods, should focus on
task-based and performance-based approaches for evaluation of natural language
applications, with key questions such as:

- How can it be determined how useful a given system is for a given task?
- How can focusing on such issues and combining these approaches with our
already acquired experience on automatic evaluation help us develop new metrics
and methodologies which do not feature the shortcomings of current automatic
metrics?
- Should we work on hybrid methodologies of automatic and human evaluation for
certain technologies and not for others?
- Can we already envisage the integration of these approaches?
- Can we already plan for some immediate collaborations/experiments?
- What would it mean for the FEMTI framework to be extended to other HLT
applications, such as summarization, IE, or QA? Which new aspects would it need
to cover?

We solicit papers that address these questions and other related issues relevant
to the workshop.

Workshop Programme and Audience Addressed

This full-day workshop is intended for researchers and developers on different
evaluation technologies, with experience on the various issues concerned in the
call, and interested in defining a methodology to move forward.

The workshop feature invited talks, submitted papers, and will conclude with a
discussion on future developments and collaboration.

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description

The Research Group on Linguistic Issues Involving the Latin American Dispora is
a 'Proyecto de Investigación' meeting with the XV International Conference of
the Latin American Association of Linguistics and Philology (ALFAL) in
Montevideo, Uruguay from August 18 to 21. 

Second Call for Papers

Abstracts of between 200 and 250 words are invited for 20 minute presentations
on linguistic research in sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, or applied
linguistics (or combination) involving the Latin American Diaspora, defined as
peoples of Latin American heritage living outside their country of origin (e.g.,
in North America, Europe, or other Latin American countries). Such communities
are of interest because of the situations of dialect and language contact they
entail and the social, educational, and linguistic issues involved in their
adaptation to new matrix societies.

The abstract must be written in Spanish or Portuguese, the official languages of
the conference. Presentations at the conference must also be delivered in
Spanish or Portuguese. There is also the possibility of publishing a paper in
either of these languages in the conference proceedings.

To submit your abstract: send an e-mail to diasporalatina@nyc.rr.com with your
name, affiliation, and the abstract in the body of the e-mail and as an attachment.

Please see the conference website for more information: http://www.mundoalfal.org
