*** Intelligent User Interfaces - IUI08 ***
A new Generation of User Interfaces
Maspalomas - Gran Canaria - Spain
13-16 January 2008


*** Call for Workshop ***

Workshops provide members of a community a forum to discuss common 
interests in a focused way. If you are working in an emerging area in 
Intelligent User Interfaces, consider organizing a workshop. They are a 
chance to meet mind-alike researchers and discover what others are 
doing. A workshop offers a good opportunity for young researchers to 
present their work and to obtain feedback from an interested community. 
Successful workshops may result in edited books or special issues in 
international journals.

IUI 2008 is looking for exciting proposals for half-day or oneday 
workshops to be held on January 13, 2008, the first day of the 
conference. Each workshop should generate discussions that give the IUI 
community a new, organized way of thinking about the topic, or ideas 
that suggest promising directions for future research. A successful 
workshop can move the field forward and help in building community. 
Researchers and practitioners in the intelligent user interfaces 
community at large are invited to submit proposals for review.


Submission

Each proposal of no more than 1000 words should contain the following 
information:

   1. A cover page including:
          * Workshop title
          * Name, affiliation, postal address, and e-mail address for
            each organizer
          * Identification of the primary contact person(s)
          * One-paragraph biography for each workshop organizer
   2. Background and Motivation: What is the overall topic of the
      workshop? Why is this topic of particular interest at this time?
      If the workshop has been organized in the past at an IUI or other
      conference, please give details (audience, URL) and describe why
      it should be held again and how improvements will be made.
   3. Objectives: What are the objectives that the workshop aims to
      achieve? Objectives may include (a) targeting a predefined set of
      focus questions, (b) presenting alternate views on a particular
      issue that is of concern to the IUI community and attempting to
      resolve the issue, (c) identifying priorities for new directions
      of research, and/or (d) initiating the appropriate collaborations.
   4. Format: Give a description of the proposed workshop format,
      including the planned activities (such as position statements,
      invited talks, panels, demos, and general discussion), as well as
      how these activities address the workshop objectives. Preference
      will be given to proposals for activities designed to fuel
      discussion and interaction among participants; workshops
      consisting solely of paper presentations are discouraged. Provide
      a preliminary schedule with estimated times. Design your schedule
      for a length of 3 hours (half-day workshop) or 6 hours (full-day
      workshop) with a lunch break and one or two coffee breaks,
      respectively.
   5. Potential Participants: Indicate how you plan to select
      participants and contributions to the workshop. State your
      estimate of the number of participants. If possible, give a list
      of tentatively confirmed participants.
   6. Workshop attraction: Indicate how you plan to attract submissions
      and/or participants. If you have a plan to edit a book or a
      journal special issue as a result of your workshop, please
      indicate it.
   7. Organization: Give short descriptions of each of the organizers'
      qualifications related to the workshop topics. Indicate if you are
      planning to have a program committee to help with the
      organization/review process, and give names and contact
      information of PC members, if available.

Proposal should be submitted via email in PDF format. Details for 
submissions are given below.
