Call for Papers
Seventh Portsmouth Translation Conference
'Translation As Negotiation'
Saturday 10 November 2007

As translators and interpreters we engage in a range of negotiatory activities.
We negotiate the frontiers and interfaces between languages and cultures; we
negotiate translation issues and problems; we negotiate rates, deadlines and
briefs with clients. We also engage with the range of expectations and demands
made of translators in our diverse cultures and working environments.

The organisers of the seventh Portsmouth Translation Conference invite
contributions from translation and interpreting professionals, scholars and
students on any topic relating to this year's theme. 

We welcome a broad range of approaches to translation, including presentations
with an empirical, critical, analytic, pedagogical, technological or
professional focus. Enquiries and abstracts to carol.osullivan@port.ac.uk.
Abstract deadline: 30 June 2007.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
