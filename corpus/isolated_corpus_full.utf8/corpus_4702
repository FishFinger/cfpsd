Call For Participation

Compact Spring Course on Rule-based Programming

http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/pm/mitarbeiter/fruehwirth/constraint-rul=
e-programming-course.html

Venice, May 18-22, 2009 at Universita' Ca' Foscari Venezia
Prof. Dr. Thom Fr=C3=BChwirth, University of Ulm, Germany

This compact one week course in English provides an overview of
rule-based programming and formalisms in computer science. We will embed
these rule-based systems into the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR)
language. This gives us the possibility to compare and analyse the
different approaches and to get to know the advanced concurrent
constraint-based CHR formalism.

Constraint Handling Rules
  Syntax and Semantics
  Properties and Analysis
Classical Rule-Based Systems
  Production Rule Systems
  Event-Condition-Action Rules
Rewriting and Graph Formalisms
  Term Rewriting Systems and Graph Transformation Systems
  Chemical Abstract Machine and Multiset Transformation
  Petri Nets
Constraint and Logic Programming
  Deductive Databases and Logical Algorithms
  Prolog and Constraint Logic Programming
  Concurrent Constraint Programming

The course is based on the upcoming book "Constraint Handling Rules" by
Thom Fr=C3=BChwirth, Cambridge University Press, 2009.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE - APPLY NOW

The course is offered free of charge. Please email your application with
your academic details to
    Frank.Raiser at uni-ulm.de
Application deadline is April 2, 2009.

lectures from Monday to Friday. Grading is possible on request. The
