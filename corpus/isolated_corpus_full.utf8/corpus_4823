Meeting Description:

The renewed attention devoted to lexical blends (also sometimes called
portmanteau words after Lewis Carroll) in the last fifteen years has resulted in
a scattered body of work spanning several linguistic fields and research
traditions. 

The aim of this international conference is to bring together linguists working
on blending in various languages and different frameworks in order to encourage
debate and cross-fertilization of ideas. Papers on the description of lexical
blending in understudied languages, on the place of blending in morphological
theory, and comparative work on two or more languages will be particularly welcome.
