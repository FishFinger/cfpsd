ESSLLI Workshop on Coherence in Generation and Dialogue 

Date: 07-Aug-2006 - 11-Aug-2006 
Location: Malaga, Spain 
Contact: Paul Piwek 
Contact Email: mcs_coherence_workshop@open.ac.uk 
Meeting URL: http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rk/esslli2006.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis 

Meeting Description: 

This workshop aims to compare and contrast different ways of
  modelling coherence in natural language generation and dialogue
  in order to guide decisions such as:

  - what is an appropriate response at a given point in a dialogue?
  - what is the optimal ordering of propositions in a discourse?
  - how should predicates, referring expressions and rhetorical 
    relations be realised (verbally and/or non-verbally) so that the
    resulting utterance can be interpreted naturally and fluently?

  The intention is to provide a forum for advanced PhD students
  and researchers to present and discuss their work with
  colleagues and researchers who work in the broad subject
  areas represented at ESSLLI.
