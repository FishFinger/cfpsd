			First Call for Papers
=09
	RANLP-07 Workshop: Computer-Aided Language Processing (CALP'07)


			Borovetz, Bulgaria
			September 30, 2007

   Workshop site:  http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/events/CALP07/
   RANLP'2007 site:  http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/



AIMS:

The past years have seen a variety of promising NLP projects but in =20
the vast majority of real-world applications, fully automatic NLP is =20
still far from delivering reliable results. As a result, computer-=20
aided methods have emerged as a practical alternative. In the =20
computer-aided scenario, processing is not done entirely by =20
computers, human intervention improves, post-edits or validates the =20
output of the computer program.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on =20
CALP projects and to provide a forum for fruitful discussion on =20
related issues and further developments in the field. Topics of =20
interests include areas where computers can be used to help but not =20
to fully automate the process such as (but not limited to) machine =20
translation, production of summaries, generation of documents, =20
extraction of terminology, creation of indexes, ontology creation and =20=

annotation of texts using semi-automatic methods.

The workshop also encourages discussions and submissions focusing on =20
evaluation issues addressing the efficiency of the CALP methods. Of =20
particular interest will be studies which compare the saving of time =20
and cost of CALP methods as opposed to manual methods.

TOPICS

Prospective authors are invited to submit proposals in the following =20
areas of interest, related to computer-aided language processing:

*	computer-aided language processing for NLP tasks including but =
not =20
limited to computer-aided summarisation, indexing, translation, =20
generation, etc.
*	semi-automatic annotation methods: post-processing vs. =
interactive =20
annotation
*	semi-automatic ontology development
*	interactive machine learning methods such as active learning
*	evaluation issues addressing the efficiency of CALP methods
*	translation memories and other translation aides
*	interactive machine translation
*	pre/post-editing of machine translation
*	intelligent tools for language learning such as dictionaries and =
=20
concordancers
*	computer-aided assessment tools
*	authorship attribution and plagiarism detection


INVITED SPEAKER

Ruslan Mitkov, University of Wolverhampton, UK


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

* Format: Authors are invited to submit two types of papers: full =20
papers which describe original and unpublished work in the topic area =20=

of this workshop, and short papers which describe full working =20
systems, and which, if accepted, will be presented at a special =20
session accompanied by live demo. Papers should be submitted as a PDF =20=

file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 stylefiles and not should =20=

not exceed 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages for short papers. The =20
RANLP 2007 stylefiles are available at:

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm.

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the =20
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that =20
reveal the authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not =20
conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

* Submission procedure: Submission of papers will be handled using =20
the START system. Specific submission guidelines will be posted on =20
the workshop site shortly.

* Reviewing: Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members =20=

of the Program Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed =20=

comments, and to score submitted papers on the following factors:
       - Relevance to the workshop
       - Significance and originality
       - Technical/methodological accuracy
       - References to related work
       - Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

* Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the =20
workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the =20
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at =20=

least one of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop =20
participants are expected to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration =20=

fee.
