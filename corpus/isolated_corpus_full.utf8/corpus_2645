Meeting Description:

Fourth International Conference on Multimodality (4-ICOM), Singapore 

First Call for Papers: Fourth International Conference on Multimodality (4-ICOM), Singapore
 
''From Print to Interactive Digital Media: Technology, Multimodal Representation and Knowledge'' 
 
Website: http://multimodal-analysis-lab.org/conf/
Email: 4icom@nus.edu.sg

We are pleased to announce the First Call for Papers for the Fourth International Conference on Multimodality (4-ICOM) taking place in Singapore on 30 July - 1 Aug 2008. The conference theme is ''From Print to Interactive Digital Media: Technology, Multimodal Representation and Knowledge''. 
 
4-ICOM brings together leading international scholars from a range of disciplines (e.g. linguistics, social semiotics, communications & new media, digital media art, history, mathematics, science, computer science and education) to explore the ways in which technology enables and constrains the ways knowledge, social relations and culture are constructed and enacted, with a special focus on interactive digital media. The aim is to explore the functions of language, visual imagery, three dimensional objects, space, sound, music and so forth, and to develop new approaches to understanding how these resources integrate in the world of new interactive digital media. Questions which arise include the following. What is the relationship between technology, multimodal representation and knowledge? How is interactive digital media changing our view of the world and each other? What are the implications for teaching and research in the humanities and social sciences? What directions !
 have research & development in digital technology taken, and for what reasons?
 
We encourage papers which address the conference themes from different theoretical perspectives. Papers which address general issues in semiotics, multimodality and multimodal analysis are also welcome.
 
4-ICOM is run in conjunction with the International Symposium on Electronic Arts  (ISEA2008) (http://isea2008.org/). 4-ICOM participants will have access to ISEA2008 exhibitions and galleries at no charge from 25 July to 3 August 2008.
