The 5th Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium
----------------------------------------------------
http://www.cse.msu.edu/mclc


The fifth meeting of the Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium =

(MCLC) is hosted by the Departments of Computer Science and Linguistics =

at Michigan State University. This colloquium offers a less formal forum =

for computational linguistics researchers to get together and present =

ideas and recent research results. It is intended to be primarily for =

researchers from the Midwest region, but applications from all regions =

are welcome. All topics within computational linguistics are =

appropriate, including theoretical as well as applied work of any sort.


      Invited Speakers

    * Steve Abney <http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Eabney/>, University
      of Michigan
    * John Goldsmith
      <http://hum.uchicago.edu/%7Ejagoldsm/Webpage/index.html>,

      MCLC website (http://www.cse.msu.edu/mclc) no later than

      Review

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. Abstracts are =

evaluated on the basis the originality, soundness, and clarity of the =

research idea presented. The reviewers will also assess abstracts' =

relevance to computational linguistics, broadly construed.


      Publication

Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited (but not required) to =

submit a 4-8 page full paper using the ACL style files for the =

proceedings, which will be distributed in a CD. Copyright of a submitted =
