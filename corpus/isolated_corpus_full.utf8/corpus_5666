Meeting Description:

The Center for Research in Syntax, Semantics and Phonology (CRISSP, www.cri=
ssp.be) in Brussels is pleased to announce the Fourth Brussels Conference o=
n Generative Linguistics (BCGL4) on ellipsis. It will be held in Brussels f=
rom November 9 till November 10, 2009.

The following invited speakers have accepted to give a talk at BCGL4:

Daniel Hardt (Copenhagen Business School)
Jason Merchant (University of Chicago)=20

Call for Papers:

Theme Description:

Ellipsis has been an important research topic in generative linguistics at =
least since Ross (1967, 1969), but with the advent of the Minimalist Progra=
m (Chomsky 1995), the interest in this topic has risen considerably. Becaus=
e it is a fortiori an interface phenomenon, understanding ellipsis requires=
 an understanding of the interaction between narrow syntax, PF, LF and the =
information-structural component. In other words, ellipsis is a useful tool=
 for gaining a better understanding of how the grammar of natural language =
works. Very simply put, ellipsis is the occurrence of meaning without sound=
. A first important question to ask is how much syntax is involved in deriv=
ing this meaning. Roughly speaking, there are three types of proposals deal=
ing with this issue. A first one takes the ellipsis site to be a fully-fled=
ged syntactic structure that is deleted (or not pronounced) at PF (i.e. PF-=
deletion; cf. Ross 1969; Sag 1980; Hankamer & Sag 1976, Sag & Hankamer 1984=
; Tomioka 1999, 2001; Merchant 2001; Johnson 1996, 2001; Lasnik 1999a, 1999=
b, 2001).=20

According to a type of second analysis the ellipsis site does not contain a=
ny internal structure, but is a null pronoun (or proform). The meaning is d=
erived from the antecedent, either parallel to how overt pronouns are inter=
preted (Wasow 1972; Shopen 1972; Hardt 1993, 1999; Lobeck 1995; Depiante 20=
00) or by copying the antecedent into the ellipsis site at LF (i.e. LF copy=
; cf. Fiengo & May 1994; Chung et al. 1995; Wilder 1997; Beavers & Sag 2004=
; Fortin 2007). A third account assumes there is nothing at all in the posi=
tion of the missing material (Ginzburg & Sag 2000; Culicover & Jackendoff 2=
005).=20

Recently, the debate on the presence or absence of internal structure has b=
een extended to overt pronouns. Elbourne (2008) proposes that overt pronoun=
s are definite descriptions underlyingly, such that when a noun undergoes N=
P-ellipsis, its determiner is spelled out as a pronoun (cf. Postal 1969). T=
his approach turns the reasoning of the null proform analysis of ellipsis o=
n its head: instead of treating the ellipsis site as a (null) pronoun, it t=
reats (overt) pronouns as ellipsis sites (cf. also Baltin & Van Craenenbroe=
ck 2008). A second central question in the study of ellipsis involves the r=
elation between the ellipsis site and its antecedent. Merchant (2001), foll=
owing Rooth (1992) and Schwarzschild (1999), proposes that an ellipsis site=
 has to be e-GIVEN: the (non-focus-marked part of the) antecedent must enta=
il the (non-focus-marked part of the) ellipsis site and vice versa in order=
 for ellipsis to be recoverable. However, recent works claim that a purely =
semantic recoverability condition is not sufficient and that ellipsis requi=
res syntactic isomorphism between antecedent and ellipsis site, cf. Lasnik =
(1995); Johnson (2001); Merchant (2007, 2008) (see also Fiengo & May 1994; =
Pullum 2000; Fox 1999, 2000; Sauerland 2004; Hardt  2004, 2005 and van Crae=
nenbroeck 2009 for discussion).

Apart from the conditions on the antecedent (i.e. the recoverability requir=
ement), ellipsis is subject to a syntactic licensing condition: even when t=
he ellipsis site is recoverable from the context, it can only occur in a sp=
ecific set of syntactic environments. Lobeck (1995), for instance, argues t=
hat VP ellipsis requires strong agreement on the inflectional head and clai=
ms that English, but not German or French, exhibits this kind of agreement.=
 Merchant (2001) on the other hand, captures the fact that ellipsis require=
s a licensing head by positing an ellipsis feature on certain heads, allowi=
ng them to leave their complement unpronounced. A similar analysis is propo=
sed in Aelbrecht (2009), who argues that ellipsis is licensed by an Agree r=
elation between an ellipsis feature and the ellipsis licensing head.

For the Fourth Brussels Conference on Generative Linguistics, we welcome pa=
pers on any topic related to the theme of the conference.
