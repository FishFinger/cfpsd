   o June 13, 2008:   Author notification
   o June 20, 2008:   Submission of Camera-ready papers (hard deadline)
   o August 24, 2008: Workshop at ACM SIGKDD, Las Vegas, USA
 
   ======================================================================

   Yahoo! Best Paper Award for Web Mining: 
   Through a peer-review process that includes the workshop organizing
   and program committees, a best paper will be selected based technical
   quality, innovativeness, and contribution to the field. The authors of
   the best paper will receive a $500 USD prize supported by Yahoo! Research.

   ======================================================================


   The Web presents a key driving force for a large spectrum of
   applications in which a user interacts with a company, a governmental
   authority, a non-governmental organization or other non-profit
   institution or other users. User preferences and expectations,
   together with usage patterns, form the basis for personalized,
   user-friendly and optimal services. Key metrics enabled by proper data
   capture and processing are essential to run an effective business or
   service. Enabling technologies include data mining, scalable
   warehousing and preprocessing, sequence discovery, real time
   processing, document classification, user modeling and quality
   evaluation models for them. Recipient technologies that demand for
   user profiling and usage patterns include recommendation systems, Web
   analytics applications, application servers coupled with content
   management systems and fraud detectors.  

   Research advances associated with knowledge discovery on the Web
   observe the Web as a social medium for exchange and cooperation, as a
   semantic network where people find information and contribute
   information (by means of documents, annotations and comments) and as a
   place for doing business, launching business and promoting business.  

   WEBKDD 2008 will bring together researchers and practitioners on
   these aspects of the Web. The emphasis is on lessons learned, recent
   advances and open issues for the next decade.  

   WEBKDD 2008 will be the 10th anniversary workshop on knowledge
   discovery on the Web, taking place at the KDD since 1999. WebKDD
   presentations have historically been of high quality and influence,
   and workshops have in the past attracted not only audience from
   academia, but also a significant audience from industry and government
   agencies. Altogether, the papers at the past WEBKDD workshops have
   accumulated about 940 citations, including 7 patent citations that
   cite the workshop as the premier reference on the topic of Web usage
   analysis. (The citations are from Google Scholar, accessed between
   Feb. 10 and Feb. 12, 2008.) 

   In WEBKDD 2008, we anticipate a wrap-up and lessons-learned from 10
   years of research on mining the Web, the Semantic Web(s) and the
   social Web and a research agenda for the years to come.  


   Workshop Topics    
   ===============    

   The WEBKDD 2008 workshop will invite contributions on mining of all
   aspects of users' activities in the Web, in particular: 

   - Mining server log (clickstream) data  
   - Web analytics
   - Web content and structure mining
   - Modeling users and their interaction with the Web
   - Mining query log data and web search result mining
   - Mining users' activities in social venues, ranging from chat fora
     with emphasis on interaction, to recommendation networks with emphasis
     on spread of influence  
   - Mining users' activities in venues that foster the capturing of data
     semantics, e.g. for  building the Semantic Web or for the building of
     folksonomies  
   - web community mining and social network analysis
   - Enabling technologies for Web mining, including technologies for Web
     warehousing, data preparation, management of multi-relational data and
     streams, visualization, and evaluation
   - Application areas, including recommendation engines, Web
     communities, Web marketplaces, Web search, Web security and misuse and
     abuse of the Web and its services. 


   Paper Submission
   ================
   All submissions must be made electronically following the submission
   information on the Workshop Web site:
   http://webmining.spd.louisville.edu/webkdd08/

   Please use the prescribed formatting guidelines of Springer LNCS
   which can be found at: 
   http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0

   Papers should be no longer than 12 pages (or 5,000 words) inclusive of
   all references and figures. All papers must be submitted in either PDF
   (preferred) or postscript. Please ensure that any special fonts used
   are included in the submitted documents. All papers must be original,
   and have not been published elsewhere. Exceptionally, paper submitted
   to KDD 2008 can also be submitted to WebKDD2008 but must be withdrawn
   if accepted at KDD 2008.

   The workshop proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
   Note Series (LNCS) with the title "Advances in Web Mining and Web Usage
   Analysis" (under negotiation). It will be distributed during the workshop. 

   Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended
   version of their papers to the Journal Data Mining and Knowledge
   Discovery for a special issue that serve as a wrap up of the most
   recent developments in Web Mining (under negotiation).
