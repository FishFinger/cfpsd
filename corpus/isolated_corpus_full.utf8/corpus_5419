Call for papers
RANLP-2009 Workshop on Natural Language Processing methods and corpora =

in translation, lexicography, and language learning

We are pleased to announce the workshop on Natural Language Processing =

methods and corpora in translation studies, lexicography, and language =

learning, to be held in conjunction with the main RANLP-09 conference in =

Borovets, Bulgaria, on 17-18 September 2009.

Extended deadline: 21 June 2009


Motivation

Corpora are now indispensable tools in research and everyday practice =

for translators, lexicographers, second language learners. Specialists =

in these areas share a general goal in using corpora in their work: =

corpora provide the possibility to find and analyse linguistic patterns =

characteristic of various kinds of language users, monitor language =

change, and reveal important similarities and divergences across =

different languages. For professional translators corpora present an =

invaluable linguistic and cultural awareness tools. For language =

learners, they serve as a means to gain insights into specifics of =

competent language use as well as to analyse typical errors of fellow =

learners. For lexicographers, corpora are key for monitoring the =

development of the vocabularies of languages, making informed decisions =

as to lexicographic relevance of the lexical material, and for general =

verification of all varieties of lexicographic data.

While simple corpus analysis tools such as concordancers have been long =

in use in these specialist areas, in the past decade there have been =

important developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) =

technologies: it has become much easier to construct corpora and =

powerful NLP methods have become available that can be used to analyse =

corpora not only on the surface level, but also on the syntactic, and =

even semantic, pragmatic, and stylistic levels.

This workshop aims to bring together the developers and the users of NLP =

technologies for the purposes of translation, translation studies, =

lexicography, terminology, and language learning in order to present =

their research and discuss new possibilities and challenges in these fields.


Topics

Submissions are invited for the following topics of interest to the =

workshop:

- NLP methodologies for processing parallel and comparable corpora
- Context-sensitive dictionary look-up
- Corpus-based study and identification of cognates and false friends
- Compilation and use of corpora in translation studies
- Corpus-based study of properties of translated text: translation =

universals, phraseology, lexical and grammatical patterns
- Corpora in translator training
- Translation of terms and collocations using corpora
- Bilingual concordancing in translation applications
- NLP methods for Computer-Aided Translation
- Compilation of specialised terminologies
- Compilation of corpora for bilingual lexicography
- Detection of gaps in bilingual dictionaries
- Corpus-based estimation of lexicographic relevance
- Term and collocation extraction
- Discovery of illustrative examples and definitions of words and word =

senses in corpora
- Reading and writing aid applications for language learners
- Automated text glossing in Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL)
- Corpus-based design of assessment materials in CALL
- Error detection and error analysis in CALL
- Detection of first-language interference in learner corpora

Important dates

Extended submission deadline: 21 June 2009
Acceptance notification: 20 July 2009
Final copies due: 24 August 2009

Submission instructions

Papers must be submitted in PDF format as e-mail attachments to Iustina =

Ilisei at iustina.ilisei@gmail.com. The e-mail should use the subject =

header =93RANLP-2009 workshop=94.

Format
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work =

in the topic area of this workshop. Papers (in PDF format conforming to =

the RANLP 2009 stylefiles) should not exceed 8 pages. The RANLP 2009 =

stylefiles are available at:

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/submissions.htm

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the authors' =

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the =

authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to =

these requirements will be rejected without review.

Reviewing
Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program =

Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed comments, and to =

score submitted papers on the following factors:
- Relevance to the workshop
- Significance and originality
- Technical/methodological accuracy
- References to related work
- Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

Accepted papers policy
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. By =

submitting a paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in case the =

paper is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors will =

attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected to pay the =

RANLP-2009 workshop registration fee.
