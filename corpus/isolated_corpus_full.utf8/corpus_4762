CIAM 2009

IJCAI-09 Workshop on Cross-Media Information Access and Mining


http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~liir/conferences/CIAM2009/


The workshop will take place July 13, 2009 as part of the Twenty-first
International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Pasadena
Conference Center, California.   This event is sponsored by The
International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI),
The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)
and The Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT).

Artificial intelligence (AI) simulates intelligent tasks performed by
humans. One primordial task is the understanding and fusion of
multiple inputs, for instance, when seeing the world around us,
listening to speech and other audio sounds, and reading texts.
Multimedia archives containing text, video, still images and audio
(speech and other sounds) are quickly gaining importance (e.g., on the
World Wide Web or privately held by broadcasting companies, publishing
houses, libraries, musea, police and intelligence services,
courtrooms, hospitals, etc.). Systems that access or mine this
multimedia content should have the intellectual capability to relate
the different information sources to each other, and to align and
integrate the content. Indeed, more often than not the different
modalities complement and disambiguate each other. Such technologies
will form the basis for multimedia and cross-media information
retrieval and mining.

This situation demands for solutions for cross-media processing and
content recognition, where some fundamental problems are emerging
topics of interest in the research community. First, content
recognition in the visual, textual or audio medium is improved by
exploiting cross-modal co-occurrences, especially when many instances
can reinforce each other. Content recognized in one medium (e.g.,
text) can serve as weak annotation for content to be learned in
another medium (e.g., the visual medium). This allows, for instance,
to train a visual object recognition system for frequent objects
without the need for manually labeled training data. Similarly, the
visual medium can assist in the processing of textual sources. For
instance, recognized visual actions might contribute to the
ontological classification of certain verbs used in language. Gestures
can complement speech as a visual reflection of the semantics of a
discourse or conversation. And there are many other examples. Content
recognition also entails content linking across media, where we deal
with problems of cross-document coreferencing (or alignment) of, for
instance, entities (e.g., persons, objects, locations), of actions
performed by entities, of events, and of temporal and spatial forms of
expression. Moreover, the initially identified alignments might
bootstrap additional cross-modal "translations".

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from
computer vision, sound processing, human language technology,
computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
reasoning, information retrieval, cognitive science and application
communities. The workshop will bring fertilizing discussions and ideas
about that will foster new interdisciplinary research avenues in
artificial intelligence. It will encourage research into intelligent
behavior and unify methodologies.

The workshop is open to all members of the AI community. The number of
participants is however limited to 40. We welcome original papers and
posters. They should show a clearly motivated interest or expertise in
cross-media recognition, retrieval and mining, and discuss
contributing and grounded ideas. We aim at obtaining a balanced
selection of papers coming from the different disciplines involved,
that clearly stress multimodal processing.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Cross-media mining and categorization
Cross-media search and question answering
Cross-media summarization
Cross-media linking of entities, attributes, objects, and actions
Cross-media emotion detection and genre classification
Alignment algorithms
Image auto-annotation
Image and video retrieval based on multi-modal cues
Recognition of semantic roles and frames in text, images and video
Recognition of narratives in text and video
Spatial and temporal recognition and resolution
Multimodal discourse analysis
Submissions in pdf format should be made online at

http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~liir/conferences/CIAM2009/index.php?topic=3Dsubm=
it

before March 18, 2009, 23:59 (midnight) UTC+1. Papers should not be
more than 6 double-column pages long. Please follow the IJCAI
formatting instructions and use the supplied Word templates or Latex
sources. Formatting guidelines can be found at the IJCAI 2009 website.
The reviewing process will be double-blind with each submission
receiving at least three reviews. Papers will be selected for oral or
poster sessions. All accepted papers (oral and poster) will be
published in the workshop proceedings. We are also arranging a journal
special issue for post-workshop publication of selected papers.
