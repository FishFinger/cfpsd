Kouvola 
November 9-10, 2007

The annual Autumn Symposium of the Finnish Association of Applied Linguistics

'Language and Globalization', which covers all sub-fields of Applied Linguistics.

Papers are sought related to the first and second language teaching and learning
as well as applied language research and questions of language politics.

Traditionally, the majority of the papers are presented in Finnish. However,
because of the need to attract more international participants, it is hoped that
there will be a number of presentations in English. Swedish is Finland's second
language so Swedish language papers are also sought.

Professor Inkeri Vehmas-Lehto, University of Helsinki 
Professor emeritus Henry Widdowson, University of Vienna 
The registration for the conference has already begun.
  
The deadline for the abstracts is September 8th, 2007.

2nd Call for Papers and Deadline Extension

Conference on Open Source in Education and Language Learning Online

Special Theme: The problem of language learning online - Is Moodle the
answer?

Friday 28th to Saturday 29th September 2007
University of Iceland
Reykjavík, Iceland

Invited Speaker:
Carole A. Chapelle
Professor of TESL and Applied Linguistics
Iowa State University

 
6th May 2007 - extended deadline for submission of abstracts


This conference is the final event in a two-year European project (Covcell),
aimed at supporting language learning and teaching in an online environment
by adding tools which support collaboration and co-operation to the
functionalities already provided by the Moodle learning management system.

As well as showcasing the collaborative tools developed by the project, the
conference seeks to address critical issues in the field of online language
learning from two perspectives: (1) the pedagogical perspective of the
effectiveness of cohort-oriented, task-based approaches to language learning and
teaching in an online environment; (2) the technical perspective of open source
development of tools which support online language learning and teaching.

We therefore welcome papers in either of these two domains:

(1) papers concerning current issues in the pedagogy of online language
learning and teaching, especially the effectiveness of approaches that allow
students to learn language while collaborating on tasks in cohort-supported
environments;

(2) papers concerning the development of open source tools which support
language learning and teaching in an online environment and especially the
suitability of such tools for use with established open-source learning
management systems such as Moodle.

Papers that address the special theme of the effectiveness of Moodle for
language learning and teaching are particularly welcome. See below for
instructions on paper submission.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will also be eligible for
consideration for publication in a book related to the theme of the
conference.

Information on registration plus other practical information will be
available shortly via http://covcell.org. There will
be no registration fee for this conference.

Important dates:

6th May 2007 - extended deadline for submission of abstracts

27th June 2007 - notification of acceptance

28-29th September 2007 - conference

(The Covcell Project is funded by the Minerva Fund of the European Union:
for more information see covcell.org).


Requirements for abstract submission:

The abstract should be anonymous, include the title of the paper and be
written in English.

The abstract should be no more than 2 pages of A4 including all
references, data and/or illustrations. Font should be 12-point and margins
2.5cm.

The abstract should be saved as a pdf file (though rtf, doc, and odt formats
can be accepted if absolutely necessary) and the file should be called
name-abstract.pdf (where name is the name of the author or of the contact
person in the case of multiple authors), e.g. whelpton-abstract.pdf

The abstract should be e-mailed no later than 6th May 2007 to both of the
following addresses:

whelpton@hi.is 

mgu@hi.is 

The main body of the e-mail should include: title of paper; name of author(s);
affiliation; e-mail address for correspondence; indication of whether the author
wishes their paper to be considered for publication in the book associated with
the conference.

The subject line of the e-mail should be COSELLO.
Submission is limited to one single authored paper and one joint authored
paper.
