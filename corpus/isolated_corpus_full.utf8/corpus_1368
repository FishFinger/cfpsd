Subject: Linguistic Association of the Southwest 
 

Full Title: Linguistic Association of the Southwest 
Short Title: LASSO 2007 

Date: 21-Sep-2007 - 23-Sep-2007
Location: Denver, Colorado, USA 
Contact Person: Devin Jenkins
Meeting Email: Devin.Jenkins@cudenver.edu
Web Site: http://www.cudenver.edu/~djenkins/LASSO 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

LASSO 2007: Linguistic Legacies 

Abstracts for papers or posters in any area of theoretical or applied
linguistics are welcome, although proposals on the theme are particularly
encouraged, as are proposals dealing with language issues of special interest in
the Southwest. Proposals for complete panels with 2-4 speakers are also welcome.

Deadline for submission is June 1, 2007.

Early submission of panel proposals is desirable.

Presentation time for papers will be twenty minutes plus ten minutes for
discussion. Abstracts may be in English or Spanish.

Presentations should be given in the same language as the abstract. Only one
abstract as single author and a second as co-author will be accepted from any
one individual.

Submissions by graduate students are welcome, and students are eligible for the
Helmut Esau Prize, a $250 cash award.

Abstracts should be 250-500 words, single-spaced in 11 point Times New Roman font.

Abstracts should summarize the main points and indicate key aspects of the data
and methodology.

Use of special font items should be kept to a minimum. In general, omit the
bibliography.

At the conference, abstracts will be distributed as received. At the beginning
of the abstract, write the title of the paper. At the end of the abstract,
repeat the title and also list the author's name (if more than one author, list
names in the order they should appear in the program), academic affiliation,
mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail. If the author will not be
available at his/her usual address or e-mail during the summer, provide summer
contact information in the cover e-mail. Also note whether any A-V equipment
will be needed.

Abstracts should be e-mailed to lasso2007@byu.edu as a PDF, Microsoft Word,
WordPerfect, RTF, or text file attachment. Special font items travel best as a
PDF. In addition to sending the abstract as an attachment, please paste the text
of the abstract into the e-mail message itself.

Authors without access to e-mail may mail a disk copy accompanied by a paper
copy to:

David Eddington
Dept. of Linguistics and English Language
Brigham Young University
4064 JFSB
Provo, UT 84602

Authors will receive a reply notifying them that their abstracts are under
consideration. If such notification has not been received within one week, the
abstract did not reach its destination and should be resent. Authors will be
notified by early July as to whether their papers have been accepted.

Participation in LASSO is a privilege of membership; this means that an
individual must be a current member in order to present a paper and be listed in
the conference program. Click below for a LASSO membership form:

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/donation/fund-drive2007/ 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
