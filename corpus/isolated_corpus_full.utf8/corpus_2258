Meeting Description:

Elfdalian (autonym övdalska, Swedish älvdalska), is spoken by some three
thousand persons in the parish of Alvdalen (Älvdalen) in the northern part of
Dalecarlia (Dalarna), Sweden. This threatened linguistic variety has been
traditionally considered a Swedish dialect. However, due to the aboundance of
features distinguishing it from Standard Swedish, an increasing number of
linguists advocate the recognition of Elfdalian as a seperate language.

Oðer råðstemna um övdalsku, The Second Conference on Elfdalian, is due to be
held on 2008 June 12 to 14 in Alvdalen. The arrangers are Centre for Multiethnic
Research at Uppsala University, Ulum dalska (The Association for the
Preservation of Elfdalian) and The Municipality of Alvdalen. 

The orientation of the conference is scientifical and likewise popular
scientifical. The purpose of the conference is to depict Elfdalian from mainly
two angles: (1) The structure of Elfdalian and (2) The revitalization and
standardization of the language. 

Abstracts should be sent to radstemna@yahoo.se on 1 February 2008 at the latest.
The main topics of the conference are (1) The structure of Elfdalian and (2) The
revitalization and standardization of Elfdalian. Papers depicting Elfdalian from
other angles are also of interest.

four successive sessions, a compact overview on main issues and the current
state of research in Cognitive Linguistics will be given. The tutorial is aimed
at (primarily junior) researchers in the field of linguistics, but also at
researchers and conference participants doing research in related fields (e.g.
sociology, psychology, literary studies). Moreover, we address cognitive
linguists who want to acquaint themselves with current issues, methods, and
applications on an international level. The courses will be held by
internationally established and top-rating scientists who are actively involved
and set the tone for current cognitive-linguistic research.
