ACL 2010: Call for Tutorial Proposals

Proposals are invited for the Tutorial Program of the 48th Annual
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2010).
The conference is to be held in Uppsala, Sweden, July 11-16, 2010.
The tutorials will be held on Sunday, July 11.

ACL 2010 seeks proposals for tutorials on all topics of computational
linguistics, broadly conceived to include areas such as psycholinguistics,
speech, information retrieval, multimodal language processing, and
language issues in emerging domains such as bioinformatics. Especially
encouraged are tutorials that educate the community about advancements in
cross-disciplinary areas such as machine learning and cognitive approaches
as they relate to computational linguistics, as well as tutorials that
span multiple areas of human language processing.

Information on the tutorial instructor payment policy can be found at
http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=3DTutorial_teacher_payment_poli=
cy

Please NOTE: Remuneration for Tutorial presenters is fixed according
to the above policy and does not cover registration fees for the main
conference.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its
   relevance to the ACL community (not more than 2 pages).

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
   tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including
   a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are
   available as well.

3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
   the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their
   research interests and areas of expertise.

4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the
   same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an
   estimate of the audience size.

5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment
   (e.g., internet access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text
no later than January 8, 2010 to tutorials@acl2010.org

The subject line should be: "ACL 2010: TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".
