Meeting Description:
The Relevance of Computational Concepts in Cognitive Linguistics. 

Second and Last Call for Papers

Computational Paradigms and Language Structure
The Relevance of Computational Concepts in Cognitive Linguistics
November 30th - December 1st, 2007,
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

URL: http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/workshops/CfPII-CPLS-07.pdf

Computer Science developed a wealth of computational paradigms responding to the
ever growing complexity of computer systems and the demands of software
maintenance and efficient data organisation. In Linguistics, computational
models were frequently made use of (cf. e.g. the notion of interfaces) without
however systematically exploring the possibilities offered by Computer Science.

In this workshop we would like to consider the concepts and solutions provided
by the different computational paradigms and address the question of whether
they allow for a cognitive interpretation which can be utilised for linguistic
theory-building. For example, complexity, maintenance and efficiency should be
core aspects in the organisation of the lexicon from a cognitive perspective.
How do the different computational paradigms deal with these problems, and how
to exploit such solutions for the organisation of the lexicon? One hypothesis
would be that the principles of the object oriented paradigm will prove to be
productive for cognitive linguistics. With the exception of the pioneering work
by Schalley (2004), this path has not yet been investigated in a more systematic
way.

The workshop aims at putting a new research question on the agenda and solicits
original contributions exploring Computational Science concepts for Cognitive
Linguistics.  

Invited Speakers:
Andrea Schalley, UNE Armidale

Submissions:
Authors should submit an anonymous abstract. The length of abstracts for talks
should be at most 2 single-column pages including literature. All submissions
should include a separate cover page specifying the authors' names, affiliation,
address, e-mail address and title of the paper. The abstracts should be
submitted electronically (pdf, ps or doc format) to: copalast07@zas.gwz-berlin.de
