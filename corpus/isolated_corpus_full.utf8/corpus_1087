Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
Recent years witnessed an increased interest in formal pragmatics and especially
the establishment of game theory as a new research methodology for the study of
language use. Within this field of research, three major currents can be
distinguished: one is closely related to the Gricean paradigm and aims at a
precise foundation of pragmatic reasoning; the second originates in the economic
literature and is concerned with the role of game theory in the context of
language use, and the third aims at language evolution seen either from a
biological or from a cultural perspective.

The workshop constitutes a forum for younger researchers to present and discuss
their work in the broad context of ESSLLI. In addition, it provides an
opportunity for researchers from other fields to get acquainted with the style
and the problems addressed in this new research paradigm. 

Second Call for Papers

Workshop on Language, Games, and Evolution

http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/lili/personen/cebert/LGE/

August 6-10, 2007

Organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2007 (http://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/) August 6-17, 2007
in Dublin.

Workshop Organizers:
 - Anton Benz, ZAS Berlin (benz@zas.gwz-berlin.de)
 - Christian Ebert, University of Bielefeld (christan.ebert@uni-bielefeld.de)
 - Robert van Rooij, ILLC Amsterdam (R.A.M.vanRooij@uva.nl)

The workshop constitutes a forum for younger researchers to present and
discuss their work in the broad context of ESSLLI. In addition it provides an
opportunity for researchers from other fields to get acquainted with the style
and the problems addressed in this new research paradigm.

Workshop Topics:
We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of the role of
rational interaction in communication, as well as empirical studies and
computational simulations that shed light on the empirical validity of formal
models. Specific topics might relate but are not limited to:

Aspects of Rationality in Language Use:
 - Gricean Pragmatics
 - Speech Act Theory
 - Pragmatics of Dialogue
 - Interaction and Discourse Structure
 - Structure of Common Ground
 - Alignment in Discourse

Aspects of Language Games:
 - Signalling Games
 - Credibility
 - Bounded Rationality
 - Relevance and Optimality

Aspects of Language Evolution:
 - Evolution of Typological Diversity
 - Studies of Grammaticalisation Phenomena
 - Micro-Dynamics of Language Evolution
 - Mathematical Models

Submission Details:
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract, which should not exceed 3
pages including references. Please send your submission in either PDF or
Microsoft Word format electronically to Christian Ebert
(christian.ebert@uni-bielefeld.de) by March 8, 2007. The submissions will be
reviewed by the workshop's programme committee and additional reviewers.

The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by
ESSLLI. The final versions should not exceed 8 pages. A selection of the
papers of this workshop proceedings will be the kernel of a book ''Language,
Games, and Evolution'' edited by Benz, Ebert and van Rooij to appear in the
series ''Texts on Logic and Games'' published by the Amsterdam University Press.

Workshop Format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the
first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper presentation and
discussion per session. On the first day the workshop organizers will give an
introduction to the topic.

Invited Speakers:
 - Simon Huttegger (Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition     
Research, Austria)
 - Rohit Parikh (Brooklyn College and CUNY Graduate Center, USA)

Workshop Programme Committee:
 - Anton Benz
 - Christian Ebert

Berlin, Project A2 on implicit common ground of the SFB 673 ''Alignment in
Communication'' at the University of Bielefeld, and Robert van Rooij's VIDI
project ''The Economics of Language''.
