Meeting Description:

CRISCO Linguistics Workshop 

What Texts Do to Sentences
(Ce que le texte fait à la phrase )

The aim of this conference is to bring together works pertaining to
sentence-text interface. 

When considered in their natural environment, i.e. the text, sentences (but also
phrases or clauses) must conform to a set of relational and positional
constraints. These constraints pertain to a range of phenomena of different
kinds.  For instance :

- The sentence is to some extent at the disposal of the wider text - and the
text itself ascribes a particular position to a given sentence. The construction
'X depends on Y' (ex : Economic growth in Britain depends on the growth of its
companies ) occurs in a textual position determined by the so-called
problem-solution pattern. Similarly, narrative schemata, textual sequences (J.M.
Adam) and modes of discourse (C. Smith) prime sentences for text positions (M.
Hoey : textual priming). The parameters of these positions must be investigated. 

- One can consider that some actance variations are caused by the need to come
up with different discourse functions. The utterance in French 'le malade demande
des soins' (= the patient requires care # the patient asks for care) has two
possible interpretations: it can be  seen as agent-focused - where the speaker
uses reported speech (the patient asks for care), and it can be seen as non
agent-focused, where the speaker simply assesses a situation as problematic (the
patient requires care); assessment is a link in a textual pattern.    

-The syntagmatic structure of the sentence is, to some extent, determined by
informational structure and diathetic pressures. The question that arises is :
what is the relationship between information structuring at the sentence level
and at the discourse level? In addition, some phenomena, related to argument
structures, are dependent on informational organisation. According to J. Du Bois
and his prefered argument structure theory, there is a tendency for speakers to
avoid expressing more than one lexical argument (i.e. more than one piece of new
information) in a clause, and the tendency to avoid having new referents
(lexically expressed) in the transitive subject position.

-Texts may be seen as an interaction between writer/speaker and addressee in
which the writer/speaker seeks to answer the questions that his adressee will
want answering. Because of this, intertextual and textual unfolding depends on
an act of questioning, and sentences are related to a whole field of questions
that give them meaning (cf. Meyer's Theory of Problematology). Are there
linguistic clues, at sentence level, that reveal this dialogical process? 

- In a circular way, although specified by text and pragmatic factors, some
sentences have predictive functions; for example, semantically unspecific nouns
or 'shell nouns' (ex : I have an idea), or specialized predicates (ex : we can
distinguish two types of explanation) are kinds of signposts : they signal a
specific textual organisation.

The issues which this conference wishes to address are: 

- The 'dialectical' relationships between text, sentence and clause. Studies
will give more importance to 'textuality' or 'discursivity' than to interclausal
relationships.
- The textual status of sentence or clause structure.
- The discussion on the 'a priori view' of grammar, which holds that grammar is
a discrete set of rules and logically precedes discourse, and the so-called
'emergent grammar', which holds that grammar is primarily shaped by
textual-discourse patterns.
 
The talks can bear on all languages, pertain to synchrony or diachrony, and
will cover such disciplines as linguistics, psycholinguistics and computer science.
