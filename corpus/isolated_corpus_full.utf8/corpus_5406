Recognition, Statistical Methods, Sublanguages and Controlled
Languages, Syntax, Temporal Processing, Term Extraction and Automatic
Indexing, Text Data Mining, Text Segmentation, Text Simplification,
Text Summarisation, Text-to-Speech Synthesis, Translation Technology,
Tree-Adjoining Grammars, Word Sense Disambiguation.

All accepted papers will be presented at the Student Workshop sessions
