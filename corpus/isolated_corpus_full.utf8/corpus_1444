Meeting Description:

Second International Workshop on   

Communication Between Human and Artificial Agents (CHAA-07)

http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~ckemke/CHAA-07/ 

Workshop Description:

The ability to communicate in a complex manner with others, to exchange ideas
and thoughts, to convey factual information as well as wishes, goals, and plans,
to issue commands, instructions and questions, and to express emotions and
interact on a social level, is one of the most important and distinguishing
aspects of humankind. If artificial agents want to progress to the next level,
and truly and deeply interact with humans, they must possess expanded
communicative abilities.

Interdisciplinary research, integrating methods and models from computer
science, psychology, engineering, linguistics, philosophy, mathematics, and
others, has provided a basis for the development of artificial agents and an
extension of their ''human'' characteristics and abilities.

Building on the approaches developed so far, this workshop focuses on new
methods and models to describe and implement communication between human and
artificial agents, in all forms and on all levels. The ultimate goal of this
endeavour is to bridge the gap between the richness, complexity and
expressiveness of human communication, and the (in)ability of artificial agents
to interact and communicate adequately with their human partners.

Topic Areas:

- models of communicative behaviour
- natural language and speech as interaction medium
- dialogue in human-agent communication
- gestures and facial expressions
- emotions, affective computing
- multi-modal communication
- human-like virtual and physical agents
- human-robot interaction
- knowledge representation and ontologies for communication
- action ontology, action theory, action representation
- context modelling (physical, spatial, temporal, dialogue context)
- speech characteristics in communication
- learning of interactive behaviours,
- learning in interactions, imitation learning
- cooperative behaviour, negotiation, judgement
- social interaction, social behaviours, social norms and roles
- applications, e.g. games, virtual reality, user interfaces
- technical realization

Important Dates:

- Paper submission: 25 May 2007
- Author notification: 2 August 2007
- Camera-ready copy: 17 August 2007
- Workshop: 1 day during IAT/WI/GrC/BIBM Conference, 2-5 Nov 2007

Paper Submission:

All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop
Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, which are indexed by EI.

Submission Instructions: TBA.
