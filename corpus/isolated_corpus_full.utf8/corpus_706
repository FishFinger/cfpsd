Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Historical Linguistics; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2007 

Holophrasis, Compositionality and Protolanguage

This announcement is a call for contributions to a special issue of the
journal 'Interaction Studies' devoted to 'Holophrasis versus
Compositionality in the Emergence of Protolanguage' and to be edited by
Michael Arbib and Derek Bickerton.

The issue of whether the protolanguage(s) that formed the basis for the
earliest forms of human language

i) consisted of items with the semantic scope of present-day words that
were subsequently conjoined to form larger utterances, or

ii) consisted of single items with the semantic scope of present-day
sentences that were subsequently decomposed into words

is currently a highly controversial one in the evolution of language, and
we welcome papers from newcomers to the controversy as well as those who
have already taken part in it.

Preference will be given to papers that, rather than attempting an overview
of the entire issue, treat one particular aspect and develop new arguments
in some depth. Such aspects include (but are by no means limited to):

Computational assumptions
Conceptual structure
Decomposition
Learnability of protolanguage
Neurological correlates
Paleontological and ecological contexts
Practical utility
Proto-conversation and proto-speech-acts
Roots of phonology
Roots of semantics
Roots of syntax

Prospective contributors should prepare abstracts of not more than 800
words and submit them electronically (MS word format preferred) to both
arbib@usc.edu and derbick@hawaii.rr.com. The deadline for submitting
abstracts is February 1, 2007.

The editors will select a set of abstracts for development into full papers
and inform prospective authors of their decision by March 1, 2007.

The due date for submission of full papers will be June 1, 2007. The
maximum length of each paper is 6,500 words. These papers will be subject
to rigorous refereeing, but it is unlikely that such a paper will be
rejected, though extensive revisions may be required.
