Computational Linguistics 
Short Title: CICLing 

Date: 17-Feb-2008 - 23-Feb-2008
Location: Haifa, Israel 
Contact Person: Alexander Gelbukh

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

This conference is the ninth CICLing event. The past CICLing conferences have
been very successful, according to the comments of the participants: Fantastic
conference! (Martin Kay, 2004), Everything was just great!
Super-hyper-ultra-well done! (Igor Mel'cuk, 2000). We consider the following
factors to define our identity:

   Excellent keynote speakers. We invite the most prominent scientists of the
field to give keynote talks which, unlike at many other conferences, are
published in extenso in the Proceedings. They also organize an additional
tutorial or discussion, and usually even participate in the excursions, where
you can speak with them in an informal environment. [Past participants' opinions]

   General interest. The conference covers nearly all topics related to
computational linguistics and text processing. This makes it attractive for
people from different areas and leads to vivid and interesting discussions and
exchange of opinions.

   Informal interaction. The conference is intended for a rather small group of
professionals. This allows for informal and friendly atmosphere, more resembling
a friendly party than an official event. At CICLing you can pass hours speaking
with your favorite famous scientists who you scarcely could even greet in the
crowd at large conferences.

   Excellent cultural program. The conference is intended for people feeling
themselves young in their souls, adventurous explorers of both science and life.
Our cultural program brings the participants to unique marvels of history and
nature hidden from ordinary tourists.
