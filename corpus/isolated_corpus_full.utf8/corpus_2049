Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERDISCIPLINARY SOCIAL SCIENCES
Monash University Centre, Prato, Tuscany, Italy, 22-25 July 2008 
http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com

The International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences examines the nature of disciplinary practices, and the interdisciplinary practices that arise in the context of 'real world' applications. It also interrogates what constitutes 'science' in a social context, and the connections between the social and other sciences.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 8 November 2007. Proposals are reviewed within four weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Prato in July 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Norma Burgess
Dean, College for Graduate Studies
Chatham University
Pittsburgh, PA, USA
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences
