Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Re-writing Linguistic History - (Post)colonial Reality on the
Fringes of Linguistic Theories' will be held at the upcoming INST-conference on
the theme 'Knowledge, Creativity and Transformations of Societies (KCTOS)'  in
Vienna, 6th-9th December 2007.  
The workshop seeks to reassert the place of (post)colonial reality within
linguistic theories, which unfortunately were designed for other contexts but
have been applied to these contexts without a conscious regard for discrepancies. 

Papers that approach the issue from quantitative and qualitative perspectives
and/or introduce alternative analytical frameworks are welcome.

Re-writing Linguistic History - (Post)colonial Reality on the Fringes of
Linguistic Theories

For the past several decades, linguistic studies of (post)colonial societies
have been built on theories, platforms, templates and frameworks constructed in,
and for, the west. As Franz Boas rightly said at the turn of the last century,
''the internal structure of languages and societies must be allowed to emerge on
their own, without the distorting imposition of European templates upon them''
(see Handbook of American Indian Languages). The distorting impact of foreign
models, as the case may be, prohibited researchers from investigating peculiar
characteristics of these societies as outcomes of their sociohistorical
completeness. For instance, Africa's multilingualism has often been described on
a par with European multilingualism. This is theoretically misleading because
whereas European multilingualism involves several written languages, the African
context involves only one (or two) written languages existing alongside oral
languages founded on oral cultures and transmitted orally. It is about time more
natural and region-based findings were made that handle postcolonial areas not
as being on the fringes of the west but as constituting centres of their own.

This section of the KCTOS conference (December 6-9, 2007) addresses the
following (and more) linguistic issues in postcolonial areas that have been
studied with foreign-based theories:

1. Postcolonial linguistics (how colonialism rolled the dice in approaches to,
and conceptions of, languages in these contexts)
2. Postcolonial pragmatics (face, politeness, turn-taking, name-calling, etc.)
3. Notions of bilingualism and multilingualism (oral vs. written languages and
cultures)
4. Construction of (multiple) linguistic identities (allegiance to languages)
5. Endangerment(?) and survival of indigenous languages in the face of
international (official) languages like English and French.
6. Language contact and (socio)linguistic outcomes

Papers with strong insights into the above topics and related ones are invited.
Priority will be given to papers that propose new (and promising) analytical
frameworks to particular linguistic processes in postcolonial areas.
Quantitative and qualitative approaches are welcome.

NB: Papers will be published in TRANS 17 (http://www.inst.at/trans/index.htm). 
Selected papers will be published as a book.

Send abstracts to Eric A. Anchimbe at anchimbe_eric@yahoo.com by July 25th, 2007.

of this message. 

The meeting will be directly followed by an independently organised Workshop on
Features. For further details, see the call for papers for this session on page
6 of the full circular, and included at the end of this message. 

Deadline for abstracts: 9th April. For details of abstract submission, see the
full first circular - abstracts may be submitted either electronically or in
hard copy; sets of abstracts may be submitted together for a themed session of
your choice. Electronic submission of abstracts is preferred. 


Call for Papers for the Themed Session Related to the Linguistics Association
Lecture by B. Elan Dresher on 'Contrast in Phonology'. 

It is a phonological commonplace that contrast is fundamental to phonology, but
quite how this should be implemented in phonological theory remains contentious.
Abstracts would be welcome which connect in any way with the issues that arise
from a consideration of the role of contrast (and of contrasts of different
types) in phonology. 

Some relevant questions are (in part adapted from the material written by B.
Elan Dresher and Keren Rice, and available here: www.chass.utoronto.ca/~contrast/). 
- How should the role of contrast be conceived in phonology? How should it be
represented? 
- Is there a relation between the amount of segmental complexity a system allows
and the number and nature of contrasts it has? 
- Which features and contrasts are marked and which are unmarked, and what
diagnostics should we use to decide this question? 
- Do noncontrastive features play any role in the phonology of a language? 

Abstracts are now invited for this session. They should be submitted in the same
way as abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked that
they are intended for this special themed session. 


Call for Papers for the Workshop on 'Syntactic Microvariation in English
Dialects', organised by Marika Lekakou and Karen Corrigan. 

In the recent past the study of dialect syntax has received renewed interest
from different perspectives (sociolinguistics, theoretical linguistics, language
typology, traditional dialectology, historical linguistics). Particularly
exciting is the recent development of extended co-operation among scholars
within these fields, which has led to a more interdisciplinary approach to the
study of the syntactic properties of dialects. This new development is reflected
in, among other things, the contributions in Cornips and Corrigan (eds), Syntax
and Variation: Reconciling the Biological and the Social. Amsterdam: John
Benjamins, 2005. 

Concomitantly, a number of dialect syntax projects have already been launched or
even completed across Europe, which have the property of combining different
theoretical backgrounds (for example, theoretical linguistics employing
sociolinguistically informed methodology of data collection). Examples of this
European tendency can be found in for instance Italy (ASIS,
http://asis-cnr.unipd.it/index.en.html), Portugal (CORDIAL-SIN,
http://www.clul.ul.pt/english/sectores/cordialsin/projecto_cordialsin.html),
Scandinavia (ScanDiaSyn, http://uit.no/scandiasyn/?Language=en), and the
Netherlands and Belgium (SAND, www.meertens.nl/sand). The Netherlands is also
the home of the currently running ESF-funded Edisyn project
(www.meertens.nl/projecten/edisyn). The Edisyn aspires to set up, extend and
develop cooperation among dialect syntax projects in Europe, thus yielding a
European network of dialect syntacticians that use similar standards with
respect to methodology of data collection, data storage and annotation, data
retrieval and cartography. 

Currently, existing dialectal variation in varieties of English has not been
explored in a systematic way, in the sense that a large-scale dialect syntax
project has not yet been undertaken (the FRED project
(http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/institut/lskortmann/) which ran at the
University of Freiburg has resulted in a corpus of dialect data from previous
generations). We aim to host a workshop with the aim of bringing together
scholars who are interested in collaboration that will ultimately lead to the
launch of a UK and Ireland branch of the Edisyn project. We therefore invite
contributions on any aspect of the syntax of English dialects. 

Abstracts are now invited for this session. They should be submitted in the same
way as abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked that
they are intended for this workshop. 


This year's LAGB meeting overlaps with the second conference of the UK Cognitive
Linguistics Association. If members would like to attend both, the committee
will be sure to take this into account, if necessary, when scheduling talks. If
this is likely to affect you, please indicate this in the message accompanying
your abstract. 


Workshop on Features
1-2 September 2007 
King's College London 
in association with the 2007 LAGB meeting 

Linguistic fields: General Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Language
Description, Linguistic Theories, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Typology 

Meeting Summary 
The Workshop on Features (1-2 September 2007) will be associated with and will
directly follow the LAGB 2007 conference at King's College London. Abstracts
should be submitted, and will be considered separately to those intended for the
LAGB meeting. The Workshop will bring together linguists who have grappled with
features as a component of theoretical models together with others who have
considered their range and variability in the world's languages. 

Details 
In attempting to understand language, a central notion is features. Examples are
person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, plural, dual...) tense (present,
past...), and inflectional class (I, II, III, IV...). Features have proven
invaluable for analysis and description, and have a major role in contemporary
linguistics, right across the range of the discipline. Yet little is firmly
established about features: we have no readily available inventory of which
features are found in the world's languages, no generally agreed account of how
they operate across different components of language and no certainty on how
they interact. Features are widely used, but are little discussed. The workshop
will therefore bring together linguists who have grappled with features as a
component of theoretical models together with others who have considered their
range and variability in the world's languages. 

There will be six guest speakers who have agreed to talk on the following topics: 
- David Adger 'Features and functional categories' 
- Peter Austin 'Features and clause linkage' 
- Ann Copestake 'Features and computational semantics' 
- Ron Kaplan 'Formal aspects of underspecified features' 
- Maria Polinsky 'Featural asymmetries in long-distance agreement: why gender is
different from person' 
- Ivan Sag 'Feature geometry and predictions of locality' 

The programme organisers of the Workshop are Greville Corbett and Anna Kibort,
Surrey Morphology Group (www.surrey.ac.uk/LIS/SMG/). The Workshop is supported
by the ESRC, within a project on Grammatical Features (grant number
RES-051-27-0122). The local organisers of the LAGB meeting at King's College
London, Devyani Sharma and Eleni Gregoromichelaki, have kindly agreed to take on
the local arrangements. 

Contact: Anna Kibort 
Contact e-mail: a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk 

Abstracts should be submitted in the same format as that described for abstracts
which are to be submitted for the LAGB meeting on page 2 of the LAGB circular.
They should not be sent to the same address as abstracts meant for the LAGB
meeting, but should be emailed to Anna Kibort (a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk), by or on
9th April 2007
