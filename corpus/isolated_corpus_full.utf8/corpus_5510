Meeting Description:

According to mythographer Lewis Spence a myth explains "our relation to the=
 universe, the environment or a social programme". In the Irish context, th=
is definition of myth helps to understand the interrelationship between the=
 retrieval of the Irish mythological lore and the construction of communal =
identity that characterised twentieth century Irish history, literature and=
 socio-political reality.

Spence's broad definition of myth, though initially referring to gods or su=
pernatural beings, can easily be adapted to explain the construction of con=
temporary myths. Understood in a Barthesian sense, the concept of myth can =
be extended to include socio-cultural narratives that are constructed and b=
ecome naturalised as symbols of a community to express the way it relates t=
o the world. A changing reality calls for new ways of relating to the conte=
xt and, consequently, for the (re)construction of myths.=20

In the last few decades Irish reality, north and south of the border, has d=
ramatically changed. The aim of this conference is to analyse the (re)const=
ruction of myths that communities in Ireland have developed in the face of =
these momentous changes. Papers are welcome from a broad range of disciplin=
es including: Literary Studies; Ecocriticism; Media and Film Studies; Cultu=
ral Studies and Popular Culture; Postcolonial Studies; Gender Studies; Crit=
ical Theory; Linguistics. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

- Myth and the nation
- Myth and masculinity
- The feminisation of Ireland and myth
- Redefinitions of traditional myths
- Myth, nostalgia and globalisation=20
- Pastoral myth and globalised Ireland
- The myths of the Celtic Tiger
- Language myths
- Folk etymologies
- Irish accents in stage and screen
- Speaker beliefs
- Ulster-Scots: language or dialect?
- Language policy

The following guest speakers have already confirmed their attendance: Prof.=
 Angela Bourke (School of Irish, Celtic Studies, Irish Folklore & Linguisti=
cs, UCD), Prof. Robert Welch (Academy for Irish Cultural Heritages Research=
 Institute, University of Ulster), Prof. Eil=E9an N=ED Chuillean=E1in (Scho=
ol of English, Trinity College, Dublin, and poet).=20

Abstracts of no more than 250 words should be sent by email to Irene Gilsen=
an Nordin (ign@du.se) and to Carmen Zamorano Llena (cza@du.se). Abstracts d=
ealing with language/linguistics should be sent to Una Cunningham (uca@du.s=
e). The deadline for submission of abstracts is 31 August 2009. Notificatio=
n of acceptance will be sent by 7 September 2009. A selection of the papers=
 presented at the conference will be published in book form.
