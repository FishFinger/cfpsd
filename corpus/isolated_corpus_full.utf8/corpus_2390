Full Title: Postgraduate Conference in Corpus Linguistics 

Date: 22-May-2008 - 22-May-2008
Location: Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Iztok Kosem
Meeting Email: kosemi@aston.ac.uk
Web Site: http://acorn.aston.ac.uk/postgraduate_conference.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description

Aston University, Birmingham, UK
School of Languages and Social Sciences
ISLS - Institute for the Study of Language and Society

The objective of the Postgraduate conference in Corpus Linguistics, organized by
the ACORN project team of the School of Languages and Social Sciences at Aston
University, is to enable postgraduates to present their corpus-related research.
By combining the conference with the Aston Corpus Symposium, which will take
place on the following day (Friday 23rd May), postgraduates will also be able to
hear experts talk about their past and current projects. 

Corpus studies have had an immense impact on language description over the past
20 years, dispelling many myths and discovering many hitherto unforeseen aspects
of language in use. Wider impacts have also been felt through work on discourse
analysis, genre analysis, and in translation studies. In recent years, attention
has been increasingly focussed on the use of corpora for teaching and learning.

Presentations can focus on any corpus-related topic.

Abstracts written in English of max 300 words (with bibliographical references)
for a 20 minute paper should be sent by 15th February 2008 to kosemi@aston.ac.uk
or g.r.yepes@aston.ac.uk. The preferred file formats are .doc and .pdf. Author's
name, affiliation, and contact details should be provided in a separate attachment.

Authors of accepted abstracts will be notified by 1st April 2008.
