Dear Scholars.

We are writing to inform you about the forthcoming book titled 'Linguistics
of Varieties of Hindi in the 21st Century'. It would be very nice if you
can help us in this endeavor by contributing your research article for the
book.=20

Proposed Title: 'Linguistics of Varieties of Hindi in the 21st Century'
We all are well aware that there has been considerable amount of work on
Hindi linguistics during the last sixty years in the form of books,
research articles, monographs and numerous dissertations. But it has also
been observed that linguistic work on varieties of Hindi has been out of
our attention for long. The forthcoming book entitled is an attempt to
counter this
deficit of focused linguistic research work on varieties of Hindi and
thereby empowering these lesser known languages in the long run.
Globalization, linguistic imperialism, language rights, language and power,
cultural, political, and economic hegemony, and language planning and
policy are at the forefront of the debate on so called big vs. small vs.
tiny languages. It has also raised our awareness about the issues of
language loss and language endangerment. The linguistic subsystems of these
languages are at crossroads in the era of information. As languages are
pushed aside and made to run second to global English, people may be at
risk of not only linguistic loss but also loss of precious bio-cultural
knowledge which survived us for ages. Many of the varieties of Hindi were
researched in early 20th century and later in post independent India but
since then linguistic research on these varieties has taken a back seat.
This was partly due to rising-roaring power of Hindi and partly due to
depreciating socio-cultural status of these varieties over the years. Today
we know little about the linguistic status of many of these minority
languages. Focused and empirical research on these languages is the need of
the hour because that time is not very far when all the speakers would have
gone.

'Linguistics of Varieties of Hindi in the 21st Century' seeks to gain an
understanding of how these varieties have evolved over the years and what
linguistic changes they have undergone. The book is primarily concerned
with recent trends in linguistic research on varieties of Hindi. The book
is an endeavor for bringing together current empirical research on these
lesser known languages. The book will be of interest to linguists and
scholars studying language change, language documentation, and language
endangerment, sociology of language, language use and educated speakers of
these languages in general.
