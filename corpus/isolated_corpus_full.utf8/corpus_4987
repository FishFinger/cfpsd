Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce the first international conference on Intonational
Variation in Arabic, to be held on 28th and 29th September 2009 at the
University of York, UK. The aim of the conference is to bring together
researchers working on Arabic prosody and intonation, and together to explore
the range of prosodic variation observed in spoken varieties of Arabic. 

Call for Papers

Papers of a descriptive and/or theoretical nature are invited which treat the
phonetics and/or phonology of suprasegmental phenomena in one or more Arabic
varieties (or other related Afro-Asiatic languages). Papers treating the
intonational phonology of spoken Arabic dialects will be particularly welcome
and will be prioritised. The conference will include a special workshop session
on the development of transcription systems for research on intonational
variation in Arabic.

Invited speakers confirmed so far:
Professor Francis Nolan (University of Cambridge, UK)
Professor Khaled Rifaat (Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud University, Riyadh)

and with normal character spacing. A second page may be used to provide
examples, figures and/or references. No submissions will be accepted which are
longer than two pages. 

Your abstract should be anonymous. You will be asked to submit a version with
your name and affiliation on it if your abstract is selected for presentation.
Please do not use your name in the filename for your abstract. 

If you choose to use a phonetic font in your abstract or if you wish to include
figures/pitch traces, we strongly recommend that you submit your abstract in pdf
format. 

Abstracts should be uploaded to the iva09 page on the EasyAbstracts site on or
before 31st May 2009. You may use one of the following formats for your

committee.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
