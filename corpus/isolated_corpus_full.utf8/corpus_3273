Meeting Description:

The Second International Conference of English as a Lingua Franca
University of Southampton, 6-8 April 2009 

First Announcement and Call for Papers

Following the success of the First International Conference of English as a
Lingua Franca in Helsinki earlier this year, we are pleased to announce the
second conference in the series. As everyone who attended the Helsinki
conference can confirm, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) has become both a
vibrant field of research, and one of the most frequently discussed and hotly
debated topics of our time. The 2009 conference will provide a forum for
researchers to present updates on their work in this fast-moving field; for
further discussion of the implications of ELF research for language policy,
teaching, testing, standards, and the like; and for the ideological debates to
continue. 

Plenary Speakers:
Anna Mauranen, University of Helsinki
Barbara Seidlhofer, University of Vienna
Henry Widdowson, Emeritus Universities of London and Vienna

Organising committee: Jennifer Jenkins (co-chair), Alasdair Archibald
(co-chair), Robert Baird, Will Baker, Jill Doubleday, Liz Hauge, Caroline
Hyde-Simon, Victoria Long, Mary Page, Chris Sinclair.

Proposals for Papers and Colloquia

We invite submissions of proposals for individual/joint papers and colloquia, on
any aspect of English as a Lingua Franca: linguistic, sociolinguistic and
psycholinguistic, and/or relating to issues of language policy, language
teaching, and language ideology that concern ELF.

Papers will be 20 minutes in length plus 10 minutes for questions and comments.
Colloquia will be 2 hours in length, involve up to four speakers, and include at
least 30 minutes for discussion.

For each submission, provide a title, an abstract of 150-200 words for papers,
250-300 words for colloquia, and the name, title, and affiliation of each
presenter. 

Proposals should be sent by email to: aa3@soton.ac.uk
