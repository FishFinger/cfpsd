Call Deadline: 01-Jul-2009 

Meeting Description:

While research on borderlands is well-established in the social sciences, it is 
only within recent years that interest in such regions as sites of particular 
relevance has taken hold within the fields of sociolinguistics and the sociology 
of language. Findings from studies on the relationships between and 
interdependence of language, borders and identities are of great value for many 
other disciplines within the social sciences - anthropology, human geography, 
and political science, among others. In the same way, the insights from social 
scientific research in border areas provide sociolinguists with challenging new 
theoretical frameworks within which to situate empirical evidence revealing the 
exact nature of the role language plays in identity-making and -marking in sites 
where identity is fluid, complex and emergent in social interaction.

The Borders and Identities Conference (BIC2010) has two aims: 1) to demonstrate 
our current state of knowledge in this fast-developing area of sociolinguistic 
inquiry, and 2) to provide an interdisciplinary perspective in order that the 
results of recent sociolinguistic studies on the topic can be contextualised in 
broader social scientific discourse. Our principal objective in organising the 
meeting is to foster new collaborative research initiatives by bringing together 
scholars in allied disciplines, with a view to extending and refining our 
understanding of the language-identity nexus in regions where in-group and out-
group categorisations may be problematic, or at least more salient than 
elsewhere.

Keynote Addresses:

Dave Britain (Essex) 'Where North meets South?: Contact, Divergence, and the 
Routinisation of the Fenland Dialect Boundary'
Nik Coupland (Cardiff) 'Where does Welsh Begin and End? Ideological Boundary 
Disputes in the Revitalisation of a Minority Language'
Danny Dorling (Sheffield) 'If Lions Could Talk: Mapping over the Borders' 

Call for Papers

The BIC2010 organising committee welcomes abstracts for oral and poster
