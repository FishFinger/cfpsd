                         CALL FOR PAPERS

    Workshop on Grammar-Based Approaches to Spoken Language Processing

  ACL 2007 Conference Workshop

     Prague, Czech Republic
June 29, 2007

              http://www.issco.unige.ch/speechgram2007

  *** Submission Deadline: 26th March 2007 ***

Even though the statistical paradigm is dominant in research on spoken
language processing, grammar based approaches are used to a great
extent in industry and are also a popular choice for building command
and control applications. They are particularly useful in situations
where there is a lack of appropriate training data for particular
domains, or even in some cases for the language as a whole, and when
it is important to encode global structural constraints. Several
platforms are now available that support construction of grammar-based
spoken dialogue systems, including SRI's Gemini, NASA and Geneva
University's Regulus and Chalmers and Gothenburg University's GF, and
a variety of substantial applications have been built using these tools.

This workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers in this area
to present results, compare systems and exchange practical experience
in grammar based development for spoken language understanding
systems. We solicit papers on topics including but not limited to the
following:

*  Tools and platforms for building grammar-based speech recognizers

*  Multilingual grammar development

*  Methods for extraction of domain specific speech grammars from=20
   large grammar resources

*  Combining grammars and statistical techniques

*  Empirical studies comparing grammar based and other approaches to=20
   recognition and generation

*  Descriptions and evaluations of systems built using grammar-based =
methods

SUBMISSION

Submissions may be either FULL PAPERS or DEMO DESCRIPTIONS. Full
papers may be of up to 8 pages, and demo descriptions of up to 4
pages. All submissions should use the style files available on the
main HLT/NAACL 2006 conference web site
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/). Author information should
be included in the papers, since reviewing will NOT be blind.

Full papers should describe substantial previously unpublished work.
Demo descriptions should follow the guidelines presented on the ACL=20
2007 demo submissions page (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/demos/).
They should describe non-trivial implemented systems, but need
not consist of previously unpublished work. People who submit
full papers are encouraged also to submit demo descriptions=20
when this is appropriate.

Papers should be submitted electronically following the instructions
at http://www.issco.unige.ch/speechgram2007, which will soon be
active.

Submission deadline: 26th March 2007

Notification: 24th April 2007
