                  Call for Papers for a Special Issue on 
                 Processing Morphologically Rich Languages 
          IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing

This is a call for papers for a special issue on Processing Morphologically 
Rich Languages, to be published in early 2009 in the IEEE Transactions on 
Audio, Speech and Language Processing. 

Morphologically-rich languages like Arabic, Turkish, Finnish, Korean, etc., 
present significant challenges for speech processing, natural language 
processing (NLP), as well as speech and text translation. These languages are 
characterized by highly productive morphological processes (inflection, 
agglutination, compounding) that may produce a very large number of word 
forms for a given root form.  Modeling each form as a separate word leads 
to a number of problems for speech and NLP applications, including: 1) large 
vocabulary growth, 2) poor language model (LM) probability estimation, 
3) higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate, 4) inflection gap for machine 
translation:  multiple different forms of  the same underlying baseform 
are often treated as unrelated items, with negative effects on word alignment 
and translation accuracy.  

Large-scale speech and language processing systems require advanced modeling 
techniques to address these problems. Morphology also plays an important 
role in addressing specific issues of under-studied languages such as data 
sparsity, coverage and robust modeling. We invite papers describing 
previously unpublished work in the following broad areas: Using morphology 
for speech recognition and understanding, speech and text translation, 
speech synthesis, information extraction and retrieval, as well as 
summarization . Specific topics of interest include:
- methods addressing data sparseness issue for morphologically rich 
  languages with application to speech recognition, text and speech 
  translation, information extraction and retrieval, speech   
  synthesis, and summarization
- automatic decomposition of complex word forms into smaller units 
- methods for optimizing the selection of units at different levels of 
  processing
- pronunciation modeling for morphologically-rich languages
- language modeling for morphologically-rich languages
- morphologically-rich languages in speech synthesis
- novel probability estimation techniques that avoid data sparseness 
  problems
- creating data resources and annotation tools for morphologically-rich 
  languages

Submission procedure:  Prospective authors should prepare manuscripts 
according to the information available at
