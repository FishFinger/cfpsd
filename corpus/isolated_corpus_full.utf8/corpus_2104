Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description

This workshop is a sequel to the workshop Descriptive and Explanatory
Adequacy in Linguistic Theory (DEAL) held in Berlin in December 2005. The
call for that workshop noted that current generative theories differ in the
restrictiveness of the generator. In Optimality Theory (OT) the generator
is rather unconstrained and consists of linguistic operations subject to
'very general considerations of structural well-formedness' (McCarthy and
Prince 1993), whereas the proponents of the Minimalist Program (MP)
normally maintain that the operations of the generator are highly
restricted. This difference between OT and MP is also reflected in the
claims that are normally made about the output of the generator. In OT, it
is normally maintained that the generator creates a candidate set that is
very large (even infinite), whereas in MP, it is normally claimed that the
resulting reference set is small, in many cases perhaps restricted to a
single candidate. Important is, however, that many proponents of MP accept
the idea that the generator may overgenerate and that we must assume some
additional means to filter out the unwanted structures from the reference
set. In this workshop we focus on the filtering devices that are or can be
used. 

Interface theories: the filtering of the output of the generator (DEAL II)
Reminder deadline for abstract submission. 

The Leiden University Center for Linguistics (the Netherlands) and  the
Linguistics department the University of Bielsefeld Potsdam (Germany) invite
abstracts for the workshop 'Interface theories: the filtering of the output of
the generator (DEAL II)', which will  take place at Leiden University, February
2008, 22-23. The deadline for abstract submission is:

November 15, 2007

Meeting Description

Sixth International Workshop on Writing Systems
Typology of Writing Systems
Braunschweig (Germany), September 18 - 19, 2008 

Call for Participation

Typology of Writing Systems

Sixth International Workshop on Writing Systems

German Department, University of Braunschweig (Germany), September 18 -
September 19, 2008.

This workshop offers a forum of discussion between researchers from different
fields of research on writing (e.g. theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics,
applied linguistics, computational linguistics), from different countries and
working on different languages. Its predecessors took place at the Max Planck
Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen (Netherlands) with a focus on 'What
Spelling Changes' (1997), 'Writing Language' (2000), and 'Constraints on
Spelling Changes' (2006), in Cologne (Germany) on the topic 'From Letter to
Sound' (2002), and in Antwerp (Belgium) focusing on 'Mapping Graphemes onto
Phonemes' (2004). See the website of the Association of Written Language and
Literacy for further information:	 http://www2.ru.nl/WrittenLanguage.

The aim of this series of workshops is to focus on various aspects of scientific
research of written language. In particular, we welcome submissions addressing:
-- theoretical approaches that try to capture the systematic character of one
specific writing system or of different writing systems in comparison.
-- psycholinguistic research on the influence of deep or more surface
orthographies on pronunciation and morphological awareness, on learning to read
and spell, and on dysfunctions in reading and spelling.
-- research evaluating alternative spelling methods, within one language, or
across languages, taking not only the perspective of the writer, but also
addressing the question how (different) writing systems take the reader's
perspective into account when representing the sounds of a language.
-- computational models that shed light on the relation between sounds on the
one hand, and letters, graphemes, diacritics and punctuation on the other hand.

The topic of the present workshop, Typology of Writing Systems, is related to
one of the central aims of the Association of Written Language and Literacy,
namely to enhance our understanding of similarities and differences among the
many writing systems that are used throughout the world. Therefore we are
especially interested in typological approaches that may stem from different
research backgrounds like theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, or
computational linguistics.
 
Submission deadline: May 2, 2008
Notice of acceptance: June 2, 2008

A selection of papers of the workshop will be published as special issue of the
journal 'Written Language and Literacy'. 

Invited Speakers: William J. Poser (University of British Columbia and Yinka
Dene Language Institute, Canada) and Rebecca Treiman (Washington University in
St. Louis, USA)

Scientific Committee: Susanne Borgwaldt and Martin Neef (German Department,
University of Braunschweig), Anneke Neijt (Radboud University Nijmegen),
Beatrice Primus (German Department, University of Cologne), and Dominiek Sandra
(Centre for Psycholinguistics, University of Antwerp).

Format of Submissions: Authors should submit abstracts of max. 1 page. Speakers
will have 30 minutes for their presentation, and 15 minutes for discussion and
questions. Please submit abstracts electronically (rtf, pdf or Word) to Susanne
Borgwaldt at s.borgwaldt@tu-bs.de.

Participation: Researchers who want to attend the workshop without presenting a
paper are also invited. Such participants should register at the address above,
s.borgwaldt@tu-bs.de. Information on lodging and travel directions, as well as a
program with the abstracts of the accepted papers will be circulated
electronically well before the workshop.

Further Information: Martin Neef: Martin.Neef@tu-bs.de

Local Organizing Committee: Susanne Borgwaldt, Torsten Fiebig, Iris Forster,
Tobias Heinz and Martin Neef.
