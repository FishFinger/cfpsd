Meeting Description:

8th International Roundtable for the Semiotics of Law (IRSL 2009)
(2-5 December 2009)

Transparency, Control and Power: Issues In Legal Semiotics

Convenor: Vijay K. Bhatia

Conference Venue: Department of English, City University of Hong Kong. 

Call for Papers

The overall aim of a State is to protect the social order in which the
individual liberty of the citizen is a major concern. As a consequence the State
should guarantee simultaneously and paradoxically a high level of individual
freedom and an order in which such freedom is made possible and guaranteed.

The 8th International Roundtables for the Semiotics of Law invites contributors
to reflect on the growing importance of Transparency, Control and Power in our
international community and how these main ideas have been examined over the
years. Contributors may choose to explore semiotic, rhetorical, pragmatic,
sociolinguistic, psychological, philosophical and/or visual perspectives on
Transparency, Control and Power.

Papers which examine the ways 'actors' in our society (legislators, politicians,
activists, movie producers, singers, painters, graffiti artists, photographers
etc.) have provoked public discourse to confront Transparency, Control and Power
are particularly welcome. 

The Roundtable will provide an opportunity for a general discussion of issues in
the semiotics of law as well as open discussions to increase our knowledge about
our Transparency, Control and Power with respect to Legal Semiotics. 
In the interest of a cohesive roundtable, prospective participants are requested
to adhere to the theme as outlined in the call for papers.

Proposals in either English or French (max 300 words) should be sent by e-mail
by the 1st of May 2009 to Vijay K. Bhatia at enbhatia@cityu.edu.hk and to Anne
Wagner at valwagnerfr@yahoo.com

Selected papers will be published in a special annual issue of the International
Journal for the Semiotics of Law (http://www.springer.com/law/journal/11196).

Call Deadline: 24-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 16th Annual University of Texas at Arlington Student Conference in
Linguistics and TESOL, March 5 and 6, 2009.

The UTASCILT is a student-run conference in Arlington, TX that provides student
scholars and their colleagues the opportunity to present and share their
linguistic and TESOL research with the larger linguistic community. Students
from all institutions with research in either Linguistics or TESOL are
encouraged to submit an abstract. 

Call for Papers

Call Deadline: now 24-October-08 Papers for this conference are invited in all
areas of linguistics, including the area of TESOL and the area of endangered
languages. Our keynote speaker will be Dr. Colleen Fitzgerald. Dr. Fitzgerald is
the Chair and Associate Professor of Linguistics at University of Texas at
Arlington, and has her Master of Arts and Ph.D. in Linguistics from the
University of Arizona. Her work includes phonological research on the Tohono
O'odham language, and most recently she has been working on documentation and
revitalization of the language, using unpublished archival materials and legacy
recordings. This recent research will drive her keynote lecture, entitled
''Language Activism and Revitalization in the Tohono O'odham Community.''  

Students from any educational institution are strongly encouraged to submit
their research and share insights they have discovered in the field. Presenters
can choose between oral and poster presentations. Oral presentations will last
20 minutes with 5 minutes for discussion and questions. An allotment of time
will be set aside for poster presentations and discussion. This is a great
opportunity to develop professional skills! The three best presentations will be
awarded the Yumi Nakamura Memorial Prize in Linguistics (up to $400.00 USD).
Poster and oral presentations are considered, accepted, and judged as equal
counterparts. 

The deadline for submission of abstracts is Friday, October 24, 2008.
Notifications of acceptance will be distributed in mid November, 2008. Abstracts
should be written on a single page (500 words or less) in Times New Roman, font
12, with one additional page for graphs and/or references. Electronic
submissions are preferred and the text of the e-mail (or title page) should include:

1) your name, 2) affiliation, 3) address, phone number, e-mail address, 4) title
of paper, and 
5) type of presentation: oral or poster.  
Please do not include your name on the abstract pages.  

Abstracts should be sent as an attachment in MS Word to utascil@ling.uta.edu.
Please do not submit using an .html or PDF format, as we will need to format the
abstract for inclusion in the abstract booklet. If you use fonts or symbols that
are unusual, please submit both MS Word and PDF, and we will make sure the
correct symbols appear. Late submissions will not be accepted.
