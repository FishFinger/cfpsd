Meeting Description:

Thirteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference
July 4-6, 2008
University of Sydney, Australia

The 13th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be hosted by the University of Sydney from July 4th to 6th 2008. This LFG conference is one in a series of linguistics conferences, and will be followed by the Australian Linguistics Institute (http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/).

LFG 2008 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical-Functional Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the 'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel, constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and collaboration among researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple levels of structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the following sites:
http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/
http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/lfg/ 

Call for Papers

Conference website: http://escholarship.library.usyd.edu.au/conferences/index.php/LingFest2008/LFG/
Conference e-mail (not for abstract submission): lfg08 ''at'' arts.usyd.edu.au

Abstract submission receipt deadline: 15 February 2008
Submissions should be submitted using the online submission system at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=LFG08

The 13th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be
hosted by the University of Sydney from July 4th to 6th 2008 as part of LingFest 2008 (http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/). Some neighboring events that might be of interest include:

- The 15th annual meeting of the Austronesian Formal Linguistics Association from June 30th to July 2nd. More details are available at http://escholarship.library.usyd.edu.au/conferences/index.php/LingFest2008/AFLA/.

- A workshop on 'Morphosyntactic aspects of instruments and instrumentals' on July 3rd. More information can be found at http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~donohue/instruments08/


Submissions: Talks and Posters
The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15 min. discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions can focus on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Presentations should describe original, unpublished work.


Dissertation Session
As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will give students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other student research dissertations). The dissertations must be completed by the time of the conference, and they should be made publicly accessible (e.g., on the World Wide Web).  The talks in this session should provide an overview of the main original points of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute discussion period. The International LFG Association (ILFGA) will pay the conference fees for the students presenting at the student session. 

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to student submissions.


Timetable
Deadline for abstracts: 15 February 2008
Acceptances sent out: 31 March 2008
Conference: July 4-6 2008


Submission Specifications
Abstracts for talks, posters/demonstrations and the dissertation session
must be received by February 15, 2008. All abstracts should be submitted
using the online submission system. Submissions should be in the form of
abstracts only. Abstracts can be up to two A4 pages in 10pt or larger
type and should include a title. Omit name and affiliation, and obvious
self-reference.  Note: we no longer ask for a separate page for data and
figures (c-/f- and related structures). They can be included in the text
of the abstract, obeying the overall two-page limit. Please submit your
abstract in .pdf or .doc format. If you have any trouble converting your
file into any of these formats, please contact the Program Committee at
the address below.

Each individual may be the single author on only one submission and the
first author on at most two submissions; however, s/he may be a
co-author on any number of submissions.

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people. Papers will appear in the proceedings, which will be published online by CSLI Publications.  Selected papers may also appear in a printed volume published by CSLI Publications.


Organisers and Their Contact Addresses
If you have queries about abstract submission or have problems using the
EasyChair submission system, please contact the Program Committee.
