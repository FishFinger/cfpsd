Call Deadline: 12-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

Continuing a successful series of annual BioNLP workshops at ACL and NAACL
starting in 2002, and in accordance with the ACL SIGBIOMED (www.sigbiomed.org)
tradition of presenting work on a broad range of topics, we invite submissions
on any topic of current interest in the field of Biomedical Natural Language
Processing. 

Call for Papers

BIONLP 2009
A NAACL HLT 2009 Workshop
Boulder, CO June 4-5, 2009
Workshop submissions due: March 12, 2009, 11:59 PM Eastern US
Workshop web site: http://compbio.uchsc.edu/BioNLP2009/index.shtml

We especially encourage submissions on:
- Entity identification and normalization for a broad range of semantic categories
- Ontologies and knowledge bases in BioNLP
- Extraction of complex relations
- The economics of text mining and database curation
- Processing of various text and document types (clinical narrative, gray
literature,  blogs, email)
- Resources and novel strategies for system testing and evaluation
- Shared tasks in the biomedical domain
- Test suites and corpora for BioNLP
- Quantifying utility to end-users
- Portability for non-developers
- Summarization
- Question-answering
- Full text and figures
- Practical applications of NLP in the biomedical domain

For the first time, there will be a shared task associated with this year's
BioNLP meeting.  Results of this shared task on bio-event extraction will be
presented during the second day of the BioNLP09 workshop. Information on the
shared task is available at http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/.

Important Dates:
Submission deadline: Thursday, March 12, 2009
Notification of acceptance: Monday, April 6, 2009
Camera-ready copy due from authors: Monday, April 20, 2009
Workshop: June 4, 2009
Shared task presentations: June 5, 2009

Submission Instructions:
Two types of submissions are invited: full papers and poster abstracts.
Submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST on March 12, 2009. Submit your
paper or abstract via the NAACL HLT BioNLP 2009 site at
https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/BioNLP2009/.  Note that the review of
papers on the shared task will be handled separately, by the task organizers.

Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages of text and one page of
references. These are intended to be reports of original research.  BioNLP aims
to be the forum for interesting, innovative, and promising work involving
biomedicine and language technology, whether or not yielding high performance at
the moment. This by no means precludes our interest in and preference for mature
results, strong performance, and thorough evaluation. Both types of research and
combinations thereof are encouraged.

Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages. Accepted abstracts will be
published in a separate section of the workshop proceedings. Appropriate poster
topics include preliminary results, application notes, descriptions of work in
progress, etc.

Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format, and should follow the
two-column format of ACL proceedings. Ensure that you are *not* in A4 format.
Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting specifications.
Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files
available on the NAACL HLT meeting website
(http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html). 
Submissions need not be anonymous. Authors who cannot submit a PDF file
electronically should contact the workshop organizers well in advance of the
submission deadline.

Dual submission policy: note that papers may not be submitted to the BioNLP 2009
workshop if they are or will be concurrently submitted to another meeting or
publication and that other meeting or publication prohibits dual submissions. If
your paper is also submitted to ISMB or AMIA, you should expect it to be
rejected by ISMB and AMIA. If your paper is or will be concurrently under
consideration by another meeting or publication, notify us of that fact in a
footnote on the first page. Do not dual-submit your BioNLP 2009 workshop paper
to ISMB or AMIA.
