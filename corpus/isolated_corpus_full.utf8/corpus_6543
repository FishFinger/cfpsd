Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

Let me kindly inform you that the 5th International Conference on Software and Data Technologies (ICSOFT 2010) is accepting paper submissions until next February 01 in any of its main topic areas:
 - Enterprise Software Technology
 - Software Engineering
 - Distributed Systems
 - Data Management
 - Knowledge-Based Systems

ICSOFT 2010 will be held in Athens (Greece) next July 22-24. The yearly meeting place of top researchers and practitioners in Software Engineering, Data Management, and applications related to Information Technologies, ICSOFT is now one of the most significant conferences in its area, providing a forum for top researchers from all over the world to come and present their work.

The conference proceedings will be indexed by major international indexers namely, Thomson Reuters - Conference Proceedings Citation Index, INSPEC, DBLP and EI (awaiting confirmation of indexation from the last one). 

The conference has a double-blind review process and after a strict selection procedure all accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings under an ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support. Extended versions of the best papers of the conference will be published in a book, by Springer-Verlag.

All published papers will be also available at the INSTICC's Digital Library, which will be made available shortly.

The conference program will include a number of Keynote Lectures delivered by distinguished world-class researchers. Their names will be announced soon at the conference website.

Two prestigious awards (the "Best Paper Award" and the "Best Student Paper Award") will be announced during the conference. These awards, signs of excellence for their recipients, are selected from the set of outstanding full papers presented at the conference, based on the best combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation produced by the reviewers.

Workshops and special sessions are also invited. If you wish to propose a workshop or a special session, for example based on the results of a specific research project, please send a proposal to the ICSOFT secretariat. Workshop chairs and Special Session chairs will benefit from logistics support and other types of support, including secretariat and financial support, to facilitate the development of a valid idea.
