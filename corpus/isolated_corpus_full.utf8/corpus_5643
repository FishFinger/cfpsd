Full Title: Issues in Intercultural Communication 


Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis;General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2009 

Issues in Intercultural Communication is a multi-disciplinary journal
focusing on the analysis of communication within and between cultures. We
welcome papers written within the frameworks of the various social or human
sciences (including political science, psychology, sociology, discourse
analysis, linguistics, literary and cultural studies, education, etc.)
insofar as they deal with discourse within and across different cultures. 

The focus of the journal is on empirical studies, although theoretical
expositions may also be accepted if appropriate. We currently have a short
backlog of submissions in process, so appropriate submissions will be dealt
with promptly.

Review process
Manuscripts considered for publication will be sent out for peer review,
which will focus on relevance to the field, appropriate use of method and
data, innovative use of framework and experimental design, and addition to
the general knowledge base of the field.

Manuscripts will be considered for publication with the understanding that
they have been submitted only to Issues in Intercultural Communication and
that all pertinent sources of funding and information have been credited
appropriately. Issues in Intercultural Communication will not consider
articles that are currently submitted for review or have been published
elsewhere.

Manuscript format requirements
All manuscripts must be word-processed, double-spaced throughout (including
abstracts, references lists, endnotes, and material in tables). Issues in
Intercultural Communication follows the style of the Publications Manual of
the American Psychological Association (5th edition) and manuscripts must
conform to this style to be considered for inclusion. Manuscripts should be
in a common 12 point font (e.g. Times or Time New Roman). Title pages
should include for each author his or her preferred academic or
professional affiliation. 

If the paper was presented at a meeting, the acknowledgment note should
give the title of the meeting, the name of the sponsoring organization, the
exact date(s) of the presentation, and the city in which the meeting was
held. Tables and figures adapted or reprinted from other sources require
permission from the publisher of the original source. All manuscripts
should be accompanied by an abstract of 100 to 120 words and 6-10 keywords.

Please email submissions in both Microsoft Word (.doc) and .pdf formats to
Associate Editor, Dr. Elizabeth Grace Winkler: iic@indiana.edu
