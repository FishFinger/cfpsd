In order to promote the studies on "derivation by phase" proposed by
Professor Noam Chomsky (2001, 2004, 2005 and 2006) and to present new
achievements by colleagues worldwide, the Research Group of Language and
Cognition in Beijing Language and Culture University is now editing a paper
collection for publication in 2008. The collection welcomes papers related
to topics on "Derivation by Phase". Invited topics include DP and CP
parallelism, Issues on v*P and CP, Agreement, EF movement, Feature
Valuation, and other topics on phases. Papers on issues of interfaces are
also welcome. Submissions are accepted in English only. We accept
electronic submissions in Word format or PDF format. 
Deadline: March 29th, 2008.
