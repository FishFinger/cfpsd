Meeting Description
The focus of 'Dialogue Under Occupation' is the ongoing exploration of dialogue
and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occupation. Dialogue is
intended in the sense that understanding of differing perspectives comes through
dialogue. Discourse refers to the types of talk that the various stakeholders
involved in occupation engage in (e.g., political discourse, media discourse,
public discourse).

The goal of the conference is to provide a venue to maximize the investigation
and application of differing perspectives (i.e., the dialogue or discourse of
the occupied, the dialogue or discourse of the occupiers, or the interaction
between opposing sides), and to actively promote greater understanding of the
ideologies, issues, concerns, etc. of individuals affected by occupation in its
various dimensions. 

2nd Call for Papers -- Dialogue Under Occupation: DUO II

November 14-16, 2007 at Al-Quds University, Jerusalem

Description 
As we intend this conference to be interdisciplinary, we invite scholars from
various disciplines to submit papers that address the use of dialogue in the
creation, maintenance, resistance, and resolution of occupation.

Multidisciplinary approaches and models of dialogue analysis such as Dialogue
Grammar, Discourse Analysis, Critical Discourse Studies, Multi-modal Discourse
Analysis, Conversational Analysis, Social Constructionism, etc., are welcomed.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
