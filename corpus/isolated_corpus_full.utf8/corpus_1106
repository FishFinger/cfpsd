Meeting Description:

Deadline Extension

The one-day conference on 'Spec and Head/ Spec or Head?' as part of the
1st LISSIM will be held on April 9, 2007, in Kausani, India. Abstracts not
exceeding 500 words including data are invited on this general theme
by February 24th, 2007. As LISSIM proposes to examine the role of head/ phrasal
movement in pre-Minimalist frameworks and the Minimalist Program, abstracts
highlighting this aspect of the status of specs and heads are particularly welcome.

As we expect to get some more single/ double rooms at the conference venue, the
deadline for participation in the Linguistics Spring School in the
Indian Mountains (LISSIM) has also been extended to February 24th, 2007,
however, early submissions are encouraged.

For details regarding the Spring School (LISSIM), visit
http://fosssil.edublogs.org/.

Address for abstracts and application to participate in the school:
fosssil06@gmail.com 

FOSSSIL announces the 1st LISSIM to take place in Kausani March 26th to April
9th, in the lap of the Kumaun Hills, India. Overlooking the highest peak on the
Indian side, Nanda Devi, and several other peaks including the famous, Trishul,
the Spring School venue is ideal for communal leaving and learning, devoid of
the usual distractions of a city, town or even a touristy hill station. 

The 1st LISSIM will empirically examine the status of pre-Minimalist themes in
the Minimalist program, like Remnant Movement, Head versus Phrasal Movement,
Topic and Focus effects as a result of movement, among others. The last day of
the School will be devoted to a day-long conference on the topic ''Spec and
Head/ Spec or Head?'' 

The teaching will consist of the following faculty who are established experts
in the above topics: 

- Ian Roberts, University of Cambridge 
- KA Jayaseelan, CIEFL, Hyderabad (retd.) 
- Anders Holmberg, University of Newcastle upon Tyne 
- Nomi Erteschik-Shir, Ben Gurion University 
- Anoop Mahajan, UCLA (not confirmed) 

All prospective students for the spring school, are requested to send an email
to fosssil06@gmail.com with the following information latest by 10th February 2007: 
name: 
email: 
affiliation: 
qualification in linguistics: 
PhD/research topic: 
reason for participating in LISSIM: (max 500 words) 

Those wishing to present a paper in the conference on the 9th in addition to
participating in the School, are requested to send by email an abstract with
their application not exceeding 500 words on the status of specifiers and heads
in the Minimalist Program, with specific attention to the possibility or
impossibility of reduction of one to the other.
