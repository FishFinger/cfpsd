Call for Papers

Association for Linguistic Typology 8th Biennial Meeting   (ALT8)
Typology and the study of language: Comparative grammar and beyond
 
University of California, Berkeley
July 23-26, 2009
Website: http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/alt8
 
Abstracts on any topic in typology are invited for 20-minute papers, posters,
and possibly a limited number of workshops. Non-members of ALT may submit
abstracts but will be expected to join ALT in order to present a paper at the
meeting.
ALT website: http://www.linguistic-typology.org/
 
Deadline for receipt of abstracts: January 12, 2009
Notification by Monday, March 2.  

The Program Committee has taken into consideration the consensus of the 2007
meeting: three simultaneous sessions is the maximum we can handle; conference
workdays should not be uncomfortably long or without breaks; members submitting
abstracts should be able to be confident that a good abstract will be accepted
(i.e. the acceptance rate should  not be too low); standards should be stringent
enough that only good abstracts are accepted; workshops during the conference
sessions should be limited in number and their presentations should strictly
adhere to the timing and quality constraints on regular papers.    

For more on workshops, see below

How to submit an abstract:
- One individual may be involved in a maximum of two papers (maximum of one as
sole author). A workshop presentation by one person counts as a single-author paper.
- Send your abstract as an email attachment to: alt8@berkeley.edu
Subject header: (your last name) alt8 abstract e.g: hyman alt8  abstract
(If you have a common last name, it's helpful to us if you also include an
initial:	e.g.  jnichols alt8 abstract.)
- Include these things in the body of the email:
Author's name(s)
Abstract title

For workshops: title of workshop and authors and titles of all workshop papers
Contact information: email, phone, fax

Abstract Specifications:
- Maximum length:  500 words or 1 single-spaced page
- Abstracts and papers should be in English.
- Put this information at the top of your abstract:
The title.
Category: oral; poster; either oral or poster; TPI poster (see below)
Format: If at all possible, please send your abstract as a pdf.
- Anonymity: Abstracts must be anonymous. Do not put your name or other
identifying information on the abstract.  Also, please anonymise your pdf by
removing identifying information. In general this can be done by using the
following two pull-down menus:
File > document properties > description (remove name of author)
View > comments (though an abstract is unlikely to have comments, check this and
remove any comments, as they will show your username)
View >  review tracker (ditto)
If it's your own copy of the software, you might also check:
Acrobat > preferences > identity (to keep your identity off of this and other
pdf's, leave all the fields blank)
- Give your pdf a filename similar to the subject header, e.g.:
hyman_alt8_abstract.pdf

Categories of Submission:
Individual oral presentations (single or multiple author):
20 minutes +10 minutes for discussion.

Posters:
One or more poster sessions will be organized, depending on demand.
Oral or poster. This means you prefer an oral presentation but can also do a
poster. If there are more good abstracts than we can accommodate, the Program
Committee will schedule some as posters.

If you choose either category "poster" or "oral or poster" you will increase
your chances of acceptance.

Workshops. 
Both the sense of the 2007 meeting and the realities of competition for rooms
during the busy UC Berkeley summer session dictate that we have very few
workshops during ALT 8. (A workshop is a thematically unified organized session
held at the same time as other sessions.)  We will probably schedule all
workshops during the same time, likely Sunday afternoon, July 26. Please note
the following policies:

Each workshop presenter sends in an abstract for their presentation. The
workshop organizer also sends in an abstract for the workshop, about half a page
to a page in length. (Workshop organizers can collect the individual abstracts
and attach them all to a single submission email, or have their presenters send
in their own individual abstracts. Either way is OK.)

Each abstract will be reviewed in the same way as non-workshop individual
papers, and will be individually accepted or not. The whole workshop abstract
will also be competitively reviewed. If all the individual abstracts and the
workshop abstract are accepted, the workshop will be scheduled as a workshop. If
not, the accepted papers will be scheduled as regular individual presentations
(and may be scheduled together, as we will aim for thematic unity of conference
sessions where possible). In the case of a close call (e.g. a workshop with all
but one presentation accepted; all presentations accepted but workshop proposal
not accepted; etc.) the Program Committee will try to resolve things in as
member-friendly a way as possible.

Maximum number of papers per workshop: 6 (or 5 if the introduction is more than
a few sentences). A workshop must fit into a 3-hour time slot.

TPI Posters: 
Typology and public interest. Meeting on a large busy campus during the LSA
Institute and the general Summer Session gives typologists an opportunity to
communicate to non-typologists and non-linguistics why and how typology is
interesting and what important discoveries are being made in typology. 
Therefore we plan to schedule an over-quota TPI poster and if possible a
competition to pick the posters (TPI and other) that do the best job of
communicating the interest of typology and/or typological phenomena of interest,
and display the winners for a longer time in a prominent display cabinet in one
of the important campus buildings. By "over quota" we mean that TPI posters can
be a second single-author abstract. With this TPI poster session and competition
we hope to inspire members to mobilize their graphic, communicative, and
analytic skills to produce compelling posters on such topics as:

Typological rarities and other phenomena of interest, previously published or
not. These might include findings from recent fieldwork for which you have a
squib-like presentation, phenomena noted in published literature, proposed
correlations, etc.

Public communications making clear in not-too-technical terms the interest of
something you have already published or are publishing (or e.g. presenting at
this conference).
Examples of best practice in typological work
Demonstrations of software and its applications
Teaching materials, curriculum, etc.

Meeting Description:

The research team of the project "Indo-European Case and Argument Structure from
a Typological Perspective" (IECASTP) (http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP) is organizing
a workshop at the XIXth International Conference on Historical Linguistics
(10-15 August 2009, Nijmegen, http://www.ru.nl/cls/ichl19/), devoted on the
origin of non-canonical subject marking in Indo-European.

The URL of the workshop is: http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP/Workshop5.htm 


Call for Papers

Invited speaker: Leonid Kulikov (University of Leiden)

Please send a 300-word abstract in pdf format to Ilja Serzants
(Ilja.Serzants@uib.no) no later than January 10th. Notification of acceptance
will be sent out no later than January 25th. The abstract also has to be
submitted through the main conference website at the same time.

Several of the Modern Indo-European languages that have maintained morphological
case exhibit structures where the subject(-like) argument is not canonically
case marked. These are found amongst the Modern Germanic languages, Modern
Russian, the Modern Baltic languages and the Modern Indo-Aryan languages, to
mention some. It is traditionally assumed in the literature that these have
developed from objects to subjects (see, for instance, Hewson and Bubenik 2006),
hence the case marking. Recently, however, it has been argued for Germanic that
oblique subjects in the modern languages were syntactic subjects already in Old
Germanic (Eythórsson and Barðdal 2005). This raises the question whether these
non-canonically case-marked subject(-like) arguments were objects in
Proto-Germanic or Proto-Indo-European, or whether they may have been syntactic
subjects all along, given an assumption of the alignment system in
Proto-Indo-European being a Fluid-S system (cf. Barðdal and Eythórsson 2008). It
is, moreover, possible that the case marking patterns of different predicate
types have different origins in Indo-European. The aim of this workshop is
therefore to gather researchers who work on case marking in Indo-European, and
case marking in general, to a forum where the more general topic of the origin
of this non-canonical case marking can be discussed. By doing that, we hope to
shed light on this important issue within case marking and alignment, historical
linguistics, and Indo-European studies.
