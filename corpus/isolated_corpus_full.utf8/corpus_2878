Call for Participation
VideoCLEF2008
http://ilps.science.uva.nl/Vid2RSS/

VideoCLEF is a new track for CLEF 2008. This track aims to develop and
evaluate tasks in processing video content in a multilingual environment.

The VideoCLEF track for 2008 is centered on the Vid2RSS2008 task. This
comprises a number of subtasks including topic classification performed on
dual language videos. The longer term overall objective of VideoCLEF is to
combine and extend these subtasks and perform completely automatic
generation of RSS feeds specific to a particular information need and
personalized to a particular language preference. The video data for
Vid2RSS2008 are Dutch television documentaries and contain Dutch as a
dominant language, but also contain a high proportion of spoken English
(i.e., interview guests often speak in English).

The main task for Vid2RSS2008 involves assigning topic class labels to
videos of television episodes. Speech recognition transcripts, metadata
records (containing title and description) and video keyframes (and shot
boundaries) for each episode are supplied. The output format is a set of
RSS-feeds, one for each topic class. The RSS-feeds are created by
concatenating the metadata records for the episodes assigned to a given
topic class. (The RSS-feed format is trivial to generate and is used as an
output format because it can be easily visualized in a feed aggregator.)

There is one mandatory task: classifying videos of television episodes
using speech transcripts only.

There are several optional tasks: classifying episodes using both
speech-transcripts and metadata (or potentially including visual content),
translation of content to generate feeds in English (or another language
of your choice), selection of keyframes to represent individual episodes,
and shot boundary and keyframe extraction from the video source.

The development data (10 episodes / ca. 6 hours) and sample classes will
be released at the end of March along with sample topic categories. The
test data (40 episodes /ca. 24 hours) will be released at end of April
with the test topic categories. The submission date for the task will be
set towards the end of June. The CLEF 2008 Workshop will be held on 17-19
September 2008 in Aarhus, Denmark, in conjunction with the 12th European
Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL 2008). More information about
Vid2RSS2008 is available at: http://ilps.science.uva.nl/Vid2RSS/.
Participants in VideoCLEF are required to register with CLEF. Registration
for CLEF 2008 is now open, full information about CLEF can be found at:
