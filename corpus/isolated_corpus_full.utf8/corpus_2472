the work's relevance to developments in the field; and may include a short
example to support the main point or argument. Conclusions should be stated,
however tentative.

Abstracts should be accessible to a wide audience, as they will be reviewed
by scholars from a variety of language-related fields, such as anthropology,

Meeting Description

Semantics and Pragmatics of Discourse Interpretation and Generation.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for presenting recent research
on constraints in discourse. The target areas include the recognition of
discourse structure as well as the interpretation and generation of discourse in
a broad variety of domains. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from
diverse formal approaches, including but not limited to:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
- Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
- Tree Adjoining Grammars
- Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
- The QUD Modell
- Plan Based Reasoning
- Abductive Reasoning
- Gricean Pragmatics
- Speech Act Theory

We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of the role of
constraints in discourse, as well as empirical studies that shed light on
their empirical validity. The conference is explicitly intended for discussion
and comparison of theoretical accounts that lay the ground for applications. It
is not intended as a platform for system demonstrations. Specific topics might
relate to:
 - Anaphora Resolution
 - Co-reference
 - Dialogical vs. Monological Discourse
 - Questions and Answers
 - Lexicon and Discourse Relations
 - Cognitive Modeling
 - Underspecification and Nonmonotonic Inferences
etc.

The organisers are planning to publish a book based on the contributions to
this workshop.

Publication (and workshop) language is English. 

Workshop on Constraints in Discourse
                                
http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org

This is the third in a series of workshops entitled ''Constraints in
Discourse''.

It is a linguistic commonplace to say that the meaning of text is more than the
conjunction of the meaning of its sentences. But what exactly are the rules that
govern its interpretation, and what are the constraints that define well-formed
discourse? For a long time, the development of precise frameworks of discourse
interpretation has been hampered by the lack of a deeper understanding of the
dependencies between different discourse units. Recent years have seen a
considerable advance in this field. A number of strong constraints have been
proposed that restrict the sequencing and attaching of segments at various
descriptive levels, as well as the interpretation of their interrelations. 

Invited Speakers

Laurence Danlos, Universite Paris 7
Julia Hirschberg, Columbia University
Paul Piwek, Open University
Bonnie Webber, U Edinburgh, UK

Paper Submission

Researchers interested in contributing a paper to the workshop are invited to
submit an abstract that spans not more than 3 pages in PDF or PS (single column,
10pt font size, A4 paper, including a bibliography) using the form at the
workshop website (http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org). Reviews will be done
blindly; the abstracts may accordingly not include explicit hints that
allow the identification of the authors (such as ''in paper (...) we show that'').

Important Dates

Conf: July 30th-August, 1st, 2008
Deadline for Submissions: April 25th, 2008
Notification of Acceptance: May 17th, 2008
