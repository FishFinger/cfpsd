Meeting Description

LREC 2008 workshop 'Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008)' 

Call for Evaluation Resources

LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008) 

endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of
multiword expressions (MWE), the development of algorithms for their automatic
extraction from corpora, and the automatic identification of additional
properties such as morphosyntactic preferences or the interpretation of
semi-compositional expressions.

It is difficult to compare results of the many published studies on MWEs and
obtain a broader perspective, though, because algorithms and implemented
systems have been evaluated on vastly different gold standards and corpora, in
different languages, for different subtypes of MWEs, etc. In order to make the
next big step forward, the field of MWE research needs a shared task in which
different approaches are applied to the same data sets, allowing completely new
insights to be gained. Since there is as yet not a clear and universally
accepted definition of multiword expressions, the first instalment of this
shared task will be of a more exploratory nature than the competitions that have
been carried out in other areas of computational linguistics.

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for collecting, sharing
and exploiting MWE evaluation resources. We solicit contributions of such
resources from the MWE community, in particular:

(1) manually annotated data sets (MWE candidates marked as true and false
positives, or as different subtypes of MWEs); 
(2) data sets of MWEs annotated with additional properties; and
(3) lists of known MWEs, e.g. from machine-readable dictionaries.

In addition, candidate data obtained from corpora with sophisticated
proprietary NLP tools may be of interest, helping researchers to apply their
statistical MWE identification techniques to a broad range of languages.

The contributed resources will be made available freely for research purposes
on multiword.sf.net, and should be accompanied by documentation (e.g.
annotation guidelines) on the SourceForge project wiki. Contributors will be
invited to submit a short paper (4 pages) describing their resource and
summarising previous research carried out on these data.

After collection of the resources, teams participating in the shared task can
evaluate their MWE extraction algorithms on multiple data sets and discuss
implications for their generalisability and further development. At the
workshop, the evaluation results of the different teams will be summarised and
compared. A call for papers and participation in the shared task is being
distributed separately.


Submission Information

If you are interested in contributing a MWE evaluation resource to our
initiative, please contact us by e-mail to make further arrangements.

If you have a SourceForge account, you will be able to upload the resource
yourself and document it on the project wiki.

Resource submission deadline: February 1, 2008
Paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
Notification of acceptance: March 28, 2008
Camera-ready papers due: April 4, 2008
Workshop date: June 1, 2008

Meeting Description

21st Canadian Conference for Artificial Intelligence - AI for the 21st Century 

21st Canadian AI - AI for the 21st Century

http://cs.uwindsor.ca/AI08

First Call for Papers

AI'08, the twenty-first Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, invites
papers that present original work in all areas of Artificial Intelligence. In
particular, papers that successfully apply historical AI techniques to modern
problem domains and recent techniques to historical problem settings are
encouraged. Topics include, but are not limited to

Agent Systems
AI applications
Knowledge Representation
Constraint Satisfaction
Automated Reasoning
Information Processing
Case-based reasoning
User Modeling
Uncertainty
Natural Language Processing
Web Applications
Data Mining
Bioinformatics
Games
Neural Nets
Smart Graphics
E-Commerce
Search
Planning

Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee members and judged  
according to their originality, technical merit and clarity of presentation.
Accepted papers are allocated a maximum of 12 pages in the proceedings. The
conference proceedings will be published as Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence by Springer and have to be formatted accordingly. Papers can only
be included in the proceedings upon registration of at least one author. Papers
submitted to AI'2008 must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be
under review for another conference. Best paper and best student paper awards
will be presented.

Full paper submission due January 15th, 2008 
Notification of acceptance February 26th, 2008
Final paper due March 15th, 2008

AI-08 is collocated with three cognate conferences, Graphics  
Interface, Computer & Robotic Vision, and Intelligent Systems.

General Chair: Howard Hamilton,  Regina University
Program Chair: Sabine Bergler, Concordia University
Graduate Symposium: Scott Buffett, NRC
Local arrangement Chairs: Ziad Kobti, Dan Wu,  University of Windsor

Please mark these dates in your calendar, we hope to receive your submissions
and see you at the conference!
