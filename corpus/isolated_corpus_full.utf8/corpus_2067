*********************************************************************
5th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2008)
http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/inlg2008/

June 12-14, 2008
Salt Fork, Ohio, USA

1st Call for Papers

*********************************************************************

The 5th International Natural Language Generation Conference (the
Biennial Meeting of the Special Interest Group in Natural Language
Generation SIGGEN) will be held June 12-14, 2008 in Salt Fork, Ohio, =
USA.

INLG is the leading international conference on research into natural
language generation. It has been held in Sydney, Australia in 2006
(http://www.ict.csiro.au/inlg2006/), at Brockenhurst, UK in 2004
(http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/inlg04/), in Harriman, NY, USA in 2002
(http://inlg02.cs.columbia.edu/), and in Mitzpe Ramon, Israel in 2000
(http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~nlg2000/). Prior to 2000, INLGs were
International Workshops, running every other year since 1984.  INLG
provides a forum for the discussion, dissemination and archiving of
research topics and results in the field of text generation.

INLG invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all
topics related to natural language generation. Active topics of interest
include:

* Applications of generation technology
* Architecture of generators
* Affect/emotion generation
* Content planning
* Discourse models (and pragmatic influences)
* Embodied generation
* Evaluation of NLG systems
* Generation and summarization
* Information organization for planning and NLG
* Lexicalization
* Multilingual NLG
* Multimedia or multimodal generation
* NLG for real-world applications
* NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks
* NLG workflows and architectures
* Referring expression generation
* Statistical processing for NLG
* Syntactic realization
* Use of ontologies in NLG


INLG will be held this year immediately prior to ACL:HLT 2008 (June
15-20), in Salt Fork, OH (about 2 hours from Columbus, OH, the site of
ACL:HLT 2008).  In addition to the INLG conference, there will be a
special session for the Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG
Challenge 2008).

Submission Information

Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2008 must not
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
proceedings. Submission to other conferences should be clearly indicated
on the paper.

Category of Papers: The conference will be organized as a 2.5 day
workshop, including sessions to present long papers, a special session
for discussing the Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG
Challenge 2008), and a poster session for short papers and REG Challenge
results.

Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time:

-  Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research
results and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references;

-  Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research
effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these
will be presented at posters during the poster session).


Special Session on Referring Expression Generation Challenge 2008 (REG
Challenge 2008).

The second Referring Expression Generation Challenge will involve two
different data sets: the TUNA Corpus (with previously unseen test data),
and the GREC Corpus of references to named entities in free text.  The
Challenge will have eight submission tracks, including attribute
selection, realisation and named entity generation tasks, as well as
open category and evaluation methods tracks.  Assessment criteria will
range from automatically computed metrics to human evaluation.  For the
TUNA tasks the criteria will include minimality, humanlikeness, and
identification/comprehension by human readers; those for the GREC task
will include humanlikeness and the DUC criteria of coherence and
referential clarity. Subject to feasibility, system processing
efficiency is another possible criterion.

The full preliminary announcement can be found here:

http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/REG-Challenge-2008.txt

A separate call for participation in the REG Challenge will be issued.
In the meantime, please contact Anja Belz and Albert Gatt at gre-stec
(at) itri.brighton.ac.uk for further information.


Important Dates

Submission of papers and posters:    Mar 14
Notification of acceptance:        Apr 25
Submission of camera-ready copy:    May 16
INLG 2008 in Salt Fork, OH:        Jun 12-14


Paper Submission: Submission will be electronic and the only accepted
format for submitted papers will be Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow
the two-column format of ACL proceedings (see the guidelines provided on
the ACL:HLT conference website).  More details on the submission process
to follow.


Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors
within the paper. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Note that in extreme cases, an author unable to comply with the above
submission procedure should contact the program chairs sufficiently
before the submission deadline so alternative arrangements can be made.
