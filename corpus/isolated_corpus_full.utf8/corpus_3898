Meeting Description:

Eye-to-IT Conference on Translation Processes, Sentence Processing, and the
Bilingual Mental Lexicon.
28-29 April, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark 

The EU FP6 Eye-to-IT project (2006-2009) has brought together psycholinguists,
neurolinguists, eye-tracking specialists, EEG specialists, translation scholars
and developers of translation tools. Jointly, they have explored the possibility
of developing a research application for studying translation processes
intensively and, in parallel with this, to develop a prototype gaze-based
support tool for translators. Now that the project is nearing its end, we invite
researchers with an interest in applying eye-tracking, keystroke logging and EEG
to the study of translation processes, and to language processes more generally,
to discuss the state of the art in the field. 

Plenary Speakers:

We are very proud to announce that the following eminent speakers have all
accepted to give plenary talks:

Dr. Marcel Bastiaansen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour ,
Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. (Neurolinguistics,
Neurocognition of Language Comprehension, EEG)

Dr. Cheryl Frenck-Mestre,  Laboratoire Parole et Langage, Université
Aix-Marseille, France. (Psycholinguistics, Sentence Processing, Bilingual Lexicon)

Dr. Jukka Hyönä, Department of Psychology, University of Turku, Finland. (Eye
Tracking and Reading)

Dr. Anthony Pym, Intercultural Studies Group, Universitat Rovira i Virgili,
Tarragona, Spain. (Translation Research)

Panel proposals - deadline: 23 January 2009

The organizing committee invites proposals for panels on the specific topics
addressed in the conference. Panel proposals on e.g sentence processing, the
bilingual lexicon, cognitive translation processes, eyetracking as a means of
exploring both continuous and discontinuous reading (as in translation),
eyetracking as a means of exploring comprehension processes and/or production
processes, EEG as a means of exploring language processes. Panels will focus on
a specific topic with a maximum of 5 x 20-minute papers plus half an hour for a
concluding discussion. In their proposal, workshop organisers should briefly
describe the panel topic and give the names, affiliation and e-mail addresses of
presenters, as well as the abstracts of individual papers.

Notification of acceptance/rejection of panel proposals:  9 February 2009

Abstract submission - deadline: 23 January 2009

We invite abstracts for paper (20-minute presentation + 10-minute discussion)
and poster presentations in all the areas of eyetracking, keystroke logging and
EEG applied to studying language processes or applied to developing language
technological tools to support language users. 

Abstracts should be in English and should not exceed 500 words. Mail to
mb.iadh@cbs.dk.

Notification of acceptance/rejection of abstracts/posters: 16 February 2009 

The conference can accommodate a maximum of 70 participants.

A conference webpage is at: www.cbs.dk/eyetoit
Participation is expected to cost around 150 euro, including coffees and
lunches. We hope to be able to sponsor participation fees for 10 or 12 PhD students.

The conference web page will carry details of the venue, programme,
registration, etc.
