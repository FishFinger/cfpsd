1ST WORKSHOP ON DEFINITION EXTRACTION
September 18, 2009
Borovets, Bulgaria

http://www.iling.unam.mx/wde


MOTIVATION:

Nowadays, the automatic extraction of definitions from textual data is a co=
mmon task in different domains of Natural Language Processing. Briefly, we =
can sketch two main research directions:

-The use of Definition Extraction (DE) as a methodological resource in area=
s such as Computational Semantic, Information Extraction, Text Mining, Onto=
logies, WEB Semantics or E-Learning.
-The conception of DE as a self-challenging task, particularity in Computat=
ional Lexicography and Terminology, toward the design and implementation of=
 electronic resources such as lexical knowledge bases, machine-readable dic=
tionaries, terminological databases, thesauri.  Such resources can be monol=
ingual or multilingual.

However, in contrast to the generalised use of DE in multiple domains, ther=
e is no specific forum for sharing information about methodologies, tools, =
evaluation techniques or applications related directly with DE.

We propose this 1st Workshop on Definition Extraction as such an exchange f=
orum, with the hope that this workshop could become an academic space to sh=
are and assess new methodologies, tools and techniques, in the spirit of pr=
omoting the DE as a consolidated research area.

TOPICS:

This workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss, both theoretical and =
practical views in DE. The following are examples of topics that are releva=
nt, but not exclusive, for the workshop:
.	Discussions, analysis, positions around the state of art on DE.
.	Concrete uses of resources obtained from DE in scientific or technical ar=
eas.
.	Original methodologies considering the use of symbolic and/or statistical=
 methods for the recognition and extraction of possible candidates of textu=
al definitions.
.	Comparisons between DE from structured (such as Wikipedia) and unstructur=
ed textual data.
.	Development of computational tools for extracting definitions from large =
corpora.
.	Concrete applications of DE within larger projects in Language Learning, =
Automated Reasoning, Text Mining, etc.
.	DE in multilingual environment.
TARGET AUDIENCE:

Lexicographers, terminographers, linguists, computational linguists, NLP co=
mmunity and those people interested in DE field.

TENTATIVE PROGRAM (1 FULL DAY):

1 Invited speaker (to be determined)
8-10 papers
4-5 software demonstrations

OFFICIAL LANGUAGE

The official language of the conference is English.


PAPER SUBMISSION PROCESS:

-Submission process will be independent for RANLP-2009: papers should be su=
bmitted to the e-mail address wde@iingen.unam.mx.
-However, all submissions should follow RANLP-2009 papers format (no longer=
 than 7 pages, including cover page, figures, tables and references).
-We also encourage the submission of demos, which should be no longer than =
5 pages.
-RANLP-2009 templates could be found in the following link.
-Papers will be reviewed using a blind peer review process by at least two =
members of the program committee.
-At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop, =
and all workshop participants must pay the RANLP-2009 workshop registration=
 fee.
