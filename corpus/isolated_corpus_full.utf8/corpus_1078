2nd Call for Papers - 30th Anniversary of the Child Language Seminar

Child Language Seminar
18-20 July 2007
University of Reading, England
 
We are pleased to announce that in 2007 the Child Language Seminar will take
place from 18-20 July 2007 at the University of Reading. It will be hosted by
the School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences and is being organised by
Theo Marinis & Vesna Stojanovik (Department of Clinical Language Sciences),
Carmel Houston-Price & Graham Schafer (Department of Psychology), and Brian
Richards (Institute of Education).
 
New Information - Thematic sessions, proceedings:

To mark the 30th Anniversary of the CLS, this year we have added a half-day (18
July) with two thematic sessions, while keeping the remaining two days (19-20
July) open to all avenues of research on child language development. The
thematic sessions will be on topics related to the keynote papers. The exact
topics of the thematic sessions will be decided on the basis of the abstracts we
will receive.

To commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the conference, we will publish the
proceedings of this year's CLS on a CD-ROM and on the web-site of the University
of Reading.

This year's keynote speakers are:
 
Anne Baker & Jan de Jong
Department of Language and Literature
Universiteit van Amsterdam
 
Dorothy Bishop
Department of Experimental Psychology
University of Oxford
 
Philip Dale
Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences
The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque
 
Catherine Snow
Harvard Graduate School of Education
Harvard University

The CLS is an interdisciplinary conference attracting a diverse audience of
among others psychologists, linguists and speech and language therapists, and
provides a forum for research on first and second language acquisition in
typically and atypically developing children. It was first held in 1977, so in
2007 it will be the 30th Anniversary of the CLS. 

The University of Reading is one of the top 20 most research-intensive
universities in the UK, and has a long tradition of research in language
development. The School of Psychology & Clinical Language Science was
established in 2005 when the Clinical Linguistics section moved to the School of
Psychology. The School is set on one of the most beautiful campuses in the UK,
with 320 acres of landscaped grounds surrounded by green open spaces, lakes and
wildlife. 
 
Reading is the county town of the Royal County of Berkshire and is located in
the heart of the beautiful Thames Valley some 50 kilometres west of London. The
city is easily accessible by air (30 minutes to Heathrow airport via frequent
bus service to Reading station, and 75 minutes to Gatwick airport through a
direct rail connection) and by rail (25 minutes from London Paddington). The M4
motorway provides ready access to London, Wales and the South West and there is
an express coach service to London which also stops outside the main gate of the
University. 
 
Proposals are invited for papers and posters on any topic related to child
language development and disorders. 
 
Submission deadline is 1 March 2007
