Platforms for Natural Language Processing
Special Issue of Traitement Automatique des Langues (TAL)
http://www.atala.org/

Because there is no agreed 'integrated' model of language processing,
researchers often produce ad hoc and application-specific solutions, while
NLP platforms help by bringing components together and making them
interoperable. Due to the complex nature of NLP applications -- and
language itself -- one needs to mix in the same process different models,
resources and algorithms, leading to important problems of interoperability
and data exchange.
 
1)   Architectural issues
Bringing together different modules raises many architectural and technical
questions, centered around interoperability and data exchange, such as:
-  interoperability between representation formats of corpora, linguistic
resources, documents and annotations; standardisation;
-  technical compatibility of heterogeneous algorithms and data:
portability, availability, maintainability, etc;
-  graphical user interfaces supporting computer scientists and/or
linguists to assemble sets of 'components' and to visualise and debug the
results of their application to corpora;
-  multimodality and multilinguism;
-  software execution models: pipeline, agent-based architectures,
distributed web services, etc; scalability (massive data, simultaneous
on-line users?);
 
2)   Methodological issues
The scientific approach which consists in projecting a certain linguistic
model - or a set of models -- on the same data or corpora also raises
interesting questions:
-   formalisation: which formalisms are appropriate for the various levels
of linguistic analysis? How can they be made interoperable? What should be
considered first: the expressivity of a formalism or the complexity of the
associated algorithms?
-   descriptive power: how can we ensure the declarative nature of NLP
processes, from linguistic rules to the specification of process chaining?
Is it possible to have a convergence of descriptive and prescriptive models?
-   repeatability: how to ensure that an experiment, based on complex
algorithms, can be reproduced? How to share and capitalize on operational
models and resources?
-   modularity: how to make a complex process independent of the choice of
a particular component for a particular task? Reuse and adaptation of
resources and components; support for multiple annotations;
-   evaluation of composite processes;
-   theoretical productivity: by bringing together different 'local'
models can we study new linguistic phenomena, at a higher complexity level?
 
Presentation of concrete experiments embedding NLP platforms into
application-oriented software systems (human-machine interfaces,
information retrieval and extraction, terminology/ontology constitution,
automated translation?) is warmly encouraged. Description of specific NLP
platforms is also welcome, and authors should then clearly explain the
underlying principles and hypotheses, in order to contribute to the general
discussion.
