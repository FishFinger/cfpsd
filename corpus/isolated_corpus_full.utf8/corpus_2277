Meeting Description

With the language learner at the very centre, human and material resources are
two key elements that make up the language learning process. 

Regarding material resources, nowadays new technologies can be said to play a
leading role in most language learning environments. However, we cannot forget
that these relatively new tools still coexist with more traditional ones which
are still widely used in the foreign language classroom. On the other hand, the
progressive emergence of new 'human roles' in language learning means that human
resources have also become a key medium through which the learner accesses
knowledge and practice towards language acquisition.

Within this context, there is an obvious need to carry out research on these
resources in order to assess their potential for an optimum learning experience.


Invited Speakers

Dr. Phil Benson (The Hong Kong Institute of Education, China):
Autonomy in Language Teaching and Learning: Where Has It Come from and Where Is
It Going?

Dr. Inmaculada Fortanet Gómez (Universitat Jaume I, Spain):
From ESP to CLIL: Is Teacher Training a Problem? 

We welcome paper proposals in relation to the roles that any of the following
can play in the language learning process:

1. Human resources: native speakers, tandem learning, language advisors,
language teachers, peer learners...
2. Traditional resources: paper-based, audiovisual...
3. Computer-based resources: software, Internet, electronic communication tools?

Proposals for 20-minute papers must include:

[i] Personal data (author's name, affiliation and e-mail address) and abstract
(up to 150 words, including paper title) 
[ii] Full paper in English.

Important Dates
Paper proposal: 11 April 2008 
Notification of acceptance: 5 May 2008 
Registration deadline: 30 May 2008 
Conference Dates: 17-18 July 2008

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description:
Workshop on Empirical Approaches to Speech Rhythm
Centre for Human Communication, UCL 

Call for Papers: Workshop on Empirical Approaches to Speech Rhythm

Centre for Human Communication, UCL

Abstracts due: 31st January 2008
Workshop date: 28th March 2008

Empirical studies of speech rhythm are becoming increasingly popular. Metrics
for the quantification of rhythm have been applied to typological,
developmental, pathological and perceptual questions. The prevalence of rhythm
metrics based on durational characteristics of consonantal and vocalic intervals
(e.g. deltaV, deltaC, %V, nPVI-V, rPVI-C, VarcoV and VarcoC) indicate the need
for agreement about their relative efficacy and reliability. More fundamentally,
it remains to be demonstrated whether such metrics really quantify speech
rhythm, a controversial and elusive concept.

Confirmed Speakers:
Francis Nolan (Cambridge) - keynote speaker
Fred Cummins (UCD)
Volker Dellwo (UCL)
Klaus Kohler (Kiel)
Elinor Payne (Oxford)
Petra Wagner (Bonn)
Laurence White (Bristol)

Abstracts:
We invite abstract submissions for a limited number of additional oral
presentations, and for poster presentations. We welcome abstracts that address
any or all of the following questions:
- What is speech rhythm?
- How should we measure speech rhythm?
- Which rhythm metrics are most effective and reliable?
- What can rhythm metrics tell us?
- What are the limitations of rhythm metrics?

Publication:
It is intended that a limited number of contributions to the workshop may be
published in a special issue of Phonetica. Initial selection of papers will be
made after the workshop with a view to compiling a thematically coherent
publication. Selected papers will subsequently be reviewed.

Important Dates:
Abstracts must be received by: 31st January 2008
Notification of acceptance: 15th February 2008
Date of Workshop: 28th March 2008

Abstract Submission:
Abstracts should be sent to: rhythm2008@phon.ucl.ac.uk. Abstracts should be in
Word or rtf format, 12pt Times New Roman, 1.5 line spacing, and no longer than
one page of A4. The file should be entitled RhythmWorkshop-[name].doc|rtf, where
[name] is the last name of the first author. The abstract should start with:
- the title of the abstract in bold and centered;
- the name(s) and department(s) of the author(s) in italics and centered;
- the email address(es) of the author(s), centred.
The body of the abstract should be justified left and right. 

Further Information:
For more information and updates please check www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/rhythm2008.
Email enquiries should be directed to rhythm2008@phon.ucl.ac.uk.
