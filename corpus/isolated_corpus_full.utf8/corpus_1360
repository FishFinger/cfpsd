DECALOG -- The 2007 Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue

         Università di Trento (Italy), May 30 -- June 1, 2007

          http://www.cimec.unitn.it/events/decalog/index.htm

                         in conjunction with

   Inaugural Workshop of the Language, Interaction and Computation Lab,
                  Center For Mind / Brain Sciences (CiMeC)

                             May 29, 2007


CALL FOR POSTERS AND DEMOS (deadline: 22 April 2007)


Description

   The SEMDIAL series of workshops aim to bring together researchers
   working on the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such
   as artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, formal
   semantics/pragmatics, philosophy, psychology, and neural
   science. In 2007 we will celebrate ten years of the SEMDIAL series
   with the DECALOG workshop, organized at the Center for Mind/Brain
   Sciences, CIMeC (Centro Interdipartimentale Mente/Cervello), of the
   University of Trento in Rovereto. The SemDial workshops are always
   stimulating and fun, and Rovereto is a great place to visit.

   DECALOG will be held on May 30 -- June 1, 2007, in conjunction with
   the Inaugural Workshop of the Language, Interaction and Computation
   Lab of CIMeC on May 29. This one-day workshop will feature invited
   presentations by some of the leaders of the computational
   linguistics and human language technology community.

Invited Speakers

   For DECALOG 2007 (May 30 -- June 1)

      Bruno Bara (University of Torino)
      Renato De Mori (University of Avignon)
      Paul Piwek (Open University)
      Ipke Wachsmuth (University of Bielefeld)

   For the Inaugural Workshop (May 29)

      Harald Baayen (Radboud University Nijmegen & Max Planck Institute
         for Psycholinguistics)
      Justine Cassell (Northwestern University)
      Terry Regier (University of Chicago)
      Steffen Staab (University of Koblenz-Landau)
      Mark Steedman (University of Edinburgh & University of Pennsylvania)
      Oliviero Stock (ITC-IRST: Center for Scientific and Technological
         Research, Trento)

Scope

   We invite short abstracts describing system demonstrations and/or
   ongoing projects relevant to the topics of the workshop, including,
   but not limited to:

     - models of common ground/mutual belief in communication
     - modelling agents' information states and how they get updated
     - multi-agent models and turn-taking
     - goals, intentions and commitments in communication
     - semantic interpretation in dialogues
     - reference in dialogues
     - ellipsis resolution in dialogues
     - dialogue and discourse structure
     - interpretation of questions and answers
     - nonlinguistic interaction in communication
     - natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue
       systems
     - multimodal dialogue systems
     - dialogue management in practical implementations
     - categorisation of dialogue moves or speech acts in corpora
     - designing and evaluating dialogue systems

Submission

   Deadline for receipt of abstracts is 22 April 2007, 23:59 UTC.
   (Since we have to close the system manually, submissions will
   probably be accepted for a few hours after the deadline, but we're
   not making any promises.) Submit your paper via the web at

     http://www.easychair.org/DECALOG2007/

   Before submitting you must register with the website and receive a
   password by email; please do this well ahead of your submission,
   since email is sometimes unreliable. You will also need to fill out
   a web form with the author details and type in (or paste) a short
   plain-text abstract (up to 200 words), in addition to uploading
   your full abstract.

   The full abstract should be a PDF file, 2 pages long (including
   data, tables, figures, and references), A4 paper size, 11pt Times
   font, 2.5 cm (1 inch) margins, 2-column format. You may find it
   convenient to use the style files provided by COLING/ACL 2006.
   Submission is NOT anonymous: please include the authors' names,
   affiliations, and e-mails.

   Submissions will not be peer-reviewed, but evaluated for relevance
   only by the program committee chairs. Due to limited space at the
   workshop site, we ask authors to limit their submissions to one
   poster/demo. Authors who have been accepted to give an oral
   presentation are asked not to send a different paper as a poster;
   you may, however, show a demo of your accepted paper (there is no
   need to submit a separate abstract).

Proceedings

   The accepted 2-page abstracts will be distributed in a proceedings
   volume at the workshop.

Important Dates

   Submission deadline:       22 April 2007 (Sunday)
