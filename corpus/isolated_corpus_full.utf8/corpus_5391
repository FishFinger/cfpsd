Meeting Description:

The first international conference on Intonational Variation in Arabic will be
held on 28th and 29th September 2009 at the University of York, UK. The aim of
the conference is to bring together researchers working on Arabic prosody and
intonation, and together to explore the range of prosodic variation observed in
spoken varieties of Arabic.

There is an extended submission deadline. The new Call Deadline is 14-June-2009. 

Conference Website: http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~sh581/iva09 

Call for Papers

Papers of a descriptive and/or theoretical nature are invited which treat the
phonetics and/or phonology of suprasegmental phenomena in one or more Arabic
varieties (or other related Afro-Asiatic languages). Papers treating the
intonational phonology of spoken Arabic dialects will be particularly welcome
and will be prioritised. The conference will include a special workshop session
on the development of transcription systems for research on intonational
variation in Arabic. 

Invited Speakers: 

Professor Francis Nolan (University of Cambridge, UK) 
Professor Khaled Rifaat (Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud University, Riyadh)

examples, figures and/or references. No submissions will be accepted which are

pdf format.
