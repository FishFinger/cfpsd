             ********SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS*******

     Workshop on Building Frame Semantics Resources for
             Scandinavian and Baltic Languages

   **held in conjunction with the NODALIDA 2007 Conference**

      *****SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 19****

DATE AND LOCATION
Date: Thursday 24 May 2007
Location: University of Tartu, Estonia
Part of the NODALIDA 2007, the 16th Nordic Conference of  
Computational Linguistics
Workshop web page: http://nlp.cs.lth.se/frame2007/
Conference web page: http://math.ut.ee/nodalida2007/


OBJECTIVES
Annotated data with role-semantic information are becoming an ever
more important resource for many semantic systems. They form the core
element to develop large coverage, high-performance, and reusable
semantic parsers, classifiers as well as applications that include
lexicography, term and information extraction, semantic processing of
the web, text-to-scene conversion systems, etc.

Existing examples of role annotated corpora/resources include for
English: FrameNet, PropBank, and VerbNet, for German: Salsa, and for
Spanish: Spanish FrameNet. However, the two main initiatives outside
English take FrameNet as a semantic pivot and attempt to derive or
adapt frames to the target language using manual work or semiautomatic
systems.

As frequently observed, the itemization of frames and lexical units
and their manual annotation in a corpus is an expensive task that
requires a relatively long-term and dedicated commitment. Such an
effort is currently beyond the reach of most research teams in the
Nordic area, which could impair the quality, and possibly the
existence, of future semantic applications in these languages. This
makes the construction of a role-semantic annotated corpus and the
design of automatic or semi-automatic transfer methods a challenge as
well as an opportunity.

This workshop intends to be a forum for the research community to
review current initiatives and methods as well as ideas to start the
construction of a role annotated corpus and possibly share it across a
families of related languages. Topics of interest include (but are not
limited to):

-- Transfer and adaptation of frames and role annotation from English
and German
-- Pilot annotation/projection studies
-- Lexical inheritance mechanisms: crosslingual similarities and  
differences, protoframe design, variation and variant annotation
-- Frame alignment and projections from English/German and across  
target languages
-- Transfer of collocations, subcategorization, and grammatical  
functions to role annotation
-- General methods for multilingual corpus alignment and structure  
transfer/projection
-- "Upgrade" of existing resources: dependency annotation, small  
corpora, and bootstrapping using nonsemantically annotated data
-- Shared annotation platforms
-- Experience from other initiatives: Salsa, Romance FrameNet
-- Applications of frame semantics
-- Evaluation

IMPORTANT DATES
Deadline for submitting extended abstract: February 19
Notification of acceptance: March 1
Deadline for submitting final papers, short, max. 4 pages or full,  
max. 8 pages: April 20
Workshop: May 24


SUBMISSION AND ORGANIZATION
Participants are invited to submit a one to two page extended  
abstract of their research or position statements using the NODALIDA  
styles (http://math.ut.ee/nodalida2007/author.html). Submissions must  
include author names, affiliation, and contact address. The workshop  
submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee.

If their abstract is accepted, authors will be invited to submit a  
short paper (max. 4 pages) or a full paper (max. 8 pages) according  
to the authors' own choice that will be published in the workshop  
proceedings.

Submissions are to be sent to frame2007@cs.lth.se

The workshop will take place in the NODALIDA 2007 conference and will  
include a round table where participants will be able to discuss and  
try to propose an agenda to build frame semantic resources for the  
Scandinavian and Baltic languages. Active participation and/or  
commitments from the presenters or the public to set up this agenda  
will be welcome.

TARGET GROUPS
All the people interested in building frame semantic resources as  
well as frame semantic analyzers for the Scandinavian and Baltic  
languages.
