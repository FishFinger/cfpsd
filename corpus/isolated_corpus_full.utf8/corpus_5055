Meeting Description:

Conference on the Word in Phonology

Sponsored by the MA/PhD Program in Linguistics at the City University of New
York and the CUNY Phonology Forum
January 14th-16th, 2010, at the CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
City, 10016
For more information, visit http://www.cunyphonologyforum.net/word.php. 

Call for Papers

We invite oral and poster presentations from any subdivision of cognitive
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics,
poetics, philosophy, psychology, etc. We also encourage diversity in methods, so
we welcome both formal and experimental approaches to the topic of the word in
phonology. 

By 'word' in phonology we refer to any structural entity larger than and/or
distinct from morphemes, or to representations that have been proposed to
capture phonological or morphological generalizations larger than the syllable
or foot. The conference organizers especially want to encourage proposals from a
variety of theoretical frameworks.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to open the field of discussion to all matters related
to the nature of the word in phonology and/or phonetics.

- Is the word a valid concept?
- Is the word the same entity as the phonological word?
- Is the word hierarchically superordinate to feet and/or syllables?
- What is the internal structure of the word?
- What principles determine word structure?
- What aspects of the word are relevant to rhyme and meter?
- How do psycholinguistic processes interact with the linguist's word?
- How do morphological and phonological rules/constraints refer to the word?
- Does the word exist at different levels of phonology and phonetics?

Invited Speakers: (titles to be announced later)
Nigel Fabb, University of Strathclyde
Alec Marantz, New York University
Adam Ussishkin, University of Arizona

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts for oral or poster presentations should consist of a one page
description (12pt font) with a second page for references, data and/or
illustrations. Please specify whether it is a proposal for a poster or an oral
presentation, or potentially either. Although we will make every effort to honor
authors' requests, the criterion for assigning a proposal to either the oral or
the poster format is simply whether the subject matter is better suited for one
or the other mode of presentation. Abstracts should be emailed as an attachment
(PDF format) to word@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, October 18,
2009. Authors should include title of the proposal, name of the author(s) and
affiliation in the body of the email.

Important Dates:
October 18, 2009 deadline for abstracts submission
November 20, 2009 notification of acceptance
January 14-16, 2010 Conference on the word in phonology

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
