:: 1. Registration Details
================================================================================

Registration closes at midnight USA West Coast time on June 30
(i.e. **TODAY**), after which the only registration option will be onsite
during the conference (at a higher rate than for online registration). If
you have yet to register, we strongly recommend you complete online
registration ASAP at:

  http://www.acl2006.org/registration 

VERY IMPORTANT: if you are a presenter at a workshop, you MUST register to
attend it, to ensure sufficient seats and coffee.  Do NOT assume that because
you are a listed speaker you are automatically registered - check your
registration, and email the conference secretariat (acl@welldone.com.au)
immediately (before the cutoff date of 30/6) if you need to add your
attendance at a workshop or tutorial. Note that tutorial presenters have all
been registered to attend at no charge, to ensure catering is correct.

For the final program of the workshops and co-located events, see the
individual web pages, listed at:

  http://www.acl2006.org/program/workshops



================================================================================
:: 5. Local Map of Sydney
================================================================================

Menno van Zaanen and Simon Zwarts at Macquarie University have produced a
Google Maps mashup that shows you all the key locations and
accommodation. The map is available at:

  http://www.acl2006.org/map

Three places of particular interest that may be your first point of call to
the conference are:

1. University of Technology, Sydney (UTS): the location of the workshops and
   tutorials on the weekend of July 15-16, and also the place to collect your
   monorail pass early so you can use it on Sunday July 16. Registration will
   be open from 7:45am on Saturday July 15, and close at 3:00pm on Sunday July
   16. Come to the UTS precinct, Quay Street Haymarket - enter at Building C.

2. Convention Centre, Parkside Ballroom Foyer (level 1): the location of the
   welcoming cocktails on the evening of Sunday 16 July, sponsored by
   Google. The cocktail reception will commence at 6:00pm and run until
   8:00pm. It will also be possible to register here, from 7:00pm. Enter via
   the Harbourside main reception area, at the northern end of the convention
   centre (the main entrance if coming from the Novotel or via the monorail).

3. Convention Centre, Bayside Foyer (level 1): the location of the
   registration desk for the duration of the main conference. Registration
   will be available from 7:30am on Monday July 17. Enter via the
   Harbourside main reception area, at the northern end of the convention
   centre (the main entrance if coming from the Novotel or via the monorail).

The Convention Centre and UTS are marked green on the map.



================================================================================
:: 6. Lunches during the Conference
================================================================================

As part of your conference registration, we are offering the option of lunch
boxes for those who wish to eat onsite or outside in the sunshine of Darling
Harbour. While there are plenty of eateries in the Darling Harbour precinct
there will likely be queues for the cheaper ones, and they are certainly not
as convenient as a lunch box -- short queues, and plenty of places to network
and enjoy lunch while you use the wireless facilities available in our
conference area!

Here's what you will get in a (sample) lunch box:

Marina Lunchbox
Salmon miso, green tea noodles and coriander salad
Spinach tortillo wrap with lettuce, tomato, avocado and smoked turkey
Butter lettuce hearts, egg dressing and semi dried tomato
Seasonal fresh fruit
Tetrapak fruit juice

- delicious!

If you want a vegetarian lunch box, be sure to indicate this in the special
dietary requirements on your registration form.




================================================================================
:: 7. Conference Dinner
================================================================================

Where else can the Scots and the French co-exist, co-operate and co-host such
an event? Our conference dinner will celebrate the efforts and inclinations of
our two local chairs in particular, and is not to be missed. The dinner will
take place on Thursday July 20 at the Star City Ballroom, against a fabulous
backdrop of city lights - and you can party on afterwards at the Casino and
nightclubs below.




================================================================================
:: 8. Monorail Passes
================================================================================

Another option on the registration form is the 7-day monorail pass, which is a
must if you are staying at any of the conference hotels in the precinct, or
moving between the Workshops / Tutorial venue (UTS) and the main Conference
(Convention Centre).  A monorail runs every 10 minutes, and the pass allows
you to jump on and off as often as you wish for the 7 days of Sunday July 16
through Saturday July 22.

A single day monorail ticket costs $9.00, compared to $25.00 for our 7-day
pass - exceptional value even if you are only planning to use it for 3 days!
It will also get you to and from the Conference Dinner, the starting point of
the Wednesday Excursion, and the UTS precinct. A map of the monorail route can
be found at:

  http://www.metromonorail.com.au/StationLocatorFlash.asp

On-site, the monorail pass will cost you $30 - still a great saving.




================================================================================
:: 9. Excursion
================================================================================

According to the COLING custom, Wednesday July 19 is a conference-free day for
delegates to really enjoy the beauty of Sydney.  We'll collect you in ferries
at Darling Harbour, transport you to the famous Taronga Park Zoo for a tour
particularly of our Australian native animals, and morning tea; then to Manly,
a wonderful seaside beach suburb, where you can browse, shop, take lunch, even
swim, and take a coach to North Head, the entrance to Sydney Harbour, with a
spectacular view back to the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House; late
afternoon the ferries will take a leisurely cruise back to Darling Harbour,
with drinks and canapes to finish a wonderful day.  All this is included in
your registration, so we expect everyone to enjoy this networking and
sightseeing opportunity -- and bring your partners, families and friends.
Tickets need to be booked for any additional guests.




================================================================================
:: 10. Extra Activities
================================================================================

You can STILL BOOK any of the extra activities, even if you've registered for
the conference or workshops. Either go back to the online registration and
work your way through and select just these extras, or take the registration
form available on the web and complete the details and fax it to us with your
credit card details. Note on the form or in the comments that you've already
registered for other activities. We'll send you confirmation of your update.

A reminder also of the two partner excursions:
   

(1) July 17, 2006 (Mon): Departs 2.00pm, returns 5.30pm

Sydney Highlights Tour


(2) July 21, 2006 (Fri): departs 8.15am, returns 5.45pm

Blue Mountains Day Tour, incl 2 course hot lunch

================================================================================
:: 11. Student Accommodation
================================================================================

There are plenty of cheap options around the Darling Harbour area, as listed
on the bottom of:

  www.acl2006.org/accommodation/listings/

You can book directly with any of the listed options.
