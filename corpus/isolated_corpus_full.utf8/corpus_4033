Full Title: Africana Linguistica 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

This is a call for papers for issue 15 of Africana Linguistica. Submission
deadline is January 31, 2009 to be considered for publication in the same
year. Issue 14 just appeared:
www.africamuseum.be/publications/journals/ALvol14 

Africana Linguistica is a peer-reviewed and internationally oriented
journal, covered by several abstracting/indexing services such as Arts and
Humanities Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, European
Reference Index for the Humanities, MLA International Bibliography, MLA
International Bibliography, CSA Linguistics and Language Behavior
Abstracts, Linguistic Bibliography.

Africana Linguistica is dedicated to the study of African languages with
special focus on Bantu and welcomes original descriptive, historical and
typological papers in phonetics/phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicology
and semantics. Contributions on poorly documented and described languages
or lesser-known language areas as well as those trying to integrate
linguistics into interdisciplinary approaches of the African past are
highly appreciated. Fellow researchers from Africa are especially
encouraged to contribute.
