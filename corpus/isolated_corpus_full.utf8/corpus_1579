Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this conference, linked to a national project on Identity and Culture
in English Domain-Specific Discourse, is to explore the relationship between
shared disciplinary norms and individual traits in academic speech and writing.
Identity is indeed a matter of individuality as well as sameness: it defines
what makes individuals similar to their peers but also what makes them to a
certain extent unique. Despite the standardizing pressure of cultural and
language-related factors, academic communication remains in many ways a highly
personal affair, with active participation in a disciplinary community requiring
a multidimensional discourse that combines the professional, institutional,
social and individual identities of its members.

Within the bounds of this perspective, paper proposals are invited on the
following themes:

- Tensions involving individual/collective values in academic discourse
- Corpus analyses of collective vs. individual discoursal features
- Longitudinal investigations of the output of individual scholars
- Ethnographic investigations of 'new disciplinary voices'
- Generic norms and their violation by junior/senior researchers

Invited plenary speakers who have already confirmed their participation include
Ken Hyland (University of London), Keith Richards (University of Warwick) and
Paul Thompson (University of Reading). 

Submissions in English (containing a 300-word abstract with the main thrust and
conclusions of the paper) should be emailed to cerlis@unibg.it (using the form
in the conference website) by 31 October 2007.
The outcome of submissions will be announced by 30 November 2007.

Subject: Semantic Representation of Spoken Language 

	

Full Title: Semantic Representation of Spoken Language 
Short Title: SRSL7 

Date: 12-Nov-2007 - 13-Nov-2007
Location: Salamanca, Spain 
Contact Person: Manuel Alcantara
Meeting Email: manuel.alcantara@dfki.de
Web Site: http://www.dfki.de/~mpla/SRSL/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2007 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in the
semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous speech. The
current state-of-the-art supports solutions from very different backgrounds and
perspectives, but still remain important and complex issues to deal with, such
as the accurate segmentation of speech in semantic units. 

Spoken language is a pending issue in computational linguistics and artificial
intelligence, both traditionally focused on written language, although semantic
processing of speech is necessary for the understanding of both natural and
human-machine interaction. The problems found when trying to linguistically
structure spontaneous speech are leading to works focused on its semantic
representation. In-depth research on the semantic representation of speech can
provide us with a suitable basis for further analysis of related linguistic
levels, like prosody or pragmatics. 

2nd Call for Papers: International Workshop on the Semantic Representation of
Spoken Language 2007 (SRSL7)

Salamanca, Spain (12-Nov-2007 - 13-Nov-2007)

http://www.dfki.de/~mpla/SRSL/

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research concerning
the semantic representation of spoken language. They can be full (6-8 pages) or
short papers (3-4 pages).

Possible topics include:

- Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, etc.) and
concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
- Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
- Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
- Dialogue and discourse structures.
- Topic detection and tracking.
- Multimodal representations including speech.
- Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.
- Speech in embedded systems.
- Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic
representations.
- Standardisation work.

Submissions must be written in English and should follow the Springer format. As
reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the author's names and
affiliations.

Submission will be via email and must be sent to
manuel(dot)alcantara(at)dfki(dot)de. Accepted papers will appear in the
proceedings of the workshop. Both full (6-8 pages including references) and
short papers (3-4 pages including references) will have an oral presentation at
the workshop within the framework of the CAEPIA conference in Salamanca (Spain).
The University of Salamanca offers 15 grants/awards to facilitate the attendance
of doctoral and young doctors both to the event.
