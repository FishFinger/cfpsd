Hello all

I am grateful to Mira for raising the question of intuition. My work in this
area may look extensive but it has been hard-won. 400,000 words of it remain
censored in one way or another. You will see below that I am not even being
allowed access to the list replies. My service provider has always and over=
 ten
years placed any material that I need urgently for my research, entirely by
accident, of course, in the spam trap. This process delays replies and caus=
es
logical threads to be lost. Perhaps I need to tell the EU and the new PM.

So let me say this completely oblivious of the content of your messages.
Intuition is the one main reason why I am researching collocation as
instrumentation for language. We cannot discover deception in texts and
institutions if these are read in the normal way. Collocation subsists not =
only
in the TEXT being read but also in the WHOLE language against which a text =
is to
be read. What we cannot see in the text is often more important than what w=
e can
see. Macherey called these 'absences'. Could we see that TRUTH and
RECONCILIATION were never collocates? Twenty three thousand victims of apar=
theid
were apparently conned by their inability to recognise that the institution=
 was
logically a fake when read against the whole language. (Google CESLICF for =
this
paper).TRUTH collocates with JUSTICE. Did we see trials to establish justic=
e and
the rule of law? No, we saw mass waiver. Do we know that we may be being fr=
amed
by the courts when we hear the term NATURAL JUSTICE? What are its collocate=
s?
Use the corpus and know the truth. 'Trust the Text'.

John Sinclair in _Reading Concordances_ Chap 14 refers to Semantic Prosody =
as
'hidden meaning'. Hidden from what or whom? The answer is hidden from intui=
tion.
Chris Ruehlemann mentions Susan Hunston's 're-visiting SP' article. That ar=
ticle
takes no account of my 'difficult to find in her own department' 2000 artic=
le in
Heffer and Sauntson (Eds.) entitled 'Contextual prosodic theory: bringing
semantic prosodies to life.' Nobody reprints that article! I sent copies to=
 Mira
and others. My service provider offered no clue as to whether they reached =
you.
More articles on request. See my methodology paper in the Festschrift for W=
illi
van Peer just out (Viana & Zyngier Eds.)

More if I am allowed the benefit of Articles 12 and 19 of the UDHR.
