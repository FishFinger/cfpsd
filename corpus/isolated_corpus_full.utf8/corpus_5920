HCSNet SummerFest Call for Speed Papers and Posters

*** LIMITED NUMBER OF SUMMERFEST TRAVEL BURSARIES AVAILABLE -- READ ON! ***

Two fantastic events at this year's SummerFest: the Speed Papers session and the Student Posters session.  Details below.

** SummerFest '09 Speed Papers Call Open

This year's Speed Papers session will be held on the afternoon of Wednesday 2nd December, 2009. The speed paper concept is somewhat like speed dating: you get just 4 slides and 4 minutes to tell the assembled audience about a project you are already doing, or would like to do. Everyone in the audience has a form on which they can scribble relevant comments and feedback on your project. You then get to do the same for the other speed papers. Result: as a presenter, you get masses of feedback; and as a member of the audience, you get an introduction to a vast range of research problems in a short time. The speed papers session is a fun, fast-paced way to get to know others at SummerFest. Anyone can submit a speed paper; to submit, you just provide a 250-word abstract describing what you want to talk about. A template for presentation slides will be provided to presenters of accepted abstracts in October.
For more information seehttp://sf09.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest09/speedpapers09.

** SummerFest'09 Student Poster Session

This year's Student Poster Sessions will be held on the evenings of Monday 30th November and Tuesday 1st December, 2009. The aim of the HCSNet Summer School poster sessions is to help students get to know one another and to hear about current research projects in a range of disciplines. The poster sessions will include refreshments to keep the 
atmosphere informal and social, and along the way you'll get to know your peers and receive useful feedback on your own research work.The general idea is for the posters to convey who you are, where you are and what you are doing. For more information see http://sf09.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest09/posters09. 

** Travel Bursaries

A limited number of travel bursaries will be available for students presenting posters on the Monday or Tuesday evening, and those presenting speed papers at the Wednesday speed papers sessions.  See the website for full details!
