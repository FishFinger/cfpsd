Meeting Description:

This workshop seeks to bring together researchers in both computer science and
social sciences who are interested in developing and using topic-sentiment
analysis methods to measure mass opinion, and to foster communications between
the research community and industry practitioners as well. 

Call for Papers

1st International CIKM Workshop on Topic-Sentiment Analysis for Mass Opinion
Measurement
November 6, 2009
Hong Kong
http://sites.google.com/site/tsa2009workshop

The increasing amount of user-generated content on the Internet and social media
and the digitization of large number of government and institutional documents
provide new opinion-rich data sources for researchers to examine individual and
group perceptions on products, organizations, and social issues at a large
scale, and thus contribute to the research and practice in the areas of
political science, social policy, communications, and business intelligence.

On the other hand, researchers are tackling the problem of processing large
amount of opinion-rich data using various approaches. The increasing number of
relevant publications in top data mining, information retrieval and natural
language processing conferences (KDD, SIGIR, ACL, WWW, etc.) has witnessed the
growing interest in automatic opinion analysis. Both TREC and TAC (Text Analysis
Conference) have set up individual tracks for opinion retrieval and analysis tasks.

In recent years topic detection and tracking techniques have been well developed
to identify the issues discussed in a large text collection. Sentiment analysis
is catching up to detect the polarity of opinions expressed in texts. However,
many times real-world applications have to take into consideration of both
topics and sentiments for precise opinion measurement. Topic and sentiment
alignment is crucial for opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, and
aggregation on various issues. Topics and sentiments could also have
sophisticated interactions. For example, the choice of topics and the attention
distribution among topics might bear hidden opinions as well.

How do we build synergistic topic and sentiment models for text documents? How
do we tackle the domain-dependency problem of sentiment analysis? How do we
identify users' needs and integrate them into the design of opinion analysis
systems? What are the successful applications of topic-sentiment analysis for
mass opinion measurement? What lessons have the pioneers learned? How do we
evaluate the automatic mass opinion measuring tools with regard to the
reliability and validity? This workshop solicits submissions to address these
problems and more.

We hope this workshop can advance research in topic-sentiment analysis, make
connections between research community and industry practitioners and encourage
development of high performance tools and systems that can work at the web scale
for real world applications.

Topics of Interest
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, and aggregation
- Topic and sentiment alignment in opinion analysis
- Applications of topic-sentiment analysis, e.g. corporate reputation
measurement, political orientation categorization, customer preference study,
public opinion study
- Issues in using topic-sentiment analysis as a new research method for mass
opinion estimation, such as reliability, validity, sample bias, etc.
- Sentiment identification and filtering at various text granularity
- Domain-dependency of sentiment analyzers
- Evaluation methodologies
- Performance issues, scalability and efficiency
- Web-based system demonstration
- Novel algorithms, tools and systems
- Construction of benchmark data sets

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
