CALL FOR PAPERS:  TCBR@ICCBR05
		
Textual Case-Based Reasoning Workshop
at the 6th International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning

http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~rw37/tcbr05.html

24 August 2005 as part of the ICCBR 2005 Workshop Program, Chicago, IL

DESCRIPTION

Textual CBR is an increasingly important CBR sub-discipline. Textual CBR techniques can facilitate rapid construction of CBR systems by reducing or eliminating the task of feature-design in domains in which raw cases consist of free or semi-structured text. Moreover, many tasks, such as question answering, are inherently language-based. For such tasks, retaining a textual case representation may be more effective than engineering a feature representation that is intermediate between text queries and text solutions. In addition, textual CBR can provide information extraction or other language analysis tools to assist in engineering feature-based cases. Accelerating growth in the number and size of incident report, lessons-learned, and other unstructured or semi-structured text collections insures that textual CBR will continue to increase in importance.

The goal of this workshop will be to provide a forum for discussion of trends, developments, research issues, contributions from other communities, and practical experience in textual case-based reasoning. A particular focus of the workshop will be development of data repositories and other shared resources for research, validation, and development of textual CBR systems.  

Topics will include, but not be limited to, the following:

	Range and scope of applicability: What characteristics of a domain determine whether it is amenable to textual CBR techniques?  
	Representation issues: What representations should textual cases be mapped into, and when should cases be manipulated as raw text documents?  
	Segmentation and case extraction.  
	Conversational CBR.  
	Reuse and adaptation of textual cases.
	The relationship between textual CBR and related technologies, such as text mining, question-answering and dialogue systems, and human-language technology.   
	Case studies of textual CBR systems.  
	Indexing and retrieval of textual cases.  
	Automated extraction of lexical and taxonomic information from cases.  
	Testing and evaluation methodologies for textual CBR systems.  
	Corpora and repositories for textual cases. 

WORKSHOP FORMAT

This half-day workshop will start with an invited talk on The Role of Generative Ontologies in Textual CBR, speaker is Kalyan Moy Gupta (AES, ITT Industries, Alexandria, VA. & NCARAI, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC, USA); followed by paper presentations, a panel, and a concluding discussion period among participants to delineate conclusions and potential future efforts.
This workshop is open to all interested conference participants, but may be limited by available room facilities.
