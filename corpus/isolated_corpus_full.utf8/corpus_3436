Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

A number of countries have developed 'national corpus' exercises, gathering
large bodies of linguistic data that support a wide variety of research
activities.  Australia doesn't have one -- this workshop aims to change that. 

Call for Papers

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December 1st 5th
2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a
workshop on ''Designing the Australian National Corpus''.

This workshop focuses on current developments and emerging possibilities in
corpus construction and usage for researchers working in Human Communication
Sciences. Its aim is to bring together researchers with expertise in data
representation and corpus building, as well as corpus annotation and
interrogation, in a single forum in order (1) to disseminate leading work on
corpus construction and usage to the broader research community in Australia and
thereby contribute to collective knowledge about data collection and
representation, and (2) to work towards the design and construction of an
Australian National Corpus that is innovative in exploiting the full potential
of the interface between language and technologies.

The workshop will include a keynote address by Professor Nancy Ide (Vassar
College) who is the Technical Director of the American National Corpus.
Professor Ide is the Co-Editor-in-Chief of Language Resources and Evaluation and
of the Text, Speech and Language Technology book series (Springer), and has
published widely in the areas of computational linguistics and corpus
construction. The workshop will also include keynote addresses by Professor Pam
Peters, author of the Cambridge Guide to English Usage and the Cambridge Guide
to Australian English Usage (CUP) and Director of the Dictionary Research Centre
and Style Council Centre; and Dr Steve Cassidy, co-author of Techniques in
Speech Acoustics (Kluwer) and a member of the Executive of the Australian Speech
Science and Technology Association. 

Intended Audience:
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with expertise in
corpus linguistics and language documentation, including those with a particular
focus on English and other languages spoken in Australia, as well those with
expertise in corpus building, corpus annotation and corpus interrogation. Those
who are users of corpora in linguistics, language technologies and other
disciplines are also warmly welcomed.

For enquiries about the workshop, contact Michael Haugh (m.haugh@griffith.edu.au).

Submissions:
Submissions for presentation at the workshop are sought. Topics of interest
include but are not limited to:

- corpus linguistics 
- corpus data

- linguistic and multimodal data representation 
- audio(visual) text transcription

- corpus annotation 
- corpus design and construction 
- language data ethics
