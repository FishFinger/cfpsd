Meeting Description

Conference on Language, Communication and Cognition
University of Brighton, August 4th-7th 2008, Brighton, UK

Extended Abstract Submission Deadline

Due to multiple requests for further time to submit abstracts, the deadline for
submission to the Conference on Language, Communication and Cognition (Brighton
Aug 4-7 2008) has been extended until Sunday 2nd December 2007.   

The conference on Language, Communication and Cognition aims to promote an
interdisciplinary, comparative, multi-methodological approach to the study of
language, communication and cognition, informed by method and practice as
developed in Cognitive Linguistics. The objective is to contribute to our
understanding of language as a key aspect of human cognition, using converging
and multi-disciplinary methodologies, based upon cross-linguistic,
cross-cultural, and cross-population comparisons.

The conference will address the following themes: 
- Language, creativity and imagination
- Language in use
- Meaning and grammar
- Communication, conceptualisation and gesture
- Language and its influence on thought
- Language acquisition and conceptual development
- Origins and evolution of language and mind

The following distinguished scholars will be giving keynote lectures relating to
the conference themes:

Lera Boroditsky, Stanford University
