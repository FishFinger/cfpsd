Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

ConSOLE is the annual conference of the Student Organization of Linguistics in
Europe (SOLE). Console is open to registered students worldwide. It provides a
forum for the coming generations of linguistics to present their research to an
international audience. 

Call for Papers

The Student Organization of Linguistics in Europe (SOLE) was founded in 1992, by
students of the Holland Institute of Generative Linguistics which has since been
superseded by University of Leiden Centre for Linguistics. Once a year, SOLE and
a local committee organize a conference for students of Linguistics, ConSOLE.
Open to registered students worldwide, it provides a forum for the coming
generations of linguistics to present their research to an international audience.

Graduate students not having defended a Ph.D. in Linguistics by September 15th
are invited to submit abstracts in Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, and Semantics.
Submissions in other areas, e.g. Psycholinguistics, Neurolinguistics, Phonetics,
etc., will also be welcome if their theoretical significance is made clear.
Papers are allotted 30 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.

Abstracts should not exceed two pages, including data, references and diagrams.
Abstracts should be typed in at least 11-point font, with one-inch margins
(letter-size; 8''1/2 by 11'' or A4) and a maximum of 50 lines of text per page.
Abstracts must be anonymous and submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1
joint abstract per author. 

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Please send name, affiliation,
e-mail, postal address and title of paper in the body of the message. The
anonymous abstract should be sent as an attachment, and only abstracts in pdf
format will be accepted.

Abstracts should be sent to: console.XVII@gmail.com

Invited Speakers:
- Richard Larson (Stony Brook University)
- John Harris (University College London)
- Paul Hirscb√ºhler (University of Ottawa)
- TBA

Important Dates:
- Deadline for abstract submission: September 15, 2008
- Notification of acceptance: November 19, 2008
- Final Program: December 1, 2008
- Conference: January 16-18, 2009

More information on the conference will soon be available on the webpage

Full Title: The Emergence of Linguistic Patterns 

Date: 12-Jul-2009 - 17-Jul-2009
Location: Melbourne, Australia 
Contact Person: Mareike Buss
Meeting Email: elp.ipra2009@googlemail.com

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Historical Linguistics; Linguistic
Theories; Philosophy of Language; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

The panel aims at discussing linguistic pattern formation and change in a
cognitive, functional, and semiotic perspective. We expect that the combination
of these different perspectives will generate new insights into the processes of
pattern emergence, especially by focusing on the communicative circumstances and
the discursive context in which an utterance is produced. 

Reminder: Call for papers for a panel at the 11th International Pragmatics
Conference in Melbourne, Australia, 12-17 July 2009
(http://ipra.ua.ac.be/main.aspx?c=.CONFERENCE11&n=1346)

Panel Theme: ''The Emergence of Linguistic Patterns: Cognitive, Functional and
Semiotic Perspectives''
Panel organizers: Elisabeth Birk (RWTH Aachen), Mareike Buss (RWTH Aachen), Elke
Diedrichsen (RWTH Aachen/U Duesseldorf), Joerg Jost (RWTH Aachen)

Panel Description:
Usage-based models of language claim that linguistic structures are grounded in
instances of language use. Hence, they have to address the question how series
of utterances can lead to the emergence of (relatively stable) linguistic
patterns. In cognitive linguistics, this is generally explained with recourse to
the 'frequency' and the 'similarity' of those linguistic instances that
contribute to the formation of a pattern. Whereas the notion of frequency may be
considered to be quite uncontroversial, it is often far from clear what counts
as a 'similar instance of language use'. We claim that formal or semantic
similarity is not an inherent quality of linguistic patterns. Rather, it is
unconsciously attributed by speakers on the basis of specific structural and
communicative contexts of usage.

In functional linguistics, the question of pattern emergence and change plays a
central role for the analysis of grammaticalization phenomena. A case in point
is grammaticalization based on reanalysis: new interpretations of a given
structure arise in contexts where the given structure is ambiguous. The new
interpretation (called 'reanalysis') is closely tied to the structural and
communicative context of the reanalyzed structure. It is neither an intentional
nor a creative act of the speaker. If, for example, in 'I am going to visit
Bill', the 'am going to'-phrase is given a future interpretation, this is
totally compatible with the former directional interpretation, and the speaker
does not recognize the innovation as such. In consequence, the future meaning
can serve as a basis for further developments and, thus, structures such as 'I
am going to like Bill' emerge.

A semiotic approach based for example on Nelson Goodman's theory of symbols
would interpret both scenarios as exemplifying the problem of induction: There
are always numerous true statements that describe a given state of affairs, but
not all of these are general laws. How do we know which properties to ignore and
which to ascribe to new cases? Goodman has famously argued that our choice of
relevant properties is guided by what he calls the ''entrenchment of a
predicate'' - i.e. we choose a predicate that has been used before in relevant
contexts. If the problem of the emergence of linguistic patterns is of this kind
- how do we know which traits of a given utterance are to give rise to a (new)
pattern? - Goodman's paradox makes a strong case for the assumption that context
and usage are the decisive factors in such processes.

Our panel aims at discussing linguistic pattern formation and change in a
cognitive, functional, and semiotic perspective. We expect that the combination
of these different perspectives will generate new insights into the processes of
pattern emergence, especially by focusing on the communicative circumstances and
the discursive context in which an utterance is produced. We welcome both
theoretical and empirical contributions that explore the induction problem that
arises with the emergence of linguistic patterns within and across languages.
