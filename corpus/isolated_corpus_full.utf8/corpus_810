Abstracts are invited for 30-minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for discussion) on topics dealing with formal aspects of Slavic syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology or psycholinguistics.

Abstracts are also invited for a Special Session on ''The development, acquisition and attrition of the Slavic languages''.  Here we seek submissions that explore formal linguistic issues involving first and second language acquisition of Slavic languages, formal analyses of diachronic change of the Slavic languages, of Slavic languages in contact situations, and of the attrition of the Slavic languages in the United States and other non-Slavic contexts.

If you have difficulty submitting the abstract electronically, please contact us about other options.  Preference will be given to presentations not duplicated at other major conferences (e.g., LSA, NELS, WCCFL).
