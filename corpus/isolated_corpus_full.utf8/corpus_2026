>  The International Conference on Computer-Mediated Social   
> Networking (ICCMSN
> 2008) will explore social networking issues  such as formation of  
> online
> communities and how collaboration and  cooperation can be  
> achieved.  The topics
> covered encompass  multiple disciplines, including Computer  
> Science, Sociology,
> Epidemiology, Economics, Marketing, Education, etc.  Some of the   
> applications
> that can benefit from social network structural  models include  
> social norm
> spreading, disease propagation,  opinion dynamics, and collective  
> knowledge
> construction.  Network  topologies can play an important role in these
> applications.  The  conference will examine the links between these  
> topics.
>
> Topics of interest include:
>
>     * How can we facilitate effective structure in a SNS?
>
>     * How can we enable collaboration/cooperation in social networking
> application areas such as education, e-commerce, 		 world-wide
> research etc?
>
>     * How can collective knowledge be constructed and shared?
>
>     * What is the role of network topologies (scale free, small world,
> random) in the areas such as disease spreading, 		 opinion
> dynamics, and norm spreading?
>
>     * How can we model the dynamic growth and shrinkage of online  
> communities?
>
>     * How can software agents be used in the development and  
> simulation of
> on-line societies?
>
>     * How can various Web 2.0 tools be integrated to satisfy the  
> needs of
> electronic communities in a holistic manner?
>
>     * How can realistic virtual environments be modelled, designed and
> developed? What are the issues and solutions?
>
>     * How can high speed networks such as KAREN (Kiwi Advanced  
> Research and
> Education Network, http://www.karen.net.nz/home) facilitate the  
> real world
> experience of virtual environments?
>
>     * How can privacy, security, and trust issues be addressed in  
> on-line
> communities?
