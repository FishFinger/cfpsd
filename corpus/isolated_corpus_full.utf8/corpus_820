*********************************************************************

CALL FOR PAPERS

STUDENT RESEARCH WORKSHOP at ACL-07

June 25th-27th, 2007

Prague, Czech Republic

Submission deadline: January 23, 2007

*********************************************************************

 

1. General Invitation for Submissions

 

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the
general audience and from selected panelists - experienced researchers
who prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

 

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the
emphasis is on work in progress. Original and unpublished research is
therefore invited on all aspects of computational linguistics
including, but not limited to, the following topic areas:

 

. pragmatics and discourse

. semantics and lexicons

. syntax and grammars

. phonetics, phonology, and morphology

. linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language

. information retrieval, information extraction, and question
  answering

. summarization and paraphrasing

. speech recognition and speech synthesis

. corpus-based language modeling

. multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids

. spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems

. multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems

. narrative understanding systems

 

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and
demos. More information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page,
http://www.acl2007.org/.

 

2. Submission Requirements

 

The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with
the opportunity of presenting their work in a formal
setting. Submission will therefore normally be open only to students
who have settled on their thesis direction but who still have
significant research left to do; those students in the final stages of
their thesis and those who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL
Student Research Workshop should submit to the main conference
instead.

 

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers
should clearly indicate directions for future research wherever
appropriate. The papers may have more than one author; however, all
authors MUST be students (graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted
are eligible only if they have not been presented at any other meeting
with publicly available published proceedings. Papers that are being
submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate
this on the submission page.

 

3. Submission Procedure

 

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. These will be available
from the web pages of ACL-07. A description of the format is also
available in case you are unable to use these style files
directly. Submission must be electronic. The only accepted format for
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. More details regarding the submission
procedure will be posted on the workshop website.

 

4. Reviewing Procedure

 

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance
decision will be based on the results of the review.

 

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make
sure your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the
paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: "We showed
previously (Smith, 2001), ...", use citations such as: "Smith (2001)
previously showed ...".

 

5. Schedule

 

The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time January
23, 2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be
automatically disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after
receipt.  Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by
e-mail) on March 23, 2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the
preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors
with their acceptance notice.

 

Important Dates:

 

Paper submission deadline: January 23, 2007

Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007

Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007

Conference date: June 25-27, 2007

 

6. Travel Grants

 

Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to
the Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel
grants, please contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Research Workshop.
