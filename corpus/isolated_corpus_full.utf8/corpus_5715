Meeting Description:

ICCA10 is an international multidisciplinary meeting on conversation analys=
is, which focuses on talk-in-interaction in everyday conversation, institut=
ional and mediated interaction.

Panel/Session: Multimodal Perspectives on Explaining (Panel organizers: Jan=
et Spreckels & Christiane Hohenstein)

With life-long learning becoming the educational norm in many societies, ex=
plaining as a competence is highly in demand. Whereas previous studies have=
 already shed light on certain forms of explaining within professional disc=
ourse scenarios - e.g. in the context of academic presentations (Hohenstein=
 2006) and doctor-patient interactions (Rehbein 1994, Hartog 1996) - we wil=
l expand this investigative focus to include both institutional and non-ins=
titutional scenarios. We will look at settings with different knowledge dis=
tribution (instructor-student relationship, group learning, etc.) and the v=
arious forms of interactivity and co-operation that develop during practica=
lly every process of explaining (cf. Spreckels 2009). In all settings, our =
concern is especially with the multimodality of explanation as determined b=
y:=20

1) Institutional and environmental factors such as training centres, classr=
ooms, family homes etc.=20
2) Equipment such as the combination of white boards, overhead projectors, =
books, student notes as found in many high schools; see Pitsch/Ayass 2008;
3) Multimodal practices and communicative resources such as gestures, mimic=
s, gaze;
4) Multimodal practices and communicative resources in intercultural settin=
gs. More specifically - and in line with the conference theme of next year'=
s ICCA - we aim to describe and illuminate the interplay between these mult=
imodal factors and their relative effects on the explaining process as a wh=
ole.=20

Call for Papers:

Contributions to our panel are expected to address one or more of issues de=
scribed in the Conference Description and should be based on original and e=
mpirically founded studies of explaining. We welcome abstracts of around th=
ree hundred words that include information on the study's guiding research =
question, data set, theoretical background, methodology, and results. The p=
anel format will consist of presentations of 20 minutes each plus 10 minute=
s of individual discussion. There will also be a general discussion of our =
topic at the end.

Sunmission of applications with proposed Title, brief description of data a=
nd content of presentation as well as author(s)' affiliation(s) and address=
(es) until 26th of July 2009.

Detailed Abstracts should be submitted by email to the organisers by email =
before August 10th 2009.=20
