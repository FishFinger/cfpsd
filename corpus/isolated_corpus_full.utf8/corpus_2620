Semantics of Clause-Combining
http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/esslli08/
August 11-15, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008
(http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 
4 - 15 August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany

Workshop Organizers: Uli Sauerland, esslli08@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Workshop Purpose:
Clause combining is on the border between semantics and pragmatics. The
semantics of clause combining has progressed in several key areas in recent
years: the description of perspective shift in various languages, the discovery
of several semantic and syntactic constraints on shifts in subordinated and
otherwise dependent clauses; the development of formal models of inter-clausal
discourse relations like SDRT; and the innovation of new relations between
speech act operators and clause combining. Nevertheless, many questions still
remain, especially concerning the difference in expressibility between
coordination and subordination and indicated vs. un-indicated discourse
relations. This workshop seeks to make progress on the open questions by
connecting the so far unrelated lines of progress pointed out above.

Submission Details: 
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous abstract. Submissions should not
exceed two pages. The following formats are accepted: PDF and ASCII text. Please
