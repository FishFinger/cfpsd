Call For Papers: 
Working Papers in Athabascan/Dene Languages and Linguistics 
Deadline for submission: September 30, 2006 

To be published as Alaska Native Language Center Working Papers No. 6, 
edited by Siri Tuttle, Leslie Saxon, Suzanne Gessner and Andrea Berez. 

Since 2001 the Alaska Native Language Center has annually published the 
proceedings of the Athabascan/Dene Languages Conference in its Working 
Papers series. After the very successful Dene Languages Conference in 
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada in June 2006, we would like to 
continue the annual publication tradition by assembling a collection of 
working papers to be published in late Fall 2006. We welcome submissions 
both from participants in the Yellowknife Conference, and from people who 
were not able to participate. 

Papers are invited on all areas of Athabascan/Dene linguistics, language 
teaching, language policy, and language revitalization. Any topic that 
would be appropriate for presentation at the Athabascan/Dene Languages 
Conference is also appropriate for this Working Papers volume. We 
particularly welcome reports on works-in-progress, explorations of new 
data, and language pedagogy. As with previous Working Papers volumes, 
submissions will be editorially reviewed and publication in the volume does 
not preclude publication elsewhere. 

The deadline for submission is September 30, 2006. Electronic submission is 
encouraged. If possible, submit papers in Microsoft Word format, and 
include copies of all fonts with your submission. Submissions should be 
emailed to aberez@umail.ucsb.edu or andrea.berez@gmail.com. Electronic 
submission is preferred, but papers can be sent via traditional mail to: 

Working Papers 
c/o Siri Tuttle 
Alaska Native Language Center 
Box 757680 
Fairbanks AK 99775-7680 
USA 

The following are some basic style guidelines to follow when preparing your 
paper: 

*Papers should be single spaced. The Working Papers will not be reduced, so 
there is no need to add extra space or make the font large size. 

*There is no predefined page limit, though we expect most contributions 
will not exceed 20 pages. 

*Font: 12 pt. Times for text and subheadings. 

*Margins: 1'' left, right, top. 1.5'' bottom. 

*Numbering: leave pages unnumbered (but pencil in number on back of page if 
submitting via traditional mail). 

*Headings should be formatted as follows: 

Title (bold and centered, 14 point) 
[skip a line] 
Name (centered) 
[skip a line] 
Affiliation (centered) 

*Do not include an abstract in the heading of the paper. 

*Subheadings should be flush left. Subheading 1: bold. Subheading 2: 
italic. Subheading 3: same as normal text. Do not go below subheading 3. 

*Use footnotes, not endnotes. 

Please direct questions to Siri Tuttle ffsgt1@uaf.edu or (907)474-5708.
