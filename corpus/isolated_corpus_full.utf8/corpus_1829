- Character and word processing
- Lexical access
- Sentence processing
- Reading comprehension
- Acquisition and pedagogy (either as a first/ second language)
- Neural mechanisms
- Bilingualism
- Language disorders
- Sign language processing
	
Presentations may be delivered as oral papers or as interactive posters. Each
abstract is limited to 300 words and must be written in English. Please prepare
your abstract as a WORD file with the following information:

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

This conference is the first of a series of three meetings, as part of an
internationalization project between the research centers CELIA Paris, INPA
Manaus, UFAM Manaus, Leiden University, and the VU University Amsterdam. The
themes to be discussed at the first meeting are 'morpho-syntactic alignment' and
'nasal harmony'. Although the nature of the meeting is that of a seminar for
which most of the contributors are individually invited, there is space in the
program for 5 or 6 more speakers, which we hope to be able to invite as a result
of this announcement. Also, the meeting is open for students and scholars that
are interested in assisting without presenting a paper. 

Papers are invited that relate to the themes described below.
Deadline for submission of abstracts, October 1, 2007
Notification of acceptance between October 10 and October 15, 2007
Abstracts should be sent by e-mail to Frantomé Pacheco of the local organizing
committee no later than October 1, 2007: frantome@uol.com.br. Only PDF files
will be accepted. One copy of the abstract should be anonymous both in the body
of the text and the filename, while another copy should be headed by the name of
the author(s) and affiliation. Please make sure all fonts and figures are
correctly rendered. Also attach a separate file containing: title, author's name
and address, affiliation and e-mail address. 

Description of the conference themes (only submissions that deal with these
themes will be considered for presentation)

The term ''vowel harmony'' is generally used either to designate long distance
nasal spreading (i.e. spreading of the nasal feature beyond the immediately
contiguous segment), or to refer to a type of contrastive nasality in languages
where the nasal feature seems to characterize a prosodic constituent or a
morpheme, rather than a segment. Nasal harmony systems are regularly found in
South-American languages, where their presence often goes hand in hand with the
existence of contour stops comprising a nasal and an oral phase in syllables
with an oral nucleus, which, in turn, typically arise in consonant systems in
which a triple voiceless-voiced-nasal contrast is lacking. Recent research on
nasal harmony has aimed at identifying the relevant phonological and
morphological parameters involved in nasal harmony systems, often based on
secondary data. In addition, various proposals were made to explain the
emergence of contour segments as the manifestation of underlying sonority, or as
the phonetic enhancement of voicing. For the African language Ikwere, Clements
and Osu have demonstrated the relevance of a class of non-obstruent sounds which
'naturally' combine with nasality. In the light of Clements and Osu's findings,
it seems worthwhile to study the aerodynamic properties of voiced stops in
South-American languages that have nasal harmony, to see if the Ikwere
explanation can be extended to these languages. For this conference, papers
featuring research based on primary data and careful laboratory analysis that
could shed new light on the parameters and properties of nasal harmony systems
in South-American lowland languages, on the relation (if any) between the
underlying consonant system and the emergence of contour stops, or on the
aerodynamic properties of segments that are targets for nasal spreading are
solicited.
