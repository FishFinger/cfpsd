Meeting Description:

The vitality of research on word classes is a major aspect of current lingu=
istics in several of its articulations. It is likely and desirable that new=
 horizons open and that the various perspectives interlace to increase our =
knowledge in this field of research.

In this framework, the TRIPLE Laboratory at Roma Tre University organizes a=
 3-day International Conference on 'Word Classes' with the following goals:

-Fostering a balanced evaluation of what is being done in the field of Word=
 Classes research;
-Gathering and discussing original pieces of research;
-Fostering the links between distinct disciplines concerned with the field.

Keynote Speakers:

-William Croft (Southwestern University)
-Alessandro Lenci (Universit=E0 di Pisa)
-Beth Levin (Stanford University)
-Thomas Stolz (Universit=E4t Bremen)=20

Call for Papers:

We invite, starting from September 15, 2009, the submission of abstracts of=
 original papers for approx 12 presentations of 40 minutes each (30 minutes=
 for the talk plus 10 for discussion). Should the accepted submission excee=
d the indicated number of slots, a reduction of talking time will be consid=
ered.

Abstracts are supposed to address one or more of the following topics:

-Word classes and sub-classes: particularities, criteria of definition, exe=
mplification
-Word classes and constructions
-Syntactic and semantic properties of word classes (e.g. external structure=
 of words, semantic representation of word classes)
-Continua between classes (verbs with nominal features, nouns with verbal f=
eatures, adjectives and verbs, etc.)
-Neglected or scarcely studied word classes (prepositions, conjunctions, et=
c.)
-'Possible' and 'impossible' words
-Typological and comparative analyses of word classes and word class system=
s
-Computational representations and recognition algorithms for all the above=
 topics

Abstracts must not exceed 2500 characters (short bibliography included) and=
 must be sent electronically in BOTH word AND pdf format to triple@uniroma3=
.it

They must respect the following constraints:=20

-To be anonymous: name(s) of authors, e-mail address(es) and affiliation(s)=
 must be indicated in the body of the e-mail.=20
-The associated bibliography must avoid any reference to a recognizably hig=
h number of author(s)' works.=20
-E-mail subject has to be only ''Word Classes abstract submission''.=20

Official conference languages are English and Italian.

Submitted abstracts will be evaluated by an international refereeing commit=
tee on a double-blind review basis.

Important Dates/Deadlines:

-Abstracts accepted from: September 15, 2009
-Abstract submission deadline: November 15, 2009
-Notification of acceptance: December 15, 2010
-Definitive programme: January 10, 2010
-Registration open: January 15, 2010
