Subject: Formal Approaches to Variation in Syntax 

	

Full Title: Formal Approaches to Variation in Syntax 

Date: 10-May-2007 - 13-May-2007
Location: York, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: William Haddican
Meeting Email: lang6@york.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

The goal of this conference is to bring together scholars focusing on
intra-speaker variation in syntax in an effort to stimulate theoretical debate
in this area. 

Formal Approaches to Variation in Syntax

Second Call for papers

The Kings Manor, York, England, May 10-13, 2007

Within the last few years, syntacticians have begun to take an interest in
intra-speaker variation to a degree that was hitherto unknown. Previously, only
those syntacticians interested in diachronic variation--led by Kroch
and colleagues--devoted much attention to the issue of how variation can be
dealt with formally (Kroch 1989, 1994, 2001, Kroch and Taylor 1995, 2000,
Pintzuk 1991). Formal syntax has otherwise largely ignored the type of data
that sociolinguistic variationists attach so much importance to quantifying,
either because they had nothing to say about it or because they felt that in the
grammar of the idealised speaker-hearer there would (or even could) be no
variation. The advent of minimalism, which generally eschews the possibility of
optionality in grammar, has prompted some syntacticians to take a greater
interest in variability, in order to explain it without reference to ''free
variation.'' Recent literature, then, has seen several promising new formal
approaches to intra-speaker variation in syntax (Adger 2006, Yang 2000, Henry
1995, Clark 2004, Asudeh 2001).

The goal of this conference is to bring together current researchers in this
area in an effort to stimulate debate on issues such as the following:

-Is variability in child language at the root of syntactic change or is
variation in the adult grammar a necessary impetus?
-What is the relationship between intra-speaker and inter-speaker variation
in syntax?
-What formal and syntactic mechanisms best explain the existence of
intra-speaker variation?
-Are frequencies of variants (partially) predictable from the formal
properties (e.g. features) involved?
-What if any is the role of parameters in intra-speaker variation?

Invited Speakers:

David Adger
Sjef Barbiers
Joan Bresnan
Tony Kroch
Charles Yang


The conference will run from Thursday evening to Saturday evening. Researchers
in this area are invited to submit abstracts for presentations of 35 minutes,
with an additional 10 minutes allotted for questions. (Invited speaker
presentations will be 45 minutes in length with an additional 15 minutes for
questions.) We intend to approach publishers with a view to publishing an edited
volume of selected papers following the conference. Preference will be given to
papers which address the issues outlined above and related formal issues rather
than merely providing detailed analysis of a piece of variation. We encourage
syntacticians of all theoretical persuasions to apply.

Abstracts of no more than 2 pages (A4 or 8.5'' x 11'') should be sent to
lang6@york.ac.uk by March 1, 2007. Please send two copies of each abstract, one
in camera ready form for inclusion in the abstract booklet with
speakers' names, affiliation and email addresses, and another anonymised,
both in pdf format. Notifications of acceptance will be sent by March 15th
2007.

Organisers:

Bernadette Plunkett and Bill Haddican (University of York Linguistics)
