Language Policy involves any action established by a society regarding language

administered within national and local governments, the courts, the workplace,
the media, and education systems. Matters of interest to Language Planning

which languages will be taught in the school system, and bilingualism planning;
as well as the linguistic industries driven by the market in the process of
globalization. Under this rubric, abstracts of not more than 425 words are
solicited on such topics as:

Language Planning and Globalization 
Spanish in the United States
French and English in Canada 
Indigenous /Endangered/Minority languages
Languages in Contact
Pidgins and Creoles			
Language Planning in Education

Policies on Bilingualism
Official Language Policy
Creoles and Standardization
Human and Machine Translation Industry
Language Planning and Human Development
Immigrant Languages
Dialects and Standardization
 
While papers on the main topic are particularly welcome, individuals are
encouraged to submit abstracts on any subject in theoretical and applied
linguistics.

Submit abstracts in an anonymous, titled, single-spaced attachment of not more
than 425 words in length, with name, address and affiliation in the body of an
email.  Please send abstract as a camera-ready attachment (in a Microsoft Word
file, if possible) to the conference coordinator, Annika Wendt
(annikawendt@yahoo.com). Within the body of the email, please also indicate any
audio-visual equipment needed. 

Those wishing to propose panels or special sessions should contact the
conference chair, Kathleen O'Connor-Bater (oconnorbaterk@oldwestbury.edu) before
