Meeting Description:

The theme of Georgetown University Round Table 2010 centers on the Arabic
language. Arabic is one of the official languages of the United Nations, spoken
by more than half a billion people around the world, and is of increasing
importance in political and economic spheres. 

The study of the Arabic language has a long and rich history: Earliest
grammatical accounts date from the 8th century, and included full syntactic,
morphological and phonological analyses of the vernaculars and of Classical and
Modern Standard Arabic -- the religious language of the Quran and the language
of poetry. In recent years the academic study of Arabic has become increasingly
sophisticated and broad. 

GURT 2010 seeks to explore the Arabic language from a variety of perspectives
including research from the following linguistic subfields: Syntax, Semantics,
Morphology, Phonology and Phonetics, Computational linguistics, Historical
linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Anthropological linguistics. 

Call for Papers

We invite researchers engaged in the analysis of Arabic to share original
research in areas of Arabic language study, including but not limited to:
- Syntax, Semantics, Morphology, Phonology and Phonetics
- Computational analysis
- Historical analysis
- Sociolinguistics
- Anthropological linguistics
- Discourse Analysis
- Teaching and Learning of Arabic

Presentation formats include:
(1) Colloquia: Scheduled for 2-hour blocks. Colloquium organizers may organize
as they choose, but time should be allocated for opening and closing remarks,
presentations, discussion and audience response. Organizers serve as the liaison
between participants and the conference organizers. Organizers may choose to
participate in the panel as a presenter or discussant.

(2) Individual papers: 20 minutes long with a 10-minute discussion period.

(3) Poster presentations: displayed for a 2-hour block of time; an opportunity
to report on work in progress in one-on-one discussions.

Submission deadline November 15, 2009. Notification of proposal acceptance:
December 15, 2009. A prize will be awarded to the best student presentation or
poster; no separate application is needed.
