*** Call for Journal Articles ***

Special Issue: LDV Forum 2008, Vol. 23(2)
Title: 'Automatic Genre Identification: State of the Art, Issues, and
Prospects'

Guest Editors: M. Santini, G. Rehm, S. Sharoff,  A. Mehler

Description

The popularity of the World Wide Web has given rise to distinct forms of
information-seeking behaviour and new interaction styles, but we have not
fully understood what these forms are nor their implication for the
development of new applications to assist users in the tasks they perform
online on a day-to-day basis. We believe that the concept of genre have a
significant impact on the future of web information seeking and
interaction, and our common goal is to explore the possibility of meeting
users' needs by filtering or organizing information by genre. 

There are several reasons why Automatic Genre Identification is still only
a niche research area. Among others, it seems to be very difficult to agree
upon a shared definition of genre, and a shared set of genre categories.
Another major problem is the lack of a genre benchmark to perform objective
evaluations of categorisation approaches.

Regardless all these difficulties, 2007 has been an important year for
research on genres of digital documents. In addition to the genre minitrack
at the annual Hawaii' International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS,
usually held in January), three other events have added findings to genre
research, namely the Colloquium *Towards a Reference Corpus of Web Genres*,
held in conjunction with Corpus Linguistics 2007 in Birmingham (UK), the
Workshop *Towards Genre-Enabled Search Engines: The Impact of NLP* held in
conjunction with RANLP 2007, at Bovorets (Bulgaria), and finally the Panel
*Towards the Use of Genre to Improve Search in Digital Libraries: Where Do
We Go from Here?* sponsored by SIG-CR and SIG-HCI and held in conjunction
with ASIST 2007 Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA).

This LDV special issue on genre originates from the organisers of the
colloquium and the workshop mentioned in the previous paragraph.
Contributors to these events are encouraged to submit fully-revised and
extended articles based on their workshop papers or colloquium abstracts,
enhanced with additional findings and more in-depth analyses. 

***We also encourage other researchers to submit articles to the special
issue.***

The main themes that we would like to focus on this issue are:

* the construction of reference corpora of web genres
* the inclusion of genre classes in IR systems and automatic document
categorisation
* investigations on users' behavior with regards to searching by genre
