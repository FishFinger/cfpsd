Meeting Description:

Gesture session at AFLiCo3, University of Paris 10-Nanterre, May 27-29, 2009
'Multimodality and grammatical integration'

Organizers:
Ellen Fricke, European University Viadrana, Frankfurt/Oder

Simon Harrison, University of Bordeaux 3
(simon.harrison@ens-lyon.fr) 

Call for Papers

Much research in cognitive linguistics now adopts a multimodal view of language,
i.e. "gestures are an integral part of language" (McNeill 1992: 2).
Nevertheless, there is no obvious or single way to describe how gestures are
integrated with language. In the current theme session we propose to investigate
this problem from the perspective of grammar.

We invite contributions that address the following broad questions: Are gestures
integrated with grammar during speech? If so, how can we identify and describe
this integration? The questions can be approached from a variety of
perspectives, which might include (but are not limited to):

- locating integration
- types, degrees, levels, and hierarchies of integration
- 'grammatical' phenomena: negation, quantification, topicalisation,
co-ordination, etc.
- processes of conventionality, schematicity, abstraction, and type construction
- theoretical perspectives: e.g. construction grammars, cognitive grammars,
grammaticalization theory
- comparisons between spoken and signed languages

Abstract submission: The deadline for submitting abstracts is November 24 2008.
Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (references excluded). Please send two
copies of your abstract by email: one anonymous and one including name and
affiliation of author(s). In the main body of the email, specify author(s),
affiliation(s), title of talk, and 3-5 keywords. We will notify applicants by
mid-December. Presentations will be allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for
questions. There will be a slot reserved for a more general discussion at the
end of the session. For information and abstract submission please contact Simon
Harrison at simon.harrison@ens-lyon.fr. To visit the AFLiCo 3 conference website
