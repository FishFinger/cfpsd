Meeting Description:

New Perspectives on Irish-English aims to assess the contemporary state of =
the
field. It aims to identify the main gaps through comparison with research o=
n
other varieties of English and with research methodologies used in differen=
t
domains of linguistics, and thus define potential future directions for res=
earch.=20

Call for Papers

The distinctive structural properties of the varieties of English spoken in
Ireland have attracted much attention. Research has generally focused on
divergent morphological, syntactic and phonological features, their origins=
 and
to some extent their development. However, there has been relatively little
cross-fertilization between the different research foci/agendas. Equally
noteworthy is the fact that there is comparatively little research on the
phonetics, sociolinguistics and pragmatics of Irish English. For instance, =
most
studies focus heavily on conservative rural and working class urban populat=
ions,
while there is little published research on middle class varieties, issues =
of
language and identity (e.g. the role of distinctive Irish English features =
in
the construction of middle class and urban identities, including among newc=
omers
to Ireland), and the social stratification of English in the larger urban
centres or in rural areas in general.=20

Sessions will focus on=20
-  formal approaches (including phonology/phonetics, syntax/morpho-syntax)
-  historical approaches including language contact (e.g. substrate influen=
ces
from Irish)
-  sociolinguistic and linguistic anthropological approaches (e.g. social
stratification, language & identity, language attitudes, usage patterns by
indigenous, immigrant and 'diaspora' populations)
-  pragmatic approaches (e.g. politeness, encoding of status.=20

We also encourage submission of papers focusing on comparisons with researc=
h on
other varieties of English and similar contact-settings. The conference wil=
l end
with a round table discussion.

We welcome abstracts in any of the areas listed above. Anonymous abstracts
should not exceed one page. A single additional page may be added with exam=
ples
and references. Name, affiliation and contact details should be provided in=
 the
accompanying e-mail. Please indicate whether the submission is for an oral =
or
poster session.=20

Abstracts should be sent to: jhiconferences@ucd.ie
Deadline: 16th November.
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 21st December.

The conference is being organised by Bettina Migge and M=E1ire N=ED Chios=
=E1in of, the
School of Irish, Celtic Studies, Irish Folklore and Linguistics, UCD, in
conjunction with the UCD John Hume Institute for Global Irish Studies.
