                              ACL-08:HLT
                          Second Workshop on
         SYNTAX AND STRUCTURE IN STATISTICAL TRANSLATION (SSST-2)

                       June 2008, Columbus, Ohio
                  =

The Second Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation
(SSST-2) seeks to build on the foundations established in the first
SSST which was held as an AMTA-sponsored workshop at NAACL-HLT
2007. SSST-1 brought together a large number of researchers working on
diverse aspects of synchronous/transduction grammars (hereafter,
S/TGs) in relation to statistical machine translation. Its program
comprised high-quality papers discussing current work spanning topics
including: new grammatical models of translation; discriminative
training of syntax-based models; using S/TGs for semantics and
generation; syntax-based evaluation of machine translation; and formal
properties of S/TGs.

The need for structural mappings between languages is widely
recognized in the fields of statistical machine translation and spoken
language translation, and there is a growing consensus that these
mappings are appropriately represented using S/TGs and their
tree-transducer equivalents. To date, flat-structured models, such as
the word-based IBM models of the early 1990s or the more recent
phrase-based models, remain widely used. But tree-structured mappings
arguably offer a much greater potential for learning valid
generalizations about relationships between languages. Within this
area of research there is a rich diversity of approaches, and recent
years have seen significant progress on many fronts.

SSST-2 seeks to bring together researchers in these diverse areas,
providing a forum for discussing recent results, comparing and
contrasting different approaches, and identifying the questions that
are most pressing for future progress in this field. We invite papers
on:

  * syntax-based / tree-structured statistical translation models
    and language models
  * machine learning techniques for inducing structured translation
    models
  * algorithms for training, decoding, and scoring with S/TGs
  * empirical studies on adequacy and efficiency of formalisms
  * studies on the usefulness of syntactic resources for translation
  * formal properties of S/TGs
  * scalability of structured translation methods to small or large data
  * applications of S/TGs to related areas including:
    * speech translation
    * formal semantics and semantic parsing
    * paraphrases and textual entailment
    * information retrieval and extraction
