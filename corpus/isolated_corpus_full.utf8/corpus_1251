research results on systems issues in the area of embedded, networked
sensors. Distributed systems based on networked sensors and actuators
with embedded computation capabilities enable an instrumentation
of the physical world at an unprecedented scale and density, thus
enabling a new generation of monitoring and control applications. This
conference provides an ideal venue to address the research challenges
facing the design, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these
systems. Sensor networks require contributions from many fields, from .....

  Special session on: Evolutionary Computation in Games
  p.hingston@ecu.edu.au

Dear Games Researcher,

This email is to remind you about the special session on evolutionary
computation in games to be held at the upcoming IEEE Congress on
Evolutionary Computation (CEC'07).  CEC'07 will be held in Singapore
from 25-28 September 2007.


Special session on: Evolutionary Computation in Games
=====================================================

Games have proven to be an ideal test domain for the study of evolutionary
algorithms as not only are they fun to play and interesting to observe,
but they provide competitive and dynamic environments that model many
real-world problems.  Evolutionary techniques have successfully been
applied to many different kinds of games, however a number of research
questions still remain.  This special session aims to bring together
leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to
discuss recent advances and explore future directions in this field.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: .....

---------------
In recent years, there has been significant increase in Internet attacks,
such as DDoS, viruses, worms, spyware, and malware, etc, causing huge
economical and social damage. While the attack systems have become more
easy-to-use, sophisticated, and powerful, interest has greatly increased
in the field of building more effective, intelligent, and active defense
systems which are distributed and networked. We will focus our program on
issues related to Network and System Security, such as authentication,
access control, availability, integrity, privacy, confidentiality,
dependability and sustainability of network defense systems. We also
welcome research reports on network attack systems; because we believe
only by fully understanding the attack mechanisms can we perform .....

CALL FOR PAPERS


Sensor nodes are tiny autonomous devices that combine sensing, computing
and wireless communication capabilities. These nodes are deeply embedded
into the physical surroundings, and gather and process information such
as temperature, humidity, light characteristics, seismic activities or
images and sound samples from the physical world. Networked systems
of such sensors are expected to be used in a variety of applications
including habitat monitoring, precision agriculture, disaster recovery .....
