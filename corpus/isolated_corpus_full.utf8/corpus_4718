Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Traditionally, melodic primitives are linked with structural positions, with the
implication that melody specifies phonetic properties such as voicing or place
of articulation, whereas the structural positions themselves are devoid of
phonetic content. This distinction between melody and structure appears to be
widely accepted, even among 'phonetically based' approaches to phonology.

For example, Steriade (1997) presents a cue-based account of laryngeal
neutralizations in various languages, which is presented largely as a refutation
of a 'licensing by prosody' (e.g. Ito 1986) approach that relates the presence
or absence of laryngeal contrasts to questions of syllable structure. Recent
proposals in element theory (Jensen 1994, Pochtrager 2006) replace melodic
properties with structural configurations, but nevertheless assume that melody
and structure are different representational species. 

Call for Papers

Melody vs. Structure in Phonological Representations

Session at the 40th Poznan Linguistic Meeting. 2-5 September. Gniezno, Poland.

This session seeks to examine the underlying assumption of a melody/ structure
dichotomy. We are particularly interested in the following questions. Are
'licensing by cue' and 'licensing by prosody' mutually exclusive. Can we really
separate melody and structure? If not, how do melody and structure interact? Is
structure really phonetically bare? If not, what defines it?

In keeping with the leitmotif for this year's PLM ('Variants, Variation,
Variability'), we especially welcome papers comparing a variety of approaches to
the melody/structure problem, or those investigating representational
implications of cross-linguistic variation.

You may upload your abstracts (no more than two pages including examples and
references) at the PLM website (http://ifa.amu.edu.pl/plm/Home). Please also
send a copy of your abstract to session organizer Geoff Schwartz
(geoff@ifa.amu.edu.pl). The deadline for submission is May 1st.

Hope to see you.
