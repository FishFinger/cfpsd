Meeting Description:

12th European Workshop on Natural Language Generation (ENLG 2009)
http://enlg2009.uvt.nl/

ENLG 2009 is organized as an EACL workshop, and will take place on 30 and 31
March 2009 in Athens, Greece. It continues a biennial series of workshops on
natural language generation that has been running since 1987, providing a
regular forum for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG
specialists and for researchers from other areas. ENLG 2009 includes two special
events. To begin, the Generation Challenges 2009 will be held in conjunction
with ENLG 2009, as an umbrella event designed to bring together three different
shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of natural language.
In addition, ENLG 2009 will have a special track devoted to the generation of
vague language based on exact input data.

ENLG 2009 is organized as an EACL workshop, and will take place on 30 and 31
March 2009 in Athens, Greece.

The ENLG 2009 workshop continues a biennial series of workshops on natural
language generation that has been running since 1987, providing a regular forum
for presentation of research in this area, both for NLG specialists and for
researchers from other areas. ENLG 2009 includes two special events. To begin,
the Generation Challenges 2009 (see
http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09) will be held in conjunction
with ENLG 2009, as an umbrella event designed to bring together three different
shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of natural language.
The Generation Challenges are organized by Anja Belz, Albert Gatt and Eric Kow.
In addition, ENLG 2009 will have a special track devoted to the generation of
vague language based on exact input data.

ENLG 2009 invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all
topics related to natural language generation. Topics of interest include:

- Affective / emotional generation
- Content and text planning
- Generation for embodied agents and robots
- Evaluation of NLG systems
- Text-to-text generation
- Lexicalisation
- Multimedia or multimodal generation
- Story-telling and narrative generation
- NLG for real-world applications
- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks
- Personalization and personality of text
- Psycholinguistics and NLG
- Referring expression generation
- Statistical processing for NLG
- Surface realization
- Use of ontologies in NLG
- Vague expressions and large database [special track]

Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at ENLG 2009 must not have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Submission
to other conferences should be clearly indicated on the paper.

Category of Papers: ENLG has two submission categories, long and short papers:
- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research results
and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references (these will be orally
presented);
- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort
and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these will be
presented as posters during the poster session).

Paper Submission: Submissions should be uploaded to the Start web site for the
workshop (to be made available). The only accepted format for submitted papers
is Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings. Use of the ACL style files is strongly recommended (see
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors).  
Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors within the
paper. Please note that papers for the shared tasks should be submitted via the
Generation Challenges website.

If authors have any questions, they should contact the workshop organizers.

Committee.

Call Deadline: 23-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

We use the term User-Language to refer to the natural language input of users
interacting with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 

Call for Papers 

The primary characteristics of user-language are that it is short (typically a
single sentence) and that it is unedited (e.g., it is replete with typographical
errors and lacking in grammaticality). We use the term paraphrase to refer to
ITS users' attempt to restate a given target sentence in their own words such
that a produced sentence, or user response, has the same meaning as the target
sentence. 

The corpus in this challenge comprises 1998 target-sentence/student response
text-pairs, or protocols. The protocols have been evaluated by expert human
raters along 10 dimensions of paraphrase characteristics. 
Along with the protocols, the database comprising the challenge includes 10
computational indices that have been used to assess these protocols. 
The challenge we pose for researchers is to describe and assess their own
approach (computational or statistical) to evaluating, characterizing, and/or
categorizing, any, some, or all of the paraphrase dimensions in this corpus. 

The purpose of establishing such evaluations of user-language paraphrases is so
that ITSs may provide users with accurate assessment and subsequently
facilitative feedback, such that the assessment would be comparable to one or
more trained human raters. As such, these evaluations will help to develop the
field of natural language assessment and understanding.

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting 
guidelines. The papers should be original work (i.e., not submitted, in
submission, or submitted to another conference while in review). Papers should
not exceed 6 pages, are due by November 23rd, 2008, and should be submitted to
the ANLP special track for FLAIRS-22. Papers will be refereed and all accepted
papers will appear in the conference proceedings which will be published by AAAI
Press. Please see 
http://www.msstate.edu/dept/english/applied_nlp/flairs_2009 for more details.
