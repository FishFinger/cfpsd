Second Call for Papers

Special Guest Speaker
Professor Tania Ionin of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be
giving a special talk entitled Second Language Acquisition of Articles.

Submission Deadline: Friday, February 27, 2009
Acceptance Notification: Friday, April 10, 2009

The PLA Symposium 2009 endeavors to provide graduate students from various
disciplines related to linguistics opportunities to interact with those both
inside and outside their respective disciplines.  This year, we will have a
special panel on language acquisition as part of the Symposium.  Accepted papers
will be considered for publication in the next issue of the PLA Working Papers.

Special Session: Language Acquisition
Is there universality in language acquisition?  What is the role of the first
language in second language acquisition?  What is the role of UG?  How does
language acquisition research contribute to theoretical frameworks?  The special
session aims to address some of these questions from theoretical, experimental,
and pedagogical viewpoints.  We are especially interested in hearing papers on a
variety of linguistic subfields on the topic of language acquisition.  The
special session will be followed by a general discussion.

General Session:  We invite submissions for abstracts for 20-minute
presentations in any area related to linguistics, including, but not limited to:
Phonetics
Phonology
Syntax
Semantics
Sociolinguistics
Pragmatics
Psycholinguistics
Historical Linguistics
Anthropological Linguistics
Computational Linguistics
Second Language Writing
Speech and Hearing Sciences

- 500 words maximum
- 2 pages maximum (second page may be used for tables, figures, and references)

abstract
