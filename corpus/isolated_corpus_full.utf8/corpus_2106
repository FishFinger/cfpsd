The first international conference of Arabic Planning Laboratory:
Comparative Arabic Linguistics

The conference offers a highly developed framework for the study of linguistic
variation, both across adjacent dialects (micro-variation) and across closely
related languages in terms of different linguistic patterns that diverge, to
some extent, typologically and historically (macro-variation).
The conference devotes a special workshop to theoretical and applied linguistics
studies engaged in computational linguistics and lexicography. 
A concise abstract with a list of references (written in Arabic, English or
French) are to be sent before the 29th of February 2008 to one of the following
addresses:
