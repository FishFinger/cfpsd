INitiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval (INEX)

Call for participation INEX 2008

REGISTRATION NOW OPEN AT http://www.inex.otago.ac.nz


OVERVIEW

INEX 2008 is examining focused (or sub-document) retrieval using the
Wikipedia Collection.  For the main ad hoc retrieval track the
collection will be made available in Plain Text as well as XML so that
also non-XML based passage retrieval systems can be used. Other tracks
are: Book Searching (using a collection of full text books in XML),
Efficiency, Entity Ranking, Interactive (iTrack), Question Answering
(QA@INEX), Link-the-Wiki, and XML-Mining. All INEX Participants are
expected to participate in topic creation, and assessment.


TASKS AND TRACKS

* Ad hoc Track -- The main track of INEX 2008 will investigate the
   effectiveness of XML-IR and Passage Retrieval for three ad hoc
   retrieval tasks (Focused, Relevant in Context, Best in Context).

* Book Searching Track --  Investigating information access to, and IR
   techniques for searching full texts of digitized books.

* Efficiency Track -- Investigating both the effectiveness and
   efficiency of XML ranked retrieval approaches on real data and real
   queries.

* Entity Ranking Track -- Investigating entity retrieval rather than
   text retrieval: 1) Entity Ranking, 2) Entity List Completion.

* Interactive Track (iTrack) --  Investigating the behavior of users
   when interacting with XML documents, as well as develop retrieval
   approaches which are effective in user-based environments.

* Question Answering (QA@INEX) Track -- Investigating technology for
   accessing semi-structured data can be used to address real-world
   focused information needs formulated as natural language questions.

* Link-the-Wiki Track - Investigating link discovery between Wikipedia
   documents, both at the file level and at the element level.

* XML-Mining Track - Investigating structured document mining,
   especially the classification and clustering of semi-structured
   documents.


A detailed description of each of the tracks can be found at
http://www.inex.otago.ac.nz/.

RELEVANCE ASSESSMENTS

Relevance assessments will be provided by the participating groups
using the INEX assessment system. Each participating organization will
judge about 3 topics. Please note that the assessment of each topic
may take one-person 1 to 2 days to complete!

WORKSHOP AND PROCEEDINGS

Participants will be able to present their approaches and the final
results at the INEX workshop to be held in December at Schloss
Dagstuhl, Germany. All participants will be able to publish their work
in the workshop pre-proceedings.  Fully peer-reviewed and revised
papers will be published in the INEX post-workshop final
proceedings. Since 2004 the final proceedings have been published in
the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and we
hope to continue that tradition.
