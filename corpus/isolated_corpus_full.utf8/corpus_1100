Meeting Description:

Call for Papers: 'Speech and language technology for less-resourced languages'
Two-hour Special Session at Interspeech 2007, Antwerp, Belgium, August 27-31 2007 

Call for Papers

    ''Speech and language technology for less-resourced languages''

   Two-hour Special Session at Interspeech 2007, Antwerp, Belgium
      
                   www.interspeech2007.org

Speech and language technology researchers who work on less-resourced languages
often have very limited access to funding, equipment and software. This makes it
all the more important for them to come together to share best practice, in
order to avoid a duplication of effort. This special session will therefore be
devoted to speech and language technology for less-resourced languages.

In view of the limited resources available to the targeted researchers, there
will be a particular emphasis on ''free'' software, which may be either
open-source or closed-source. However, submissions are also invited from those
using commercial software.

Topics may include (but are not limited to) the following:

    - Examples of systems built using free or purpose-built software (possibly
with demonstrations).
    - Presentations of bugs in free software, and strategies for dealing with them.
    - Presentations of additions and enhancements made to the software by a
research group.
    - Presentations of linguistic challenges for a particular less-resourced
language.
    - Descriptions of desired features for possible future implementation. 

Submission:

Researchers who are interested in contributing to this special session are
invited to submit either a paper or a demo or both, as follows.

   1. Papers can be submitted by proceeding according to the regular submission
procedure of Interspeech 2007 and selecting ''Speech and language technology for
less-resourced languages'' as the topic of your first choice. The paper
submission deadline is March 23, 2007.
   
   2. We offer a light submission procedure for demos. (Please note: unlike
regular papers, texts submitted with a demo will not be published in the
proceedings, but will be made available for download from the SALTMIL website at
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/saltmil/ ). In this case, please submit a short
description of the system demonstrated, the demo, required materials for the
demo, and references, to the first of the session organisers (see below) and to
special_sessions@interspeech2007.org before April 27, 2007. Demo submission
texts should be formatted in accordance with the Interspeech 2007 author kit,
and should be between 1 and 4 pages in length.
