The Third Symposium on Statistical Machine Translation (SSMT-2007)
Call for papers

August 12-13, 2007, Harbin

http://mitlab.hit.edu.cn/ssmt2007.html

Following the successes of the Symposiums on SMT in 2005 and later in 2006, 
the Third Symposium on SMT (SSMT-2007) will be held in Harbin, Heilongjiang,
China during August 12-13, 2007.
In this symposium, we focus on the statistical modeling of translation 
between Chinese and English, which involves the analysis of parallel corpora, 
the automatic construction of machine translation systems and the evaluation 
of the system performance. Nevertheless the impact of other technologies like
rule based method and example based method in so-called ¡°hybrid machine 
translation system¡± will also be investigated in detail.
In addition to soliciting research papers, the symposium is also featured 
by a shared task: the word alignment and the translation between Chinese 
and English.

Therefore, two types of submissions are invited: 

  1) technical papers on related issues, and 
  2) participants in any track of the shared task.

Technical Paper

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

  Word-based, phrase-based, syntax-based, semantic-based approaches on SMT
  Various parallel corpus processing techniques, 
      e.g. annotation, word alignment, structure alignment
  Training algorithms for SMT 
  Decoding algorithms for SMT
  Incorporation of rule-based and/or example-based MT with SMT 
  Evaluation measures of MT

Shared Task

The symposium organizers will provide common test sets for the following
three tasks:

  Word alignment for Chinese English parallel corpus
  Chinese-English machine translation
  English-Chinese machine translation

Participants may submit results for any or all of the evaluation tasks. 
A more detailed description of the shared task (including information 
about the test and training corpora and the evaluation measures) is 
available from the SSMT-2007 website (http://mitlab.hit.edu.cn/ssmt2007.html).

Submission Information

Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages in A4 size, 
providing abstracts, key words, author names, affiliations, post addresses 
and email addresses. The paper can be prepared either in Chinese or English, 
but the paper written in Chinese should provide an English abstract. 
All papers will be submitted electronically in Word or PDF format 
(fonts must be plugged in PDF so that the papers can displayed on different 
computers) to ssmt2007@mtlab.hit.edu.cn, containing "SSMT-2007" in the 
subject of the e-mail.

The paper accepted for presentation at the symposium cannot have been 
published in any other journals or presented at any other meeting with 
publicly available published proceedings. The accepted paper may be 
recommended to publish in the Journal of Chinese Information Processing.

Important Dates

    * June 30, 2007: Deadline for paper submissions 
    * July 15, 2007: Notification
    * July 25, 2007: Deadline for camera-ready versions

    * July 15, 2007: Test data issue
    * July 20, 2007: Result submission due
    * July 25, 2007: Evaluation result issue

Related details in technical program, registration and accommodation of the 
symposium will be soon announced in the website.
