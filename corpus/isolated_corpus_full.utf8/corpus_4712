Meeting Description:

This workshop is organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic,
Language and Information ESSLLI 2009 http://esslli2009.labri.fr to be held in
Bordeaux (20-31 July, 2009) and is supported by the Department of Psychology of
University of Milan-Bicocca. 

Second Call for Papers  

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2009  

Workshop Topics: 
The grammars of sign languages are as highly complex as the grammars of spoken
languages and share with them many universal features, despite the difference in
modality between spoken languages (which use the auditory channel) and sign
languages (which use the visual channel). Yet, sign languages also differ from
spoken languages in radical ways: morphological information in sign languages is
often conveyed simultaneously by different articulators rather than 
linearly; moreover, certain aspects of their phonological, syntactic and
semantic structures are not commonly found in spoken languages. These
differences raise an interesting challenge for existing formal linguistic
frameworks, which are designed to account for the grammars of spoken languages.
By bringing together formal linguists working on sign languages, the workshop
should contribute to meet this challenge. 

Submission Details: 
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous abstract (personal information should
appear in the text of the e-mail accompanying the abstract). Submissions should
not exceed 500 words. The following formats are accepted: PDF, Word, RTF. Please
send your submission electronically to carlo.cecchetto@unimib.it by the deadline
listed below. The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme
committee and additional reviewers. The accepted papers will appear 
in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. 

Workshop Format: 
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second
week of ESSLLI. There will be approximately 10 slots for selected papers (20
minutes for talk + 10 for discussion) and 3 invited talks. 

Invited Speakers: 
Mark Aronoff (Stony Brook University) 
Diane Lillo-Martin (University of Connecticut) 
Josep Quer (Pompeu Fabra University) 

Important Dates: 
Submissions: March 31, 2009 
Notification: April 15, 2009 
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2009

Workshop dates: 27-31 July, 2009 

Local Arrangements: 
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register 
for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will correspond 
to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee. Moreover, a number of 
additional fee waiver grants will be made available on a competitive basis and 
workshop participants are eligible to apply for those. There will be no
reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. Workshop speakers who have
difficulty in finding funding should contact the local organizing committee to
ask for the possibilities for a grant.
