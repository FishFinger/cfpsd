DEADLINE 20th June 2009 (0:00  GMT+2)

Workshop on: Multilingual resources, technologies and evaluation for =20
Balkan and Slavic
languages

- associated with the RANLP 2009 (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/)-

17 September 2009, Borovets, Bulgaria

Workshop page: http://www.c-phil.uni-hamburg.de/view/Main/RanlpBalkan09

The economical and political changes during the last years in Europe =20
have led to a major shift  of activities in the language technology =20
area. On one side the access for all citizens to global information =20
has become a real demand, on the other side the specific European =20
context with a big number of national and minority languages and the =20
exponential number of documents appearing every day, makes this =20
desiderata a real challenge.

Language Processing is now seen as the main technology being able to =20
give people access to information (no matter where it was produced) in =20
their own languages. Despite important developments, the =20
infrastructure in terms of languages resources (data and tools) for =20
less spoken languages , (especially Balkan and Slavic languages) are =20
still far behind the achieved standard for major west European ones.

As most part of the current LT-Applications rely on data-driven =20
methods, one major drawback in the development of language resources =20
for these languages is the lack of training and evaluation data , as =20
well as reference systems for comparing results.
Well-known corpora like JRC-ACQUIS and OPUS, although a significant =20
step forward,:
- still do not cover all languages in Balkan area
- are collection of documents in specialised language and therefore =20
decrease the
performance of systems trained on this data when testing on other =20
domains and registers.
In order to shorten this bottleneck, it is necessary to develop, =20
promote and make available data which can be used for training and =20
evaluation. In addition, it is important to know which systems have =20
been developed for which applications, on which data were tested and =20
with which evaluation results.

The aim of the current workshop is to make a first step in this =20
direction. We encourage submission of original, unpublished work =20
related to Balkan and Slavic languages  in the following areas:
- data-set profiling for Balkan and Slavic languages
- development of multilingual resources (parallel and comparable =20
corpora, lexica, etc)
- multilingual and cross-lingual applications (IR, IE)
- machine translation
- evaluation of machine translation  and cross-lingual IR/IE systems
- evaluation protocols and measures
- usage of language independent models for the considered languages

Submissions will be made through the START System of the main conference at

https://www.softconf.com/ranlp09/RanlpBalkan/cgi-bin/scmd.cgi?scmd=3DbasicSu=
bmit

no later that June 20th (0:00 GMT+2),

and should follow the formatting instructions specified on
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/ under "Submission Info". Submissions =20
should be ANONYMOUS and should not be longer as 8 A4-pages (full =20
article).
