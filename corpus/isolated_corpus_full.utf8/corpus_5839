Full Title: Journal of Germanic Linguistics=20


Linguistic Field(s): Dutch;General Linguistics;Germanic=20

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2009=20

Special Issue of the Journal of Germanic Linguistics
Dutch between German and English
Call for contributions

One of the first Dutch linguists to compare Dutch with its two Germanic
neighbours, English and German, was Van Haeringen in 1956. Since then the
subject has continued to intrigue. Now, a special issue of the Journal of
Germanic Linguistics (JGL) will be dedicated to this topic. We welcome
papers in which Dutch is compared with German and/or English in a variety
of ways. They could, for example, be about the languages' typological
position, an aspect of their structure, their history or their
socio-political status. We also welcome papers on theoretical and/or
methodological questions concerning the comparison of closely related
languages. The special issue is to be published in June 2010. The deadline
for submitting manuscripts (max. 5000 words) is 1 September 2009. Papers
will be anonymously refereed, in line with JGL policy. Please contact the
guest editors (below) for further details.
