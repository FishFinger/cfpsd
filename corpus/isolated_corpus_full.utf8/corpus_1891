Meeting Description:

The information economy exists as an environment in which we are all
contributors and consumers. Within this system, effective communication is
essential to success, allowing individuals to contribute ideas and information
effectively and to make efficient use of the goods and services. This conference
seeks to examine this economic model by examining the connections between
communication practices and the products, practices, and services that
constitute the information economy.  The objective of such an examination will
be to help attendees better understand and participate in the information
economy as both contributors and consumers. 

Call for Panel and Paper Proposals
IEEE International Professional Communication Conference 2008 (IPCC 2008)
Conference theme: Opening the Information Economy
Conference Location: Concordia University, Montréal, Canada
Conference Dates: July 13-16, 2008

The information economy is based on the collection and the exchange of data and
ideas.  We all either contribute to or use materials from the information
economy in most aspects of our everyday lives.  As a result, the information
economy exists as an environment in which we are all contributors and consumers.
Few of us, however, understand all of the nuances of the information economy or
the communication factors that affect its operations. 
 
The conference will take place on the campus of Concordia University in
Montréal, Canada and will consist of paper presentations and panel discussions
that focus on various communication, design, social, and cultural aspects of the
information economy.

Possible Topic Areas 
Suggested topic areas include but are not limited to the following:

-Establishing and assessing the value of knowledge work and knowledge products

-Information design, usability, and accessibility

-Virtual teams, online collaboration, and distributed models of work

-Cross-cultural communication, globalization, outsourcing, translation, and
localization

-Legal policies and social issues related to the information economy

-Media selection and multimodality

-The role of and perspectives on teaching and training within the information
economy

-Content management, open source software, single sourcing, and XML

Send 1-2 page (250-500 word) proposals to IPCC2008@gmail.com by 15 December 2007.
