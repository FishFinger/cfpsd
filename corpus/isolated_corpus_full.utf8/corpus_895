Rochester, New York, USA
Conference: April 22-27, 2007
Submission deadline: Jan 18, 2007
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/

    Demo Co-Chairs:
       Bob Carpenter, Alias I, Inc.
       Amanda Stent, Stony Brook University
       Jason D. Williams, AT&T Labs - Research

Proposals are invited for the NAACL HLT 2007 Demonstrations Program.
This program is aimed at offering first-hand experience with new
systems, providing opportunities to exchange ideas gained from creating
systems, and collecting feedback from expert users. It is primarily
intended to encourage the early exhibition of research prototypes, but
interesting mature systems are also eligible.=20

Accepted proposals will be presented during the NAACL HLT 2007
Demonstrations Program.  In addition, a plenary session in the NAACL HLT
main conference will be reserved for proposals of exceptional quality
and of broad interest.

Submission of a demonstration proposal on a particular topic does not
preclude or require a separate submission of a paper on that topic; it
is possible that some but not all of the demonstrations will illustrate
concepts that are described in companion papers.

AREAS OF INTEREST

We encourage the submission of proposals for demonstrations of software
and hardware related to all areas of human language technology. Areas of
interest include, but are not limited to, natural language, speech, and
retrieval systems for:

- Speech recognition and generation;
- Speech retrieval and summarization;
- Rich transcription of speech;
- Interactive dialogue;
- Information retrieval, filtering, and extraction;
- Document classification, clustering, and summarization;
- Language modeling, text mining, and question answering;
- Machine translation;
- Multilingual and cross-lingual processing;
- Multimodal user interface;
- Mobile language-enabled devices;
- Tools for Ontology, Lexicon, or other NLP resource development;
- Methods for evaluation;
- Unusual techniques, or applications to other domains.

Please refer to the NAACL HLT 2007 CFP
(http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/call_papers.shtml) for
a more detailed but not necessarily an exhaustive list of relevant
topics.

SUBMISSION FORMAT

A demo proposal should consist of the following parts:

- An extended abstract of up to two pages, including the title, authors,
full contact information, and technical content to be demonstrated. It
should give an overview of what the demonstration is aimed to achieve,
how the demonstration illustrates novel ideas or late-breaking results,
and how it relates to other systems or projects described in the context
of other research (i.e., references to related literature).

- A detailed requirement description of hardware, software, and network
access expected to be provided by the local organizer. Demonstrators are
encouraged to be flexible in their requirements (possibly preparing
different demos for different logistical situations). Please state what
you can bring yourself and what you absolutely must be provided with. We
will do our best to provide equipment and resources but at this point we
cannot guarantee anything beyond the space and power supply.

- A concise outline of the demo script, including the accompanying
narrative, and either a web address to access the demo or visual aids
(e.g., screen-shots, snapshots, or sketches). The demo script should be
no more than 6 pages.

The demo abstract must be submitted electronically in the Portable
Document Format (PDF). It should follow the format guidelines for the
main conference papers. Authors are encouraged to use the style files
provided on the NAACL HLT 2007 website.=20

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Demo proposals should be submitted electronically to the demo co-chairs
at naaclhlt2007demos@gmail.com.

REVIEWING

Demo proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to the
conference, innovation, presentation, and potential logistical
constraints.  Demonstrations will also be evaluated on the underlying
techniques or science they illustrate, but will not be expected to
contribute new approaches.

PUBLICATION

The accepted demo abstracts will be published in the Companion Volume to
the Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2007 Conference.

FURTHER DETAILS

Further details on the date, time, and format of the demonstration
session(s) will be determined and provided at a later date. Please send
any inquiries to the demo co-chairs at naaclhlt2007demos@gmail.com.
