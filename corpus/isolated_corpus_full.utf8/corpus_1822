HCSNet WORKSHOP ON FORENSIC SPEAKER RECOGNITION

Title: FSI not CSI: Perspectives in State-of-the-Art Forensic Speaker Recognition
Date: 6-7 December, 2007 (part of SummerFest'07)
Location: University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia
Contact: Philip Rose (philip.rose@anu.edu.au) and Kym Buckley (ky.buckley@uws.edu.au)

CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION

INTRODUCTION

How well can you identify the voice of a criminal? In our technological age, more and more offenders are being recorded while committing crimes, and expert opinion is being increasingly sought in the legal process as to whether two or more recordings are from the same speaker. The way forensic speaker recognition is done in real life departs considerably from its depiction in film and popular TV crime shows like Law and Order and Crime Scene Investigation.

The last ten years have witnessed exciting new developments in Forensic Speaker Recognition, not just from the point of methodology but also from the correct evaluation of evidence. To summarise these developments, the HCSNet Forensic Speaker Recognition Workshop is a major forum bringing together for the first time leading practitioners and experts to present State-of-the-Art Forensic Speaker Recognition from several of its most important perspectives, including examples from real case-work. 

We invite participants who are involved in any aspect of forensic speaker recognition, but especially researchers in automatic or traditional speaker recognition methods; the evaluation of FSR evidence, and those with actual casework experience including legal counsel, both defence and prosecution.

Possible topics include: new features (e.g. consonantal features, source features, phonological features), for forensic comparison; protocols and data for testing of established features; effects of mobile phone transmission; assessing comparability for analysis; combining automatic and traditional features; accounting  for correlation of variables; lessons learnt from case-work.

PARTICIPATION AND FORMAT

We welcome participation from a range of interests and perspectives within FSR, as outlined above, from both academia and industry, and we would like to involve as many as possible in discussion. Two forms of presentations are possible - short and longer as follows:
