Full Title: Workshop on Spatial Expressions 

Date: 14-May-2009 - 15-May-2009
Location: Troms√∏, Norway 
Contact Person: Peter Svenonius
Meeting Email: peter.svenonius@uit.no
Web Site: http://castl.uit.no/conferences/09/spatial-expressions.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Linguistic
Theories; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 30-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss formal analyses of spatial
expressions cross-linguistically, including expressions of location and of
motion. It is connected to the Moving Right Along project at CASTL, the Center
for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics. 

Call for Papers

Great advances have been made recently in our understanding of spatial
expressions, especially those based on adpositions and local cases. Detailed
semantic analyses have appeared for a range of expressions of static location
and dynamic motion of different types, and there have been several detailed
investigations into the adpositional and local case systems of different
languages. Detailed cross-linguistic comparisons have also been conducted.

Less well understood are systems which do not make use of adpositions or local
cases, or make little use of them. Partly addressing this issue, Professor
William McGregor of the University of Aarhus will present his work on spatial
frames of reference in Gooniyandi (an Australian language) at the workshop.

Two-page abstracts are invited for any topic relating to the theme of the
workshop. They must be received by Peter Svenonius (peter.svenonius at uit.no)
by Monday, March 30th, 2009. Abstracts should be submitted in anonymous form,
with contact information in the body of the e-mail.

Some travel support may be available for speakers whose papers are selected.
