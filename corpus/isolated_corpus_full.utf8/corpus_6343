              Semantics for the Rest of Us -- Variants of
            Semantic Web Languages in the Real World

                        Held in conjunction with
    8th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2009)
          Monday, 26 October 2009, Washington, DC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Semantic Web is a broad vision of the future of personal
computing, emphasizing the use of sophisticated knowledge
representation as the basis for end-user applications' data modeling
and management needs. Key to the pervasive adoption of Semantic Web
technologies is a good set of fundamental "building blocks" - the most
important of these are representation languages themselves. W3C's
standard languages for the Semantic Web, RDF and OWL, have been around
for several years; instead of strict standards compliance, we see
"variants" of these languages emerge in applications, often tailored
to a particular application's needs. These variants are often either
subsets of OWL or supersets of RDF, typically with fragments OWL
added. Extensions based on rules, such as SWRL and N3 logic, have been
developed as well as enhancements to the SPARQL query language and
protocol.

In this workshop we will explore the landscape of RDF, OWL and SPARQL
variants, specifically from the standpoint of "real-world
semantics". Are there commonalities in these variants that might
suggest new standards or new versions of the existing standards? We
hope to identify common requirements of applications consuming
Semantic Web data and understand the pros and cons of a strictly
formal approach to modeling data versus a "scruffier" approach where
semantics are based on application requirements and implementation
restrictions.

The workshop will encourage active audience participation and
discussion and includes a keynote by Sandro Hawke (W3C) as well as a
panel to be moderated by Jim Hendler (RPI).
