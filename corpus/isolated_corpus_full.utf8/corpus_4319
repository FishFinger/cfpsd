Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

This conference is meant as the starting point of a long-term research project
which aims at bringing out crosslinguistic regularities in the synchronic
grammar and diachronic evolution of monosyllables. The conference brings
together scholars of many schools of thought to exchange their views on
monosyllable from as many angles as possible. 

Call for Papers

Local Organisers: Prof. Dr. Thomas Stolz & local linguistics team

Invited Speakers:
Reinhard Köhler (Trier), Utz Maas (Osnabrück), Ian Maddieson (Albuquerque),
Alexis Michaud (CNRS, Paris)

This conference is meant as the starting point of a long-term research project
whose ultimate aim is to set out the crosslinguistic grammar of monosyllables.
The segmental and suprasegmental phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics of
monosyllabic words, their discourse functions, diachrony, learnability, contact
sensitivity, frequency effects etc. are investigated closely. Their impact on
linguistic theory (for instance, syllable structure) is evaluated.

Papers and posters on the following issues are welcome:
- Phonology of Monosyllables
- Morphology of Monosyllables
- Syntax of Monosyllables
- Semantics of Monosyllables
- Discourse Functions of Monosyllables
- Quantitative Aspects of Monosyllables
- Typological Aspects of Monosyllables
- Diachrony of Monosyllables
- Monosyllables and language contact
- The Psycholinguistics of Monosyllables
- Monosyllables in the History of Linguistics
- Monosyllables and Linguistic Theory

Papers and posters focusing on the properties of monosyllables in individual
languages are welcome.

It is planned that the conference proceedings be published with a major
publishing house.

Submission of abstracts for section papers or posters (600 words maximum, with
title and author identified) should be addressed to: iaas@uni-bremen.de  by 1
