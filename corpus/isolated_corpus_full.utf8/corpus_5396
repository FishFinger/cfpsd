Meeting Description:

The teaching of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has been seen as a separate
activity within English Language Teaching. However, with the advancement of
commerce, science, technology, and various disciplines in education, ESP should
be opened to insight drawn from the present needs of the society. With the
implementation of the Indonesian governments education policy to design and
develop Sekolah Berbasis Internasional (SBI) or Internationally Standardized
School - for some Indonesian schools, the needs for appropriate ESP design and
methodology for Indonesian schools is greatly felt by the school management.
Based on the consideration above, the Faculty of Language & Literature in
cooperation with Language Training Center, Satya Wacana Christian University
will hold the third International Seminar on the key issues in ESP within the
context of SBI.
