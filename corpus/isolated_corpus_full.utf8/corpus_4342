Human communication is naturally multimodal, involving the interaction
of modalities such as speech, facial expressions, hand gestures and
body posture. In order to have a better understanding of human-human
communication and to improve human-computer interaction it is
essential to identify, describe, formalise and model the interaction
of the different modalities in interhuman communication. The past two
decades have witnessed numerous initiatives and research efforts to
improve the state of the art, including collection and annotation of
multimodal data, automatic recognition of the different modalities,
modelling and generation of multimodal data. However, there are still
many questions and problems concerning the annotation of multimodal
data, the technology for capturing data, not to mention the
interpretation and reproduction of complex, natural multimodal
behaviour. The present workshop aims to provide a multidisciplinary
forum to present results and discuss issues that concern
research on human multimodal communication, its modelling and=20
representation for computational systems. We invite unpublished
contributions in these field. Topics of particular interest include,
but are not limited to:=20
* Cognitive aspects of multimodal communication
* Formal frameworks and descriptions of multimodal communication
* Representational issues (e.g. definition of annotation units,
  granularity of descriptions, spatio-temporal models of non-verbal
  modalities, definition  of default values, representation of
  multimodal meaning, inclusion of world context etc.) =20
* Interaction of the different modalities
* Multimodality in intercultural communication
* Definition of communicative functions in multimodal communication
* Methodologies and tools to annotate, process and/or produce=20
  multimodal communication
* Multimodal signal processing and its integration with manual
  annotation
* The annotation and validation of multimodal data
* Machine learning applied to multimodal data=20
