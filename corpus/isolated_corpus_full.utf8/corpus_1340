Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

The past years have seen a variety of promising NLP projects but in the vast
majority of real-world applications, fully automatic NLP is still far from
delivering reliable results. As a result, computer-aided methods have emerged as
a practical alternative. In the computer-aided scenario, processing is not done
entirely by computers, human intervention improves, post-edits or validates the
output of the computer program.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on CALP
projects and to provide a forum for fruitful discussion on related issues and
further developments in the field. Topics of interests include areas where
computers can be used to help but not to fully automate the process such as (but
not limited to) machine translation, production of summaries, generation of
documents, extraction of terminology, creation of indexes, ontology creation and
annotation of texts using semi-automatic methods. 

First Call for Papers
RANLP-07 Workshop: Computer-Aided Language Processing (CALP'07)
Borovetz, Bulgaria
September 30, 2007
Workshop site: http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/events/CALP07/
RANLP'2007 site: http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

Aims:

The past years have seen a variety of promising NLP projects but in the vast
majority of real-world applications, fully automatic NLP is still far from
delivering reliable results. As a result, computer-aided methods have emerged as
a practical alternative. In the computer-aided scenario, processing is not done
entirely by computers, human intervention improves, post-edits or validates the
output of the computer program. 

The workshop also encourages discussions and submissions focusing on evaluation
issues addressing the efficiency of the CALP methods. Of particular interest
will be studies which compare the saving of time and cost of CALP methods as
opposed to manual methods. 

Topics:

Prospective authors are invited to submit proposals in the following areas of
interest, related to computer-aided language processing:

- computer-aided language processing for NLP tasks including but not limited to
computer-aided summarisation, indexing, translation, generation, etc.
- semi-automatic annotation methods: post-processing vs. interactive annotation
- semi-automatic ontology development
- interactive machine learning methods such as active learning
- evaluation issues addressing the efficiency of CALP methods
- translation memories and other translation aides
- interactive machine translation 
- pre/post-editing of machine translation
- intelligent tools for language learning such as dictionaries and concordancers
- computer-aided assessment tools
- authorship attribution and plagiarism detection

Invited Speaker:

Ruslan Mitkov, University of Wolverhampton, UK

Submission Guidelines:

- Format: Authors are invited to submit two types of papers: full papers which
describe original and unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop, and
short papers which describe full working systems, and which, if accepted, will
be presented at a special session accompanied by live demo. Papers should be
submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 stylefiles and
not should not exceed 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages for short papers. The
RANLP 2007 stylefiles are available at: 

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm.

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the authors' identities
should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be
rejected without review.

- Submission procedure: Submission of papers will be handled using the START
system. Specific submission guidelines will be posted on the workshop site shortly.

- Reviewing: Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members of the
Program Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed comments, and to
score submitted papers on the following factors:
      - Relevance to the workshop
      - Significance and originality
      - Technical/methodological accuracy
      - References to related work
      - Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

- Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in
case the paper is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors will
attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected to pay the
RANLP-2007 workshop registration fee.

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: June 15, 2007
Paper acceptance notification: July 20, 2007
Camera-ready papers due: August 31, 2007
Workshop date: September 30, 2007

Full Title: 4th International Conference of Hispanic Linguistics 
Short Title: SIS 

Date: 27-Mar-2008 - 29-Mar-2008
Location: Swansea University, Wales, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Nuria Lorenzo-Dus
Meeting Email: N.Lorenzo-Dus@swansea.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.sis.soton.ac.uk/events.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics; Pragmatics 

Subject Language(s): Spanish (spa)

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 4th International Conference of Hispanic Linguistics will take place 27-29
March 2008 at Swansea University, Wales. We welcome abstracts for papers
exploring any aspects of the way in which Spanish is used in society. Of
particular interest are theoretical, methodological and empirical papers on the
use of Spanish in institutional contexts of communication. For example:

- Spanish in business communication, including call centres and service encounters
- Spanish in health-care and judicial contexts
- Spanish in educational settings 
- Spanish in the mass media
- Spanish in political communication

Our theme, Spanish at Work, is not limited to how Spanish is used in its own
right but includes also how it 'works alongside' other languages in the above
contexts. Proposals for papers around issues relating to bilingualism /
multilingualism and inter- / cross- cultural communication in institutional
settings are therefore also welcome. 

Confirmed plenary speakers (and provisional titles):

- Lars Fant (Stockholm University, Sweden): 'La negociaciÃ³n de la
intersubjectividad en la interacciÃ³n oral'
- Laura Pardo (Buenos Aires University, Argentina): 'El espaÃ±ol como herramienta
de diagnÃ³stico para la psicosis. Una aproximaciÃ³n desde el AnÃ¡lisis CrÃ­tico del
Discurso' 
- Miranda Stewart (Strathclyde University, Scotland): 'The Pragmatics of
parliamentary discourse'
- Ana Celia Zentella (UC San Diego, California, US): 'Hired for speaking
Spanish, fired for speaking Spanish'

Workshop:

- Paul Meara (Swansea University, Wales): 'Quantitative methods in the study of
Spanish in institutional contexts of communication' 

Presentations will be 30-minute research papers inclusive of 10 minutes for
discussion and questions. The languages of the conference are English and
Spanish. We intend to publish a selection of peer-reviewed articles.

Deadline for abstracts and submission guidelines: 
Please submit abstracts for papers by email to n.lorenzo-dus@swansea.ac.uk no
later than 31st August 2007. Abstracts should be sent as a word attachment
containing the title of the paper and a 300 word max. description of the
proposed talk, including: the aims, methodology and main findings of the study
upon which it is based, as well as a list of bibliographical references (Harvard
system). Contact details (name, affiliation and postal / electronic address)
should be included only in the body of the email, together with the title of the
paper.  

Notification of acceptance: December 2007. 

Conference registration: January-February 2008 (conference registration form and
further details to be provided in September 2007).

Organisers: International Association for the Study of Spanish in Society (SIS)
and the School of Arts, Swansea University.
