IADIS =96 EUROPEAN FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE DATA MINING (ECDM -2007)

Lisbon, Portugal, 5 to 7 July 2007

(http://www.datamining-conf.org)

part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information
Systems (MCCSIS 2007)

Lisbon, Portugal, 3 to 8 July 2007

(http://www.mccsis.org)



*Keynote Speakers (confirmed)*

* *

Professor Janusz Kacprzyk, Deputy Director for Scientific Affairs,
Polish Academy
of Sciences, Poland

Professor Bogdan Gabrys, Computational Intelligence Research Group, Bournem=
outh
University, UK



*Conference background and goals*



The First European Conference on Data Mining (ECDM'07) is aimed to gather
researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining
related areas such as statistics, computational intelligence, pattern
recognition, databases and visualization. ECDM'07 is aimed to advance the
state of the art in data mining field and its various real world
applications. ECDM'07 will provide opportunities for technical collaboratio=
n
among data mining and machine learning researchers around the globe. Main
tracks have been identified (see below). However innovative contributions
that do not fit into these areas will also be considered since they might b=
e
of benefit to conference attendees.



*Format of the Conference *

* *

The conference will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations. The
