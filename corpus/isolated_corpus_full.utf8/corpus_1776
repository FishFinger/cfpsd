Meeting Description:

Interfaces of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (iicall2 2007) 
Research in Intelligent Computer-Aided Language Learning (ICALL) integrates
natural language processing into a computer-assisted language learning
environment. For such research to be innovative, successful and sustainable, it
arguably needs to combine linguistic modeling, second language acquisition
research and insights from foreign language didactics with representations and
computational linguistic algorithms capable of integrating the information from
these models. 

The current state of the art in the various relevant fields seems favorable for
interdisciplinary ICALL research. Complementing the focus on communication and
culture in foreign language teaching since the 1960s, second language
acquisition research since the 1990s has clearly established that awareness of
language constructions, forms and meanings, rules and principles can facilitate
the successful acquisition of a foreign language. At the same time, most
research groups currently lack the interdisciplinary orientation, background, or
ties needed to develop and combine the linguistic and learner/cognitive modeling
with computational processing, and to develop and test intelligent tutoring
systems as part of real-life language teaching.

Research in Intelligent Computer-Aided Language Learning (ICALL) integrates
natural language processing into a computer-assisted language learning
environment. For such research to be innovative, successful and sustainable, it
arguably needs to combine linguistic modeling, second language acquisition
research and insights from foreign language didactics with representations and
computational linguistic algorithms capable of integrating the information from
these models. 

The iicall2 conference - the first conference was in December of last year at
The Ohio State University - is intended to foster exchange and in-depth
discussion of these interfaces of ICALL. 

The event will be held at the University of Waterloo. Participation in the
conference and the invited workshop is free for presenters and other
participants, if you register before the early bird deadline (31 October). We
are grateful to the Centre for Teaching Excellence, the Faculty of Arts, the
Department of French Studies, the Department of Germanic and Slavic Studies, and
the Graduate Studies Office for their support of this conference. 

You are invited to submit one-page abstracts describing research related to
ICALL. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 

Learner and/or instruction models for ICALL 
ICALL tools to promote language awareness 
Activity design for ICALL systems 
Transferability of SLA research results to an ICALL setting 
ICALL to collect data for SLA research 
Evaluation of ICALL tools in foreign language teaching settings 
Integration of ICALL into foreign language teaching curricula 
ICALL system architecture 
Re-use of NLP resources for ICALL 
NLP techniques for ICALL 
Feedback generation in ICALL 

Discussions of work in progress are welcome - PhD students and other young
researchers are particularly encouraged to submit their work. 

Format: one page proposal (plus references/figures) 
Use the Submission Form to submit your abstract. You can upload it as a pdf or
rtf file or copy/paste it in the abstract box. 
Deadline for submissions: Monday, 1 October 
Notification of acceptance: Friday, 12 October 
Registration deadline (early bird): Wednesday, 31 October 
Pre-conference workshop: Friday, 7 December 
Conference: Saturday, 8 December 

The event will be held at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo (Ontario),
Canada. Participation in the conference and the pre-conference workshop is free
if you register online by the early bird deadline (31 October). The late
registration fee is 20 CAD payable in cash upon arrival at the conference.
