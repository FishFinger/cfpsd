Last Call for Papers and Deadline Extension

Special Issue of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language =
Processing
on New Approaches to Statistical Speech and Text Processing

[New Submission Deadline, due to NIPS and GALE: June 29]

Dramatic advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology in =
recent=20
years has enabled serious growth in spoken language processing research, =
both=20
for human-computer interaction and spoken document processing.  The =
challenges
of working with spoken language, including ASR errors and disfluencies, =
were
major factors in the adoption of statistical techniques in the language
processing community. Statistical methods now dominate many areas of =
text
processing as well, enabled by growing collections of linguistic data =
resources
and developments in machine learning. While transfer of methods from =
spoken-=20
to written-language processing continues, advances in written-language
processing also now have a significant impact on spoken-language =
processing.=20
This issue seeks to highlight the cross-fertilization in speech and text =

processing by publishing novel statistical modeling and learning methods =
that
span a variety of language processing applications.=20

We invite papers describing new approaches to statistical language =
processing
of both spoken and written language. Submissions must not have been =
previously
published, with the exception that substantial extensions of conference =
papers
will be considered. Of particular interest are methods that transfer =
recent
developments from text processing to speech processing and vice versa, =
but new
methods in one domain are also welcome. Papers describing new strategies =
for
integrating acoustic and linguistic cues in spoken language processing =
are also
encouraged.=20

Topics of interest include:  =20
 - Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
 - Discriminative learning
 - Transfer or adaptation to new domains
 - Active learning
 - Reinforcement learning
 - Memory-based learning and neighborhood methods
 - Novel statistical models
 - Statistical methods for feature selection or transformation=20
=20
Specific applications of interest include information extraction, =
question
answering, text segmentation and classification, summarization, =
translation,
language generation and spoken language dialogs.  Papers that address =
component
problems of these larger applications are also encouraged, including =
parsing,
discourse analysis, and talker interaction analysis. The issue aims to =
cover a
variety of applications as well as different statistical methods.


Submission procedure:
=20
Prospective authors should prepare manuscripts according to the =
Information for=20
Authors as published in any recent issue of the Transactions and as =
available=20
on the web at http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/infotsa.html. =
Note
that all rules will apply with regard to submission lengths, mandatory =
overlength
page charges, and color charges. Manuscripts should be submitted =
electronically
through the online IEEE manuscript submission system at=20
http://sps-ieee.manuscriptcentral.com/.=20
When selecting a manuscript type, authors must click on "Special Issue =
of TASLP
on New Approaches to Statistical Speech and Text Processing". Authors =
should
follow the instructions for the IEEE Transactions Audio, Speech and =
Language
Processing and indicate in the Comments to the Editor-in-Chief that the
manuscript is submitted for publication in the Special Issue on New =
Approaches
to Statistical Speech and Text Processing. We require a completed =
copyright
form to be signed and faxed to +1-732-562-8905 at the time of =
submission.
Please indicate the manuscript number on the top of the page.
