Meeting Description

The Psycholinguistics and Cognition Lab of the Department of Psychology,
Concordia University, Montreal, Canada will be hosting a workshop on Verb
Concepts, to be held on Friday - Saturday, 3-4 October, 2008, in Montreal,
Canada. The full title of the workshop is 'Verb Concepts: Cognitive Science
Perspectives on Verb Representation and Processing'
With this one time event, we aim to bring together researchers working on verb
concepts either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective and to achieve a
forum of discussions covering every possible aspect of verb representation and
processing. We are very pleased to have nine invited speakers each of them
representing a separate research area dealing with verb representation and
processing, such as theoretical linguistics, philosophy of language,
psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, cognitive science.

Invited Speakers

Roelien Bastiaanse (Linguistics, University of Groningen)
William Croft (Linguistics, University of New Mexico)
Brendan Gillon (Linguistics, McGill University)
Martin Haiden (Université François Rabelais, Tours)
David Kemmerer (Psychology, Purdue University)
Beth Levin (Linguistics, Stanford University)

Paper Submission

We will have approximately 12 slots available for submitted papers. Papers
should present theoretical positions on the nature of verb representation (e.g.,
semantic and conceptual structures, predicate decomposition, argument structure;
the nature of events; etc). We also encourage submissions of psycholinguistic
and neurolinguistic work (including brain imaging) on major themes guiding
research on verb representation and processing. Our goal is to survey
theoretical approaches and empirical data as well as to contrast major positions.
 
Papers should be submitted in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format. Please send two
attachments: (1) one with title, author(s), affiliation, text, and references;
and (2) one with title and text only (there should be no authorship information
or reference to own work in text). Text should contain up to 1000 words (two
pages). Graphs or diagrams should not be sent separately but can be included in
the two-page limit. Authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to
revise the abstract before publication in the abstract booklet.
 
Deadline for submission: May 1, 2008
 
Please submit abstract as attachment (in .pdf) to: coglab@alcor.concordia.ca
(subject line: VERBS - YourLastname).
 
We are planning to publish a volume with selected papers from the conference.
Further details will be available at a later date.
