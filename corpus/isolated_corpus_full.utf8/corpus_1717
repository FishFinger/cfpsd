Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Philosophy of Language; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:
Propositions of communication may be submitted on all aspects of natural
language for which set theory proves its limitations. Works showing the
fruitfulness of alternative frameworks (e.g. category theory, linear logic,
plural logic) for the analysis of natural language semantics are welcome. 

Semantics In Paris 2 (SIP2): Semantics Beyond Set Theory
October 25-26, 2007, Paris, France

Call for Papers
Since its creation by Cantor 130 years ago, set theory has come to play the role
of a lingua franca, both in mathematics and in disciplines that make a strong
use of mathematical tools, such as natural language semantics.
  While helpful in order to understand a great variety of phenomena, set theory
also has certain limitations. Two of them have important consequences for the
analysis of natural language.
  First, the elements of a set must not be too many, on pain of paradox. Usual
model theory is therefore unable to offer a faithful picture of quantification
over absolutely everything there is, as in sentences like ''Everything is
self-identical''. This limitation also shows up with plurals: apparently
meaningful sentences like ''There are some sets such that a set is one of them
just in case it is not a member of itself'' cannot be adequately represented
using sets. Second, by its very nature, set theory is extensional. As such it is
ill equipped to deal with intensional phenomena.
  These limitations of set theory surface in a variety of domains, among others
and non-exhaustively:
- Expressions of togetherness: some advances beyond classical mereology have
lead to reconsidering the adequacy of set theoretic notions; for instance, some
theoreticians have claimed that expressions of collectivity require the notion
of groups as qua objects.
- Expressions of genericity require for their analysis new, non set-theoretic
tools, in particular in order to handle exceptions and higher order entities.
- Finally, since events cannot be identified to temporal traces, the analysis of
temporal expressions and aspect is likely to go beyond the use of set-theoretic
notions.
Propositions of communication may be submitted on all aspects of natural
language for which set theory proves its limitations. Works showing the
fruitfulness of alternative frameworks (e.g. category theory, linear logic,
plural logic) for the analysis of natural language semantics are welcome.

Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 17th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference will be held November 9-11,
2007, on the UCLA campus. This conference aims to provide a forum for presenting
research in Japanese and Korean linguistics, thereby facilitating efforts to
deepen our understanding of these two languages, which have striking typological
similarities. This year in addition to the general session, two workshops with
guest speakers are scheduled during the conference. 

Final Call for Papers 
Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2007 
17th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference 
November 9-11, 2007  
UCLA 
 
Special Panels 
 
''Usage-based linguistics: theory and methodologies'' 
 
Joan Bybee (University of New Mexico)
Sandra Thompson (UCSB)
Tsuyoshi Ono (University of Alberta)
Soonja Choi (San Diego State University)
Discussant: Patricia Clancy (UCSB) 
 
''Progress in Generative Grammar; its characterization and assessment'' 
 
Yasuo Deguchi (Kyoto University)
Fritz Newmeyer (University of Washington) 
Colin Phillips (University of Maryland) 
Ayumi Ueyama (Kyushu University)
 
Papers in all sub-areas of Japanese and Korean linguistics are invited.
Presentations will be 20 minutes long and will be followed by a 10-minute
question and answer period. Please submit abstracts (one page, 500 words
maximum) as a PDF file attached to an email message to JK17@humnet.ucla.edu by
July 15, 2007 (Please note this new deadline). You may use a second page for
references and/or example sentences. The first line of your abstract should
indicate the category (Formal or Functional), followed by the sub-field (e.g.,
Formal/Syntax, Functional/Discourse, etc.). The second line should be the paper
title, followed by the number of words used on the first page of the abstract,
excluding the first two lines with the category, the sub-field, and the paper
title (e.g., Title (492)). Omit your name and affiliation from the abstract. In
the body of your email message, include name(s) and affiliation(s), address,
phone number, and email address, followed by the category, the sub-field, and
the paper title (e.g., Title (492)) copied from the top of the first page of the
abstract. Use the following subject header for your email: ''JK17, Last name,
First Initial.'' Please note that only one abstract from each individual can be
considered for acceptance. One individual abstract or one jointly authored
abstract may be submitted. All the necessary information about the conference
will appear on our conference website: http://www.alc.ucla.edu/jk17/.
