                           Workshop on Matching and Meaning:
           Automated development, evolution and interpretation of ontologies

                        http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/wmm-2009/

                9th April 2009, part of AISB'09 Convention, Edinburgh, UK


OVERVIEW

The problem of semantic misalignment - of two systems failing to
understand one another when their semantic representation is not
identical - occurs in a huge variety of areas: the Semantic Web,
databases, natural language processing; anywhere, indeed, where
semantics are necessary but centralised control is undesirable or
impractical.  In highly dynamic domains, where interactions are between
a large, diverse and evolving community, there is a need for the
resolving of these misalignments - through developing and evolving
existing ontologies or interpreting unknown ontologies in terms of
known ones - to be done automatically and on-the-fly.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
the problems of automated development, evolution and interpretation of
ontologies in the many different domains in which it occurs. We are
primarily interested in the exchange of ideas and the stimulation of
debate, and the workshop is intended to be a forum for researchers to
present ongoing work and ideas and to engage in discussion with other
researchers from the field. We are particularly interested in novel
ideas and innovative research, which may be in its early stages, and
encourage reports on work in progress.

Topics of interest include:

        * Ontology evolution
        * Ontology matching and alignment
        * Ontology versioning
        * Representational or structural change
        * Formal aspects of ontology dynamics
        * Foundational issues
        * Social and collaborative matching
        * Background knowledge in matching
        * Extensions to ontology languages to better support change
        * Belief revision for ontologies and the Semantic Web
        * Inconsistency handling in evolving ontologies
        * Uncertainty in matching
        * Change propagation in ontologies and metadata
        * Ontologies for dynamic environments
        * Dynamic knowledge construction and exploitation
        * Case studies, software tools, use cases, applications
        * Development and evolution of ontologies in humans and animals
        * Open problems


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We encourage the submission of extended abstracts that discuss ongoing
research, problem descriptions and overviews of the domain. These may
be of any length; we expect two or three pages will be appropriate in
most cases. This workshop will be non-archival so it is not necessary
that abstracts should meet fixed standards; they are primarily intended
to highlight ideas.

Submissions will be subject to light reviewing, mainly intended to
check fit to workshop.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically in pdf format to
f.j.mcneill-at-ed.ac.uk by 19th December 2008. Notification of
acceptance will be sent to the submitting author on 13th February 2009.


VENUE

The workshop will take place at the Edinburgh Convention Centre at
Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, as part of the AISB 2009
Convention (http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb09/), on April 9th
2009. All workshop participants must be registered for the AISB 2009
Convention. Registration for this workshop is included in the
convention registration fee.


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission: Friday, 19th December 2008
Notification: Friday, 13th February 2009
Workshop: 9th April 2009
AISB09 Convention: 6th - 9th April 2009


PROGRAMME

Presentations: Authors of accepted abstracts will give presentations of
their work; exact times to be decided.

Posters: If it is not possible to fit in presentations for all accepted
authors, some may be asked to present posters instead. There will be a
session of 5 minute poster talks.

Panel: The technical programme will end with a 90 minute panel
discussion on a topic of mutual interest to be decided. Three speakers
will speak for 10 minutes each with a brief to stimulate debate during
the remaining 60 minutes. Discussion amongst all participants, rather
than question-and-answering for the panel, will be strongly encouraged.
