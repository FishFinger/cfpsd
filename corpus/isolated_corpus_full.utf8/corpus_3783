Meeting Description:

Production, Perception, Attitude
An interdisciplinary workshop on understanding and explaining linguistic variation

Hosted by the University of Leuven, April 2-4, 2009

Organized by the Universities of Leuven, Nijmegen, and Groningen for the
VNC-research programme 
The interaction between intelligibility, attitude, and linguistic distance. 

Call for Papers

We invite paper and poster presentations for a two day symposium which focuses
on (and confronts) work in variationist linguistics, perceptual dialectology,
and language attitude research. Contributions preferably tackle one of the
following topics:
  
-  Innovative methods and techniques for measuring language variation and    
change, language perceptions, or language attitudes;
-  Innovative methods and techniques for collecting reliable data in these
disciplines;
-  Data-based analysis which highlights the causal relations between production,
perception, and attitudes. 

Although the focus in the research programme which frames this workshop is on
Dutch, contributions need not be restricted to linguistic variation in the Low
Countries.

Background
Although linguistic variation in the Dutch language area (The Netherlands and
Flanders) has enjoyed an enormous amount of descriptive and theoretical
attention, few reliable data are available on the origin of this variation and
on how it can be accounted for. In order to explain language variation, the
sociolinguistic correlates of phonetic, lexical, and morpho-syntactic variables
"have to be traced back to a complex set of underlying criteria" (Knops & Van
Hout 1988: 2). The identification of at least some of these criteria is the
ambitious aim to which the present workshop is devoted.  

Up to now, linguistic variation in The Netherlands has been investigated
predominantly from the perspective of language production, i. e. in terms of the
description of the linguistic distance observed between regional and stylistic
varieties of Dutch (cf. Geeraerts, Grondelaers & Speelman 1999; Van Hout & Van
de Velde 2001; Heeringa & Nerbonne 2001). In order, however, to move from merely
describing linguistic variation to explaining variation, three extensions are
needed. 

First, the production perspective on linguistic variation has to be refined
theoretically and methodologically to chart hitherto unknown patterns and (more
importantly) triggers of variation. Second, it is well-known that some language
variation and change patterns are sustained by attitudinal factors (whereby
"attitudes" are provisionally defined as the culturally and experientially
acquired inclination to perceive and evaluate a variety as systematically
negative or positive). Although the causal link between perception and
production has recurrently been demonstrated (cf. Van Bezooijen 2001), both
define different disciplines in (socio)linguistics and social psychology which
rarely interact. Attitude research is moreover hindered by a lack of reliable
quantitative data (Grondelaers, Van Hout & Steegs: in press).

In addition to these two perspectives, the workshop also focuses on the (often
missing) link between the production and the evaluative perception of language
variation. Before language variation can be subjectively evaluated, it must
first be recognized by the layman. Perceptual dialectology (Long & Preston 1999)
therefore investigates to what extent linguistic laymen recognize and understand
other varieties, and where they situate the boundaries between their own and
other varieties. Although this paradigm represents one of the oldest disciplines
in sociolinguistics (pioneered in Weijnen 1946), its findings have rarely been
systematically confronted with production and attitudinal perception data.
Another crucial perspective which has largely been ignored in this respect is
the mutual intelligibility between language varieties, a factor which is
co-determined by attitudes and by linguistic distance (Gooskens 2007).    

The present meeting is devoted to enhancing the convergence between the cited
research disciplines in order to develop (the preliminaries to) an explanatory
model of language variation and change. The workshop is interdisciplinary in
focus and features three plenary speakers and presentations by the universities
participating in the research programme. In addition, we invite contributions
from (socio)linguists and (social) psychologists working in the three
aforementioned areas for plenary oral presentations as well as an extended
poster programme (poster presenters will be allowed plenary presentation time to
advertise their posters).
