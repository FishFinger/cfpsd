There are two unique and fantastic events at this year's SummerFest:  A Workshop on Building the Australian National Corpus: Data Sources, and A Workshop on Interacting with Intelligent Virtual Characters. Details on both are below.

Call for Papers: Workshop on Building the Australian National Corpus -- Data Sources and Tools

Description:
Following on from the successful Designing the Australian National Corpus workshop held during SummerFest 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Building the Australian National Corpus to be held as part of SummerFest 2009.

This workshop focuses on current developments and emerging possibilities in language data gathering and tools that might complement existing collections of language data in building the Australian National Corpus. While sources like the World Wide Web have enormous potential there are numerous challenges facing those wishing to draw out linguistically relevant data from the Web. In constructing the Australian National Corpus, then, a wider range of data sources needs to be drawn upon. The aim of the workshop is thus to bring together researchers with expertise 
in corpus and web linguistics along with corpus building and annotation in a single forum in order to work towards strategies to capitalize on the potential for language data in existing as well as new collections to be incorporated into the Australian National Corpus in a principled manner.

Topics include but are not limited to:
*Using the web as a source of corpus data
*Bringing existing data collections into the AusNC
*Proposed models for collecting new data
*Legal issues for data collection and sharing technical infrastructure and requirements
*Long term curation of the AusNC

Intended Audience:
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers in linguistics and language technology who build and use corpora together with experts in web and search technologies.

Submissions:
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
*corpus building
*corpus-based research
*web-based research
*web linguistics
*web for corpus
*computer-mediated communication
*search technologies
*linguistic and multimodal annotation
*corpus interrogation

Call for Papers: Workshop on Interacting with Intelligent Virtual Characters

Intelligent Virtual Characters are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and are being used in games, film, education, and social situations. We are seeing advances in perceptual abilities, language processing and generation, and animation; and a better understanding of embodied communication and conversation. Microsoft's new Xbox demo involving the virtual boy Milo sets a vision for the possibilities of virtual characters playing a role in social engagement with humans.

This workshop, held as part of HCSNet SummerFest 2009, aims to explore technical, psychological, and sociological issues in the development of intelligent virtual characters and applications involving them. We encourage a broad range of submissions from researchers working on the development of virtual characters or capabilities for them, or on issues related to human engagement with such characters, or on social situations that may involve one or more virtual participants. We are particularly interested in bringing together insights from both technical and social perspectives.

Specific topics may include:

* Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) or human-robot interaction
* Perceptual abilities: e.g. speech, vision, emotion detection, physical object detection
* Communicative abilities: language processing and generation; physical gesture; gaze and facial expression
* Social abilities: models of attention, engagement and interaction; turn-taking
* Emotional and affective modelling: emotion rendering through face and language; personality
* Computational frameworks and animation: platforms for building agents
* Reasoning and control: AI for ECAs; scripting multi-character scenarios; autonomy
* Applications: games; movies; entertainment; education and training; virtual reality; virtual companions

Professor Catherine Pelachaud, one of the world's leading ECA researchers, will give a keynote presentation at the workshop, which will consist of presentations, posters, demos, and discussion sessions. We encourage participation from interested researchers from Computer Science, Sociology, Psychology, and Communication, as well as anyone working in or interested in any application area for Virtual Characters, including industry perspectives. As an outcome, we hope to bring together a diverse community and develop collaboration opportunities amongst groups working on different aspects of the design of intelligent virtual characters.

Submissions should be in the form of 500 word abstracts.

Submission deadline: Monday 28th September 2009
