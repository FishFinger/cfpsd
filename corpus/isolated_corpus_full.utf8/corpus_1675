20th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2008
Monday August 4 - Friday August 15, 2008
Hamburg, Germany
http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/

                      CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around
Europe.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic
and computation.  ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced
courses, as well as workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within
the three areas of interest: Language and Computation, Language and
Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
500 students from Europe and elsewhere.  The school has developed into
an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information.

The ESSLLI 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 20th
annual Summer School on a wide range of timely topics that have
demonstrated their relevance in the following fields:

        - Logic and Language
        - Logic and Computation
        - Language and Computation

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than

                     ******* Monday July 2, 2007. *******

GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION: Anyone interested in lecturing or organizing
a workshop during ESSLLI 2008, please read the following information
carefully.

ALL COURSES: Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers. They consist
of five sessions (a one-week course), each session lasting 90 minutes.
Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course should submit two
independent one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the
first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second).
The ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the
two proposed courses.

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming
any background knowledge.  They are intended for people to get=20
acquainted
with the problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they
should allow researchers from other fields to acquire the key=20
competences
of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly
interdisciplinary research community. Foundational courses may=20
presuppose
some experience with scientific methods in general, so as to be able to
concentrate on the issues that are germane to the area of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the activities
of the Summer School.  They are intended to equip students and young
researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic methods and
techniques.  Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and
Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g.,=20=

an
introductory course in computational linguistics should address an
audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and=20
computation.
Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of the=20
course
as compared to standard texts in the area (if available).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students.  Proposals for advanced courses should
specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced
Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their work.
Workshops should have a well defined theme, and workshop organizers=20
should
be specialists in the theme of the workshop. It is a strict requirement
that organizers give a general introduction to the them during the first
session of the workshop.  They are also responsible for the organization
and program of the workshop including inviting the submission of papers,
reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, each=20
workshop
organizer will be responsible for producing a Call for Papers for the
workshop by November 11, 2007.  The call must make it clear that the
workshop is open to all members of the LLI community.  It should also=20
note
that all workshop contributors must register for the Summer School.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions:

        July 2, 2007: Proposal Submission Deadline
        Sep 10, 2007: Notification
        Nov 11, 2007: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers
                      (by ESSLLI PC chair)
        Nov 18, 2007: Workshop organizers send out (First) Call for =
Papers
        Mar 17, 2008: Deadline for Papers (suggested)
        Apr 28, 2008: Notification of Workshop Contributors (suggested)
        June 2, 2008: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of=20
Workshop
                      Proceedings (by ESSLLI Local Organizers)

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the
Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate
to be determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: The web-based form for submitting course and
workshop proposals is accessible at
http://www.folli.org/submission.php.  You will be required to submit
the following information:

        * Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)

        * Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer;
          where possible, please include phone and fax numbers)

        * Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

        * Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an =
introductory
          course, or an advanced course?)

        * Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation,
          Language & Logic or Logic & Computation? name only one)

        * Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed
 	contents and substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)

        * External funding (will you be able to find external funding to
          help fund your travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

        * Further particulars (any further information that is required =
by
          the above guidelines should be included here; in particular,
          indicate here your teaching experience in an interdisciplinary
          field as the one addressed by ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should
be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer schools is done
on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as
possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for their contribution,
but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to a fixed, maximum
amount that will be notified to lecturers when courses are accepted).
It should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world are
welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full reimbursement of
travel costs, especially from destinations outside Europe.

Please note the following: In case a course is to be taught by two
lecturers, a lump sum is reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation
expenses for one lecturer. The splitting of the sum is up to the
lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, and such issues might be taken into
account when selecting courses.
