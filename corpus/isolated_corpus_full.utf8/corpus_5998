ASWC 2009 Call for Posters and Demos

http://www.aswc2009.org/research-paper-track/callpostersdemos

Fourth Asian Semantic Web Conference (ASWC 2009)
6-9 December, 2009
Shangai, China

The Asian Semantic Web Conference is the yearly conference on
theoretical foundations, technological building blocks and practical
applications of semantic technologies on the Asian continent. Targeted
at both academia and industry, the conference will present the latest
research and development of the Semantic Web and its related
technologies. It will bring together researchers in relevant disciplines
such as artificial intelligence, knowledge modeling, logic, databases,
social networks, Web services, distributed computing, Web engineering,
information systems, natural language processing, multimedia, and
human-computer interaction.

As integral part of this conference, the poster and demo track is an
opportunity for researchers and developers to present late-breaking
achievements, ongoing projects, and innovative early ideas. It should
provide authors and attendees a forum for exchanging experiences and
establishing potential future collaborations.

We welcome different types of poster submissions, ranging from
descriptions of completed research and work in progress to more
technical topics and practical applications.

Demo submissions are intended to showcase innovative Semantic Web
implementations and technologies. Demos are intended to convey a
scientific result or work in progress and are not intended as
advertisements for software packages.

A detailed list of suggested topics can be found in the Call for Papers
of the main conference.

*Submissions*

Poster and Demo submissions must be written in English and must be no
longer than 2 pages. The maximum number of pages allowed includes all
figures. Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document
Format) format and must be formatted in the style of the Springer
Publications for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

Papers that exceed the 2 pages limit, do not follow the LNCS guidelines
or are not submitted as PDF documents will be automatically rejected
without a review.

Full papers rejected in the other tracks, notably the research track of
ASWC2009, will not automatically be considered for the poster track. A
separate poster submission must be made. A poster can be provided in
addition to a paper accepted for presentation in the research track or
can be used to present work that was insufficiently mature to be
accepted there.

Submissions will be evaluated for acceptability by a committee of
independent reviewers. Decisions about acceptance will be based on
relevance to the call, originality, potential impact and quality of the
presentation.

Posters and demos must be submitted via the Easychair system prior to
the submission deadline:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aswc2009

At least one of the authors must be a registered participant at the
conference, and attend the Poster and Demo session to present the work.

*Important Dates*

17 September 2009. Submission of poster and demo descriptions
1 October 2009. Notification of acceptance
15 October 2009. Camera-ready versions

*ASWC 2009 Poster and Demo Chair*

RaÃºl GarcÃ­a Castro, Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid, Spain
