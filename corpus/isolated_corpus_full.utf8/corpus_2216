Call Deadline: 10-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description

The Department of French and Italian at the University of Texas at Austin will
be hosting the Fifth Annual FIGS Conference for French and Italian Graduate
Students in Linguistics and Literature on April 11-12, 2008. 

This conference aims to evaluate various ''Points of Contact'' across French and
Italian literature and linguistics, as well as such contact in music, film, art
and popular culture. In presentations of 15-20 minutes, participants are asked
to address questions pertaining to various modes of cultural production and,
most importantly, to assess the outcome of such encounters or confrontations.
Conversely, participants may also interrogate the evasion or refusal of contact.
In the final analysis, it is the legacy of contact that we wish to uncover.  

The keynote speaker this year is Danielle Marx-Scouras, a professor of French at
The Ohio State University. Her latest book, La France de Zebda 1981-2004: Faire
de la musique un acte politique, examines the popular band at the intersection
of arts and engagement in contemporary France.  Situating Zebda's engagement in
a broader context, Marx-Scouras points out how cultural decentralization has
allowed the band's native Toulouse, along with Marseille, to become the points
of contact of la France métissée.

Possible panels may include, but are not limited to:

Immigration
Francophone by choice: Beckett, Kundera, et al.
Cross-cultural contact in urban France
Intertextualizing contact
Fears or fruit of contact
Contact and shifting identity
Suppressed contact
Borders and boundaries as sites of contact
Translation as a point of contact
Linguistic contact in French sociolects and dialects
Linguistic points of contact (Mediterranean culture, rhizomatic contacts)
Contact through Second Language Acquisition and cultural competence

You are also invited to submit panel proposals, which must include at least
three paper abstracts for each proposed panel. The same guidelines will apply.

To be considered, paper proposals, in French, English or Italian, should include: 
A 200-300 word abstract
Your name
Mailing address
Email address
University affiliation 

Deadline for submission is January 10th, 2008. 

Please email paper proposals as a Word document or PDF attachment to:

David Siller, jedipoete@yahoo.com
Meredith Wright, meredithnell@mail.utexas.edu
