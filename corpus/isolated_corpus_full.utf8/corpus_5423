Full Title: Current Advances in Caucasian Studies 

Date: 21-Jan-2010 - 24-Jan-2010
Location: Macerata, Italy 
Contact Person: Vittorio Tomelleri
Meeting Email: caucasus@unimc.it

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2009 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the conference is to gather together specialists working on the
Caucasus area and to give an overview over the present state of research
involving this region. The conference will focus on contact viewed from
different points of view (cultural, religious, linguistic, philological,
historical and so on). The complex history of the Caucasus shows us that
contact, being as a rule often quite problematic and conflictual, is indeed a
major factor of development and mutual enrichment for all the individuals
involved in it. Therefore, we especially welcome papers putting the data in a
broader context and discussing phenomena of contacts between two ore more
groups, languages, and/or communities living in this area.

Invited Speakers:

Alice Harris (Stony Brook University of New York)
Jost Gippert (Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main)
Luigi Magarotto (Ca' Foscari University of Venice)
Boghos Zekiyan (Ca' Foscari University of Venice) 

Second Call for Papers:

Please send a one page abstract in pdf format, not exceeding 300 words, to the
following address (caucasus@unimc.it) no later than 31 July 2009.

In the body of the message, your name, affiliation, the title of your submission
and the language of the talk (English and Russian are strongly recommended)
should be included. The time allotted is 20 minutes for the talk and 5 minutes
for discussion. You will be informed about the acceptance on the 30 of September
2009.

Further information about the conference will be provided later on.

Abstract deadline: 31 July 2009

Acceptance notification deadline: 30 September 2009
