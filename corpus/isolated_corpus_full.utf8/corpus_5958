22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information

ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) =20=

is organized every year by the Association for Logic,
Language and Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different =20
sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface
between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers =20
foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops,
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest: =20=

Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful, =20
attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The
school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for =20
discussion for students and researchers interested in the
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI=922009 =20=

website: http://esslli2009.labri.fr/.


The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational, =20=

introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the
22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in =20
the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics,
computer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3 =20=

traditional ESSLLI streams:


-Language and Computation
-Language and Logic
-Logic and Computation
We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these =20
categories.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a =20
prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010
website http://esslli2010cph.info/, through EasyChair on =
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Desslli2010=20
, not later than

******* Monday, September 7, 2009 *******

Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the =20
guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that
do not conform with these guidelines may not be considered.

GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS:

ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and =20
consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course
proposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative =20
content and structure of the course, as well as state the course=92s
objectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who =20
want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent
one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week =20=

of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two =20
proposed courses.

TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by =20=

the ESSLLI=922010 local organizers

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not =20
assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for
people who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of =20=

areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from
other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring =20
disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly =20
interdisciplinary
research community. Foundational courses should require no special =20
prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific
methods and general appreciation of the field of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the =20
activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an
introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young =20
researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good
understanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such =20=

courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields
to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus =20
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research
community. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and =20
Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g.,
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an =20=

audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and
computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the =20
level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of =20=

advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for
advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes =20=

sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to
provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to =20
present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well
defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the =20
theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify
the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and =20=

expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential
submitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are =20
required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for the =20
organization and program of the workshop including inviting the =20
submission of
papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, =20
each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for
Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the =20
submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all =20
members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop
contributors must register for the Summer School.

TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to =20
ESSLLI=922010 PC chair

Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers

Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers

Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers

Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops

May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop =20
contributors

Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop =20=

proceedings to the ESSLLI=922010 Local Organizers.

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the =20
Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate
to be determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop =20
proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website
www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010.

The proposers are required to submit the following information:

* Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two =20=

per course or workshop
* Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if =20
available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s);
* Title of proposed course/workshop;
* Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)
* Stream (one of: Language & Computation, Language & Logic, Logic & =20
Computation)
* Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance =20=

to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp.
expected participation in the workshops)
* External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain =20
external funding for travel and accommodation expenses)
* Further particulars (any further information that is required by the =20=

above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course
objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching =20
experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the
interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers =20
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer
schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants =20=

fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation =20
(up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the
lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while =20
proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot =20
guarantee
full reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations =20
outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be
taught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to =20
cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the
splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers.

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, =20=

lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost =20=

of attending ESSLLI=922010 lower.
