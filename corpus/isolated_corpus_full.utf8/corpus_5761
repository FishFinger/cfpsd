3rd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009

November 8-10, 2009, Hyatt Regency, Jeju Island, South Korea
http://lbm2009.biopathway.org

[Important: LBM 2009 has been brought forward to November 8-10, 2009 to ena=
ble participants to travel in due time to the AMIA annual conference, after=
 having enjoyed research talks on the Jeju Volcanic Islands (UNESCO World h=
eritage).]

LBM is an interdisciplinary forum that brings together researchers in biolo=
gy, chemistry, medicine, public health and informatics to discuss and explo=
it cutting edge language technology.  Language, in its many forms, is the u=
niversal means to represent, question, and convey knowledge. Likewise appli=
ed technologies such as information extraction, summarization, and translat=
ion are key technologies for advancing biomedical research and healthcare p=
rovision. The automation of all these solutions empowers our ability to dis=
cover new knowledge.

All the available technologies are constantly being challenged by user dema=
nds in interdisciplinary research work leading into sustained growth in qua=
ntity and quality of existing language technologies.  The involved communit=
ies profit from information exchange about recent progress to efficiently e=
xploit the available solutions and to improve interdisciplinary work.  This=
 has led to the continued interest in the LBM symposium series, which offer=
s a forum for synergistic interdisciplinary interactions as a rich source f=
or significant advancements.  After all, to efficiently manage data and kno=
wledge requires the meeting of specialists in all relevant domains.  =


The International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009=
 is the next opportunity for interdisciplinary interaction. LBM was establi=
shed in 2005 and the remit of this event remains highly relevant today. The=
 symposium focuses on the languages that are in active use for biology and =
medicine. We call for outstanding contributions to, but not limited to, the=
 topics listed below:

    * Natural language: text mining, retrieval and managements;
    * Ontology language: semantic indexing, ontology construction, inductio=
n and management;
    * Logic language: knowledge representation;
    * Sequence language: RNA structure prediction, protein domain predictio=
n;
    * Database language: database interface, query language;
    * Visualization language: information visualization, molecular visualiz=
ation;
    * Image language: image indexing and retrieval

Important dates:

    * Paper Submission Deadline: August 31, 2009
    * Paper Acceptance Notification: September 30, 2009
    * Camera Ready Version Due: October 18, 2009
    * Symposium Dates: November 8-10, 2009 =


Papers focusing on application aspects of languages in biology, chemistry, =
medicine, public health as well as theoretical aspects are welcome.

LBM 2009 will offer a diversity of high quality presentations: keynote and =
invited speeches, research presentations on ongoing scientific work (short =
and long papers), poster presentations and a panel discussion. Research pre=
sentations will be selected by peer review from the Programme Committee.

We intend to publish the best submissions to the symposium in special issue=
s of peer reviewed journals.  We have selected the Journal of Bioinformatic=
s and Computational Biology (JBCB <http://www.worldscinet.com/jbcb/jbcb.sht=
ml>) for publications with a strong focus on biomedical informatics and the=
 Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS <http://www.jbiomedsem.com>) for pub=
lications with a strong focus on semantic resources and their use in applic=
ations.  Upon submission of a manuscript, authors should indicate their pre=
ference.  All selected papers will receive at least one additional review f=
rom the respective journal.  All remaining manuscripts will be published in=
 the online proceedings after the symposium.  =


This year's symposium will be held on the beautiful volcanic resort island =
of Jeju in South Korea, a short 1 hour flight from Seoul. The island is wel=
l known for its scenic beaches, waterfalls, cliffs and caves that lie in ha=
rmony, as well as the mild temperature throughout the year. It also contain=
s the UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site entitled Jeju Volcanic Island and =
Lava Tubes.
