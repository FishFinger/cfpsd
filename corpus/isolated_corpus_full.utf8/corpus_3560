  7TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOGICS
  NOVEMBER, 2008, DOHA, QATAR
  http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/iwil2008
               
                 CALL FOR PAPERS


The 7th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics will be held in
conjunction with the 15th International Conference on Logic for Programming,
Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning, LPAR 2008 (http://www.lpar.net/2008/),
in Doha, Qatar, in November 2008. IWIL has been unusually sucessful in
bringing together many talented developers, and thus in sharing information
about successful implementation techniques for automated reasoning systems and
similar programs. We are looking for contributions describing implementation
techniques for and implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem
provers for various logics, logic programming systems, and related
technologies. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * Data structures and algorithms for the efficient representation of
      logical concepts
    * Theorem proving systems
    * Model generation systems
    * Satisfiability-modulo-theories systems
    * Constraint-based systems
    * Logic programming systems
    * Implementation of propositional logic and decision procedures
    * Implementation of higher order logics and lambda-calculus
    * Implementation of new and unusual calculi
    * Integration of systems based on different logics
    * Transformations between different logics (e.g., abstractions)
    * Issues of reliability, witness generation, and witness verification
    * Evaluation and benchmarking of logic-based systems
    * Reasoning for ontologies
    * Ontology modularity, module extraction

Contributions that help the community to understand how to build useful
and powerful reasoning systems in practice are of particular interest.


Important dates:
---------------

    * Submission of abstracts: October 18th
    * Notification: October 27th
    * Workshop (preliminary): November 22rd, with LPAR 2008.


Submission
---------

Please submit an extended abstract of up to 10 pages in PDF, conforming to the
format produced by LaTeX using the easychair.cls class file available from the
workshop web-page.  Long listings of computer output should be relegated to a
referenced WWW site. Submission is via EasyChair.  All submissions will be
informally reviewed by the programme committee and accepted contributions will
be published in archived electronic notes.
