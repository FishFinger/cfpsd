Critical Directions in Comparative Austronesian Studies 
Short Title: CDCAS

Location: Canberra, Australia

Meeting URL: http://rspas.anu.edu.au/linguistics/ComparativeAustronesian/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics; General Linguistics; Historical Linguistics 

Language Family(ies): Austronesian 
Meeting Description: 

It has been over ten years since the publication of The Austronesians (1995) and even longer since the 
ANU conference was held from which that volume emerged. A great deal of research has been done in 
archaeology, anthropology, linguistics and genetics since that time, as well as numerous integrationist 
studies. It is now appropriate to take stock of what has been discovered and what can be learned from 
it. It is essential, however, to begin with the presentation of new evidence.

For that reason, we have proposed this Workshop, scheduled for the 28th and 29th of January, to be 
held at the ANU with the aim of bringing together researchers who can present critical evidence, and 
who are willing to discuss their findings from different perspectives. At this stage, we are not asking 
for definitive papers or summation statements. Rather we hope that the Workshop will provide a forum 
for the consideration of what we know, what we think we know, and what we need to focus on for the 
development of future research.

We are suggesting a deviation from a 'normal' conference model. We would like talks to be 30 minutes 
each, mainly consisting of a clear presentation, suitable to an interdisciplinary audience, of the critical 
data that each researcher brings to the discussion. Following this we call for a short disciplinary 
interpretation of these data, without attempting to integrate with evidence from other disciplines. Each 
talk will end with 5 minutes for clarificatory questions. We shall save general discussion, questions and 
answers, and debate for dedicated discussion slots, during which we shall also work towards an 
integrated model that combines data from the different disciplines.
