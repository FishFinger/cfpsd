The 14th Conference on Formal Grammar

Call for Papers

Background
FG-2009 is the 14th conference on Formal Grammar, to be held in conjunction with
the European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information, which takes place
in 2009 in Bordeaux, France.

Previous Formal Grammar meetings were held in Barcelona (1995), Prague (1996),
Aix-en-Provence (1997), Saarbruecken (1998), Utrecht (1999), Helsinki (2001),
Trento (2002), Vienna (2003), Nancy (2004), Edinburgh (2005), Malaga (2006),
Dublin (2007) and Hamburg (2008).

Aims and Scope
FG provides a forum for the presentation of new and original research on formal
grammar, mathematical linguistics and the application of formal and mathematical
methods to the study of natural language. Themes of interest include, but are
not limited to:
-  formal and computational phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics;
- model-theoretic and proof-theoretic methods in linguistics;
- logical aspects of linguistic structure;
- constraint-based and resource-sensitive approaches to grammar;
- learnability of formal grammar;
- integration of stochastic and symbolic models of grammar;
- foundational, methodological and architectural issues in grammar;
- mathematical foundations of statistical approaches to linguistic  analysis.

Previous conferences in this series have welcomed papers from a wide variety of
frameworks.

Proceedings
Submissions will be reviewed anonymously by at least three reviewers. We plan to
publish accepted papers after the conference in the LNCS series of Springer.

Submission Details
We invite electronic submissions of original, unpublished 30-minute papers
(including questions, comments, and discussion). Papers should report original
work which was not presented in other conferences. However, simultaneous
submission is allowed, provided that the authors indicate other conference to
which the work was submitted on the paper submission form. Note that accepted
papers can only be presented in one of the venues. For more guidelines for
submissions see the conference web page.

The submission deadline is April 26th, 2009. Papers must be submitted
electronically at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fg09
