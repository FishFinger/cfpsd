Meeting Description

This workshop will bring together researchers from the US and abroad for a
discussion of the treatment of variation within current formal linguistic
theory.  Participating researchers will address the following themes:

- The status of linguistic features in grammar and their relation to the way
languages and dialects vary
- Intra-speaker variability due to selection of multiple grammars or parameters
- Patterns of variation in language acquisition 

Call for Posters

Workshop on Locating Variability: Formal Approaches

Center for the Study of African American Language
College of Humanities and Fine Arts
University of Massachusetts at Amherst


April 24th -26th, 2008


Recent trends in linguistic theory have led to increased interest in the role of
features and formal grammar in language variation, its expression as dialectal
difference, and speakers' choices of forms within dialects. While it is true
that research on dialects of English has focused mainly on the impact that
social factors have on the use of linguistic constructions, variation in
dialects of languages such as Italian, German, Dutch, and Flemish have been
productively analyzed using variation models developed within theoretical
syntax. This workshop will bring together researchers from the US and abroad for
a discussion of the treatment of variation within current formal linguistic
theory.  

While the speakers have been invited to participate (see list to follow), in
recognition of the scope of the topic and the many contributions to research in
this area, slots have been reserved for posters selected from submitted
abstracts. Submissions which present research on any topic consistent with the
themes of the workshop will be considered. Please send a one-page anonymous
abstract to kaa@linguist.umass.edu. The title ''WLV Abstract'' should be in the
subject line. Include your contact information in the body of the email message:
name, address, email address, affiliation. The abstracts must be received by
midnight on February 1, 2008.  Applicants will be notified as to whether their
abstracts have been accepted by February 25, 2008.
