32nd European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2010)

The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
28 - 31 March 2010

In cooperation with: BCS-IRSG, ACM SIGIR, The Open University, Dublin =

City University, University of Essex
http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/ecir2010/
***************************************************************************


Overview

The annual BCS-IRSG European Conference on Information Retrieval is the =

main European forum for the presentation of new research results in the =

field of Information Retrieval. The conference encourages the submission =

of high quality research papers reporting original, previously =

unpublished results. The 32nd European Conference on Information =

Retrieval will be held at The Open University in Milton Keynes, UK from =

the 28th to the 31st of March 2010.


Call for Posters

Poster presentations offer researchers a unique opportunity to present =

late-breaking results, significant work in progress or research that is =

best communicated in an interactive or graphical format, for which there =

is more time for discussion and questions than is sometimes available in =

a full paper session. Poster presentations are also a good way to =

present work applying information retrieval approaches and techniques to =

new domains and problems. Please note, however, that posters describing =

work at the proposal stage will not be accepted. Authors are invited to =

submit posters presenting original, previously unpublished, work on or =

before 22 October 2009. Submissions must be in English and must not =

exceed 4 pages. Authors are encouraged to conceal their identity where =

it is practical to do so. All posters will be refereed through =

double-blind peer review. All accepted posters will be published in the =

conference proceedings.

Poster submissions are welcome in all areas of Information Retrieval, =

including, but not limited to:

- Enterprise Search, Intranet, Desktop, Adversarial IR
- Web IR
- Digital libraries
- IR Theory and Formal Models
- Web log analysis
- Distributed IR, peer to peer IR, Mobile IR, Fusion/Combination
- Multimedia IR
- Cross-language retrieval, Multilingual retrieval, Machine translation =

for IR
- Topic detection and tracking, Routing, Content-based filtering, =

Collaborative filtering, Agents, Spam filtering
- Question answering, NLP for IR, Summarization, Lexical acquisition
- Text Data Mining
- Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis
- Text Categorization, Clustering
- Performance, Scalability, Architectures, Efficiency, Platforms
- Indexing, Query representation, Query reformulation, Structure-based =

representation, XML
- Metadata, Social networking/tagging
- Evaluation methods and metrics, Experimental design, Test collection
- Interactive IR, User studies, User models, Task-based IR
- User interfaces and visualization
- Other domain-specific IR (e.g., Genomic IR, legal IR, IR for chemical =

structures)
- Blog and online-community search


Call for Demonstrations

Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes or =

operational systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas gained =

from implementing IR systems and to obtain feedback from expert users. =

Demonstration submissions are welcome in any of the areas identified =

above. One-page demonstration abstracts will appear in the conference =

proceedings.

Authors are invited to submit demonstration outlines presenting =

original, previously unpublished, work on or before 22 October 2009. =

Submissions must be in English and consist of an extended abstract and =

an additional one-page requirements description. The abstract should =

emphasize what the implemented system aims to achieve, the major =

components of the system, the novelty of the techniques that have been =

implemented, and comparisons with comparable systems. The requirements =

description should identify the hardware, software and network access =

requirements for the demonstration. Network connections and computers =

with standard Web browsers can be provided upon request. Proposals to =

demonstrate systems that require more than a standard Web browser (e.g., =

context-aware mobile systems or virtual reality systems) must explain =

how the systems will be demonstrated at the conference. Unlike posters, =

authors of demonstration proposals are not expected to take measures to =

conceal their identity from reviewers.


Submissions

All submissions should follow the Springer LNCS formatting guidelines, =

available at http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-7-72376-0.

All posters and demos should be submitted electronically in PDF format =

at http://www.conftool.net/ecir2010/ on or before 22 October 2009.
