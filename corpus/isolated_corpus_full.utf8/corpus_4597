recent work on markers of discourse structure:=20
adverbials, connectives, discourse particles,=20

and/ or at the discourse level and, if so, which=20
ones? What impact do discourse structure markers=20

We invite papers using cognitive and functional=20

TOPICS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING:
- Segmentation and linearization

- Saliency and Information Structure
- Grammaticalization and evolution of structure markers
- Typological approach to structure markers
- Spatial and temporal discourse structure
- Effects of discourse organization markers on comprehension
- Acquisition and mastery of their use in discourse production
- Role of text structuring devices in acquiring knowledge
