This is the third in a series of workshops entitled "Constraints in Discour=
se".

It is a linguistic commonplace to say that the meaning of text is more than=
 the
conjunction of the meaning of its sentences. But what exactly are the rules=
 that =

govern its interpretation, and what are the constraints that define well-fo=
rmed =

discourse? For a long time, the development of precise frameworks of discou=
rse =

interpretation has been hampered by the lack of a deeper understanding of t=
he
dependencies between different discourse units. Recent years have seen a
considerable advance in this field. A number of strong constraints have bee=
n =

proposed that restrict the sequencing and attaching of segments at various =

descriptive levels, as well as the interpretation of their interrelations. =


The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for presenting recent resea=
rch on =

constraints in discourse. The target areas include the recognition of disco=
urse =

structure as well as the interpretation and generation of discourse in a br=
oad =

variety of domains. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from divers=
e =

formal approaches, including but not limited to:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
- Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
- Tree Adjoining Grammars
- Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
- The QUD Modell
- Plan Based Reasoning
- Abductive Reasoning
- Gricean Pragmatics
- Speech Act Theory

We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of the role of =

constraints in discourse, as well as empirical studies that shed light on t=
heir =

empirical validity. The conference is explicitly intended for discussion an=
d =

comparison of theoretical accounts that lay the ground for applications. It=
 is =

not intended as a platform for system demonstrations. Specific topics might =

relate to
 - Anaphora Resolution
 - Co-reference
 - Dialogical vs. Monological Discourse
 - Questions and Answers
 - Lexicon and Discourse Relations
 - Cognitive Modeling
 - Underspecification and Nonmonotonic Inferences
etc.

The organisers are planning to publish a book based on the contributions to=
 this =

workshop.

Publication (and workshop) language is English

hints that allow the identification of the authors (such as "in paper (...)=
 we
show that").
