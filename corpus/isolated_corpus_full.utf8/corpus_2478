    Workshop on Parsing and Semantic Role Labeling
    Tilburg University, The Netherlands

    http://ilk.uvt.nl/parsrl/

    February 26, 2008
    9:30 - 17:30
    Room TZ 3 (Tias-Nimbas Building)


Call for Participation

The ILK Research group and the Communication and Information Sciences =

Department of the Faculty of Humanities of Tilburg University kindly =

invite you to participate in the Workshop on Parsing and Semantic Role =

Labeling.

The intrinsically related tasks of parsing and semantic role labeling =

are well-studied tasks in computational linguistics; the interest in =

them has been invigorated in recent years by the carefully defined CoNLL =

Shared Task competitions on both tasks, and the recent SemEval competition.

In this workshop we bring together researchers who apply machine =

learning techniques to parsing and/or semantic role labeling. While most =

of the work reported in the literature focuses on English, a part of =

this workshop is aimed at reporting and discussing results obtained for =

Spanish and Dutch. As for parsing, supervised and unsupervised =

approaches to parsing will be discussed. Semantic role labeling systems =

based both on constituents and dependency syntax will be presented. =

Another focus of discussion will be on the interrelation between parsing =

and semantic role labeling: how essential is parsing for semantic role =

labeling?

Entrance is free. We kindly ask you to register by sending an email to =

J.F.L.Sinay@uvt.nl stating that you wish to participate, before February =

19, 2008.
