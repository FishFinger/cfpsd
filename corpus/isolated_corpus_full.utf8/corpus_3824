Meeting Description:

The large numbers of bilinguals in the world and widespread migrations of the
1990s, have led to dramatic increases in the number of children being raised in
multilingual communities. This drives the need for coordinated research and
policies which reflect bilingual situations when planning assessment, treatment
and placement of migrant children with specific language impairment (SLI) in
appropriate educational frameworks. These needs are best served by studying SLI
in the bilingual context. The main objective of this workshop is to bring
together researchers who study linguistic and cognitive abilities of bilingual
children, children with SLI and bilingual children with SLI across different
migrant communities to discuss the linguistic and cognitive nature of bilingual
SLI. 

Key words: Bilingualism, Specific Language Impairment (SLI), Language
Acquisition, Migration 

Call for Papers

Deadline: November 15, 2008 

Interfaces of Bilingualism and Specific Language Impairment Workshop
February 1-5, 2009

Institute for Advanced Study, the Hebrew University, Israel
 
The large numbers of bilinguals in the world and widespread migrations of the
1990s, have led to dramatic increases in the number of children being raised in
multilingual communities. Typically developing (TD) bilinguals often look like
the children with Specific Language Impairement (SLI), creating methodological
and clinical diagnostic confounds. Medical, language and educational
professionals have limited test instruments to distinguish language impaired
migrant children from those who will eventually catch up to their monolingual
peers. As a result, folk wisdom reigns, often carrying the view that bilingual
children with language disorders should be educated in a single language,
usually not the language of the home. In recent years, several research groups
have taken upon themselves to disentangle bilingualism and SLI by establishing
the relative contribution of the each to impaired language performance.
