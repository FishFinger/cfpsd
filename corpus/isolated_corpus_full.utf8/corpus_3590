              GEMS : GEometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics

                **** Submission Deadline:  December 19, 2008 ****
****************************************************************************

Endorsed by SIGLEX.

Distributional models and semantic spaces represent a core topic in =

contemporary computational linguistics for their impact on advanced tasks
and =

on other knowledge fields (such as social science and the humanities).

The goal of the GEMS workshop is to further stimulate research on semantic =

spaces  and distributional methods for NLP, by adopting an interdisciplinary

approach to allow a proper exchange of ideas, results and resources among =

often independent  communities. In particular, the workshop will provide a =

common ground for a fruitful discussion among experts of distributional =

approaches, collocational corpus analysis and machine learning; researchers =

interested in the use of statistical models in NLP applications (e.g.
question =

answering, summarization and textual entailment) and in other fields of =

science; and experts in formal computational semantics.

The workshop aims at gathering contemporary contributions to large scale =

problems in meaning representation, acquisition and use, based on =

distributional and vector space models. The workshop aims also to shed =

new light on the use of such  techniques  on complex linguistic tasks, =

such as linguistic knowledge acquisition, semantic role labeling, =

textual entailment recognition, question answering, document =

understanding/summarization and ontology learning.

The workshop is endorsed by SIGLEX, the ACL Special Interest Group on the =

Lexicon.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite submissions on any topic of current interest related to the
application of semantic spaces to NLP and related disciplines, such as:

  - Document-based, Collocational and Syntagmatic spaces
  - Eigenvector methods (e.g. Singular Value and Tucker Decomposition)
  - Higher order tensors and Quantum Logic extensions
  - Feature engineering in machine learning models
  - Computational complexity and evaluation issues
  - Graph-based models over semantic spaces
  - Logic and inference in semantic spaces
  - Psychological and cognitive theories of semantic space models
  - Applications in the humanities and social sciences

We also especially encourage submissions on the empirical  evaluation of the

above computational models within the  following NLP tasks:

  - Word sense disambiguation and discrimination
  - Selectional preference induction
  - Acquisition of lexicons and linguistic patterns
  - Conceptual clustering
  - Kernels methods for NLP (e.g. relation extraction and textual
entailment)
  - Quantitative extensions of Formal Concept Analysis
  - Modeling of linguistic theories and ontological knowledge:


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit papers on original, unpublished work in the =

topic area of this workshop. In addition to long papers presenting completed

work, we also invite short papers and demos: =


  - Long papers should present completed work and should not exceed 8 pages.

  - Short papers/demos can present work in progress or the description of =

     a system, and should not exceed 5 pages. =


As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are  anonymous.  The =

papers  should not include the authors' names and affiliations or any =

references to web sites, project names etc. revealing  the authors'
identity.
Self-references that reveal the author's identity,  e.g., "We previously =

showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided.  Each submission will be =

reviewed by at least two members of the program committee.  Accepted papers =

will be published in the workshop proceedings. =


All submissions are to be formatted using the EACL 2009 stylefiles.
Submission will be electronic, via a web-service to be announced later. =

Please consult the Workshop web page for more details.

Notification of acceptance: January 30, 2009
Camera-ready papers due: February 13, 2009
