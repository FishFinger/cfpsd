ACL/IJCNLP-2009 Workshop

"The People's Web meets NLP:
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources"

Co-located with Joint conference of the 47th Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the 4th International
Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian
Federation of Natural Language Processing

Singapore
6-7 August 2009

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, online resources collaboratively constructed by ordinary
users on the Web have considerably influenced the NLP community. In many
works, they have been used as a substitute for conventional semantic
resources and as semantically structured corpora with great success.
While conventional resources such as WordNet are developed by trained
linguists [1], online semantic resources can now be automatically
extracted from the content collaboratively created by the users [2].
Thereby, the knowledge acquisition bottlenecks and coverage problems
pertinent to conventional lexical semantic resources can be overcome.

The resource that has gained the greatest popularity in this respect
so far is Wikipedia. However, other resources recently discovered in
NLP, such as folksonomies, the multilingual collaboratively
constructed dictionary Wiktionary, or Q&A sites like WikiAnswers or
Yahoo! Answers are also very promising. Moreover, new wiki-based
platforms such as Citizendium or Knol have recently emerged that
offer features distinct from Wikipedia and are of high potential
in terms of their use in NLP.

The benefits of using Web-based resources come along with new
challenges, such as the interoperability with existing resources and
the quality of the knowledge represented. As collaboratively created
resources lack editorial control, they are typically incomplete. For
the interoperability with conventional resources, the mappings have
to be investigated. The quality of collaboratively constructed
resources is questioned in many cases, and the information extraction
remains a complicated task due to the incompleteness and semi-
structuredness of the content. Therefore, the research community has
begun to develop and provide tools for accessing collaboratively
constructed resources [2,5].

The above listed challenges actually present a chance for NLP
techniques to improve the quality of Web-based semantic resources.
Researchers have therefore proposed techniques for link prediction [3]
or information extraction [4] that can be used to guide the "crowds"
to construct resources that are better suited for being used in NLP
in return.

TOPICS

The workshop will bring together researchers from both worlds: those
using collaboratively created resources in NLP applications such as
information retrieval, named entity recognition, or keyword extraction,
and those using NLP applications for improving the resources or
extracting different types of semantic information from them. Hopefully,
this will turn into a feedback loop, where NLP techniques improved by
collaboratively constructed resources are used to improve the resources
in exchange.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
 * Different types of collaboratively constructed resources, such as
   wiki-based platforms, Q&A sites or folksonomies;
 * Using collaboratively constructed resources in NLP such as
   information retrieval, text categorization, information
   extraction, etc.;
 * Analyzing the properties of collaboratively constructed resources
   related to their use in NLP;
 * Interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with
   conventional semantic resources and between themselves;
 * Converting unstructured information into structured lexical
   semantic information; tools for mining social and collaborative
   content;
 * Quality issues with respect to collaboratively constructed resources.

We also encourage the submission of short papers describing publicly
available tools for accessing or analyzing collaboratively created
resources. During the breaks, tables can be provided for demonstrations.


INVITED SPEAKER

Rada Mihalcea, University of North Texas
