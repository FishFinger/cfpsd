Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

A two-day workshop will be held at Potsdam University as part of the activities within the special research group SFB 632 'Information Structure', funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG). The workshop aims at bringing together descriptive and theoretical perspectives on the analysis of predicate focus, where we understand predicate focus as a cover term for a number of related, or even identical phenomena that are discussed in the literature under various headings, such as verum focus, auxiliary focus, polarity focus, focus on tense and aspect, event focus, and narrow focus on the lexical verb. What all these instances of predicate focus have in common is that they are used to highlight aspects of the verbal or functional meaning of a clause, as opposed to the highlighting of arguments and adjuncts, which figures more prominently in the literature.

Important Dates:
1 June 2008: deadline for abstract submissions
15 July 2008: notification of acceptance
14-15 November 2008: Workshop in Potsdam

Predicate Focus, Verum Focus, Verb Focus: Similarities and Differences

Among the many interesting aspects of predicate focus are the following:

- Crosslinguistically, predicate focus is often grammatically unmarked and subject to contextual resolution: Why is predicate focus not obligatorily marked?
- If marked, predicate foci tend to involve non-canonical strategies that differ from focus marking on arguments and adjuncts. A frequently attested means of marking predicate focus is the use of specific (ad)verbal focus markers in form of special stem forms, inflections, affixes, or adverbal particles. Additional means of marking predicate focus include nominalization, sometimes accompanied by movement, or particular morphological markers: Why is predicate focus marked differently from nominal argument/adjunct focus?
- Some languages show an affinity between focus on the truth value, on the tense/aspect, and on the lexical verb in that all three instances of focus are grammatically marked in the same way: What are the structural or semantic reasons behind this affinity?
- Some languages mark predicate focus and all-new/thetic utterances in the same way: What is the semantic connection between theticity and predicate focus?
- In some languages, discourse particles can be used for emphasizing the truth or factualness of the event reported, so that they look like markers of verum/polarity focus: What is the semantic relation between discourse particles and markers of predicate focus?

From a semantic point of view it is not clear why predicate focus should differ from argument/adjunct focus. While predicate focus involves semantically unsaturated expressions and might therefore involve more complexity in the focus semantic component, the modeling of predicate focus as such is not different from that of argument foci. One goal of the workshop is therefore to explore what are the structural or semantic factors behind the special behavior of predicate focus.

We invite submissions reporting on descriptive and/or theoretical work relating to the structural and semantic nature of predicate focus. We particularly encourage submissions that include discussions of lesser investigated languages. In addition to the various issues raised above, contributions to the workshop could focus on, but are not limited to, the following questions:

- What are the possible focus readings observed with verb-specific focus markers expressing predicate focus in different languages?
- Is it possible to give a unified account of the meaning contribution of such verb-specific focus markers in different languages?
- How are verb focus, auxiliary focus and verum/polarity focus expressed in isolating languages, e.g. in South East Asian?
- Is there really a systematic ambiguity between narrow focus on the verb, on the one hand, and focus on tense/aspect or the truth value, on the other?
- How do markers of predicate focus interact with other grammatical categories, such as negation, argument/adjunct focus, sentence type and aspect?
- Can markers of predicate focus occur in embedded environments?
- To what extent can discourse particles be used as markers of predicate focus?

Invited speaker: Tom Güldemann (Universität Zürich)

We are planning to have slots of 45 minutes per speaker, including 10 minutes of discussion. Depending on the number of accepted papers, the organizers reserve the right to reduce the individual slots to 35 minutes.

Abstract submissions should reach us no later than 1 June 2008. An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts must be at most 2 pages in 12-point font with 1'' margins, including data and references. Authors are requested to submit an anonymous copy of the abstract as pdf-attachment to the following address: hole@uni-potsdam.de. The name of the pdf file should be the author(s)'s name(s): name.pdf

The body of the email should contain the following information:
1. Name(s) of author(s)
2. Title of talk
3. Affiliation(s)
4. E-mail address(es)

1 June 2008: deadline for abstract submissions

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
