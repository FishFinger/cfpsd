Meeting Description:

The conference aims at bringing together scholars, instructors, university
leaders and administrative personnel working in bi- and multilingual
universities, so as to provide them with terrain for scientific and didactic
discussion, comparison of practices, approaches and results and networking
opportunities. 

It will give particular emphasis to bottom-up, application-oriented research, as
well as to the critical analysis of practices and policies; a major objective
will be to highlight current best practices, but also obstacles and limits faced
by multilingual universities across Europe.

Topics will include (required and targeted) student language competence,
autonomous learning, CLIL and analysis of academic discourse, English as lingua
franca, cost and benefits of institutional multilingualism and minority
langauges and higher education. 

Bi- and multilingual universities 2007: European perspectives and beyond

Call for papers

The international conference ''Bi- and multilingual universities 2007: European
perspectives and beyond'', will be hosted by the Free University of
Bozen-Bolzano from 20 to 22 September 2007.
Our goal is continuation of the discussion on multilingual higher education
initiated by the 1st conference on bi- and multilingual universities held in
Fribourg/Freiburg in 2003 and subsequently continued with the 2nd conference in
Helsinki 2005, ''Bi- and multilingual universities: European perspectives and
beyond'' in Bolzano will place particular emphasis on bottom-up,
application-oriented research, as well as on the critical analysis of practices
and policies on the one hand and on the promotion of exchange of experiences and
information on the other. Furthermore, a major objective of the conference will
be to highlight current best practices, but also obstacles and limits faced by
multilingual universities across Europe and to place them against the background
of the language policy adopted by the EU to promote functional multilingualism
in society.
 
Topics:

The multi-faceted nature of multilingual higher education is a well known
reality for students, educators, scholars, administrators and university leaders
acting in environments where two or more languages are used in informal
every-day communication, teaching and learning, decision-taking, planning,
negotiating. While such a reality may be seen, perceived and tackled from
different perspectives representing focus and priorities of different subjects,
it is clear that all of them are strongly interconnected, and that solutions to
problems can be only found within interdisciplinarity and interaction. The issue
of English as a medium of instruction and as lingua franca, for instance,
involves not only questions of international standards and certifications, but
also the consideration of the communicative habits of the single disciplines;
planning coaching measures for subject-matter instructors can be based on
established CLIL-experiences and profit from investigations into academic
communicative styles; discussing the kind of competence required of prospective
students and to be reached by graduating students has to take into account the
needs of workplaces but also to establish solid links with secondary education
prior to university.
Following such considerations, the conference will be broken down into thematic
areas that will allow participants to explore in detail those varied points of
view, to compare them and to relate them to each other, so as to gain a
comprehensive overview that includes didactical, scientific, organizational,
economic and policy aspects of multilingual higher education. 
 
We welcome contributions on following topics:

- Language competence of incoming and outgoing students: language assessment,
certifications, quality standards
- Autonomous learning and extra-curricular measures
- English as language of instruction and as lingua franca
- Schools and workplaces: synergies with higher education
- CLIL, coaching for subject-matter instructors, analysis of academic discourse
(lecturer and student communicative practices)
- Minority languages and higher education
- The administration perspective: costs and benefits of institutional
multilingualism
- Institutional language policies and everyday practices: case studies

Abstracts:

Proposals for presentations should not exceed 2000 characters (about 300 words),
and can be presented in English, German, Italian, French or Spanish. Each
contribution will be given a 30-minutes slot (20-minute presentation and
10-minute discussion).
 
Presentations in languages other than English are highly encouraged; in order to
make the use of such languages feasible by ensuring mutual comprehension, we
suggest the adoption of bilingual communication (for instance, speech in the
chosen language and visual presentation and/or hand-out in English).

Meeting Description

The SEMDIAL series of workshops aim to bring together researchers working on the
semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such as artificial intelligence,
computational linguistics, formal semantics/pragmatics, philosophy, psychology,
and neural science. In 2007 we will celebrate ten years of the SEMDIAL series
with the DECALOG workshop, organized at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences,
CIMeC (Centro Interdipartimentale Mente/Cervello), of the University of Trento
in Rovereto. The SemDial workshops are always stimulating and fun, and Rovereto
is a great place to visit.

     http://www.easychair.org/DECALOG2007/

   Before submitting you must register with the website and receive a
   password by email; please do this well ahead of your submission,
   since email is sometimes unreliable. You will also need to fill out
   a web form with the author details and type in (or paste) a
   plain-text version of your abstract (200 words), in addition to
   uploading your paper.

   The actual paper should be an anonymous PDF file, 6 pages long
   (including data, tables, figures, and references), A4 paper size,

   COLING/ACL 2006.

   Multiple submissions by the same author or group of authors are
   allowed, but each person may only give one oral presentation at the
   workshop.

   We will have a separate submission of late-breaking system
   demonstrations and ongoing project descriptions, to be presented in
   a poster session during the workshop. Late-breaking submissions
   will be two pages long; they will not be refereed, but evaluated
   for relevance only by the program committee chairs. Submission of
   late-breaking abstracts will be allowed only after review of the
   main session papers has concluded. The deadline for late-breaking
   submissions is 15 April 2007.

Proceedings

   Final, 8-page versions of the accepted papers, together with the
   2-page accepted late breaking abstracts, will be distributed in a
   proceedings volume at the workshop.
