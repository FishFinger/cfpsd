Meeting Description

Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic knowledge
into high level applications such as information retrieval, machine translation,
or question answering, for which efficiency and robustness is of importance. In
comparison with chunking and deep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding
structure that is richer than chunks but less exhaustive than full
syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing may involve constructing nested
structures (unlike simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a
sentence.   However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather an area
ranging from chunking to almost full parsing. This workshop will bring together
researcher who work on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Submission deadline: 17 February 2008


Scope

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted to):

- linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: syntactic and
semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical structure, semantic information
(anaphora, disambiguation);

- the usability of language resources for the development of partial parsers;

- multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;

- experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers for
new languages;

- technical aspects of partial parsers:
- robustness, scalability;
- time and space complexity;
- expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. context-free rules;
unification; type hierarchies; etc.);

- applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question answering,
machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical information, etc.;

- evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different partial
parsing tasks, etc.;

- ways of combining multiple partial parsers;

- comparsion (classification) of partial parsers.


Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should indicate
the state of completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with
previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be

Meeting Description

Workshop on Sentiment Analysis: Emotion, Metaphor, Ontology and Terminology at
LREC 2008
27 May 2008


Workshop Topics

Sentiment analysis systems seek to extract emotions and feelings expressed about
people, organisations, nation states, goods and services, in free natural
language texts. This interdisciplinary workshop will address three related
topics in this area:

(a) how metaphor and sentiment interact in everyday communication;

(b) language/conceptual resources properties to support sentiment analysis

(c) evaluation of sentiment analysis programs and evaluation methodologies.

There will be one keynote lecture on each of the three topics followed 
by the presentation of papers related to each of the three topics.

Sentiment Analysis: Emotion, Metaphor, Ontology and Terminology
(EMOT 2008)

Submission deadline: 20 February 2008


Workshop Aims

This workshop will deal with the recent advances in the processing of
''sentiment'' in arbitrary collections of text. Sentiment can be expressed about
works of art and literature, about the state of financial markets, about liking
and disliking individuals, organisations, ideologies, and consumer goods. It is
necessary to examine what aspects of emotional experience sentiment analysis
aims to capture, how and in what way this may be evaluated. This workshop
focuses on three strands of research which will serve to enhance the development
of automated sentiment analysis systems of free text for real world applications.

Firstly, in psychology and computational linguistics, the notions of emotion and
metaphor interact in a number of complex ways. It has been argued that
conceptual metaphors underlie human understanding and processing of emotion. In
addition, it can be argued that the expression of sentiment and its
interpretation can rely critically on how a speaker or writer uses metaphor.
Therefore, an understanding of how emotion is expressed and perceived in
language is not complete without addressing the role of figurative language and
metaphor as basic scaffolding or tool for modulating affective text content.

Secondly, to date, sentiment analysis typically deals with a specific domain of
'ideal objects'. In order to build a sentiment analysis system, one has to
understand 'what there is' in a given domain, i.e. the ontology of the domain.
In this context, is it possible to conceive of generic sentiment analysis?
Practitioners in this area need to examine the requirements and challenges of an
approach that could cross boundaries of domain or time or even language where
different communities of use, languages or cultures may express or even
experience sentiments in different ways.

Finally, work in sentiment analysis may be regarded as work in intelligent
information retrieval and ''success'' is evaluated in terms of accuracy in
identifying the affective content of information segments. Yet sentiment
analysis has the potential to have a powerful impact in other domains that
require input about emotional context. Researchers in Human-Computer
Interaction, Affective Computing, Lexicography and Terminography, may become
end-users of work in sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis folks may have
much to learn from how a machine artificially ''endowed'' with
emotions/sentiments behaves. It may become feasible to evaluate sentiment
analysis systems in terms of the performance of such applications. An
examination of alternative end-user systems and evaluation mechanisms can only
serve to enrich the field of sentiment analysis and present new challenges for
researchers to address.
