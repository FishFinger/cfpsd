I take it that the benefit of attending such a meeting is on a much longer
run than simply taking ideas on board to complete a PhD. The way I read it,
it's more about large-scale networking, discussing possible career paths,
and maybe also, if lucky, specific opportunities. It sounds like a good
place where to be as a (soon-to-be) job seeker... That's why I think that
ideally it would be especially useful +/- 2 months around submission--if
there wasn't anything else to focus on!!
