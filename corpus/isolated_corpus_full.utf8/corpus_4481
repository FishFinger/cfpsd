                              Paris, France

ACL/SIGPARSE will  host the  11th International Conference  on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'09) on October 7 - 9, 2009 in Paris, France, at 
the University of Paris 7.

IWPT'09  continues  the tradition  of  biennial  workshops on  parsing
technology  organized  by  SIGPARSE,  the Special  Interest  Group  on
Parsing of  the Association for Computational  Linguistics (ACL).  The
first  workshop, in  Pittsburgh  and Hidden  Valley,  was followed  by
workshops in Cancun (Mexico) in 1991; Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy
(Belgium) in 1993;  Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech  Republic) in 1995;
Boston/Cambridge  (Massachusetts)  in 1997;  Trento  (Italy) in  2000;
Beijing  (China)  in  2001; in Nancy (France) in  2003;  in  Vancouver
(Canada) (2005); and in Prague (Czech Republic) in 2007.


Topics of interest for IWPT'09
------------------------------
Topics  of interest  for  IWPT'09  include, but  are  not limited  to:

theoretical  and  practical  studies  of   parsing  and   transduction
algorithms   for  natural   language   sentences,  texts,   fragments,
dialogues,  ill-formed   sentences,  speech  input,  multi-dimensional
(pictorial)  or  signed languages, multimedia (web) documents; parsing
issues arising  or viewed  in a  multimodal  and multilingual context; 
parsing  in  relation  to   semantic  and  pragmatic  information  and 
communication;  cognitive  aspects  of grammar  and  their  impact  on 
parsing. 
Knowledge-based and data-driven approaches are equally welcome.


Time schedule:
--------------
   Deadline for full paper submission:       25 May,  2009
   Full papers notification of acceptance:    1 July, 2009
   Deadline for short paper submission:       8 July, 2009
   Short papers notification of acceptance:  15 July, 2009
   Final papers due:                       15 August, 2009
   Conference:                         7 - 9 October, 2009


Submitting Papers
-----------------
Two types of submissions are invited:
- full papers,  to be presented  as such during the conference and to 
  be published in the conference proceedings (maximally 12 pages);
- short papers,  to be  presented  at the conference in the form of a 
  poster  plus a summary oral presentation  in a short-paper session; 
  four-page summaries will be published in the conference proceedings.

Submissions of either type should describe original work. Full papers 
should be concerned with  completed work  or intermediate results  of
ongoing work,  rather than  with intended work,  and should  indicate 
clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Short papers
may describe planned or starting research or untested ideas.

A paper accepted for presentation  at IWPT 2009 cannot be presented or
have  been presented  at  any other  meeting  with publicly  available
published  proceedings.  Papers  that  are being  submitted  to  other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must
papers  that  contain significant  overlap  with previously  published
work.

The  reviewing of  the  papers will  be  blind. The  paper should  not
include   the   authors'   names   and   affiliations.    Furthermore,
self-citations  and other  references (e.g.  to projects,  corpora, or
software)  that   could  reveal   the  author's  identity   should  be
avoided. For  example, instead of "We previously  showed (Smith, 1991)
...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".


Instructions for authors 
------------------------ 
Prospective   authors   are   invited   to  send   their   submissions
through the electronic submission  page  of  the  conference. The only
accepted format  for submitted papers is PDF.  Full papers  should not 
exceed 12 pages; short papers should not exceed 8 pages.


Detailed formatting and submission instructions for authors will be
available through the IWPT'09 home page at:

       http://alpage.inria.fr/iwpt09
