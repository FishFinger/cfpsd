Corpus and Cognition: The relation between=20
natural and experimental language data


MOTIVATION

While the usefulness of corpora for the=20
description of language cannot be denied, it must=20
also be recognised that they are not the only=20
sources for language data. Corpora show how=20
people use language in authentic environments, or=20
what is likely to occur in language, but they do=20
not make it possible to answer questions having=20
to do with, say, grammaticality or language=20
processing, or how, if at all, language is=20
structured in the mind. Hence the suggestion,=20
made by several researchers (e.g. Kennedy 1998),=20
to combine corpus data with other types of linguistic evidence.

One particularly interesting combination is that=20
between corpus analyses and experimental=20
techniques (elicitation, lexical decision,=20
magnitude estimation, eye movement research,=20
reaction time measures, etc.). While the former=20
make it possible to study =93properties of the=20
linguistic output of language users=94 (Sandra=20
1995: 592), the latter give access to =93properties=20
of the mental processes and structures underlying=20
language production and comprehension=94 (ibid.),=20
such as cognitive salience or readability.=20
Bringing together the two approaches, therefore,=20
offers a more holistic view of language.

Depending on the phenomenon investigated and the=20
types of data used (e.g. speech vs. writing,=20
sentence production vs. self-paced reading), one=20
may find that the natural and experimental=20
language data converge (cf. Gries et al. 2005)=20
or, on the contrary, that they produce different=20
results (cf. Roland & Jurafsky 2002). We believe=20
that, by examining such relations more closely,=20
we will learn more about the specificities of=20
each type of data and will thus be able to make=20
informed choices about how the two can fruitfully=20
be combined, in domains such as descriptive=20
linguistics, sociolinguistics or foreign language teaching.

While the usefulness of corpora for the description of language cannot be

&nbsp;<br>
One particularly interesting combination is that between corpus analyses
and experimental techniques (elicitation, lexical decision, magnitude
