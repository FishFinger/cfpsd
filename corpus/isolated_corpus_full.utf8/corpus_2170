Meeting Description

The International Workshop on Spoken Languages Technologies for
Under-Resourced Languages (SLTU) will be held at Hanoi University of

Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam, May 5 - May 7, 2008.
Workshop Web Site: http://www.mica.edu.vn/sltu 

Call for Papers

The STLU meeting is a technical conference focused on spoken language processing
for under-resourced languages. This first workshop will focus on Asian
languages, and the idea is to mainly (but not exclusively) target languages of
the area (Vietnamese, Khmer, Lao, Chinese dialects, Thai, etc.). However, all
contributions on other under-resourced languages of the world are warmly welcomed.

The workshop aims at gathering researchers working on:
- ASR, synthesis and speech translation for under-resourced languages
- portability issues
- fast resources acquisition (speech, text, lexicons, parallel corpora)
- spoken language processing for languages with rich morphology
- spoken language processing for languages without separators
- spoken language processing for languages without writing system

- Paper submission: January 15, 2008
- Notification of Paper Acceptance: February 20, 2008
