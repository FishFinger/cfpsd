<h4>Research area: Intelligent Systems - Artificial Intelligence</h4>
<p>My language interests focus around spoken dialogue, dialogue processes=
, and dialogue systems; in particular, activity-oriented dialogue for com=
plex systems. Issues of interest include the representation of tasks, act=
ivities, goals, and intentions appropriate for effective activity-oriente=
d conversation, as well as representation of dialogue processes themselve=
s, using the Information-State Update paradigm. An important challenge is=
 the use of context representation, both for robust interpretation of utt=
erances as well as for improving interaction under error (e.g. recovering=
 from speech mis-recognition).

Of particular interest is the context of use of such systems. At Stanford=
, we worked on dialogue systems for the in-car environment, as well as fo=
r physical meeting spaces involving multiple participants. Different appl=
ication domains throw up novel issues and constraints, such as minimising=
 cognitive load and distraction, or managing multi-party dialogue using b=
oth spoken and visual cues.

<h3>HCSNet Priority Area:  Effective Interfaces</h3>

<p>Lawrence Cavedon, this week's spotlight, is a leader of HCSNet's Human
Effective Interfaces Priority Area. As our technology gets more complex,
so do the interfaces we use to communicate with that technology.
Communication breakdown in these interfaces is evident all around us:
video recorder remote controls with functionalities too complex to
understand, and repeated frustration at call-centre automation via less
than perfect speech recognition, are two very visible instances. At the
same time, humans are more complex than any devices we have yet created,
but we communicate with each other effortlessly. This research priority
area focuses on what it is that makes a human-computer interface,
particularly one where speech is used as the mode of communication,
effective.
See the Priority Areas web pages at <a
href=3D"http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/priorityareas">http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/=
priorityareas</a>
for more information.</p>
