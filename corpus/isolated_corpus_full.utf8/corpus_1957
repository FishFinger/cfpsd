MAIN CONFERENCE: 28-29-30 MAY 2008

WORKSHOPS and TUTORIALS: 26-27 MAY and 31 MAY- 1 JUNE 2008
Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/=20

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation =
(LREC) will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide =
range of international associations and organisations, including AAMT, =
AMTA, ACL, ALTA, COCOSDA and Oriental COCOSDA, EACL, EAMT, ELSNET, =
EURALEX, GWA, IAMT, KnowledgeWeb, LDC, NEMLAR Network, SIGLEX, TEI, =
Technolangue French Program, WRITE and with major national and =
international organisations including the European Commission - =
Information Society and Media, Unit E.2 "Content and Knowledge".

CONFERENCE AIMS
In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has =
become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for =
Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an =
overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and =
emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their =
applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned =
activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the =
e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and =
organisational ones.
LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding =
agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and =
opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for =
international cooperation, in support to investigations in language =
sciences, progress in language technologies and development of =
corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

*CONFERENCE TOPICS*

Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): =
text, speech, multimodality
- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for =
LRs
- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation
- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of =
knowledge
- Ontologies and knowledge representation
- Terminology
- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web =
technologies
- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications
- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, =
mobile communication, machine translation, summarisation, web services, =
semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.
- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, =
natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice =
activated services, etc.
- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. =
e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile applications, =
etc.
- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation
- HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs
- Benchmarking of systems and products
- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and =
dialogue systems
- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation
- National and international activities and projects
- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international =
policies for LRs
- Open architectures
- Organisational, economical and legal issues

Special Highlights

LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken, =
written, and other modalities - and of the respective communities. To =
this end, LREC encourages submissions covering issues which are common =
to different types of LRs and language technologies.
LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of =
applications and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass all =
those data that interact with language resources in an attempt to model =
more complex human processes and develop more complex systems, and =
encourages submissions on topics such as:
- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces, =
Human-Human interactions, and content processing
- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, =
including emotions
- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for =
robotic systems

PROGRAMME
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, =
poster and demo presentations, and panels.
There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. =
Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less =
interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.

ABSTRACT SUBMISSION
On-line submission form for abstracts is now available: please go to the =
"Abstract submission" section on the LREC2008 web site ( =
