The 5th International Workshop on "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND=20
COGNITIVE SCIENCE"
(NLPCS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/workshops/nlpcs/nlpcs2008-cfp.html

12-13 June, 2008 - Barcelona - Spain

In conjunction with the 10th International Conference on Enterprise=20
Information Systems (ICEIS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/


Co-Chairs
Bernadette Sharp, Staffordshire University, United Kingdom,=20
B.Sharp@staffs.ac.uk
Michael Zock, CNRS, LIF, Marseille, France, michael.zock@lif.univ-mrs.fr


BACKGROUND

Realising that no single discipline will ever suffice to reveal the=20
functioning of the human mind, cognitive science was born. The idea was=20
to analyse complex behaviour (speaking, thinking, problem-solving) from=20
different angles or levels and to build models that could account for =
them.


GOALS

While ambitious and intriguing, the idea looked promising enough to=20
attract numerous researchers, and there were plenty of opportunities=20
then to present this kind of work. Alas, the situation has changed, the=20
discipline has lost speed during the last decade. And if the reasons for =

this are multiple, ranging from lack of results to unkept promises (=AB=20
cognitive science =BB remaining wishful thinking rather than a widely=20
shared way of doing research), the fact is that funding has become more=20
and more scarce, and so have the opportunities to present work done=20
within this framework.

In the meantime statistical approaches have gained in popularity, and=20
evaluation has become an obligatory feature for presentation of work in=20
the arena of computational linguistics. While there is no doubt that=20
evaluation has certain qualities, it does not guarantee progress or=20
insights per se. A broader perspective is needed. To get the necessary=20
insights and to get the big picture, we probably need to get back to the =

framework in which we worked in those days, which means, we should adopt =

and integrate multiple viewpoints, that is, take a cognitive science=20
approach. This is the goal of this workshop.


JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEW NAME AND RELATION TO THE TOPICS

The workshop used to be called NLUCS (Natural Language Understanding and =

Cognitive Science), yet, realising that this is too restrictive, we=20
decided to rename it NLPCS (Natural Language Processing and Cognitive=20
Science), as NLP is obviously more than just natural language=20
understanding. Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Machine=20
Translation, Question Answering, Text Summarization, Text Generation,=20
etc. are all part of NLP or HLT (Human Language Technology), and they=20
all go clearly beyond language understanding. This being so, it might be =

a valuable proposition to integrate them into the debate. In other=20
words, we would like to widen the scope and provide a forum for all=20
researchers of NLP working within the CS paradigm.

Also, while certain components (dictionaries, grammars, or ontologies)=20
are very general, the way they are used varies considerably with the=20
task. Hence it is important to show how the task reflects in the use of=20
a given resource.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working=20
within the paradigm of cognitive science

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

. Computational Models of NLP
. Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
. Evolutionary NLP
. Situated (embodied) NLP
. Multimodality in speech / text processing
. Text Summarization and Information Extraction
. Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
. Computer Assisted Language Learning
. Multi-Lingual Processing
. Pragmatics and NLP
. Speech Processing
. Tools and Resources in NLP
. Ontologies
. Text Mining
. Electronic Dictionaries
. Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives:=20
full automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT),=20
semi-automated processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs=20
assisting people in their tasks), simulation of human cognitive process.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation=20
in any of the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be=20
accepted, and the length of the paper should not exceed 10 pages (5000=20
words). Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex=20
format) are available at the ICEIS web site.=20
http://www.iceis.org/paper_template.htm Postscript/RTF versions of the=20
manuscript should be submitted through ICEIS web-based paper submission=20
procedure: http://www.iceis.org/paper_submission.htm


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations of=20
previously submitted papers that went through a double peer review=20
process. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the form=20
of a book.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper Submission: March 3, 2008
Author Notification: April 4, 2008
Final Camera-Ready and Registration: April 14, 2008
