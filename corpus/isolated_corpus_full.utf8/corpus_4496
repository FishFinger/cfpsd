Full Title: Current Advances in Caucasian Studies 

Date: 21-Jan-2010 - 24-Jan-2010
Location: Macerata, Italy 
Contact Person: Vittorio Tomelleri
Meeting Email: caucasus@unimc.it

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2009 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the conference is to gather together specialists working on the
Caucasus area and to give an overview over the present state of research
involving this region. The conference will focus on contact viewed from
different points of view (cultural, religious, linguistic, philological,
historical and so on). The complex history of the Caucasus shows us that
contact, being as a rule often quite problematic and conflictual, is indeed a
major factor of development and mutual enrichment for all the individuals
involved in it. Therefore, we especially welcome papers putting the data in a
broader context and discussing phenomena of contacts between two ore more
groups, languages, and/or communities living in this area. 

Call for Papers
