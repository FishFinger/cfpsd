An issue on the contact between Putonghua and minority languages in China

Scope:
Since the promotion of Putonghua began in the 1950s, Putonghua and its
corresponding written form, standard written Han, have gradually spread to
China's minority language communities through the school systems, mass
media, official use, corpus planning, and eventually daily communication.
The spread has picked up speed in the last two decades as Putonghua is
officially designated as China's national language and China's market
economy unfolds across the country. The spread produces extensive language
contact that leads to variations.
The contact between Putonghua and various languages and dialects in the
past half-century is of great interest to scholars, students, and
practitioners of language planning and the sociology of language. In 2006,
the Journal of Asian Pacific Communication devoted an issue (vol. 16, 2) on
the contact between Putonghua and Han dialects, an issue that studied how
the contact produced varieties of Putonghua (?????). The current
planned issue of IJSL will focus on the contact between Putonghua and
minority languages in China. It will consider the following topics, but not
limited to them:
1)	How does Putonghua influence minority languages? How do minority
languages influence Putonghua? What variations does their contact produce?
2)	What are the sociolinguistic implications of the varieties of Putonghua
or varieties of minority languages resulted from the contact?
3)	Does any evidence of variation suggest that language contact in a
language-planning context behaves the same as that in a non-planning context? 
4)	What are the implications of this type of contact for the study of
language contact in general?
5)	What lessons can scholars, students, and practitioners of language
planning learn from this type of contact?
