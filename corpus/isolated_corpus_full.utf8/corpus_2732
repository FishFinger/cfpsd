Location: Salt Fork, OH, USA 
Contact Person: INLG Organizers

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 21-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 5th International Natural Language Generation Conference (the Biennial
Meeting of the Special Interest Group in Natural Language Generation SIGGEN)
will be held June 12-14, 2008 in Salt Fork, Ohio, USA.

INLG is the leading international conference on research into natural language
generation. It has been held in Sydney, Australia in 2006
(http://www.ict.csiro.au/inlg2006/), at Brockenhurst, UK in 2004
(http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/inlg04/), in Harriman, NY, USA in 2002
(http://inlg02.cs.columbia.edu/), and in Mitzpe Ramon, Israel in 2000
(http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~nlg2000/). Prior to 2000, INLGs were International
Workshops, running every other year since 1984. INLG provides a forum for the
discussion, dissemination and archiving of research topics and results in the
field of text generation. 

INLG 2008 will be held this year immediately prior to ACL:HLT 2008 (June 15-20),
in Salt Fork, OH (about 2 hours from Columbus, OH, the site of ACL:HLT 2008). In
addition to the INLG conference, there will be a special session for the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008). 

2nd Call for Papers

Invited Speakers:
Kiwako Ito and Shari Speer, The Ohio State University, USA
Matthew Stone, Rutgers, USA

Topics:
INLG invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics
related to natural language generation. Active topics of interest include:
- Affect/emotion generation
- Architecture of generators
- Content planning
- Discourse models
- Embodied generation
- Evaluation of NLG systems
- Generation and summarization
- Lexicalization
- Multilingual NLG
- Multimedia or multimodal generation
- NLG for real-world applications
- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks
- Planning and NLG
- Referring expression generation
- Statistical processing for NLG
- Surface realization
- Use of ontologies in NLG

Submission Information:
- Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2008 must not have
been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.
Submission to other conferences should be clearly indicated on the paper.
- Category of Papers: The conference will be organized as a 2.5 day workshop,
including sessions to present long papers, a special session for discussing the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008), and a poster
session for short papers and REG Challenge results.

Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time:
- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research results
and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references;
- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort
and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these will be
presented as posters during the poster session).

Paper Submission: 
Submissions should be uploaded to the EasyChair web site for the conference. The
only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should
follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. Use of the ACL style files is
strongly recommended.

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors within the
paper. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Note that in extreme cases, an author unable to comply with the above submission
procedure should contact the program chairs sufficiently before the submission
deadline so alternative arrangements can be made.

Important Dates:
Mar 21, 2008: Submission of papers and posters
Apr 25, 2008: Notification of acceptance
May 16, 2008: Submission of camera-ready copy
Jun 12-14, 2008: INLG 2008 in Salt Fork, OH

Special Session on Referring Expression Generation Challenge 2008

The second Referring Expression Generation Challenge will involve two
different data sets: the TUNA Corpus (with previously unseen test data), and the
GREC Corpus of references to named entities in free text. The Challenge will
have eight submission tracks, including attribute selection, realisation and
named entity generation tasks, as well as open category and evaluation methods
tracks. Assessment criteria will range from automatically computed metrics to
human evaluation. For the TUNA tasks the criteria will include minimality,
humanlikeness, and identification/comprehension by human readers; those for the
GREC task will include humanlikeness and the DUC criteria of coherence and
referential clarity. Subject to feasibility, system processing efficiency is
another possible criterion.

Full details on the challenge can be found on the REG Challenge 2008
website. A separate call for participation will be issued by the challenge
organizers, Anja Belz and Albert Gatt (gre-stec [at] itri.brighton.ac.uk).
