Meeting Description:

The Formal Approaches to Mayan Linguistics (FAMLi) Workshop aims to bring
together linguists to present work on contemporary Mayan languages and tackle
new and outstanding puzzles in the field. FAMLi encourages participation from
researchers working in any linguistic framework, and with any level of formal
linguistic background, to present data and analyses of Mayan languages. By
attracting a diverse group of participants, FAMLi hopes to facilitate
communication between Mayan language researchers, and to create contacts between
Mayan scholars and the broader theoretical community. 

Invited Speakers:

Judith Aissen (UCSC)
Heriberto Avelino (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology)
Ximena Lois (University of Michigan)
B'alam Mateo Toledo (CIESAS)
Norvin Richards (MIT) 

Call for Papers

In addition to five invited talks, FAMLi is accepting abstracts for
presentations and posters in English or Spanish. Presentations should provide a
formal analysis in any subfield of Mayan linguistics. The poster session will be
devoted to work on language revitalization, and to detailed descriptions of
grammatical phenomena and puzzles in Mayan languages. FAMLi especially
encourages abstract submissions from native speakers of Mayan languages.

Abstracts should be one page in length (1 inch margins, at least 11 point font),
with an additional page for data and references. Abstracts will be accepted in
either English or Spanish. Abstracts should be submitted via Easy Abs:
http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/famli2010 

Thanks to a generous grant from the National Science Foundation, FAMLi has
funding to assist with travel and lodging for participants with little or no
institutional support. Special priority will be given to native speaker
participants.
