             ACL-07 Call For Workshop Proposals

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for
workshops to be held in conjunction with the 45th Annual Meeting of
the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-07), in Prague,
Czech Republic. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest to the
ACL community.

The workshops will be held on Thursday, June 28, and Friday, June 29,
2007 at the main conference venue.

The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find general
information on policies regarding attendance, publication, financing,
and sponsorship, as well as on specific policies on sponsorship and
financial support of SIG workshops, at the following URL:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/index-policies.html Your
proposal should include a budget, a clear motivation and estimations
of numbers of submissions and attendees.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

A workshop proposal submission form is available online at
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/workshops/proposal.txt containing
prompts for information that is expected in the proposal.

Proposals for workshops should contain:

1. A title and brief description (max. 500 words) of the workshop
    topic and its motivation.

2. A description of target audience and expected number of
    participants.

3. The intended length and format of the workshop (half a day to two

    program committee if the workshop proposal is accepted.
