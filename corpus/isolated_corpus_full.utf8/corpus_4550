CALL FOR PAPERS
----------
4th Special Track on Ontologies for Biomedical Systems
3-4 August 2009
Albuquerque, New Mexico

http://cbms09.biomap.org/

22nd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems

http://cvial.ee.ttu.edu/cbms2009/
----------

Biomedical Ontologies have developed in an uncoordinated way, often
reflecting mere relations of 'association' between what are called
'concepts', and serving primarily the purposes of information extraction
from on-line biomedical literature and databases. In recent years, we have
learned a great deal about the criteria which must be satisfied if ontology
is to allow true information integration and automatic reasoning across data
and information derived from different sources. The goal of this track is to
survey existing biomedical ontologies and reform them in such a way as to
allow true information integration in biomedical domain. Authors are invited
to submit original papers exploring the theories, techniques, and
applications of biomedical ontologies. Papers are invited (but not limited)
to the following themes:

* Biomedical Ontologies for Genetics, Proteomics, Diseases, Privacy etc
* Conceptual Models for Biological and Medical Data
* Semantics in Biological Data Modeling
* Use of semantics to manage Interoperation in Biomedical Databases
* Semantic Web technologies and formalisms for Biomedical Data
* Ontology representation and exchange languages for bioinformatics
* Biomedical Ontologies and OWL
* Biological Data Integration and Management using Ontologies
* Biomedical Data Engineering using Ontologies
* Application of Biomedical Ontologies for Heterogeneous Database Access
* Query Optimization Techniques for Biomedical Database using Ontologies
* Support of Ontologies for Biological Information Retrieval and Web
Services
* Change Management in Biomedical Ontologies
* Tools for Development and Management of Biomedical Ontologies

PAPER SUBMISSION:

No hardcopy submissions are being accepted. Electronic submissions of
original technical research papers will only be accepted in PDF format. Use
a maximum of 6 pages IEEE two-column format, including figures and
references. All submissions will be done electronically via the CBMS 2009
web submission system (
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecbms2009). Select the track
"Ontologies for Biomedical Systems", provide the information about the paper
title, authors, keywords, and corresponding author's information (telephone,
fax, mailing address, e-mail address). Please note that author names should
not appear on the paper. Submission implies the willingness of at least one
of the authors to register and present the paper at the CBMS 2009 Symposium.
All papers will be peer reviewed by at least two independent referees. All
accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. Selected
papers from the track will be published in Special Issue of International
Journal of Healthcare Information Systems and Informatics (IJHISI) in 2010.

IMPORTANT DATES:

April 1, 2009     Paper Submission Due
May 25, 2009     Notification of acceptance
June 21, 2009     Final camera-ready paper due
June 21, 2009     Pre-registration deadline

You must pre-register to have your paper published in the proceedings. If
you only plan to attend and are not submitting a paper, pre-registration is
still strongly encouraged.

TRACK CHAIRS:

Amandeep S. Sidhu
WA Centre for Comparative Genomics, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia

Matthew I. Bellgard
WA Centre for Comparative Genomics, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia

Jake Chen
Indiana University - Purdue University, Indianapolis, USA
