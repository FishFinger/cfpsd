Meeting Description:

PACLIC 23 is organized by the Department of Chinese, Translation and 
Linguistics, and the Language Information Sciences Research Centre of the City 
University of Hong Kong, under the auspices of the PACLIC Steering Committee. 

Call for Papers

The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation 
(PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong Kong on 3-5 December 2009.  

The PACLIC series of conferences emphasizes the synergy of theoretical 
analysis and processing of language, and provides a forum for researchers in 
different fields of language study in the Pacific-Asia region to meet, to 
inspire and to be inspired. PACLIC conferences used to rotate among Hong Kong,
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, and occasionally took place in other cities
in the region. According to the Computer Science Conference Ranking  Website, as
in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of 701 conferences in topic area II (AI
and Machine Learning), roughly at top 7%. 
(http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/topicsii.html)

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics. Topics include but 
are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
discourse analysis, typology, corpus linguistics, formal grammar theory, natural
language processing, natural language systems and related computer applications.
Papers which are interdisciplinary, demonstrating synergy among language,
information, and computation especially on Asian languages, are particularly
encouraged.

Important Dates:
9 Aug 2009     Paper submission deadline
21 Sep 2009    Acceptance notification
19 Oct 2009    Camera-ready paper due
3-5 Dec 2009   PACLIC 23 conference

Paper Submission:
Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished work. Papers
should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10) pages, including
references.  Please follow the formatting instructions and use the style files
provided on the conference website (http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk).  Accepted
papers will be presented in one of the regular sessions or poster sessions as
determined by the program committee.  Such decisions will be based on the nature
rather than on the quality of the work.   

The deadline for paper submissions is 11:59PM Aug 9, 2009 Hong Kong time
(GMT+7).  Submissions should be made via the submission software at:
https://www.softconf.com/a/PACLIC23/

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, 
significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. Each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.  As the
reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the authors' names and
affiliations.  Authors should ensure that their identities are not revealed in
any way in the paper.  Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be
rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which will
subsequently be digitally archived and sent to ISI for indexing.  PACLIC
conference proceedings are indexed in the ISI Web of Science since 2002 and
authors are encouraged to cite previous PACLIC papers in their work.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
