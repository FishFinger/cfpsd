*******************************************************************

7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
   Plus GALA - Gathering of Life-like Agents
           17th - 19th September 2007
               Paris, France
           http://iva07.ntua.gr

           1st Call for Papers
*******************************************************************

SCOPE

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied
agents in an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able
to interact intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and
especially with human users.

The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and
practitioners in computer graphics, animation, computer games, virtual
environments, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
cognitive modeling, human-computer interaction and artificial life.
Since the first IVA back in 1999 firm lines of research have been
established and there is much that the graphics and AI communities can
learn from each other.

The domain of Intelligent Virtual Agents has become much more diverse
and now encompasses a wide range of disciplines; cognitive and social
psychology, communication models (conversational skills, interaction
loops, conversational analysis), non-verbal communication, sociology
(modeling human / IVA societies), HCI (intelligent user interfaces,
gesture/body tracking interfaces), design and arts (e.g., interactive
installations with IVAs), and numerous application domains.

While initial research often focused on the use of IVAs in virtual
environments, they are now increasingly used in web-based interfaces,
personal computing devices and interactive television. The rapid
advances in the field have enabled it to be applied in both in
research and industrial contexts. IVAs can provide appealing
characters for games and entertainment. They can also be used in novel
user interfaces or even as tools of psychological research.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and
practitioners from academia and industry with an interest in the
design, implementation, and evaluation of IVAs and IVA
applications. We aim for a lively program of timely, high-quality
presentations and demonstrations to discuss the state of the art and
future of Intelligent Virtual Agents. Papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence)
series.

This year, IVA'07 and ACII'07 (http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/acii2007/) are
happening close to each other. While we do encourage submitting to
both conferences we do highlight there are differences in topics of
interest in each conference. We highly advise authors to read them
carefully.  Papers submitted to both conferences should be clearly
different in their scope and topic.

IVA'07 will also host GALA - The Gathering of Life-like Agents - see 
http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/
