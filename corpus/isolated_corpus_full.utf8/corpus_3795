Many recent reports cited by UNESCO and other agencies estimate that up to 90%
of the world's languages will be lost in the next 100 years if current trends
continue. The vast majority of these languages will be those of minorities,
indigenous, and marginalized peoples. The UN has recognized the significance and
urgency of language use by declaring 2008 the Year of Languages. Efforts to
reverse this trend will require the support and cooperation of actors at all
levels: from the UN, to national governments, to local communities, and the
individual. So what does this matter to us in an increasingly globalized world?
How and why does language loss happen? How can international legal and policy
instruments protect and support language vitality and diversity?

According to recent Chinese government statistics, Tibetan language speakers
comprise 0.4% of the Chinese population. Tibetan language use is protected and
supported under Chinese national and local laws and policy initiatives. How are
these laws and policies interpreted and implemented? What are the implications
for Tibetan language use in China, now and in the future? What can international
and Chinese standards and practices learn from each other?

These are just some of the questions and issues we will attempt to explore
during this introductory event to the series. Each speaker will present a paper,
followed by a discussion with fellow speakers, and a chance to take questions
and comments from the audience. The event will conclude with a reception.
