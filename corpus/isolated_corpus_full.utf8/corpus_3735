Short Title: SLE 2009 

Date: 09-Sep-2009 - 12-Sep-2009
Location: Lisboa, Portugal 
Contact Person: José Pinto de Lima
Meeting Email: sle2009@fl.ul.pt

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Societas Linguistica Europaea and the Lisbon local organizing committee
invite you to submit paper abstracts and workshop proposals for the next annual
SLE meeting. SLE meetings welcome papers and workshop submissions from all
(sub)domains of linguistics. Every year local organizers pay special attention
to one specific topic. Next year's conference particularly welcomes papers which
deal with the scholarly debate about "Global languages. Local languages". 

Call for Papers
 
Papers and workshops are invited on all topics belonging to the field of
linguistics. Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes question time. 

We particularly welcome proposals for workshops, which should contain (i) an
outline of the theme and (ii) a provisional list of workshop participants and
their topics (see also below). We encourage workshop convenors to distribute an
open call for papers on the LinguistList and other fora. For workshop
submissions or questions, use sle@arts.kuleuven.be. 
 
Paper abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should
state research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results.
Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously. 
 
The deadline for the submission of workshop proposals is 15 December 2008.
Notification of acceptance will follow within the week. The deadline for all
abstracts (both for the general session and workshops) is 31 January 2009.
Notification of acceptance will be given by 31 March 2009. 

Submit your title through the Submit Abstract form of our website and email your
abstract as an attachment to sle@arts.kuleuven.be. The abstract should not
mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or addresses. Abstracts are
preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your abstract contains special symbols,
please include a pdf version as well. 

Workshops
Since we would like all conference participants to be able to attend individual
workshop presentations, SLE workshops have to be compatible with the main
conference programme. This means that the format of the workshops must be
organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). Each
workshop should comprise: 
  
An introductory paper by the convenor(s) or by a key-note speaker. It should
summarize previous research, specify the approaches to be found in the workshop
and explain the scope of the papers to be given. 
At least 6 papers (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). The preference is for one-day
workshops, but two-day workshops may also be considered. 
A slot for final discussion on topics covered by the papers, methodological
issues and questions for future research.

Full Title: Case in and across Languages 

Date: 27-Aug-2009 - 29-Aug-2009
Location: Helsinki, Finland 
Contact Person: Seppo Kittilä
Meeting Email: sky-case@helsinki.fi

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

The topic of the next annual meeting of SKY (The Linguistic Association of
Finland) is case from a variety of perspectives. 

Call for Papers

As a system that marks the relations between words in a sentence, case is
essential to every language. Case has, for example, the function of
distinguishing between agent and patient, and it often codes adverbial
functions, such as location, instruments and manner, all of which are central
concepts in every language. Yet while there is no doubt that case constitutes a
core feature of grammar, linguists are not fully agreed on how to define it
theoretically. What, for example, are the differences between adpositions and
morphological cases? In addition to the multitude of theoretical definitions,
languages display significant differences, for example, in the number,
characteristics and functions of cases.

The goal of this symposium is to bring together scholars working on case. We
welcome contributions dealing with case from various perspectives and
backgrounds (including theoretical, empirical and experimental approaches), and
with both language-specific and cross-linguistic approaches to case.
Possible topics for talks include (but are not restricted to) the following:

- Case inventories/systems in individual languages/language families
- Distinction between morphological cases and adpositions
- Grammaticalization of cases
- Functions expressed by case in/and across languages
- Case in psycholinguistics (e.g. acquisition of cases, processing of cases)
- Case polysemy
- Corpus-based studies of case

Please submit your abstract (in English, max 500 words, an additional page is
allowed for references, tables and data) by e-mail to the address of the
organizing committee (sky-case@helsinki.fi) no later than March 1, 2009. Send
your abstract as attachment to an e-mail message (in both .pdf and .doc
formats). The abstracts must be anonymous (author information must be given in
the body of the message only). Please indicate clearly whether your abstract is
intended as a poster or a section paper. Participants will be notified of
acceptance by April 3, 2009. 

Workshops
Proposals for workshops should be submitted no later than February 15, 2009.
Workshop proposals will be evaluated by the organizing committee. Notification
of acceptance status will be given by March 15. These one-day workshops may run
in parallel sessions with the main conference program; alternatively, the first
day of the symposium may be dedicated to workshops.

The body of the message should include the following information (preferably in
this order):
1) Name of the participant
2) Title of presentation
3) Affiliation
4) E-mail address
5) Whether the paper is meant as a section paper, a poster, or a workshop?

Confirmed Invited Speakers
Peter Austin (SOAS, London)
Tuomas Huumo (University of Tartu)
Laura Janda (University of Tromso)
