CALL FOR PAPERS
ACL 2007 Workshop on

Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages:
Common Issues and Resources

28th June, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic
Submission deadline: 11 March 2007

Workshop Website: http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/~mros/casl07
*********************************************************
=20
The ACL 2007 Workshop on "Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages: =

Common Issues and Resources" will be held in conjunction with the 45th=20
Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and =
will=20
take place on June 28th in Prague, Czech Republic. =20
 =20
* SCOPE AND TOPICS

The Semitic family includes many languages and dialects spoken by a =
large=20
number of native speakers (around 300 million). However, Semitic =
languages=20
as a whole are still understudied. The most prominent members of this =
family=20
are Arabic and its dialects, Hebrew, Amharic, Aramaic, Maltese and =
Syriac.=20
Their shared ancestry is apparent through pervasive cognate sharing, a =
rich=20
and productive pattern-based morphology, and similar syntactic =
constructions.=20
An increasing body of computational linguistics work is starting to =
appear=20
for both Arabic and Hebrew. Arabic alone, as the largest member of the =
Semitic=20
family, has been receiving much attention lately via dedicated workshops =
and=20
conferences. Tools and resources for other Semitic languages are being =
created=20
at a slower rate.  While corpora and some tools are necessarily =
language-
specific, ideally there should be more cross-fertilization among =
research and=20
development efforts for different Semitic languages. =20

The proposed workshop aims to bring together researchers working on =
Semitic=20
Languages to share and discuss common issues and approaches to the =
processing=20
of these languages. We invite submissions on all Semitic languages, =
including=20
work describing recent state-of-the-art NLP systems and work leveraging=20
resource and tool creation for the Semitic language family. We =
especially=20
welcome submissions on work that crosses individual language boundaries =
and=20
heightens awareness amongst Semitic-language researchers of shared =
challenges=20
and common solutions. The workshop will also include a meeting of the =
Special=20
Interest Group on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages (the ACL =
SIG).=20
Examples of topics include, but are not limited to:
* Computational approaches to phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics =
and=20
  pragmatics of Semitic languages
* Tools for processing of Semitic languages (e.g. POS taggers, parsers, =
etc.)
* Computational resources for Semitic languages
* Comparative computational studies of Semitic languages
* Leveraging resources in other languages (Semitic or other) to create=20
  resources and tools for Semitic languages
* Empirical studies of unique/specific phenomena in Semitic languages
* Text and speech applications for Semitic languages such as:
  - speech recognition,
  - machine translation,=20
  - summarization,=20
  - language generation,
  - speech synthesis,
  - co-reference resolution,=20
  - mention detection,=20
  - information retrieval,
  - spoken dialog applications
  - etc.

* SUBMISSIONS
=20
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work =
in=20
the topic area of this workshop. Submissions should not exceed 8 pages =
and=20
should be formatted using the ACL 2007 style files, which are available =
at:=20
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/
The reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not =
include=20
the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by =
at=20
least two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be =
published=20
in the workshop proceedings.  Papers should be submitted electronically, =
no=20
later than March 11, 2007. The only accepted format for submitted papers =
is=20
Adobe PDF.
