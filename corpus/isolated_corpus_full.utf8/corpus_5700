The Relationship between Lexico-grammar, Register and Genre in Social
Discourses=20

The 5th ALSFAL International Conference has two main aims:=20

1. To show the latest developments of SFL in its different fields;=20
2. To discuss the impact SFL has in Latin America and the developments of
the theory in Portuguese and Spanish, specially on the continent.

Language, understood as a resource to mean, and its analysis find in SFL a
place where language use can be described, explained and interpreted in the
intersection of texts and their contexts.

Register and genre become especially relevant to understand language since
speakers' linguistic choices depend on the context of situation - the
particular situations interactants participate in - and the context of
culture these situations belong into. Speakers' options get realised in the
texts they produce in these contexts.

This makes the wide range of social discourses, the relationships between
lexico-grammar, register and genre crucial to show that grammatical
description has to be done taking into account register and interpreted on
the basis of the context of culture texts are produced in.

SFL allows us to deal with a wide range of language uses the theory has
been exploring from the moment it was created. SFL developments in relation
with Critical Discourse Analysis and Multimodality - to name only two
relevant examples - show the reach of the theory that takes the
instrumentality of language as one of its distinctive features.

This 5th edition of ALSFAL will go on exploring these issues.

ALSFAL aims towards bringing together Systemic Functional Linguists in
Latin America through activities such as organizing meetings, maintaining a
web site, circulating a newsletter, and socializing through discussion
lists and via any other suitable media. Furthermore, ALSFAL encourages the
development of Systemic Functional Linguistics, particularly theoretical
developments, application and literacy programmes and studies in Spanish,
Portuguese and other languages. In addition, it organizes courses and
projects that will promote and strengthen SFL in Latin America.
