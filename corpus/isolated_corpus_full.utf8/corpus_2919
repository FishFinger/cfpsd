Final Call for Papers (Extended Deadline: April 15, 2008)

The Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Hamburg and the
Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Tuebingen are pleased
to announce the Third International Conference ''Perspectives on Slavistics''.
The conference will take place in Hamburg, Germany, on August 28-31, 2008. The
goals of the conference are to encourage the study of Slavic languages and
literatures and to establish connections among scholars working in these areas.

The following keynote speakers have accepted the invitation to present at the
conference:

- Patrice Dabrowski, Harvard University (USA)
- Gerd Hentschel, University of Oldenburg (Germany)
- Mikhail Iampolski, New York University (USA)
- Marek Lazinski, University of Warsaw (Poland)
- Karel Oliva, Czech Academy of Sciences (Czech Republic)
- Danko Sipka, Arizona State University (USA)
- Galin Tihanov, University of Manchester (UK)

Submissions from any scholar working on Slavic languages or literatures are
welcomed, including those in Slavic departments, as well as in specialized
linguistics or literature departments. We particularly want to encourage young
scholars to participate in this conference. Papers will be considered on topics
relating to the diachronic or synchronic study of Slavic languages and
literatures from any theoretical perspective.

There will be a special session on Electronic Resources of Slavic Languages. The
aim of the special session is to provide a forum for exchange of information
regarding the recent developments in the composition and design, construction
and use of different types of resources for Slavic languages. We encourage
submissions reporting on, but not limited to:

- corpora (large and small, general and genre-specific, annotated and
non-annotated, single language and parallel corpora, spoken and written language
corpora, treebanks);
- wide-coverage grammars;
- computational lexicons, electronic terminology databases, dictionaries (mono-
 and multilingual);
- speech collections;
- wordnets, framenets, ontologies;
- tools for acquisition, construction, annotation and management of language
resources.

Each paper submitted to the conference will be allowed thirty minutes (including
10 minutes for discussion). Presentations should be in English in order to open
the conference up to researchers working on non-Slavic languages and
literatures. Data projectors and overhead projectors will be provided upon
request. The new deadline for submissions is April 15, 2008 (submission
information and abstract specifications see below).

The participation fee will be 80 euros (40 euros for graduate students and
passive participants), to be paid in advance. Detailed information on payment
options and local arrangements will be provided by May 2008. The participation
fee covers the abstract booklet, other conference materials, refreshments and
snacks.

Submission information and abstract specifications:

Abstracts for 20 minute talks (plus 10 minute discussion) should:

- be anonymous;
- not exceed 500 words (plus an additional page for tables, figures and
references,  if necessary);
- use one-column format, Times New Roman, 12pt, single-spacing;
- use the international transcription of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters;
- be in Adobe PDF format (please do include all fonts in PDF documents).

Your abstract should present a hypothesis and outline your plan for defending
that hypothesis, i.e., it should specify research question(s), an approach /
method to the data, and obtained results. Each abstract will be anonymously
reviewed by independent reviewers.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair Conference
Manager at:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pos3

You will be requested to enter a user name and password to enter the site. If
you do not have an EasyChair account, enter the following URL:

to obtain one. Your account access information will be emailed to you.

After having logged in to the system, you will be able to submit your abstract
by (1) providing an address for correspondence, (2) specifying the author(s),
(3) providing the title and a short abstract in plain text (the short abstract
should summarize the essentials of the proposal in maximally two short
sentences), (4) specifying at least two keywords, (5) selecting the topic
relevant to your paper (Linguistics, Literature or Resources), (6) uploading the
PDF file with the full anonymous abstract including the title and the abstract body.

The contact author of the paper will receive an auto-generated notification of

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
