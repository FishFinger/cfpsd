Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop will focus on the neural, computational and cognitive principles
of communication. A wealth of new knowledge has been produced by recent research
for instance as part of the EU NEST initiative 'What it means to be human'. The
goal of this workshop is to explore relevant research to focus on the question
'What it means to communicate'. 

The general aim of this workshop is to understand the neural, cognitive, social,
computational and developmental features that have led to communication
differences between humans and animals. A number of interesting and successful
research directions have been supported including learning by imitation,
examining the origin of human rule based reasoning, studying the neural origins
of language, exploring the evolutionary origins of the human mind, researching
into verbal and nonverbal communication, using and interpreting signs,
characterising human language by structural complexity, and representing
abstract concepts.

To complement this, the NESTCOM project aims to understand the results of these
projects and integrate them with a neural multimodal understanding of verbal and
visual communication for embodied action understanding. This workshop will
explore the characteristics of human communication and their relationship to the
role of neural networks in cognition and social development.

Topics of discussion could include:

- Neural or cognitive natural language modelling
- Neural or cognitive vision modelling
- Multimodal integration
- Bioinspired communicating robotics
- Developmental approaches to communication
- Imitation and Learning
- Signs and Gestures for communication
- Mirror neuron system and its mechanisms
- Learning mechanisms for communications skills
- Learning of action understanding
- Neural and artificial life agents
- Communication between robots
- Human robot interaction

The workshop will include invited introductory talks, about 10 short
presentations by panel members and a discussion session with the workshop
participants. We invite position statements of 1 page in length or full papers
of up to 8 pages in length for both panel members or workshop participants,
submitted as pdf file to Stefan.Wermter [at] sunderland.ac.uk and
Michael.Knowles [at] sunderland.ac.uk by 30 June 2007. Speakers and panelists
will be confirmed shortly thereafter.

It is envisaged that extended paper versions of the contributions will be
published at a later date in a book by Springer and/or a special issue e.g. in a
journal like the Connection Science Journal.

have set up a web page at www.his.sunderland.ac.uk/nestcom/workshop/

The 3rd International Workshop on
International Workshop on Vocabularies, Ontologies and Rules for the Enterprise
(VORTE 2007)
http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/VORTE/

In conjunction with the 11th IEEE International
EDOC Conference (EDOC 2007)
''The Enterprise Computing Conference''
http://edoc.mitre.org/

15-19 October 2007, Annapolis, Maryland, USA

Selected papers accepted to the workshop to be invited for a special issue in
Elsevier's ISI-indexed Information Systems journal
http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infosys/

Workshop Overview

Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
VORTE 2007 is the third workshop associated with an EDOC conference that
intends to bring together researchers and practitioners in areas such as
philosophical ontology, enterprise modelling, information systems, Semantic Web,
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), business rules, and business processes. The
goal of the workshop is to discuss the role that foundational and domain
ontologies play in the conceptual development and implementation of next
generation tools for enterprise computing. Since enterprise vocabularies and
ontologies, as well as business rules do not exist in isolation but serve to
support business processes, this year we are planning to put special emphasis on
business process modelling and management.

Themes and Topics

The workshop contributions will be organized along three major thematic areas,
under which the following topics of interest will be included, but not limited to:

Conceptual Modelling:
 - Business Vocabularies, Terminologies, and Taxonomies
 - Ontological Approaches to Content and Knowledge Management
 - Enterprise Information Integration and Interoperability
 - Service Taxonomies and Service Registries (for example, UDDI-related research)
 - Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modelling
 - Languages for Conceptual Modelling (for example, OWL and UML)
 - Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modelling
Business Rules and Business Process Semantics:
 - Semantic Web Services
 - Service Ontologies (for example, research related to OWL-S)
 - Business Rule Languages and Components
 - Rule-based Approaches to Web Service Policies and Choreographies
 - Ontologies for Business Process Management
 - Agent-based Business Rule and Process Management
 - Business Process Modelling and Execution Languages (for example, BPMN and BPML)
Ontologies for Enterprise Computing:
 - Foundational Ontologies and Enterprise Computing
 - Ontological Evaluation of Enterprise Systems
 - Ontologies for Interoperability of Enterprise Systems
 - Ontology-based Enterprise Architectures
 - Ontology-based Software Engineering for Enterprises
 - Enterprise Components' Modelling
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approaches to Enterprise Computing:
 - Modelling and Architecture Frameworks
 - Domain Engineering
 - Domain-specific Business Information and System Engineering
 - Transformation between MDA layers

Submission Guidelines

All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program
committee. Submissions should be 6 to 8 pages long and must use the two-column
format of IEEE conference proceedings, which is referenced on the workshop's web
site, and include the authors' name, affiliation, and contact details. Papers
must be submitted in the PDF format using EasyChair at
http://www.easychair.org/VORTE2007. Authors will be notified about the decision
by the program committee by the 11th of August 2007. At least one author of each
accepted paper must participate in the workshop. The papers accepted for the
EDOC 2007 Workshops will be published after the workshop with its own ISBN in
the IEEE Digital Library (pending approval by IEEE), which is accessible by IEEE
Xplore.

Journal Special Issue

A selection of the best papers accepted to the workshop and presented
there will be invited to the special issue of Elsevier ISI-indexed Information
Systems journal (subject to the second round of peer-review).
