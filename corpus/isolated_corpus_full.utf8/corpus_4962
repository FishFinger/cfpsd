Meeting Description:

The 11th Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar 
(SICOGG 11)
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul
Aug 11(Tue) - 14(Fri), 2009 

2nd Call for Papers 

Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Hankuk University of 
Foreign Studies, Seoul 

Invited Speaker: 
Norbert Hornstein (University of Maryland at College Park) 

General Session on Visions of the Minimalist Program 

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the general
session specified above, equal consideration will be given to papers from all
areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the
general session, two additional workshops, and a series of lectures from the
invited speaker. The themes of the additional workshops are as follows: 

Workshop on Control and Binding 

This workshop solicits the abstracts on control and binding. Since the earliest
 framework of the generative grammar, control and binding have been the richest
sources of linguistic investigation on the nature of thematic relations. With
the advent of the minimalist program, earlier approaches to these two phenomena
may well be reinterpreted in the minimalist setting. Regarding control, one most
remarkable shift of focus would be the view taken by Hornstein (1999) and his
subsequent works that obligatory control is actually movement. 

This claim invoked various controversies over PRO including Landau's (2001)
Agree-based analysis of control. Whichever approaches one might take, an
adequate theory of control must explain the distribution and interpretation of
PRO. Inseparably related to control, binding also must be reinterpreted in the
minimalist program. The topics of research include the questions like whether
binding is movement or construal, or if both are operative, which one comes
prior over the other. All in all, it would be a major contribution to the Strong
Minimalist Thesis if the theories of control and binding can be deduced from
more minimal operations, whether they would be movement, agreement, or something
else. 

Workshop on Islands 
Since the inception of the Minimalist Program, much of the earlier machinery
deriving island effects has been reformulated in terms of various equivalents
from minimalist considerations: Shortest Move (Chomsky 1994), the Minimal Link
Condition (Chomsky 1995), Multiple Spell-Out (Uriagereka 1999) and Phase Theory
(Chomsky 2000, 2001). Despite the emergence of such principled notions, however,
there is no general consensus on the treatment of islands in the current
minimalist theory, and this is partly because islands show non-trivial
differences of deviance in extraction caused by the nature of different types of
islands: weak islands vs. strong islands. 

This workshop aims to discuss the issues related to how the distinct
characteristics of the extraction from weak islands and strong islands, either
as a unified or dissociated class, can be accommodated in less redundant, more
clarifying fashions in the current minimalist program; but we also hope to
extend the range of possible topics to the impact of islands on other domains of
inquiry such as language acquisition, language processing, and functional
approaches. 

Abstracts should be anonymous and may not exceed 2 pages (A4), including
examples and references, with 2.54 cm (1 inch) margin on all four sides and
should employ the font Times New Roman 12 pt. 

Submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract
per author. Please send a separate file containing the following information:
(i) the title of the paper, (ii) the author's name, (iii) affiliation, (iv)
e-mail address, (v) telephone number, and (vi) the preferred session (general,
workshop on control and binding, or workshop on islands). Abstracts should be
sent electronically as Word or PDF attachments to kwangsup@hufs.ac.kr,
swkim@kw.ac.kr, and kggc2009@gmail.com no later than April 18, 2009. 

Abstracts will be reviewed by readers, and authors will be notified by May 15,
2009. Each speaker of the general and the workshop sessions will be allotted 20
minutes followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Accepted papers will be published
in the Proceedings of 2009 Seoul International conference on Generative Grammar,
which will be distributed to the conference participants.
 
All presenters will be asked to provide camera-ready copies of their papers in
publishable form by July 20, 2009. The text should be single-spaced and the
general page limit is 20 pages including appendices and references. 

All the information about the conference is available on our website 
http://www.kggc.org. 
Participants are asked to check this web page to keep up to date regarding
possible alterations and changes. Additional questions concerning the conference
can be answered by sending a question to Chang Yong Sim at kggc2009@gmail.com.
