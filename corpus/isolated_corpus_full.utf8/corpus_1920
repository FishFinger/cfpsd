                 Call for Papers
==================================================

       Lecture Notes on Artifical Intelligence

                Special Issue on

     Recent Advances in Constraint Handling Rules

==================================================

Editors:
      Thom Fruehwirth (Thom.Fruehwirth at uni-ulm.de)
      Tom Schrijvers (Tom.Schrijvers at cs.kuleuven.be)

The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language saw the light more than 15 years
ago.  Since then, it has become a major declarative specification and
implementation language for constraint-based algorithms and applications.  In
recent years, the Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules have spurred the
exchange of ideas within the CHR community, which has led to increased
international collaboration, new theoretical results and optimized
implementations.

The aim of this issue of Lecture Notes in Computer Science is to attract
high-quality research papers on these recent advances in Constraint  Handling
Rules.

TOPICS

Topics of interest, on all aspects of CHR, include but are not limited to:

      *  Semantics
      *  Logical Algorithms
      *  Constraint Solvers
      *  Expressivity and Complexity
      *  Program Analysis
      *  Programming tools
      *  Implementations and Optimization
      *  Program Transformation and Generation
      *  Language Extensions (Types, Modules)
      *  Retractable Constraints
      *  Programming Pearls
      *  Programming Environments (Debugging)
      *  Applications
      *  Critical Assessment
      *  Comparisons with Related Approaches

SUBMISSIONS

Revised and enhanced versions of papers published at the Workshops on
Constraint Handling Rules and other occasions that have not appeared in
archival journals are eligible for submission.  Papers describing important
past research in this area which have not been published in archival journal
papers are also solicited.  New work, surveys and comparison of state of the
art techniques are also solicited. None of the submissions should have been
published in any form prior to 2002.

When submitting already published papers with minor changes only,  authors are
responsible for ensuring copyright clearance with the  previous publisher by
obtaining a written permission to republish.

For any doubt regarding the appropriateness of the topic of a paper for this
special issue please email one of the editors.

Papers should be written in English, and formatted using the LaTeX style files
developed by Springer Verlag for LNCS. Theycan be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html

To submit please send your paper in pdf format only to both editors. For
further information, please look at:
