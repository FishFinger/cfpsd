Meeting Description:

The GERAS - the French research association in English for Specific Purposes -
will hold its 29th annual Conference from 13th to 15th March 2008, at the
University of Orleans, France.

Conference theme: 'Research in ESP: Distance and proximity'
The two conference languages are French and English. 

29th GERAS Conference
13th-15th March 2008, University of Orleans, France

Extended deadline for paper submissions

''Research in ESP: Distance and Proximity''

The deadline for the receipt of paper submissions has been extended to 31
January 2008. Proposals should be sent by e-mail to Dr. Elizabeth Rowley-Jolivet
 < elizajo@wanadoo.fr > using the paper submission form that can be downloaded
on the conference website < http://www.geras2008.fr >. 

GERAS - Groupe d'Étude et de Recherche en Anglais de Spécialité - is the French
national research association in English for Specific Purposes. For the past 30
years its activities have covered a wide range of fields (the specialised
discourses of law, economics, science and medicine, politics...) and approaches
(discourse analysis, professional cultures, lexicology and terminology,
cross-linguistic studies, EAP and ESP teaching and learning...), in four main
research strands: linguistics, culture, didactics and new technologies.

The theme chosen for the 29th annual Conference is ''Research in ESP: Distance
and Proximity''. We welcome contributions that examine the phenomena of distance
and proximity from various angles along all four research strands:

Applied linguistics, discourse analysis: proximity and distance between
oral/non-verbal communication and writing in specialised discourses, reader- and
writer-in-the-text,?; intratextual distance (anaphora, cohesion, collocational
networks...); similarities and differences between popularized and esoteric
discourses

Culture: proximity and distance between and within various academic and
professional cultures; proxemics; peripheral participation of novices or NNS in
their discourse/professional communities; distance and proximity between ESP
linguists and specialists of other disciplines, between ESP/EAP training courses
and professional practices and needs 

Didactics: distance learning; proximity and distance between learners during
tasks, between the didactic approaches of different LSPs (English, French,
Spanish...); strategies to help learners distance themselves from the learning
process and metacognition

Technology: use of computational linguistics to analyse similarities and
divergences in various specialised discourses; technological tools for ESP
(distance) learning environments

The conference also aims to provide an opportunity for researchers working in
these diverse areas, which at first sight may appear rather remote from each
other, to come closer together and bridge the distance between their different
interests, approaches and objects of research. A Round Table will enable the
collective discussion and synthesis of the various workshop presentations, while
a Research Forum will give participants the opportunity to exchange on, and
share, their research programmes and publications. 

From a more long-term perspective, the 29th GERAS Conference is the first in a
series of annual conferences which will address the broader topic of
'Multiplicity and Unity in ESP', chosen by the steering committee of GERAS as
the overarching theme for forthcoming meetings. This common theme aims to
explore both the rich diversity, and also the fundamental unity of ESP studies,
and thereby contribute to enhancing the specificity and epistemological
legitimacy of the domain.
