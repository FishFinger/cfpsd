Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Linguistic Association of the Southwest (LASSO) is a regional linguistics
association in the United States whose purpose is the advancement of the
scientific study of language, particularly in the geographical region covering
the states of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, and Texas. While LASSO is primarily interested in languages of these
southwestern states, it draws its membership from any region in the world. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts for papers or posters in any area of linguistics are welcome, as are
proposals dealing with language issues of special interest in the Southwest.
Proposals for complete panels with 2-3 speakers are also welcome. Deadline for
submission is June 1, 2009. Early submission of panel proposals is desirable.
Presentation time for papers will be 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for discussion.
Abstracts may be in English or Spanish.

Presentations should be given in the same language as the abstract. Only one
abstract as single author and a second as co-author will be accepted from any
one individual.

Submissions by graduate students are welcome, and students are eligible for the
Helmut Esau Prize, a $250 cash award.

Abstracts should be 250-500 words, single-spaced in 11 point Times New Roman font.

Abstracts should summarize the main points and indicate key aspects of the data
and methodology. Use of special font items should be kept to a minimum. In
general, omit the bibliography. At the conference, abstracts will be distributed
as received. 

- At the beginning of the abstract, write the title of the paper. 
- At the end of the abstract, repeat the title and also list the author's name
(if more than one author, list names in the order they should appear in the
program), academic affiliation, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail. 

If the author will not be available at his/her usual address or e-mail during
the summer, provide summer contact information in the cover e-mail. Also note
whether any A-V equipment will be needed.

Electronic submissions are strongly preferred. You may e-mail abstracts to
lasso2009@gmail.com as a PDF, Microsoft Word, RTF, or text file attachment.
Special font items travel best as a PDF. 

 In addition to sending the abstract as an attachment, please paste the text of
the abstract into the e-mail message itself.
Authors without access to e-mail may mail a disk copy accompanied by a paper
copy to:

Devin Jenkins
Dept. of Modern Languages
Univ. of Colorado-Denver
Campus Box 178
P.O. Box 173364
Denver, CO 80217-3364

Authors will receive a reply notifying them that their abstracts are under
consideration. If such notification has not been received within one week, the
abstract did not reach its destination and should be resent. Authors will be
notified by early July as to whether their papers have been accepted.

Participation in LASSO is a privilege of member-ship; this means that an
individual must be a current member in order to present a paper, poster, or
panel, and to be listed in the conference program. For membership information,
contact LASSO Executive Director: Regina Morin at rmorin@tcnj.edu.

Meeting Description:

Terminologie et Intelligence Artificielle (TIA - 2009)
Toulouse (IRIT) , France
18-20 November 2009 

Call for Papers 

The Conference
In all specialized fields, knowledge is stored and disseminated in the form of
documents. In some cases, document management (ranking according to relevance to
a query, for instance) and acquisition and extraction of knowledge for indexing,
modelling and conceptualization rely on terminological and linguistic studies.
Hence, terminology and linguistics supply key concepts to other disciplines such
as natural language processing, information science and knowledge engineering.
Conversely, these disciplines bring to light new problems and issues and present
new challenges and perspectives for terminology and linguistics. For nearly 15
years, TIA conferences have provided a forum for researchers working in these
various fields to come together.
The 2009 TIA Conference will focus mainly - although not exclusively - on terms
and terminological systems. Terms are used as focal points for knowledge
structuring in many applications, including ontologies, thesauri, and other
conventional terminological resources such as specialized dictionaries and
terminological databases. A number of semantic relations between terms may be
identified (and may vary depending on the application). However, although the
aim of all of these applications is a certain degree of stability, the
linguistic nature of terms and of the relations they share raises many
questions. Which relations should be represented in specific applications? How
should terms and the relations between them be represented? How can the
relations in terminological resources and their linguistic representation in
texts be linked?

Submitted papers may address theoretical or methodological issues. 
Interdisciplinary work that focuses on collaboration between disciplines when
dealing with terminological issues is strongly encouraged.

Topics
Proposals addressing the theme "Terms and terminological systems" are strongly
encouraged. However, other proposals dealing with innovative theoretical,
methodological, or practical questions are also welcome. Possible topics include:
- Semantic theories and terminology in relation to text linguistics and
ontologies (especially theoretical linguistic approaches to describing terms and
terminological structures)
- Representation of terms and semantic or conceptual relations in specific types
of data structures (ontologies, thesauri, etc.)
- Representation of terms and semantic or conceptual relations in multilingual
applications
-ntological resources from different languages, communities or time frames
- Theoretical and technical problems in automated or manual compilation of
terminologies using mono- or multi-lingual corpora
- Methods for automatic terminology structuring (identification of relations
between terms, linking of terms to specific fields of knowledge)
- Studies on the relationships between ontologies and terminologies and/or thesauri:
Use of terminologies to compile and structure ontologies
Use of ontological modelling for a better understanding of the semantics of
thesauri and terminologies

- Evaluation methods and criteria, and validation of terminologies
- Problems in compiling multilingual terminologies
- Reuse, standardization, comparison and merging of terminological or
ontological resources
- Applications of terminological resources (the Semantic Web, information
retrieval, technology watch, question answering, document management, ranking
and/or classification, etc.)

The TIA group (http://tia.loria.fr/) founded this conference series in 1995. The
first conference took place in Paris (TIA'95, Villetaneuse), and subsequent
events have been held in a variety of French cities (TIA'97 (Toulouse), TIA'99
(Nantes), TIA'01 (Nancy), TIA'03 (Strasbourg), TIA'05 (Rouen), and TIA '07
(Nice)). Created under the auspices of AFIA (l'Association française pour
l'intelligence artificielle; French Association for Artificial Intelligence) -
which has since become the AFIA/GdR-I3 group - TIA brings together researchers
in linguistics, natural language processing and knowledge engineering.
The TIA group is responsible for the organization and the management of the 2009
TIA conference. Submissions will be reviewed by an international program
committee composed of experts in the above fields (with each paper evaluated by
three reviewers) and may be accepted as full papers or posters.
