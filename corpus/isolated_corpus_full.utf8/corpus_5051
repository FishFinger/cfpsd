Meeting Description:

EVALITA is an initiative devoted to the evaluation of Natural Language
Processing and Speech tools for Italian. The general objective of Evalita is to
promote the development of language technologies for Italian, providing a shared
framework where different systems and approaches can be evaluated in a
consistent manner. 

Second Call for Papers

We are pleased to announce that the development data for the different tasks of
EVALITA 2009 are now available. We take this opportunity to launch a second call
for participation.

The general objective of Evalita is to promote the development of language
technologies for the Italian language, providing a shared framework where
different systems and approaches can be evaluated in a consistent manner.

We invite participation, both from academic institutions and industrial
organizations, in eight tasks, all for Italian. With respect to the previous
edition, tasks also include a range of Speech tasks and a new Textual Entailment
task.

Text tasks
- PoS-Tagging
- Parsing (Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing)
- Lexical substitution
- Entity Recognition (Named Entity Recognition and Local Entity Detection and
Recognition)
- Textual Entailment

Speech tasks
- Connected Digits Recognition (Clean Digits and Noisy Digits)
- Dialogue System Evaluation
- Speaker Identity Verification (Application and Forensic)

As with the previous edition, guidelines describing the different tasks are
available for download from the EVALITA website. Participants will also be
provided with training data and will have the chance to test their systems with
the evaluation metrics and procedures to be used in the formal evaluation. The
results of the evaluation will be disseminated at the final workshop, which will
be organized in conjunction with AI*IA 2009 and will take place in ReggioEmilia
on December 12th, 2009.

In order to register for one or more of the EVALITA 2009 tasks, please go to the
registration page of the EVALITA 2009 website:

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
