Send us your names for the new student paper

Yes  indeedy, the rumours are true. There?s a new student paper set to hit =
Wally?s Walk in 2008 and it?s going to be brilliant ? but we need your help=
..=0D
=0D
 =0D
=0D
Since late October, the all-student editorial team has been working hard to=
 create something that Club Macq would be proud to call its own. This meant=
 lots of early morning meetings, stressing over quotation marks and page la=
youts, baking muffins, making fun of Magro, and having the occasional panic=
 attack at three in the morning. Yet for all the progress made in the past =
few weeks, we spent so much time arguing over the correct use of the Oxford=
 comma that we... well, we kind of forgot to come up with a name for the pa=
per. =0D
=0D
 =0D
=0D
So! We call on you to help us think of a name for the new student publicati=
on, one so awesome that future generations of university students will thin=
k ?Honi Soit? Pah, Sydney Uni?s rag doesn?t stand a chance against what Mac=
quarie has to offer!? And we can look smug, and they will cry in shame. You=
r suggested name could be the one gracing the covers of the new paper next =
year. It?d be kind of neat to pick up a copy and think ?That?s right, I?m t=
he reason why this is called Dead Fish Can?t Swim. Man, this will look grea=
t on my CV!? =0D
=0D
 =0D
=0D
Please send all ideas and ponderings to us at studentpaper08@gmail.com with=
 subject line ?Name?, and help us get this paper off the ground. Every sugg=
estion will be considered, none will be ignored. We only ask you get back t=
o us by Friday 7th December.  We are also looking for contributors, so all =
you writers out there should feel free to send expressions of interest to t=
his same address. =0D
=0D
 =0D
=0D
Please keep in mind that this is not SAM or U@MQ?s paper.  This is the Macq=
uarie University Paper, run by students for the students. It is not run by =
any organisation. For those interested in a few of the ideas behind the pap=
er, the uni has drawn up some new ethical guidelines that the paper will at=
tempt to adhere to. These can be found at http://www.mq.edu.au/ethics/ethic=
-statement-final.html.=0D

Want to know more about your newly-elected student editorial team? Head to =
www.sam.org.au and read our submissions, written when we had no idea what w=
e?ve let ourselves in for. And for a limited time, catch the first of what =
is sure to be many hideous photos taken of us during our tenure.=0D

We hope to hear from at least five of you soon...=0D
