Call for Papers:


Corpus Profiling for Information Retrieval and Natural Language =

Processing Workshop 2008
18 October 2008
London
Submission deadline: 15 August 2008
http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/corpus-profiling/index.php


-----------------------------------
PURPOSE
-----------------------------------

We aim to bring together people from different research communities =

interested in exploring how corpus characteristics affect the behaviour =

of techniques in information retrieval and natural language processing, =

and to set out a roadmap for a shared research agenda.

It is well known in NLP and IR that the effectiveness of a technique =

depends on both the data on which it is deployed and its match with the =

task at hand. In 1973, Sp=E4rck-Jones attributed differing degrees of =

success at automatic classification to differences in dataset =

characteristics. Since Croft and Harper (1979), IR performance has =

repeatedly been related to collection size and other features, though no =

upper bound has been found.

The importance of data and task dependencies has been highlighted in IR, =

anaphora resolution, automatic summarization and recently, in word sense =

disambiguation. Many web/enterprise web retrieval systems rely on URL =

properties, link graph properties, click streams, and so on, with =

performance dependent on the degree to which this evidence is present =

and meaningful in a particular corpus.

Systematically exploring features that can be used effectively to =

characterise corpora, has been missing from IR/NLP research. This =

creates problems with replicability of experimental results and the =

development of applications.

The time is right to pursue this dependence systematically to address =

topics in tracking the effect of dataset profile on technique =

performance. Over the past 15 years, the approaches of several subject =

areas have converged with IR, as large corpora and test collections =

assume central importance in research methodologies. These areas have =

highlighted issues surrounding the role of data.


-----------------------------------
WORKSHOP FORMAT
-----------------------------------

The workshop will be a day long, in conjunction with the Information =

Interaction in Context (IIiX'2008, http://irsg.bcs.org/iiix2008/). The =

workshop will have three components:

(1)  invited talks in the morning, introducing the background from =

different perspectives

(2) two afternoon sessions, presenting peer-reviewed papers

(3) a panel discussion (panel composed of presenters and the organizers).


-----------------------------------
TOPICS OF INTEREST
-----------------------------------

We welcome original research or position papers. We particularly =

encourage postgraduate students or postdoctoral researchers to submit =

papers. Topics of interest include, but are NOT LIMITED to, the =

following areas:

     * Suitable features to characterise text/language variety, =

capturing known effects on technique performance with respect to a task;

     * Tasks that depend on aspects of corpus profiles, (e.g., the =

positive correlation of QA performance with fact frequency in a corpus);

     * Limitations of context-independent frequency-based measures, and =

exploration of measures that highlight complex dependencies;

     * Tools/techniques for characterising a feature or the extent to =

which it is manifested in a corpus;

     * Evaluation methodologies for testing feature candidates relative =

to task/technique;

     * Learnability of features (cf. meta-level learning for =

classification algorithms).


-----------------------------------
IMPORTANT DATES
-----------------------------------

15 August 2008: Paper submission due

12 September 2008: Notification of acceptance/rejection

26 September 2008: Camera-ready due

18 October 2008: Workshop


-----------------------------------
SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
-----------------------------------

Original technical papers, short papers and position papers are all =

welcome. Please ensure that your submission does not exceed 5,000 words =

in length. Use 10 point font size, double column for body text, and 12 =

point bold for headings. Please send your submission in PDF to all the =

three organizers (A.Deroeck@open.ac.uk; d.song@open.ac.uk; =

udo@essex.ac.uk) with subject "Corpus Profiling workshop submission".

We will publish the accepted papers electronically through BCS's =

Electronic Workshops in Computing (eWiC), together with the extended =

abstracts of invited talks, a summary of the panel discussion. We will =

seek to pursue the research thread through further workshops at relevant =

conferences. We plan to organize a post-workshop special issue on a =

suitable IR or NLP related journal.
