The 4th Web as Corpus workshop: Can we beat Google?

Marrakech, Morocco (post-LREC workshop)
1 June 2008

http://webascorpus.sf.net/WAC4/

Submission deadline: 29 February 2008


DESCRIPTION

Commercial Web search engines offer fast search on huge amounts of  =

text, combined with increasingly clever ranking and data analysis  =

algorithms, but their content-centric services do not cater to the  =

needs of the computational linguistics and NLP communities.  The  =

leading theme of this workshop, the fourth in a row of highly  =

successful Web as Corpus meetings, is to find out how to combine the  =

power and scalability of modern search engine technology with  =

sophisticated linguistic annotation and query processing.

We invite papers on various topics concerning the use of Web  =

resources for corpus research and NLP applications, including (but  =

not limited to) the following:

    * linguistic Web crawler technology and Web corpus collection  =

projects
    * applications of Web-derived corpora and other kinds of Web data
    * how far does the "easy way" get you? (using search engines, or  =

Google's n-gram lists; we are particularly interested in a critical  =

discussion of the usefulness and limitations of such approaches)
    * methods and tools for "cleaning" Web pages to turn them into a  =

corpus (contributors to this topic will be encouraged to participate  =

in the second CLEANEVAL competition to be held in 2009)
    * automatic linguistic annotation of Web data: tokenisation, POS  =

tagging, lemmatisation, semantic tagging, etc. (established tools  =

often perform very poorly on Web data)
    * search engine architectures for linguists: bringing linguistics  =

to commercial search engines, or high-performance search technology  =

to linguistics?
    * search engine-related topics such as result ranking (e.g. how  =

to identify "typical" uses rather than returning 50 very similar  =

matches on the first page)
    * duplicate detection, interactive query refinement, etc.
    * reviews and clever uses of search engine APIs (Google, Yahoo,  =

Altavista, and in particular Microsoft's current generous LiveSearch  =

API)

This workshop is endorsed by the Special Interest Group on the Web as  =

Corpus (SIGWAC) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

Submission Information: Authors are invited to submit full papers on  =

original, unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop.   =

Submissions should follow the format of LREC proceedings and should  =

not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.  We strongly  =

recommend the use of LREC LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files  =

tailored for this year's conference.  Details on the submission  =

procedure will be posted on the conference website shortly.
