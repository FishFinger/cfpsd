Full Title: Toward New eLearning Environments Based on NLP Tools 

Date: 10-Jul-2009 - 13-Jul-2009
Location: Orlando - Florida, USA 
Contact Person: Mourad Mars
Meeting Email: mourad.mars@e.u-grenoble3.fr
Web Site: http://www.iiis2009.org/wmsci 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 10-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

NLP (Natural Language Processing) and CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning)
are two highly productive fields. Although both fields are concerned with the
study of language, the links between them are still relatively tenuous. Systems
such as ELEONORE, ALEXIA, FREETEXT or platforms such as EXILLS and MIRTO
integrate NLP methods and tools, but they tend to be the exception rather than
the rule and concern non-commercialised products. 

Call for Papers

The session that we organise within the framework of WMSCI 2009 will enable
researchers from NLP and CALL to present their research on the use of NLP in
language learning, to encourage exchanges and collaborations, establish a common
area of study, draw a map of the projects in the fields and open up new research
avenues. 

Topics
The conference welcomes proposals exploring all aspects (theoretical,
conceptual, applied) of the use of NLP in CALL. The list of topics below
includes a few examples of the aspects that may be tackled:
- Applications of (written or spoken) language processing in CALL
- Methodological issues relating to the design of NLP-based CALL systems 
- Demonstration of NLP-based CALL tools 
- Design and use of corpora for language learning
- Use of learner corpora; error annotation of learner corpora
- Diagnosis, feedback and remedial work
- Design and creation of tasks
- Linguistic resources for language learning
- Linguistic theory/formal linguistics and CALL

Submission Guidelines
- Format. Authors are invited to submit extended abstract (1000 to 2000 words)
on original, unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should
not exceeding 4 pages, including references, and be formatted according to the
WMSCI 2009 stylefile available at:
www.iiis2009.org/wmsci/Contents/AK-WMSCI-2009P.pdf
- Paper submission is to be made in doc format to mourad.mars@e.u-grenoble3.fr 
- Each paper will be reviewed at least by two members of the Program Committee.

Registration
