Call for Papers:

Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing - BSNLP 2009
Second International Workshop
Cracow, Poland
15 June 2009
http://erssab.u-bordeaux3.fr/BSNLP

This year BSNLP is co-located with the IIS 2009 (Intelligent  
Information Systems) conference.
TOPIC and MOTIVATION

The recent political and economic changes in Central and Eastern
Europe and the related on-going enlargement of the European Union
brings into focus new cultures and languages. Among them, the
languages from the Balto-Slavonic group have an outstanding role
because of their rich cultural heritage and the widespread use: over
400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP)
for the Balto-Slavonic languages. The NLP tasks include, but are not
limited to, morphological analysis and generation, tagging,
named-entity recognition, information extraction, co-reference
resolution, question-answering, information retrieval, text
summarisation, machine translation. Research on these topics in the
context of Balto-Slavonic languages is still in its early stage and is
progressing relatively slowly. Due to specific linguistic phenomena,
such as rich inflection and relatively free word order, a construction
of language processing tools for these languages is an intriguing and
challenging task.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages. The
workshop will give an opportunity to exchange ideas and experience, to
discuss hard-to-tackle problems in this field of research, and to make
available resources more widely known.

This workshop is a follow-up to the successful first BSNLP 2007
workshop held in conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference in Prague.
In particular, we would strongly encourage submissions describing
systems, resources or solutions that are made available to the wider
public, as this would help to promote computational linguistics
applications for these languages.

AREAS OF INTEREST
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP in the context of:

     * text segmentation
     * morphological analysis
     * morphology models
     * morpho-syntactic disambiguation
     * named-entity recognition
     * named-entity dissambiguation
     * named-entity lemmatisation
     * name variant recognition and merging
     * term and keyword extraction
     * syntactic parsing and chunking
     * co-reference resolution
     * word sense disambiguation
     * corpus-based knowledge acquisition
     * information extraction
     * question answering
     * machine translation
     * text summarisation
     * text classification
     * information retrieval
     * linguistic processing in search engines

B. Multilingual frameworks applied to these languages

     * tools and resources (freely available for research purposes
       will be preferred)
     * experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and  
       processing resources
     * comparative evaluation between languages
     * encoding standards and formats

SUBMISSION

We expect two kinds of submissions:

     * full papers
     * short papers

Long papers should describe original unpublished work and should
indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In
particular, an overlap with previously published work should be
clearly mentioned. The authors should indicate in the abstract of
their submission if the paper has been submitted elsewhere.

Short papers should describe work in progress and/or interactive  
software demos.

All submissions, both of long and short papers, will be judged on
correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation,
usability, and significance/relevance to the workshop. Submissions
will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. The
reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

The final papers are to be prepared using LaTeX. Please download the
zipped archive with files needed to process your document:
iis4authors.zip. Both class files and an example of use are contained
in the archive. Please follow all the recommendations given in the
example.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than March 15,
2009 using the submission webpage.

The page limit for long papers is 14 pages, whereas short papers /  
software demo descriptions are limited to 7 pages.

PUBLICATION

Workshop proceedings in electronic form will be distributed at the  
workshop. They will be available on-line after the workshop.
Additionnaly, the accepted long papers will be published along with  
the main IIS 2009 conference papers in a monograph form.
IMPORTANT DATES

     * Paper submissions due: 15.03.2009
     * Notification of acceptance: 13.04.2009
     * Camera-ready versions due: 4.05.2009
