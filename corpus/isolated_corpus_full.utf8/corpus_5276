AIMS

The proliferation of the Internet has revolutionised the way information
is disseminated and presented. Blogs no longer only relay and comment on
news stories but also influence what is talked about in the news. Such
changes have not gone unnoticed by the computational linguistics
research community, who are increasingly processing or exploiting blogs
in an attempt to keep track of what is going on and mine information.
This workshop will focus on how events can be identified and how
information related to event processing (e.g. NP coreference, temporal
processing) can be extracted from blogs. Emphasis will be on how
existing methods for event processing need to be adapted in order to
process this medium, and on linguistic differences in the reporting of
events in blogs and more traditional news texts. Extensions of this
research to text types from other collaborative environments such as
wikis, fora, chats and social networks are also welcomed.

Event detection and processing is not a new topic in computational
linguistics, but until now it has focused mainly on processing of
newswire. The TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et. al. 2003), the AQUAINT
TimeML corpus, and the NP4E corpus (Hasler, Orasan and Naumann 2006)
exclusively contain newswire, which may make them inappropriate for the
development of methods which need to process other text types. This
workshop will give researchers the opportunity to present efforts to
develop resources related to event identification and processing using
blog entries. In addition, papers describing annotation guidelines and
linguistic analyses of such resources are encouraged, including
comparisons with annotations of more traditional text types.

The informal style and structure of most blog entries makes event
detection in these documents a difficult task. This workshop will
encourage submission of papers that develop new methods for event
identification or test existing ones on blog entries. The fact that the
same event is usually reported in several entries, in many instances
containing contradictory information, makes cross-document event
coreference identification a more challenging task. Researchers are
encouraged to submit papers presenting such methods. Of particular
interest are papers detailing methods to identify subjective or
objective ways of presenting an event or to detect contradictory
reporting of the same event. =


The workshop is not restricted only to event processing. Papers on
topics related to event processing, such as the identification of
entities and temporal processing and reasoning are also encouraged.
Submissions about NLP applications that exploit event identification
such as summarisation of events in blogs, question answering about
events described in collaborative environments (e.g. Wikipedia) or
opinion mining related to events are also invited. =


TOPICS

Original papers in three main areas are expected:

Linguistics

      * linguistic representation and function of different kinds of
        information (e.g. opinion/subjectivity/objectivity)
      * discourse structure related to the presentation of events within
        and across blog entries
      * annotation of events in corpora of blogs
      * extension/adaptation of 'traditional' annotation of news texts
        for blog entries =

      * description of resources encoding information relevant to this
        workshop

Methods for event processing or necessary for event processing

      * event identification in blogs
      * contradictory information regarding the same events
        (cross-document NP and event coreference)
      * entity tracking across blog entries
      * identification, representation and reasoning about time in blogs
      * evaluation of event identification methods trained on newswire
        vs blogs

NLP methods and applications that use information about events

      * summarisation of events from blogs
      * opinion mining and analysis in blogs vs newswire
      * identification of objective and subjective information in blogs
        vs newswire
      * commercial systems which process events in blogs

Although we only explicitly mention blogs, research on text types from
other collaborative environments such as wikis, fora, chats and social
networks will also be considered. =



INVITED SPEAKER

Prof. Mike Thelwall, University of Wolverhampton, UK


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors are invited to submit three types of papers: full papers which
describe original and unpublished work in the topic area of this
workshop, posters which describe work in progress, and demos which
describe full working systems, and which, if accepted, will be presented
at a special session accompanied by live demo. Papers should be
submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP 2009
stylefiles and not should not exceed 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages
for posters and demos. The RANLP 2009 stylefiles are available at:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/submissions.htm. =


As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system. More
information available at:
http://clg.wlv.ac.uk/events/eETTs/submission.php

Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members of the Program
Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed comments, and to
score submitted papers on the following factors: =

      * Relevance to the workshop
      * Significance and originality
      * Technical/methodological accuracy
      * References to related work
      * Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. By
submitting a paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in case the
paper is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors will
attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected to pay the
RANLP-2009 workshop registration fee.

      * Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2009
      * Paper acceptance notification: July 20, 2009
      * Camera-ready papers due: August 24, 2009
