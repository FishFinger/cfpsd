		GL2009: Generative Lexicons: From Theory to Implementation
	5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon

			  Final Call for Papers

		  ILC-CNR, Pisa, Italy, Sept. 17-19 2009

			  http://www.gl2009.org/



*** Submission Deadline EXTENDED: June 11, 2009 ***


The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse
contributions from theoretical and computational linguistics, computer
science, cognitive science, and lexicography, which explore
compositionality from the
point of view of generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically,
contributions have assumed, as a starting point, the view outlined in
Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). This year's GL confere=
nce
will be in a new format, combining both an open call for papers and a works=
hop
on semantic annotation.

The conference will be held over a period of three days and will be organiz=
ed
as a combination of technical paper presentations and posters,
break-out sessions,
and keynote lectures. The first day will be devoted to the annotation works=
hop
and the second day to conference papers. The final day will be dedicated to=
 the
presentation of results from the workshop and an open discussion of
remaining issues.

The workshop and the open discussion are jointly supported by the EC-FLaReN=
et
and the NSF-SILT projects, with the goal of identifying common future
directions
of research.

This conference is endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups:
	SIGANN, SIGSEM, and SIGLEX.



* IMPORTANT DATES

Papers due: June 1, 2009 [extended to June 11, 2009]
Acceptance notice: July 1, 2009
Camera-ready version due: August 1, 2009
Conference: Sept. 17-19, 2009



* INVITED SPEAKERS

Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA
Johan Bos, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy
Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh, UK
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA



* TOPICS


Track 1: Open conference


Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Polysemy and sense shifting
- Co-compositionality and creation of new word senses
- Type coercion and argument selection phenomena
- Argument realization: mapping from lexicon to syntax
- Cognitive foundations for semantic categories
- The trade-off between pragmatics and lexical knowledge
- Presupposition and commonsense knowledge
- Underspecification and word sense disambiguation

These topics can be approached from either a theoretical or
computational perspective. Computational issues relating to the above
phenomena include:

- Automatic knowledge acquisition
- Computational models of compositional phenomena
- Robust semantic annotation
- Evaluation of algorithms and annotation schemes



Track 2: Semantic Annotation Workshop


The annotation workshop will address general issues in the identification a=
nd
markup of semantic content in text.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Compositional mechanisms of argument selection and coercion
- Named entity classification including named entities, events, and
temporal and spatial expressions
- Lexical substitution
- Metonymy resolution
- Textual entailment
- Word sense disambiguation
- Semantic role labelling
- Qualia in argument selection and modification constructions
- Type selection in modification of dot objects (complex types)
- Annotation environments and tools


The workshop is intended to provide feedback and training for the
upcoming 2010 SemEval tasks, with a special focus on the "Argument
Selection and Coercion" task, which deals with identifying the
compositional operations involved in argument selection by
a predicate.



* SUBMISSION INFORMATION


GL2009 will be using EasyChair for electronic submission.  All papers should
be submitted using the following website:

    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgl2009

Please indicate whether your submission is intended for the open call or for
the workshop. The final submission deadline is June 1, 2009 11:59 EST.
*** Deadline extended to June 11, 2009 ***

All submissions must be in PDF and must follow the two-column format.
The maximum
length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages. Submissions must be anonymized, =
i.e.
no author information should be included, and obvious self-references shoul=
d be
avoided.  Please use the ACL style guidelines, as specified here:

    http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/paperformat.html

Regular and poster papers should follow the same guidelines.  The appropria=
te
presentation format will be determined at the time of acceptance.



* AUTHOR SUPPORT

A limited number of fellowships to student authors travelling from the U.S.
will be available to offset the cost of travel if the paper is accepted.
