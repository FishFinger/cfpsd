The international Conference on Innovation in Software Engineering -
ISE'2008 will be held in Vienna, Austria on 10-12 December 2008.=20

ISE'2008 provides a medium for researchers and practitioners to exchange
and explore the issues and opportunities in software engineering. The
conference focus is on theory and applications of new and innovative
ways in software engineering,systems analysis, design, implementation,
testing and maintenance.=20
The conference will consist of both plenary sessions and contributory
sessions, focusing on theory and application of software engineering
techniques in diverse fields.

The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE in the USA and will
be indexed through IEE INSPEC, EI (Compendex), SCI (ISI), IEEE XploreTM
and the IEEE Computer Society digital libraries (CSDL). All papers will
be peer reviewed by at least two reviewers.=20
