2nd Call for Papers: Speaker Classification (Project Part)
for a book edited by Christian M=FCller and Susanne Sch=F6tz=20
=2D-------------------------------------------------------------

To achieve an optimal balance of topics, we still call for contributions (s=
ee=20
restricted list of topics below).

* Introduction *

Christian M=FCller from the German Research Center for Artificial Intellige=
nce=20
and Susanne Sch=F6tz from the University of Lund (Sweden) are editing a=20
collection on speaker classification which is published by Springer in the=
=20
LNCS/LNAI series (section 'State-of-the-Art surveys' respectively=20
'Hot-Topics'). In parallel to the printed book, it is published in full-tex=
t=20
electronic form via the Springer internet platform www.springerlink.com.=20

read more about the book	: http://www.dfki.de/~cmueller/lnai
read this cfp 			: http://www.dfki.de/~cmueller/lnai_proj

We invite contributions in a variety of areas related to speaker=20
classification, including artificial intelligence (machine learning, patter=
n=20
classification), natural language technology as well as phonetics. The term=
=20
speaker classification is thereby defined as the process of assigning a=20
vector of speech features to a discrete speaker class.=20

* What is the 'Project Part' ? *

In contrast to the 'conceptual part' which encompasses overview and=20
introductory chapters, the project part incorporates separate and=20
self-contained contributions of specific speaker classification projects. T=
he=20
formats and dimensions are projected to be comparable with journal articles=
=20
or full conference papers. The papers are selected by the editors according=
=20
to their quality, their relevance for the book as well as the general=20
diversification of topics. In comparison to conference proceedings, the=20
contributions of the project part of this book will be more comparable and=
=20
contain more cross-references. They aim to provide examples of the concepts=
=20
described in the first part. Authors should therefore allow an editorial=20
loop.

* List of Topics *

The topics which are marked (*) qualify for a later submission due (see=20
below).=20

acquiring any other kind of information about the speaker on the basis of=20
her/his speech or speaking behavior*

Please note that we explicitly allow contributions that have already been=20
published in conference proceedings or journals. Novel papers are welcome a=
s=20
well, of course. If you submit an abstract of already published concepts,=20
please refer to the proceedings or journal.

approval.
