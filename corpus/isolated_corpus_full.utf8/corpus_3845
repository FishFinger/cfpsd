Meeting Description:

Corpus Linguistics and Literature 

Call for Papers

First call for papers for the pre-conference colloquium Corpus Linguistics and
Literature as part of the Corpus Linguistics 2009 conference at the University
of Liverpool (conference website: http://www.liv.ac.uk/english/CL2009/).
Workshop organizers: Bettina Fischer-Starcke (Vienna University of Economics and
Business Administration) and Martin Wynne (Oxford Text Archive).

Date of the colloquium: 20 July 2009
Dates of the main conference: 21 to 23 July 2009

Corpus stylistics is the analysis of literary texts by using corpus linguistic
techniques. It combines the analytic techniques of corpus linguistics with the
goals of stylistics, that is, it extracts literary meanings from literary texts
by using computational means of analysis. In recent years, corpus stylistics has
become an integral part of corpus linguistics. Studies have been published by,
for instance, Louw (1993), Semino and Short (2004), Stubbs (2005), Starcke
(2006), Wynne (2006), Mahlberg (2007a, b), O'Halloran (2007a, b) and
Fischer-Starcke (forthcoming). There have also been a number of workshops at
international linguistic conferences, for instance at Corpus Linguistics 2005,
Corpus Linguistics 2007, the PALA conferences in 2006 and 2007 and ISLE 1, and
the workshop "Corpus Approaches to the Language of Literature" in Oxford in 2006.
This colloquium is intended to present and discuss approaches to corpus
stylistic analyses. It aims at furthering the discussion of what is possible in
corpus stylistic research, at discussing current approaches to corpus stylistic
analyses and at providing a forum for practitioners of the field to meet and to
discuss future directions.

We therefore invite submissions for papers which present the application of
corpus linguistic approaches in the analysis of literary texts. Papers will be
allocated 30 minutes, including 10 minutes for discussion. Abstracts should be
no more than 300 words long and be submitted to b.fischer-starcke@wu-wien.ac.at.

This colloquium is run in cooperation with the Poetics and Linguistics
Association (PALA) and is subject to acceptance by the conference organisers.

Submission deadline for abstracts: 9 January 2009
Notification of acceptance: 30 January 2009
