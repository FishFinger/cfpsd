Meeting Description

The 2008 LSP Conference and General Meeting is a forum for an exchange of ideas
among linguists, specialists, scholars, and English teachers, on the World
Englishes philosophy and its influence on second language teaching and learning.
In particular, it aims to:

(1) present the World Englishes framework as it has evolved in linguistics,
literature, and pedagogy;
(2) disseminate findings of research on features of varieties of English;
(3) discuss the implications of these findings for second language teaching and
learning;
(4) demonstrate the influence of the World Englishes philosophy on second
language teaching and learning; and
(5) assemble current and prospective members to enable them to share ideas on
the directions the LSP will take as a professional organization.

Keynote Speakers
Dr. Maria Lourdes S. Bautista
Professor Emerita, De La Salle University-Manila

Dr. Andy Kirkpatrick
Professor, Hong Kong Institute of Education

Dr. Gerald Nelson
Professor, University College London and Visiting Professor, City University of
Hong Kong 

Call for Parallel Session Presentations

Interested scholars and teachers may submit a 200-word abstract for parallel
session presentations, accompanied by a 50-word bio-data. Papers may deal with
any of the following topic areas:
1. Linguistic features (phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse) of a specific
variety of English or across varieties of World Englishes
2. World Englishes and L2 learning
3. World Englishes and contrastive (intercultural) rhetoric
4. Intelligibility of Asian Englishes

Online submissions (via email attachment) are encouraged, and may be sent to
either of the following email addresses:
linguisticsociety@yahoo.com or linguisticsoc@gmail.com
The deadline for submissions is December 15, 2007. Notices of acceptance will be

Meeting Description:
Workshop on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Extended Lexical Units 

The Leiden University Centre for Linguistics (LUCL) invites abstracts for a
workshop on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Extended Lexical Units, to be
held December 14-15 2007 at LUCL, Leiden University 
(The Netherlands).

Multi word units, idioms etc., or - with a more neutral term - Extended Lexical
Units (ELUs), have never been out of the scope of linguistic research. Progress
in the field has made clear that their importance can hardly be overestimated.
In any serious attempt to cover natural language on a large scale, be it
theoretical or applied, the amount of unpredictable lexical elements is
overwhelming and the problems they raise are baffling. Research questions with
respect to ELUs arise from all kinds of linguistic fields, including cognitive
and computational linguistics. The abundance and omnipresence of ELUs in real
language forces the (cognitive) theoretician to reconsider the architecture of
the language faculty, whereas in Natural Language Processing, ELUs form one of
the major stumbling blocks for
constructing robust applications. In this workshop, we try to bring those two
perspectives together. Topics of interest cover, among others, storage,
acquisition, and processing of ELUs from a cognitive perspective, and lexicon
design, implementation, and extraction of ELUs from a computational perspective.

Researchers are invited to send in abstracts for papers on lexical elements
larger than words and their role in linguistics and linguistic theory.
Preference is given to more formal approaches; in the ideal case, analyses and
techniques are computationally implementable.

Abstracts have to be in English. The abstract should contain:
- a title
- your name, address, affiliation, and email address
- a short outline of the paper (one page)

Deadline: October 1st
Notification of acceptance: November 1st

Date: December 14-15 2007
Venue: Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands

Workshop website: http://www.lucl.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=2&c=549 
Workshop address: ELU2007@let.leidenuniv.nl

Invited Speakers: 
Prof. Dirk Geeraerts, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven
Prof. Ivan Sag, Stanford University 
Dr. Manfred Sailer, Universität Göttingen 
Dr. Kathrin Steyer, Institut für Deutsche Sprache Mannheim

Dissemination:
a selection of the papers will be published in an edited volume.

Organizing Committee:
Mika Poss
Crit Cremers
Hilke Reckman
Ton van der Wouden (chair)
