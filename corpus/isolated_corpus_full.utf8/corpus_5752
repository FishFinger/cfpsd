Meeting Description:

15th Workshop on Structure and Constituency in the Languages of the
Americas WSCLA 15

The Workshop on Structure and Constituency in the Languages of the Americas
(WSCLA) is an annual linguistics conference, which started in 1995. The
central objective of WSCLA is to bring together linguists who are engaged
in research on the formal study of aboriginal languages of the Americas in
order to exchange ideas across theories, language families, generations of
scholars, and across the academic and non-academic communities who are
involved in language maintenance and revitalization.

WSCLA 15 will take place at the University of Ottawa on February 5-7, 2010.

The following invited speakers have been confirmed:

Henning Garvin
Helena Joanne Keeshig
Bethany Lochbihler
Leslie Saxon
Martina Wiltschko
Alan Yu

There are two special themed sessions: (1) Issues in Phonology in Languages
of the Americas, and (2) New Issues in Noun Incorporation. In addition
there will be a round table discussion with invited speakers entitled
Building Partnerships between Communities and Universities.
