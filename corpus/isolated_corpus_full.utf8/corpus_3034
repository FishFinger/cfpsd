Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition (PsychoCompLA-2008)

July 23rd at CogSci 2008 - Washington, D.C.

Submission Deadline: June 15, 2007 

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:
The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated computational models of
language acquisition. That is, models that are compatible with research in
psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics. 

Invited Speakers:
- Rens Bod, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of
Amsterdam, Netherlands
- Damir Cavar, University of Indiana, USA and Zadar University, Croatia
- Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
- Jeffery Lidz, University of Maryland, USA
- Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
- Josh Tenenbaum, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA

Workshop History:  
This is the fourth meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human Language
Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, held in Geneva, Switzerland as
part of the 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics
(COLING-2004), PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in Ann Arbor, Michigan
where the workshop shared a joint session with the Ninth Conference on
Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), and PsychoCompLA-2007 held
in Nashville, Tennessee as part of the 29th meeting of the Cognitive Science
Society (CogSci-2007).

Workshop Description:
The workshop will present research and foster discussion centered around 
psychologically-motivated computational models of language acquisition, with 
an emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades there has been a 
thriving research agenda that applies computational learning techniques to 
emerging natural language technologies and many meetings, conferences and
workshops in which to present such research. However, there have been only a few
(but growing number of) venues in which psychocomputational models of how humans
acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus. 
Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular interest 
in light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest that very 
young infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an audible input 
stream. Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical 'machinery' to 
the task of grammar acquisition, with or without an innate language component,
remains an open and important question. One effective line of investigation is
to computationally model the acquisition process and determine
interrelationships between a model and linguistic or psycholinguistic theory,
and/or correlations between a model's performance and data from linguistic
environments that children are exposed to. 

Special Theme:
Although the workshop program speaks to many facets of psychocomputational
language acquisition modeling, the theme of the workshop this year is: 

Computational resources: How much is just right, and does it matter? 

The computational resources (e.g., number of calculations per input datum, 
size of memory store, etc.) employed by current psychocomputational modeling
efforts vary tremendously from model to model. However, two important questions
have rarely been addressed. How well do a particular acquisition model's
resources parallel the resources employed by a human language learner? And, how
relevant (or not) is it to establish such a relationship? 

Topics and Goals:
Abstracts that present research on (but not necessarily limited to) the
following topics are welcome:

- Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
- Models that combine parsing and learning;
- Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that  incorporate
psychologically plausible constraints; 
- Comparative surveys that critique previously reported studies; 
- Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
- Models that address learning bias in terms of innate linguistic knowledge
versus statistical regularity in the input;
- Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics;
- Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
- Models of language change and its effect on language acquisition or vice versa;
- Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
- Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or
developmental theories (e.g., principles & parameters, optimality theory,
construction grammar, etc.)
- Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from cognitive psychology,
computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical sciences, linguistics and
psycholinguistics working on all areas of language acquisition. Diversity and
cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal.

page, with a second page for examples, table, figures, references, etc. The 
following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Please include a cover
sheet (as a separate attachment) containing the title of your submission, your
name, contact details and affiliation. Send your submission electronically to

Email: Psycho.Comp@hunter.cuny.edu.

Publication:
The accepted abstracts will appear in the online workshop proceedings. Full 
papers of accepted abstracts will be considered in Fall 2008 for inclusion in 
an issue of the new Cognitive Science Society Journal - topiCS - whose focus 
will be psychocomputational modeling of human language acquisition. 

Submission deadline: June 15, 2007
