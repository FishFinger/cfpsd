Meeting Description:

The Fairy Tale after Angela Carter
University of East Anglia, UK
22-25 April 200 

Call for Papers

2009 will mark the thirtieth anniversary of the publication of Angela Carter's
The Bloody Chamber, a story collection which has had a profound and pervasive
impact on our understanding of and engagement with the fairy tale. 'The Fairy
Tale after Angela Carter' will take the anniversary as the starting point for an
assessment of the state of the fairy tale and of fairy-tale studies in the wake
of The Bloody Chamber. It will take 'after' in both senses of the word, to
suggest influence - both direct and indirect - as well as chronology. As such,
the primary focus will be the critical and creative legacy of Carter's work as
writer, critic, editor and translator of fairy tales. Fairy-tale studies is an
inherently interdisciplinary field, in which there is a mutually enriching
relationship between literary-historical scholarship and various forms of
creative practice. The aim of the conference will be to stage and explore this
relationship; to assess the state of current critical and creative practice and
to pinpoint future directions for writing and research.

Selected conference papers will be published in a special issue of Marvels &
Tales (2010).

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers working on
disharmonic (i.e. mixed head-initial and head-final) word orders from both
theoretical and empirical perspectives.
The conference is funded by the AHRC through the project 'Structure and
Linearisation in Disharmonic Word Orders' (AH/E009239/1) 

Call for Papers

Invited speakers: Guglielmo Cinque (Venice), Matthew Dryer (SUNY Buffalo), Jim
Huang (Harvard), Richard Kayne (NYU)

One of the salient results of Greenberg's pioneering work in language typology
was the notion of a ''harmonic'' word-order type. Greenberg's work initiated a
research program, successful in many ways, of formulating inductive
cross-linguistic generalizations on the basis of comparison of languages sampled
so as to be representative of all the languages of the world. Although language
typology has contributed much to our understanding of comparative grammar, it
lacks formal, theoretical grounding. There have been numerous attempts, arguably
beginning with Hawkins (1983), to express Greenbergian generalisations,
including the notion of cross-categorial harmony, using the formal mechanisms of
Chomskyan theory, and thereby to integrate the two approaches. These have always
suffered from difficulties, however, in dealing with ''mixed'' or
''disharmonic'' systems. This has created particular difficulties for
principles-and-parameters approaches to word-order typology, since these predict
that, other things being equal, any grammatical system must fall on one side or
other of any cross-linguistic dichotomy. As a result, certain basic questions
concerning word-order typology remain unanswered. Among the most important
questions are the following: since it seems that a single word-order parameter
is too strong, given the attested variation, are word-order parameters then to
be stated for each (lexical/functional) category, for classes of categories, or
for all categories subject to some defeasibility constraint? Is it then true
that, in fact, anything goes, beyond each category having to have a fixed
internal order? If not, what generalisations can be made aside from the simple
observation that most languages are tendentially head-initial or head-final?
These are the central themes this conference is intended to address.

Accordingly, we invite abstracts dealing with aspects of disharmonic word
orders. These include:

- evidence for or against given possible generalisations concerning subtypes of
harmony (e.g. clause-internal vs nominal-internal orders, etc);
- evidence for or against asymmetries in disharmonic orders; 
- evidence for or against the role of historical or areal factors in determining
disharmonic orders, particularly the role of and limits on language contact; 
- evidence for or against different surface triggers for word-order parameter
settings;
- evidence for or against limiting word-order variation to a specific subpart of
the grammar (functional heads, the lexicon, PF, etc.);
- evidence regarding the learnability of disharmonic parametric systems.

Papers may deal with these questions from any theoretical or empirical
standpoint, although we are particularly interested in papers using data from
language acquisition and language change.

Presentations will last one hour each (forty-five minutes for the presentation
followed by fifteen minutes for questions). Abstracts should not exceed two
A4/letter-size pages and be in 10- or 12-point type with standard margins.
Abstracts should be submitted by e-mail to Glenda Newton (gen21@cam.ac.uk) by
February 1st 2009. The programme will be finalised by April 1st 2009. Speakers
will be partially reimbursed for their expenses.
