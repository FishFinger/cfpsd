Meeting Description:

The Instituto Interuniversitario de Lenguas Modernas Aplicadas de la Comunidad
Valenciana (IULMA) is proud to announce the first edition of this International
Conference on Language and Health Care, to be held at the University of Alicante
(Spain) on the 24th, 25th and 26th October 2007. The main topic of the
Conference will be the study of language in the context of health sciences and
health care: interdisciplinary perspectives. The main aim of this Conference,
which deals with language from an interdisciplinary point of view, is to explore
and analyze the contribution which can be made to a better understanding of
health sciences by linguistics and language analysis.

The Conference is organized by the Instituto Interuniversitario de Lenguas
Modernas Aplicadas de la Comunidad Valenciana (IULMA). IULMA is a centre for
research, teaching and services run jointly by universities of the Valencian
Community and dedicated to theoretical and practical issues in applied modern
languages, also known as professional and academic language. IULMA's activities
take place within an interdisciplinary framework as required by a society based
on knowledge and information, with a view to the satisfaction of scientific,
business and social needs created by the globalization of knowledge, science,
technology and economics.
