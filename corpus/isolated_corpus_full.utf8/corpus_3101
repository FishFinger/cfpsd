Meeting Description:

1st International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation:
Supporting Small Languages Together. Honolulu, Hawai'i, March 12-14, 2009 

The 1st International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation
(ICLDC)  will be held at the Hawaii Imin International Conference Center, on the
east side of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa campus, from March 12th-14th,
2009. There will also be an optional opportunity to visit Hilo, on the Big
Island of Hawai'i, in an extension of the conference that will focus on the
Hawaiian language revitalization program, March 16th-17th. 

Call for Papers

It has been a decade since Himmelmann's article on language documentation
appeared and focused the field into thinking in terms of creating a lasting
record of a language that could be used by speakers as well as by academics.
This conference aims to assess what has been achieved in the past decade and
what the practice of language documentation within linguistics has been and can
be. It has become apparent that there is too much for a linguist alone to
achieve and that language documentation requires collaboration. This conference
will focus on the theme of collaboration in language documentation and
revitalization and will include sessions on interdisciplinary topics.

Plenary Speakers include:
Nikolaus Himmelmann, University of Münster
Leanne Hinton, UC Berkeley
Paul Newman, Indiana University, University of Michigan
Phil Cash Cash, University of Arizona

Presentation formats:
Papers will be allowed 20 minutes with 10 minutes of question time.
Posters will be on display throughout the conference. Poster presentations will
run during the lunch breaks.
Colloquia (themed sets of sessions) associated with the theme of the conference
are also welcome.

We welcome abstracts on the issue of a retrospective on language
documentation-an assessment after a decade, and on topics related to
collaborative language documentation and conservation which may include:
- Community-based documentation/conservation initiatives
- Community viewpoints on documentation
- Issues in building language documentation in collaborative teams
- Interdisciplinary fieldwork
- Collaboration for mobilization of language data
- Technology in documentation - methods and pitfalls
- Graduate students and documentation
- Topics in areal language documentation
- Training in documentation methods - beyond the university
- Teaching/learning small languages
- Language revitalization
- Language archiving
- Balancing documentation and language learning

This is not an exhaustive list and individual papers and/or colloquia on topics
outside these remits are warmly welcomed.

Abstract Submission:
Abstracts should be submitted in English, but presentations can be in any
language. We particularly welcome presentations in languages of the region.

Abstracts are due by September 15th, 2008 with notification of acceptance by
October 17th 2008.

Abstracts will be entered online at the conference webpage. (available July 2008).

We ask for abstracts of 400 words for online publication so that conference
participants can have a good idea of the content of your paper and a 50 word
summary for inclusion in the conference program.

Selected papers from the conference will be invited to submit to the journal
Language Documentation & Conservation for publication.
