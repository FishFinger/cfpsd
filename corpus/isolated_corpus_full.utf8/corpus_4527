Full Title: Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory 


Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis;Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2009 

Call for abstracts for a special issue on 'Contemporary perspectives on
discourse and corpora: New registers, analyses, texts, and tools' (working
title).

Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory 
(http://www.degruyter.de/journals/cllt/detail.cfm) 
publishes original corpus-based studies focusing on theoretically relevant
issues of linguistic research. The guest editor is inviting abstracts for
paper submissions for a special issue on 'Contemporary perspectives on
discourse and corpora: New registers, analyses, texts, and tools' (working
title) to appear in the next volume in 2010.

The aim of the special issue is to promote current research on
theoretically sound discourse analytical aspects of corpus linguistics.
More specifically, the special issue will offer studies exhibiting
state-of-the-art approaches to corpus-based analyses of texts from a range
of contexts. Consistent with the general philosophy of the journal, and
specific to the applied, discourse analytical aspect of linguistics, the
special issue seeks submissions that 

-- utilize new corpus-linguistic methods or extensions of existing methods
in analyzing text;  
-- support theories of discourse as they relate to corpus-based text analysis;
-- offer systematic and detailed analyses of lexical, grammatical, and/or
lexico-grammatical patterns in spoken and/or written registers;
-- analyze texts from emerging discourse contexts as they relate to the
theoretical framework of corpus-based register studies;
-- propose new approaches to corpus-based lexical pattern studies as they
relate to discourse structure.

All submitted work will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis.

The following is our projected timeline:
-- April 15, 2009: 300-500 word abstracts due 
-- April 25, 2009: Invitations to submit/rejections of abstracts
-- September 25, 2009: Papers due
-- February 15, 2010: Final revisions due

Please send your abstract to the guest editor of the special issue, Eniko
Csomay, by no later than April 15, 2009 via email ecsomay@mail.sdsu.edu
with a subject heading 'CLLT Special 2010' (abstracts and contact
information should be sent in one attachment but separate sheets and saved
in .pdf or .rtf formats) or by regular mail (to arrive by April 15, 2009)
to the following address:
