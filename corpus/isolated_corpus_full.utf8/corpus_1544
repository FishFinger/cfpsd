             Last Call for Papers

Applications of Semantics, Opinion and Sentiments in eLearning
                            (ASOS)

              Workshop organized under the joint aegis of
                    ELSNET and the LT4eL FP6 project
                      To be held at EUROLAN 2007
                    July 23-27 2007 Iasi, Romania

               http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/ASOS

  Paper submission deadline: May 28, 2007


The workshop will address the main themes of the EUROLAN-2007 Summer 
School, that is Semantics, Opinions and Sentiments (SOS), in relation 
with eLearning.

One of the main benefits of education is that it allows the student to 
come into direct contact with the lecturer. In face-to-face classroom 
education, a significant part of the formation is based on this 
activity, in which the student listens to the lecturer, and is supposed 
to be conquered by her/his eloquence, by her/his vocabulary and style, 
by the charm and charismatic presence of a human being. The role of a 
lecturer is to transmit not only knowledge, but also passion, 
discipline, and moral values. Very often, sentiments, as let to be 
perceived by the lecturer and the student, influence crucially the 
quality of education. Emotions and their expression should be perceived 
either as a feedback in the reaction of the student or as a component of 
the didactic activities.

Within technology enhanced learning, interaction is mediated by the 
computer and the role of the human lecturer seems to be diminished. 
However, a new generation of eLearning systems is being developed, in 
which the human component will play a much more relevant role. The 
challenge is to make the learning activities, in which the computer 
gains a more and more significant position, as natural as possible.

The intent of the workshop is to present new work and innovating ideas 
for the development of eLearning systems that will exploit opinions and 
sentiments in the communication between the tutor (real or virtual) and 
the student. The following topics are relevant for the ASOS event:
* molecules of emotion, sentiment classification and modeling
* automatic and semi-automatic discovery of subjectivity indicators in 
education
* signaling and controlling sentiments in learning objects
* separation of subjectivity and objectivity in educational materials
* automatic generation of learning objects by integrating opinions and 
sentiments into content
* humor recognition and generation in educational media
* tracking themes and opinions over time
* annotation for deep semantics, sentiment, and subjectivity in eLearning
* subjectivity/sentiment and analysis of discourse and dialogue in 
chats, blogs, forums and interactive educational systems
* educational interfaces involving avatars displaying emotion
* communicating emotion in intelligent educational systems
* sentiments, opinions and rational behaviors in educational environments
* relationship between intelligent systems and emotional systems
* novel intelligent learning structures for emotional function and eLearning
* implementation of emotional systems and e-learning systems
* expressivity communicated in learning environments through speech and text
* applications of SOS to improve personalized and adaptive learning, 
adaptive information filtering and retrieval, intelligent tutoring
* behavior, emotions and sentiment ontologies
* evaluation of SOS in eLearning environments
* evaluation of emotional eLearning systems
* multilingual aspects in all the above

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished work within 
the workshop themes. All submissions (even if they focus on only one 
aspect of the mentioned topics) should show how eLearning could benefit 
from the results.

We encourage submissions by YOUNG RESEARCHERS even if their research is 
in its initial stage since the workshop will give the chance to 
presenters to shape their ideas and receive feedback.

The workshop will run for three-four consecutive evenings during the 
EUROLAN-07 Summer School. Selected proposals will be invited for a 30 
minutes presentation which will be followed by one hour discussion 
moderated by a member of the Program Committee. The papers presented, 
together with a text summarizing the recorded discussions following the 
presentations, will be published in a volume in the "Al.I.Cuza" 
Publishing House.

The best reviewed submission will be granted a scholarship from the 
LT4eL European Project (http://www.lt4el.eu/) to cover the EUROLAN 
registration fee.

Proposals should be no longer than 8 pages, references excluded, and 
should be structured as follows:
- title, authors and affiliations
- short presentation of the domain and related work/and achievements
- your own previous work in this area (if existent)
- the main idea of the proposal
- your expected feedback from the audience, including some major 
questions that you want to address
- the potential and feasibility of the idea
- the foreseen dangers
- references

In order for your proposal to be selected, you should convince the 
Program Committee that it is SMART (Specific to the mentioned field, the 
effort encumbered be Measurable, its objectives be Achievable, the 
outcome be Relevant, and its realization be well Time-framed).

Submissions will be electronic. The papers will be uploaded on a special 
page, details can be found on the web page of the ASOS workshop.

Important dates:
* Paper submissions deadline: May 28, 2007
* Notification of acceptance: June 11, 2007
* Presentations / final papers due: July 9, 2007
* Summer School dates: July 23 - August 3, 2007

Authors of accepted papers must register for the EUROLAN Summer School 
and present their work at the ASOS workshop. No supplementary fee will 
be required above the EUROLAN fee. All accepted authors will benefit 
from the early registration fee regardless of the date they register. 
Participation in the ASOS workshop is open to all EUROLAN-2007 attendants.
