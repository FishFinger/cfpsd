strategically in an organizational context. Business discourse research employs
a variety of methods ranging from conversation analysis, pragmatics, corpus
linguistics, genre analysis and intersects humanities and social sciences
through its focus on language at work. 

This special topics conference seeks to position business discourse as an
emerging discipline and to bring people from a variety of disciplines together
to build a community of scholars with special interest in business discourse.
Conference topics include but are not limited to:

Workplace communication 
Leadership communication
Corporate social responsibility
Multicultural communication

This conference will take place at the University of Southern California, Los
Angeles and will consist of a series of plenary addresses, paper presentations,
