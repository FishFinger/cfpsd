Theme

For information management, databases offer precise, controlled access =
to
data. But, they do not offer the easy-to-use search capabilities that =
most
knowledge workers manipulate daily on sites such as Google. Access to
information contained in databases is more difficult, and more =
restricted.
One solution to this information bottleneck is to let search engines =
support
the brunt of the work, by offloading information from the database into
alternative infrastructures, such as that provided by search engine
technology. Many business applications such as search, report generation =
and
data analysis might be performed more efficiently on the replicated data
without involving the native database technology, e.g. transactions. =
These
offloaded databases, retaining some of their structure, can be =
recombined,
mashed up, creating one-off, possibly disposable, databases, while the
primary data is safe in the original database. This workshop will =
examine
the limits and potentialities of use information retrieval and search =
engine
technology for information management (IM) applications.=20

Topics to be explored:=20

- search engine as a database
- business intelligence applications without OLAP
- optimization of relational database search
- affordances of search engine technology for database offloading
- mashups for user applications
- content aggregation systems
- limits of database offloading
- database connectors
- access-optimized databases
- disposable databases
- optimizing access, flexibility, and scalability=20


This workshop explores the application of information retrieval and =
search
engine technologies and paradigms in the context of traditional =
information
management systems and applications. Traditional systems often use
relational databases management systems which offer many advantages for
information management: providing a normative modeling of data, ensuring
transaction security, access control, protecting data through versioning =
and
rollbacks, formal specification of interprocess communication. But with =
this
data-centered security comes implementation and exploitation costs that
reduce flexibility, reduce response time, and limit access in =
information
management systems. Many of the uses of databases might be offloaded by
replicating the data in easier-to-access and scalable technologies such =
as
search engine technologies. For rapid prototyping, mature search engine
technology might be a low-cost solution for aggregating, repurposing and
mashing up data in novel ways. There has been a growing tendency of
including more and more semantics in information retrieval systems
(information extraction); and using databases to stored unstructured
(documents) and semi structured (XML) data. The focus of this workshop =
will
be examine the opposite problem, exploring the opportunities of moving =
from
structured databases to information retrieval systems which nonetheless
recognize and maintain native semantic structure of the data.=20

As information retrieval and information management communities grow =
closer
together, this workshop will provide a meeting point for discussing
technology overlap.=20
