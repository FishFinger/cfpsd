     Second CFP for the CALICO'09 Pre-Conference Workshop on

        Automatic Analysis of Learner Language (AALL'09):
         From a better understanding of annotation needs
   to the development and standardization of annotation schemes

    March 10 or 11, 2009. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.

              Submission Deadline: December 1, 2008

In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers working on the
analysis of learner language in the broad sense, including work on
annotation schemes for learner corpora and NLP techniques used to
detect learner errors and other learner language properties. We
invite abstracts addressing these general issues, including but not
limited to:

- Which properties of learner language are useful and relevant to
 obtain for Foreign Language Teaching and current Second Language
 Acquisition research?

- What annotation scheme or (error) taxonomy is appropriate for this
 and how do different annotation schemes compare?

- How reliably can errors and other properties of learner language
 be obtained automatically given the current state-of-the art in
 NLP?

- What is the impact of the specific properties of learner language
 on the (re)use of NLP technology? How does it impact performance
 and the potential use of such technology in foreign language
 teaching tools?

- Which annotated learner language corpora have been used or could
 be used to evaluate the performance of different approaches to
 analyzing learner language?

The workshop is intended to follow up on the pre-conference workshop
on the Automatic Analysis of Learner Language held at CALICO 2008
(http://purl.org/net/calico-workshop).

We invite submissions of anonymous two page abstracts in an email
with the abstract as a pdf attachment. Name, affiliation, and email
address should only be included in the text of the email, not in the
abstract in the pdf attachment.

Send submissions to: calico-workshop@ling.osu.edu
Submission Deadline: December 1
Please use the following Subject: Submission to AALL '09

The workshop is organized by the ICALL Special Interest Group of
CALICO (http://purl.org/calico/icall), currently chaired by
Xiaofei Lu (Pennsylvania State University) and Detmar Meurers
(Universit=E4t T=FCbingen).
