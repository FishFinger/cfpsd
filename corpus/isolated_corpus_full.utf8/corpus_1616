SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on NLP for Educational Resources

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
September 26, 2007
Borovetz, Bulgaria

The submission system is available at the Workshop site
http://ixa.si.ehu.es/NLP_ER2007

RANLP 2007 site
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

In this workshop we will discuss how using NLP techniques in the =
automatic
treatment of texts can support pedagogic goals. There are well over 100=20
documented projects at the use of NLP in Intelligent Computer-Assisted=20
Language Learning (ICALL) (Heift & Schulze,2007); however, there are=20
significantly fewer publications about the use of NLP techniques in=20
educational areas other than language learning.
This workshop will bring together NLP and ICALL researchers with =
colleagues
who are investigating NLP treatment for other educational purposes. Our =
main=20
aim is to discuss how we can use NLP in the automatic treatment of =
corpora for=20
pedagogical purposes as well as in the analysis of learner corpora =
(students=20
free responses).
The contributions of this workshop will share at least two keywords: NLP =
and
Education. We especially seek contributions about the adaptation and =
integration=20
of NLP techniques in the following areas:

* Automatic exercise and task generation
* Controlled language
* Error diagnosis and remediation
* Essay assessment
* Fostering language awareness
* Automatic generation of didactic resources
* Analysis of learners? interlanguage
* NLP for processing texts in ICALL environments
* Learner corpora
* Learning of textual analysis (in linguistics, literature, =
anthropology, ?)
* Student modelling
* Text production tools (e.g. grammar and spell checkers)
* Translator training
