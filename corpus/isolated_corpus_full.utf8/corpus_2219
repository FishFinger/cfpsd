Meeting Description

2nd European Conference on Korean Linguistics (ECKL)
Aug. 7 - 9, 2008
School of Oriental and Asian Studies (SOAS)
London, United Kingdom 

The 2nd European Conference on Korean Linguistics Conference (ECKL) invites

comparative/contrastive linguistics. Areas of particular interests are not
limited and include historical linguistics, typology, syntax, semantics,
morphology, phonology, phonetics, psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics and
language teaching. 

Presentations will be 20 minutes long, followed by a 10-minute question and
answer period. Please submit abstracts (one page, 500 words maximum) as an
attached PDF file to ECKL08@yahoo.co.uk. You may use a second page for
references and example sentences. Do not include any author information in the
body of your abstract. 

Following your abstract, on a separate page, include the following information,
which will be removed before your abstract is sent out for review: 

1. Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the author(s)
2. Address
3. Phone number
4. E-mail address of the primary author

If any of your contact details will be different during spring or summer, make

The deadline for the submission of abstracts is 28 February 2008. 
Notification of acceptance will be given by the end of March 2008. Necessary
information about the conference, including programme and accommodation
facilities, will appear on our conference website from March/April 2008 onwards. 
Please note that only one individual abstract and one jointly authored abstract
may be submitted by each person. Participants are expected to submit a full
written version of their papers for inclusion in a pre-conference proceedings
volume. It is further planned that selected papers from the conference will
appear in an edited volume to be published in 2009. 
The conference is jointly organised by the Centre of Korean Studies at SOAS and
the Oriental Institute at the University of Oxford.
