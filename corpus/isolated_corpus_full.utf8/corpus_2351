Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description:

The PLA Symposium 2008 endeavors to provide faculty and students from various disciplines related to linguistics opportunities to interact with those both inside and outside their respective disciplines. The Symposium will consist of a Special Session centered on the topic of 'The Interaction between Data and Theory' and a General Session. Our invited speaker for this year is Jerrold M. Sadock (University of Chicago). 

Special Session: ''The Interaction between Data and Theory''
How do data in each linguistic field contribute to the development of theoretical frameworks? How do frameworks constrain the generation or gathering of data? This Special Session aims at presenting views on how these two aspects of linguistic inquiry interact as well as specific examples of how data and theory fit together. We are especially interested in hearing papers on a variety of linguistic subfields on this topic, with the further aim of understanding whether the relationship between data and theory varies across subfields. The Special session will be followed by a general discussion on the topic. 

General Session: 
We invite submissions for abstracts for 20-minute presentations in any area related to linguistics, including, but not limited to: 
Phonetics
Phonology
Syntax
Semantics
Sociolinguistics
Psycholinguistics
Historical Linguistics
Anthropological Linguistics
Computational Linguistics
First Language Acquisition
Second Language Acquisition
First and Second Language Writing
Speech and Hearing Sciences

Interested parties should send a title page and an anonymous abstract of not more than two pages (including examples, references and figures) as separate .pdf attachments to Sunny Park at skparkATpurdue.edu by February 8, 2008. You may also submit your pdf abstract at http://pla.purdue.org/. The title page should include the following information: 
1. Your Name
2. Title of your submission
3. Topic area of your submission (you could choose from the above list)
4. Your departmental affiliation
5. Your program of study
6. Email address
7. Whether you would like to be considered for the Special Session

If you have any questions, please contact Sunny Park at skparkATpurdue.edu or Alejandrina Cristia at  acristiaATpurdue.edu.

Meeting Description:

Thirteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference
July 4-6, 2008
University of Sydney, Australia

The 13th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be hosted by the University of Sydney from July 4th to 6th 2008. This LFG conference is one in a series of linguistics conferences, and will be followed by the Australian Linguistics Institute (http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/).

LFG 2008 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical-Functional Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the 'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel, constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and collaboration among researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple levels of structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the following sites:
http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/

Thirteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference

July 4-6, 2008

University of Sydney, Australia

Conference website: http://escholarship.library.usyd.edu.au/conferences/index.php/LingFest2008/LFG/
Conference e-mail (not for abstract submission): lfg08 ''at'' arts.usyd.edu.au

Abstract submission receipt deadline: 15 February 2008
Submissions should be submitted using the online submission system at
http://www.easychair.org/LFG08/

Submissions: Talks and Posters

The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15 min. discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions can focus on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Presentations should describe original, unpublished work.


Dissertation Session
As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will give students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other student research dissertations). The dissertations must be completed by the time of the conference, and they should be made publicly accessible (e.g., on the World Wide Web). The talks in this session should provide an overview of the main original points of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute discussion period. The International LFG Association (ILFGA) will pay the conference fees for the students presenting at the student session.

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to student submissions.


Timetable

Deadline for abstracts: 15 February 2008
Acceptances sent out: 31 March 2008
Conference: July 4-6 2008


Submission Specifications
Abstracts for talks, posters/demonstrations and the dissertation session must be received by February 15, 2008. All abstracts should be submitted using the online submission system. Submissions should be in the form of abstracts only. Abstracts can be up to two A4 pages in 10pt or larger type and should include a title. Omit name and affiliation, and obvious self-reference.  Note: we no longer ask for a separate page for data and figures (c-/f- and related structures). They can be included in the text of the abstract, obeying the overall two-page limit. Please submit your abstract in .pdf or .doc format. If you have any trouble converting your file into any of these formats, please contact the Program Committee at the address below.

Each individual may be the single author on only one submission and the
first author on at most two submissions; however, s/he may be a co-author on any number of submissions.

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people. Papers will appear in the proceedings, which will be published online by CSLI Publications. Selected papers may also appear in a printed volume published by CSLI Publications.
