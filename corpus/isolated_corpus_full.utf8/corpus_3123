The deadline for the special edition of Speech Communication on Speech 
and Language Technology for Education has been extended to July 1. 2008.

*CALL FOR PAPERS*

Special Issue of Speech Communication

on

*Spoken Language Technology for Education*

 

*Guest-editors:*

Maxine Eskenazi, Associate Teaching Professor, Carnegie Mellon University

Abeer Alwan, Professor, University of California at Los Angeles

Helmer Strik, Assistant Professor, University of Nijmegen

 

Language technologies have evolved to the stage where they are reliable 
enough, if their strong and weak points are properly dealt with, to be 
used for education. The creation of an application for education 
presents several challenges: making the language technology sufficiently 
reliable (and thus advancing our knowledge in the language 
technologies), creating an application that actually enables students to 
learn, and engaging the student. Papers in this special issue should 
deal with several of these issues. Although language learning is the 
primary target of research at present, papers on the use of language 
technologies for other education applications are encouraged. The scope 
of acceptable topic interests includes but is not limited to:

 

- Use of speech technology for education

- Use of spoken language dialogue for education

- Applications using speech and natural language processing for education

- Intelligent tutoring systems using speech and natural language

- Pedagogical issues in using speech and natural language technologies 
for education

- Assessment of tutoring software

- Assessment of student performance

 

*Tentative schedule for paper submissions, review, and revision**: ** *

Deadline for submissions: JULY 1, 2008.

Deadline for decisions and feedback from reviewers and editors: 
SEPTEMBER 31, 2008.

Deadline for revisions of papers: DECEMBER 31, 2008.

 

*Submission instructions:*

Authors should consult the "Guide for Authors", available online, at

preparation of their manuscripts. Authors, please submit your paper via
