TIME 2007 -- Call for Papers

The 14th International Symposium on=20
TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION AND REASONING

University of Alicante, Spain, 28-30 June, 2007

http://gplsi.dlsi.ua.es/congresos/time07/

The purpose of this symposium is to bring together active researchers
from distinct research areas involving representation of and reasoning
about temporal phenomena. As with previous meetings in this
well-established series (see http://time.dico.unimi.it), one of the
goals of the TIME symposium will be to build a bridge between
theoretical and applied research in temporal representation and
reasoning. Thus, we especially encourage submissions concerning
temporal issues within areas such as Artificial Intelligence,
Linguistics, Temporal/Spatial Databases and Applications of Temporal
Logic in Computer Science, in order to achieve a multi-disciplinary
perspective on the topic and to benefit from cross-fertilization of
ideas.

The conference is planned as a three-day event, and will be organised
as a combination of technical paper presentations, an extended poster
session, and keynote talks.

Paper Submission:
-----------------
Submissions of high-quality papers describing accomplished results or
on-going work on original, previously unpublished research, are
welcome. Submitted papers should be written in English, and should not
be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions
must not exceed the length of 11 pages with font size 11pt or
larger. The submission should be in PDF format (with necessary fonts
embedded for the best result). The use of the LaTeX article style at
11pt is strongly suggested when the article is prepared. Overlength
submissions may be rejected without review. Please indicate the
category, track, and topic(s) on the first page. Accepted papers will
be invited for a full presentation or a poster presentation. Papers
should be electronically submitted via the online system available at
the TIME 2007 web site.

Important Dates:
----------------
Submission Deadline: 12 Feb. 2007
Acceptance Notification: 28 March, 2007
Camera-Ready Copy: 11 April, 2007
TIME 2007 Symposium: 28-30 Jun., 2007

Conference venue:=20
-----------------
The conference will be held at the University of Alicante, Sede
Universitaria Ciudad de Alicante, beautifully situated on Costa
Blanca, between the mountains and the Spanish Mediterranean Sea.

Topics of Interests:=20
--------------------
Track 1 -- Temporal Representation/Reasoning in AI and Linguistics:
temporal aspects of agent-based systems, temporal constraint
reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, temporal languages for
planning, temporal languages and architectures, ontologies of time and
space-time, spatio-temporal reasoning, expressive power versus
tractability, belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge, time and
nonmonotonic reasoning, interval temporal logics, time and temporality
in natural language processing.

Track 2 -- Time Management in Databases: temporal data models,
temporal database design, temporal query languages, indexing of
temporal data, temporal database systems, spatio-temporal databases,
constraint databases, temporal data mining, temporal data privacy &
security, time in multimedia databases, time in web applications, time
in federated and heterogeneous systems, time in workflow systems,
querying time series databases, querying data streams.

Track 3 -- Temporal Logic in Computer Science: temporal specification,
synthesis and verification of systems, model checking of temporal
logics, verification of infinite-state systems, temporal logics for
distributed systems, expressiveness of temporal languages,
decidability and complexity of temporal logics, logics of knowledge
and time, metric and real-time logics and timed automata, temporal
logics and concurrency, temporal issues in security, tools and
practical systems.


Publication:
------------
As usual for the TIME series, proceedings will be published by IEEE
Computer Society Press and will be subject to IEEE
Copyright. Camera-ready papers are expected to be produced with the
author kits sent by IEEE Computer Society Press. It is also our
intention to organise a special issue of a respected journal,
containing extended versions of selected papers from the symposium.
