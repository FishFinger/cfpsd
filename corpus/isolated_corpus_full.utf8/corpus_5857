*********** Second Call for Papers - ECIR 2010 ***********



     32nd European Conference on Information Retrieval



     The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.

     28 - 31 March 2010



     In cooperation with: BCS-IRSG, ACM SIGIR, The Open University, 
Dublin City University, University of Essex

     http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/ecir2010/



*************************************************





The European Conference on Information Retrieval provides an opportunity 
for both new and established researchers to present research papers 
reporting new, unpublished, and innovative research results within 
information retrieval.



We are seeking the submission of high-quality and original research 
papers that have not been previously published and are not under review 
for another conference or journal. Submissions will be reviewed by 
experts on the basis of the originality of the work, the validity of the 
results, chosen methodology, writing quality and the overall 
contribution to the field of Information Retrieval. ECIR has 
traditionally had a strong student focus. Papers whose sole or main 
author is a young researcher and in particular, postgraduate student or 
postdoctoral researcher are especially welcome. Poster and demo 
submissions addressing any of the areas identified in the conference 
topics are also invited. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate work in 
progress and late-breaking research results. Papers that demonstrate a 
high level of research adventure or which break out of the traditional 
IR paradigms are particularly welcome.



The Program Chairs invite for the submission of original research papers 
and posters in all areas of Information Retrieval, including but not 
limited to:

- Enterprise Search, Intranet, Desktop, Adversarial IR

- Web IR

- Digital libraries

- IR Theory and Formal Models

- Web log analysis

- Distributed IR, peer to peer IR, Mobile IR, Fusion/Combination

- Multimedia IR

- Cross-language retrieval, Multilingual retrieval, Machine translation 
for IR

- Topic detection and tracking, Routing, Content-based filtering, 
Collaborative filtering, Agents, Spam filtering

- Question answering, NLP for IR, Summarization, Lexical acquisition

- Text Data Mining

- Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis

- Text Categorization, Clustering

- Performance, Scalability, Architectures, Efficiency, Platforms

- Indexing, Query representation, Query reformulation, Structure-based 
representation, XML

- Metadata, Social networking/tagging

- Evaluation methods and metrics, Experimental design, Test collection

- Interactive IR, User studies, User models, Task-based IR

- User interfaces and visualization

- Other domain-specific IR (e.g., Genomic IR, legal IR, IR for chemical 
structures)

- Blog and online-community search



Authors are invited to submit research papers presenting original, 
previously unpublished, work on or before 1 October 2009. Submissions 
must be written in English following the LNCS guidelines and must not 
exceed 12 pages including references and figures. All papers will be 
refereed through blind peer review. Accepted papers will be published in 
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. To allow a high degree of 
interaction, ECIR 2010 will have two presentation formats for full 
papers. They will either be presented orally or in poster format. The 12 
page limit in the proceedings applies equally to these papers. There 
will be a separate call for posters/demos and workshops/tutorials. The 
proceedings will be distributed to all delegates at the Conference.
