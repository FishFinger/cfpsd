Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

CSEDU 2010 (the 2th International Conference on Computer Supported Education) is an important yearly meeting place of top researchers and practitioners. Last edition of CSEDU was well attended by several hundred researchers and practitioners and included a number of distinguished keynote speakers who contributed to reinforce the high quality standards of the conference as can be seen at the conference website.

CSEDU (http://www.csedu.org) will be organized by INSTICC, the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communications, and held in cooperation with top international associations. This conference is co-located with WEBIST 2010 (6th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies - http://www.webist.org/) which is an added-value for those delegates who share an interest in topic areas of both conferences.

Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and CD-ROM support. The proceedings will be indexed by several major international indexers, including INSPEC, DBLP and we are awaiting the confirmation of indexation by EI and Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

Best paper awards will be distributed during the conference.

All published papers will be also available at the INSTICC's Digital Library, which will be made available shortly.

Please check further details at the CSEDU 2010 conference web site (http://www.csedu.org). There you will find detailed information about the conference structure and its main topic areas. 

Workshops and special sessions are also invited. If you wish to propose a workshop or a special session, for example based on the results of a specific research project, please send a proposal to the CSEDU secretariat. Workshop chairs and Special Session chairs will benefit from logistics support and other types of support, including secretariat and financial support, to facilitate the development of a valid idea.

Should you have any question or suggestion please don't hesitate to contact me.


Kind regards,
Bruno Encarnacao
