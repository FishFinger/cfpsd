OnToContent 2008 Workshop
Ontology Content, Semantic Mashups, eHealth Ontologies, HR ontologies,
http://ontocontent2008.mature-ip.eu
  ******************************************************************
*** Proceedings published by Springer LNCS
*** Invited Speaker: To be announced
*** Submission Deadline: June 30, 2008
*** Research Papers (10 Pages) Position Papers (6 Papers)
******************************************************************
In conjunction of the International Federated Conferences (OTM '08)
Monterrey, Mexico, November 9-14, 2008

*Call For Papers*
Under the buzz word Semantic Web a lot of research has been going on in
recent years, exploring formalisms for expressing ontologies, reasoning
algorithms for inferencing hidden knowledge in an open world, but also on
"semantifying" different types of problems. But outside the Semantic Web
research community, there has been little uptake so far. This is also due t=
o
the fact that the concept of ontology is more about content than formalism,
and we are in dire need for content-related research and experiences. As [1=
]
stated, a "good" ontology is a balance of the degree of social agreement,
the level of formality, and the appropriateness for the problem at hand tha=
t
is supposed to be solved with ontologies. In line with this view, the
workshop is looking for experiences and empirical results on which formalis=
m
is better suited, how to achieve or measure social agreement, and how to
judge whether an ontology is appropriate. It is the mission of ! this
workshop to report on these e!
xperiences and to reflect them back to the Semantic Web community.

In the area of system design, there is currently a major shift taking place
towards user-centered design, and the workshop aims to foster use-centered
ontology-based system design. Therefore, we also welcome research and
experiences on participatory and evolutionary approaches (i.e., with a
continuously high degree of involvement of the actual users) to building an=
d
maintaining ontologies that pave the way towards a Web 3.0, bringing
together users and semantics.

We also strongly encourage to submit critical papers deriving lessons from
failures with "ontologies in the wild", not only stereotypical success
reports!

Collaborative and Work-Integrated Ontology Development: Evaluation Results
and Future Directions. In: Emergent Semantics and Ontology Evolution 2007 a=
t
ISWC 2007, Busan, Korea, 2007 Workshop Structure and Topics

The workshop will consists of three main parts: a general part on Web 3.0
and ontology engineering, a special track on ontologies in Human Resources
and a special track on ontologies in e-health and ambient-assisted living.

*Towards Web 3.0*
- Semantic Data Mashup
- lessons from Web 2.0 for ontology engineering
- participatory and evolutionary approaches to ontology engineering (e.g.,
based on social software)
- lightweight ontology formalisms (e.g., SKOS) and microformats
- challenges/requirements for the maintenance and evolution of ontologies
- experiences/empirical results on lightweight vs. heavy-weight ontologies
- experiences/empirical results on graphical modeling of ontologies
- good, best, and bad practices

*Methods for assessing ontologies*
- Ontology evaluation
- Quality measures for ontologies
- assessment of ontologies with regard to social agreement, formality, and
appropriateness
- experiences with assessment and evaluations methods

*Ontologies in Human Resources* (Recruiting, Development, Employability)
- modeling and representation of: Jobs, CVs, Competencies, Skills,
Employees, People, Organizations, Social Events, etc.
- HR upper level concepts
- E-Portfolio (standards) and ontologies
- Semantics of HR-XML
- Semantic metadata for HR applications
- Semantics in job matching
- Semantics in learning technologies
- Good/Best practices for semantics in HR
- Maintenance of ontologies in HR

*Ontologies in E-Health and Ambient Assisted Living* (AAL)
- Upper level concepts of healthcare and life sciences ontologies.
- Ontologies of diseases, nursing, therapeutics, drug, etc.
- Ontologies and ontology-driven approaches in Ambient-Assisted Living
- Maintenance of ontologies in e-health and AAL

If you feel that something fits into the theme of the workshop, but is not
listed here, just contact the organizers.
Submissions

Types of papers include:
- research papers (max. 10 pages)
- case studies experience reports (preferably from industry) (max. 10 pages=
)
- position papers, clearly analyzing current state of practice for future
challenges of research (max. 6 pages)

Papers will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer as part of OTM 2008
proceedings.

Papers submitted to OntoContent 2008 must not have been accepted for
publication elsewhere or be under review for another workshop or conference=
.
All submitted papers will be evaluated by at least three members of the
program committee, based on originality, significance, technical soundness,
and clarity of expression.

Papers will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer as part of OTM 2008
proceedings. Excellent papers will be considered for a journal publication
or as book chapters
