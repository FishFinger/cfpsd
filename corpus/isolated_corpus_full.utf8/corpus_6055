Meeting Description:

Subordinators are usually defined as markers which transform an autonomous,
syntactically structured sequence into a dependent unit. The terms traditio=
nally
considered as subordinators belong to various categories and have different
syntactic and semantic properties. Relative pronouns, for instance, are use=
d not
only to embed a clause into another, but have a syntactic function in the
embedded clause. Subordinating conjunctions, while not having a syntactic
function in the embedded clause, convey only a grammatical meaning or expre=
ss a
semantico-logical relation.

However, the identification of a subordinator or a class of subordinators a=
s
such does not rely on well-defined criteria. This is due not only to their
variety, but also to their frequently ambiguous or polysemous nature (e.g. =
que,
comme in French, ut, quod in Latin). Likewise, their position in the gramma=
r
depends on the adopted approach: from items which just relate two clauses, =
to
phrase heads in generative grammars.

This colloquium, organized by the Syntaxe et TAL team of the Laboratoire de
recherche sur le langage (EA 999), aims at contributing to the understandin=
g of
subordinators.=20

2nd Call for Papers
