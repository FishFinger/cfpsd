Linguistic Field(s): Discipline of Linguistics=20

Call Deadline: 20-Oct-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Laurence Horn's comprehensive and essential work A Natural History of Negat=
ion
(1989) reveals the interest on negation that has prevailed for the last 200=
0
years among linguists, and logicians and philosophers as well. Negation is =
still
an open realm of study in linguistics, if only given recent methods of data
investigation (research via corpora), or though the comparison of various
theories (for instance, formal versus functional), or the question of the
respective explanatory roles of syntax, semantics and pragmatics.=20

2nd Call for Papers=20

The aim of this conference is thus to bring together works pertaining to
negation, as well as anything related to opposition, contradiction and what=
 one
could name =AB contra-dicting =BB and refutation. Those papers will prefera=
bly bear
on as many languages as possible and will cover as many fields of linguisti=
cs as
possible. A few guiding lines are laid out below but do not intend to be
exhaustive:=20
a) lexical morphology=20
b) lexical semantics=20
c) Intra and interpropositional syntax, macrosyntax=20
d) Pragmatics and discourse analysis

Submission abstracts must be relatively expanded (2,5 to 3 pages, including
bibliography). They must be anonymous. Each abstract will be reviewed by tw=
o
readers.=20

The talks may bear on any language, and pertain to synchrony or diachrony.=

The proposals (in Word, OpenOffice, or PDF files) are to be submitted on th=
