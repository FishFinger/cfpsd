CALL FOR PAPERS


SPECIAL ISSUE: ONTOLOGY AND THEIR APPLICATIONS JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL
COMPUTER SCIENCE (J.UCS - http://www.jucs.org/)


After pursuing a long tradition of study in Philosophy, the term
"ontology" has become the new buzzword in computer science.  It
is receiving special attention not only from an active community of
researchers pertaining to many areas of informatics but also from the
industry, which is providing increasing budgets and investments to
develop this technology and make it available in business as soon as
possible.

There is at least one main reason for this recognition: ontologies
constitute the backbone of the Semantic Web, as they are responsible
for providing context to pages, thus promising to make a relevant part
of the Web contents understandable and processable by the
software. However, there are some challenging obstacles that should be
tackled to make ontologies wide-spread reputation shift from a promise
to a daily used technology. For instance, heterogeneity and evaluation
are two of these obstacles.

Following the realization of the Brazilian "Workshop on Ontologies and
their Applications" series (see http://www.ws.onto.ufal.br/ for the
first edition and http://www.icmc.usp.br/iarn2006/coevents/wonto.php
for

the second), we planned this Special Issue as a follow-up for the last
edition of the workshop, although by no means limited to its authors
or participants. With this Special Issue, we intend to enrich the
discussion on how to enhance ontologies' applicability, thus realizing
this promising technology in general, but also in specific settings,
such as e-business and e-commerce to name but a few.


Topics of Interest:
===================

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Ontology Engineering
- methodologies
- capture and learning
- management

Semantic consistency
- foundational ontologies
- upper-level ontologies
- evaluation methods, applications and problems

Semantic Interoperability
- composition and modularity
- merging, mapping and alignment
- ontology language interoperability

Enhancement of ontology applicability 
- linguistic ontologies applied to text processing
- patterns of ontologies for specific applications 

Ontologies for Information Sharing 
- ontology-based information integration
- mediators and brokers 
- agents and ontologies

Ontology Applications
- Semantic Web 
- knowledge management
- e-commerce, e-government 
- e-learning and e-science
- information retrieval


Submission procedure:
=====================

We encourage the submission of high-quality papers based on entirely
new work or surveys, both meeting the foci of the Special
Issue. Papers must be written in English and may have a length from 20
to 30 pages, including tables, figures, and references.

As for the format, papers must conform to the J.UCS style, formatted
in PDF (preferred) or PostScript. It is recommended that authors use
the J.UCS template files (see
http://www.jucs.org/ujs/jucs/info/submissions/style_guide.html for
formatting instructions) to minimize possible conflicts when preparing
the camera ready. Word and Latex J.UCS style samplers are provided in
http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/submissions.

Papers should be submitted electronically only to one of the guest
editors (see e-mail addresses below) up to the deadline (April
15,2007). Authors should not neglect that, together with the
camera-ready version of the paper, a Copyright Transfer Statement
(which can be downloaded from
http://www.jucs.org/ujs/jucs/info/submissions/copyright.html) must be
signed and sent/faxed by each author to Mrs Dana Kaiser, Manager of
the J.UCS, via web (dkaiser@iicm.tu-graz.ac.at) or by fax (+43 316 873
5699).

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by three qualified
reviewers/referees. Any other questions regarding papers submission
must also be directed to the guest editors.


Schedule:
=========
April     15 2007  - Submission due date
July       1 2007  - Notification of paper acceptance
September 15 2007  - Camera-ready paper due
October      2007  - Publication of the Special Issue
on Ontologies & their Applications
