Meeting Description:

Workshop on Nominal and Verbal Plurality
Friday  and Saturday, November 6-7 2009
Salle de conférences, CNRS Pouchet, 59 rue Pouchet, 75017 Paris.

The workshop is organized by the project
'Distributive dependencies : nominal and verbal plurality'
(CNRS, Fédération TUL). This project explores the parallels and
interactions between the nominal and the verbal domain
by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality,
and its morpho-syntactic manifestations across languages.


Invited speakers:
- Abdelkader Fassi-Fehri (University Mohammed V, Rabat)
- Susan Rothstein (Bar Ilan University) 

Call for Papers

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of
plurality are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of
event plurality and their interaction with argument plurality
(reciprocals, distributivity, 'pluractionals', plural nominalizations)
and the nature of cross-categorial plurality markers.

We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations (plus ten-minute
discussions). Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length (including
examples and references) written in French or English.

Abstracts must be anonymous and should be sent by e-mail (plain ASCII,
rtf, ps or pdf) to:

pcabredo //AT// univ-paris8.fr

Please write the (first) author's name plus the word 'abstract' in the
subject line of your message (e.g., 'Dupont abstract'), and include
author name(s), affiliation, contact information and the title of the
abstract in the body of the email.

For co-authored papers indicate the email address that we should use
for correspondence.

Abstracts should reach us by August 20, 2009.
