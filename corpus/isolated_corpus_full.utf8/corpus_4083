                 CALL FOR PAPERS
#####################################################################

2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on
Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT-09)

September 15-18, 2009, University of Milano - Bicocca, Milano, Italy

http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/

Sponsored By
IEEE Computer Society
Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC)
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

################################################################## #
(Papers Due: *** 10 April 2009 ***
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# by the IEEE Computer Society Press, which are indexed by EI.
##################################################################

IAT 2009 will provide a leading international forum to bring together
researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, such as computer
science, information technology, business, education, systems
engineering, and robotics, to (1) examine the design principles and
performance characteristics of various approaches in intelligent agent
technology, and (2) increase the cross-fertilization of ideas on the
development of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems among
different domains.  By encouraging idea-sharing and discussions on the
underlying logical, cognitive, physical, and sociological foundations as
well as the enabling technologies of intelligent agents, IAT 2008 will
foster the development of novel paradigms and advanced solutions in
agent-based computing.

IAT 2009 will be jointly held with the 2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Web Intelligence (WI-09).  The two conferences will have a
joint opening, keynote, reception, and banquet. Attendees only need to
register for one conference and can attend workshops, sessions, tutorials,
panels, exhibits and demonstrations across the two
conferences. We are also planning a joint panel, joint paper sessions, and
a doctoral mentoring program to discuss
common problems in the two areas.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On-Line Submissions and Publication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

High-quality papers in all IAT related areas are solicited.
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 8 pages in the IEEE
2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the Author
Guidelines of last year at
http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/AuthorKit.asp?Community=CPS&Facility=CPS_Dec&ERoom=WI%2DIAT+2008).
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee
on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.

Note that IAT'09 will accept ONLY on-line submissions, containing
PDF versions. Please use the Submission Form on the IAT'09
website to submit your paper. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that are indexed
by EI.

Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 8 pages in the
proceedings and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference.
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4
pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at the
conference than regular papers.

All co-authors will be notified at all time, for the submission,
notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper to
the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted, at
least one author should attend the conference to present the
paper. The acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published
on-line. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a
notification.

A selected number of IAT'09 accepted papers will be expanded and
revised for inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems:
An International Journal (http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and in
Annual Review of Intelligent Informatics
(http://www.wi-consortium.org/annual.html)

The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application paper.
Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the best
application paper award.

More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form will be found
on the IAT'09 homepage:
http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/IAT09/IAThome.htm.

++++++++++
Workshops
++++++++++

As an important part of the conference, the workshop program will
focus on new research challenges and initiatives.  All papers accepted for
workshops will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the
IEEE Computer Society Press that are indexed by EI, and will be available
at the workshops. Detailed information is available at the conference
homepage.

Note: we will not have a separate workshop registration fee
(i.e., conference registration covers everything).

++++++++++
Tutorials
++++++++++

IAT'09 also welcomes Tutorial proposals. IAT'09 will include tutorials
providing in-depth background on subjects that are of broad interest to
the Web intelligence community. Both short (2 hours) and long (half day)
tutorials will be considered. The tutorials will be part of the main
conference technical program. Detailed information is available at the
conference homepage.

Note: we will not have a separate tutorials registration fee
(i.e., only one conference registration covers everything).

++++++++++++++++++++
Industry/Demo-Track
++++++++++++++++++++

We solicit Industry/Demo-Track papers by the following methods.

(1) Industry papers of 4 pages can be submitted on the same schedule as
   the research track.
(2) Separate 2 page demo proposals can submitted at a later schedule. (3)
Full regular paper submissions can include a demo option.
   That is, a full paper submissions will be asked to
   specify if they would like to give a demonstration; choice of
   demonstrations (while utilizing information from the regular reviewing
process) will be selected based on value as a demonstration.

For options (1) and (2), more detailed instructions will be found at the
homepage: http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/IAT09/IAThome.htm
