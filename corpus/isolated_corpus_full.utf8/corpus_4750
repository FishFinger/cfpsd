Meeting Description:

This RaAM (Researching and Applying Metaphor) endorsed colloquium is a session
of 'Corpus Linguistics 2009' and constitutes the fourth in a series of workshops
or colloquia on corpus-based approaches to figurative language that have 
accompanied the biennial Corpus Linguistics conferences. This year's broad theme
will be the use corpora to explore variation and variability in metaphor. 

Call for Papers

Since the inception of the biennial Corpus Linguistics Conferences in 2001, we
have held an accompanying workshop/colloquium on Corpus-Based Approaches to
Figurative Language. We are continuing the tradition with the 5th Corpus
Linguistics Conference being held in Liverpool, UK, on the 20th-23rd July.

http://www.liv.ac.uk/english/CL2009/index.htm

Our workshop/colloquium will be taking place on Monday the 20th and this year we
are pleased to be able to say that the colloquium is being endorsed by RaAM
(Researching and Applying Metaphor) see http://www.raam.org.uk/Home.html

(See  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~amw/CorpusLinguistics05.html for details
of the last workshop and
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~amw/CorpusLinguisticsWorkshopProgramme.html
for links to the papers)

This year the theme will be variation and variability in metaphor. This is a
broad topic which could, for example, encompass papers looking at variation in
particular types of metaphor, such as temporal metaphors, across different
genres such as news items or personal blogs; degrees of entrenchment or
conventionality in metaphor, again possibly across different genres/registers,
and how to use a corpus to get at this information; the nature of mixed
metaphors; and other possibilities.

We therefore invite contributions to the colloquium, which will consist of 30
minute papers with 10 minutes discussion plus a poster session accompanied by
brief verbal introductions by the authors. There will also be a general
discussion period exploring the theme. Preference for the long papers will be
given to papers exploring the theme, but we will also accept good papers
examining any aspect of figurative language from a corpus-based perspective,
since we believe that participants who have undertaken good corpus-based studies
of a particular topic, but who have used only a single genre or corpus may find
fruitful interaction with other participants who have investigated similar
topics but used different genre. Such interaction would by itself be an
important contribution to the theme of variety and variability.

The selection of papers/posters will be made on the basis of a two page
abstract, with references, tables and diagrams being permitted on an extra page.
Abstracts may be submitted in either pdf or Microsoft Word or rtf, with a font
size of 12 and a Times or Times New Roman font. Margins must be reasonable so
that the abstracts can be printed without any problems.

Authors of successful papers will also be encouraged to write up their abstracts
as full 6-8 page papers for inclusion in the Colloquium Proceedings, which will
be published as a University of Birmingham Technical Report with an ISBN number
and made available at the colloquium. There will be no charge for these
proceedings for the participants. The papers will also be viewable on-line prior
to the colloquium. No further reviewing will be made of these full papers.

In the proceedings, there will be no distinction between papers and posters.
However, for a paper presentation at the colloquium, preference will be given to
submissions that adhere to the theme of variation and variability in metaphor. A
paper presentation slot will also only be given to those authors who have
written up their abstracts as full papers.

Dates
Two page abstracts by Sunday the 5th of April.
Notification of acceptance: Monday the 13th of April.
Full paper versions by Sunday the 5th of July.

We apologise for the fairly short notice, but the deadline for early
registration at Corpus Linguistics is the 19th of April.

Please send abstracts to
A.M.Wallington@cs.bham.ac.uk.

Selection and Organising Committee:
Alan Wallington, John Barnden, Mark Lee (School of Computer Science, University
of Birmingham)
Rosamund Moon, Jeanette Littlemore (School of English University of Birmingham)
Gill Philip (CILTA, Universit√† degli Studi di Bologna)
