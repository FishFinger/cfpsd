Final Call for Papers

The Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Hamburg and the Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Tuebingen are pleased to announce the Third International Conference ''Perspectives on Slavistics''.
The conference will take place in Hamburg, Germany, on August 28-31, 2008. The goals of the conference are to encourage the study of Slavic languages and literatures and to establish connections among scholars working in these areas. 

The following keynote speakers have accepted the invitation to present at 
the conference:
- Patrice Dabrowski, Harvard University (USA)
- Gerd Hentschel, University of Oldenburg (Germany)
- Mikhail Iampolski, New York University (USA)
- Marek Lazinski, University of Warsaw (Poland)
- Karel Oliva, Czech Academy of Sciences (Czech Republic)
- Danko Sipka, Arizona State University (USA)
- Galin Tihanov, University of Manchester (UK)

Submissions from any scholar working on Slavic languages or literatures are
welcomed, including those in Slavic departments, as well as in specialized
linguistics or literature departments. We particularly want to encourage young scholars to participate in this conference. Papers will be considered on topics relating to the diachronic or synchronic study of Slavic languages and literatures from any theoretical perspective. 

There will be a special session on Electronic Resources of Slavic Languages. 
The aim of the special session is to provide a forum for exchange of information regarding the recent developments in the composition and design, construction and use of different types of resources for Slavic languages. We encourage submissions reporting on, but not limited to:
- corpora (large and small, general and genre-specific, annotated and non-annotated, single language and parallel corpora, spoken and written language corpora, treebanks);
- wide-coverage grammars;
- computational lexicons, electronic terminology databases, dictionaries (mono- and multilingual);
- speech collections;
- wordnets, framenets, ontologies;
- tools for acquisition, construction, annotation and management of language resources.

Each paper submitted to the conference will be allowed thirty minutes (including 10 minutes for discussion). Presentations should be in English in order to open the conference up to researchers working on non-Slavic languages and literatures. Data projectors and overhead projectors will be provided upon request. The deadline for submissions is March, 31, 2008 (submission information and abstract specifications see below). 

The participation fee will be 80 euros (40 euros for graduate students and passive participants), to be paid in advance. Detailed information on payment options and local arrangements will be provided by May 2008. The participation fee covers the abstract booklet, other conference materials, refreshments and snacks. 

Submission information and abstract specifications:
Abstracts for 20 minute talks (plus 10 minute discussion) should:
- be anonymous;
- not exceed 500 words (plus an additional page for tables, figures and references,  if necessary);
- use one-column format, Times New Roman, 12pt, single-spacing;
- use the international transcription of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters;
- be in Adobe PDF format (please do include all fonts in PDF documents).

Your abstract should present a hypothesis and outline your plan for defending that hypothesis, i.e., it should specify research question(s), an approach / method to the data, and obtained results. Each abstract will be anonymously reviewed by independent reviewers.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair Conference Manager at: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pos3
