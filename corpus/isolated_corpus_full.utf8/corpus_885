2nd Call for Abstracts

Corpus Linguistics 2007 Colloquium: 
Towards a reference corpus of web genres


COLLOQUIUM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES

Genres of spoken and written texts are being intensively studied from var=
ious angles, e.g., communication studies, discourse analysis, computation=
al linguistics, without arriving at a generally accepted definition. The =
web is new, so it is not clear how to apply traditional notions of genre =
to web pages. In this colloquium we would like collect submissions that s=
tudy characteristics of web genres with respect to traditional paper genr=
es represented in electronic corpora like the BNC. 

Web documents are often characterised by a high level of genre hybridism,=
 by a fragmentation of
textuality across several documents, by the impact of technical features =
such as hyperlinking, posting facilities and multi-authoring. The web is =
a huge reservoir of documents that can be easily mined for building all s=
orts of corpora with many collections being built according to subjective=
 criteria for
corpus composition, genre annotation, genre representativeness and genre =
granularity. In this colloquium we would like to invite submissions contr=
ibuting to a reference corpus of web genres. The main goal of the colloqu=
ium is to draw up an initial list of characteristics and requirements for=
 building, annotating and evaluation reference corpora of web genres. For=

instance:

* To what extent should genre hybridism and authorial creativity be repre=
sented in a genre collection? These two phenomena appear to be very  comm=
on on the web.
* To what extent is it possible to include "emerging genres", i.e., genre=
s still in a transitional phase in genre evolution? The web is currently =
thriving with emerging genres.
* How many granularities of the unit of analysis should be included? Only=
 genres representing web sites? Only genre representing web pages? Both? =

* What "format" should be used to store these units in a collection (e.g.=
, a database-like form, DOM trees, a net of graphs, in HTML format, in a =
text-only version, with or without embedded images, removing boilerplate =
components)?
* What level of genre granularity and similarity should be applied in the=
 reference corpus? Genre collections often show different levels of   gra=
nularity, including genres and super-genres. Should similar genres, such =
as "tutorial" and "how-to", be accounted for separately? 

TOPICS:

The topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Text theory for the development of web corpora
- Modelling corpora of web genres
- Innovative genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and =
no-genre web documents
- Modelling genre annotation scheme for web documents (metadata organizat=
ion)
- Assembling a list of web genres for a reference corpus
- Creating comparable corpora of web genre 
- Automatic genre classification vs. human genre classification
- How to evaluate the corpus: using statistical measures, relying on corp=
us linguists, librarians, or web users?

PARTICIPATION

The aim of this colloquium, the first ever organized on this topic, is to=
 bring together researchers from different communities such as corpus lin=
guistics, genre analysis, digital genre community, computational linguist=
ics, and information retrieval in order to promote the discussion and dev=
elopment of new ideas and methods to create new corpora for language
studies and as evaluation resources.

The deadline for submissions is Dec 15, 2006
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by Jan 11, 2006

*LOCATION*:
The colloquium will take place in the UK at the end of July 2007. The ven=
ue and the exact date of the colloquium will be announced at the end of J=
anuary 2007.
