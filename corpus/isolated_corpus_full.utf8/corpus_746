Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Description 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this conference is to compare recent experiences in mother tongue education in two distinct but at times intersecting contexts: the context of indigenous communities in Latin American countries and Caribbean Creole communities.  Three main sections are proposed:
1. Educational Planning and IBE;
2. Language Policy and Language Rights; 
3. Empowerment through Language Development. 

Second Call for Papers

Call deadline: November 15th, 2006

24.4. - 26.4.2007 

Language and mother tongue education: From policies to classroom experiences

What's new in Latin America and the Caribbean?

State-bound intercultural bilingual education (IBE) was first developed in Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s in an effort to meet pressing educational needs in countries with large indigenous populations such as Bolivia, Ecuador and Guatemala. IBE, an educational model based on the use of the mother tongue of the children, additionally contains a strong socio-cultural component that makes minority language teaching and teaching in the minority language more effective and meaningful, thus contributing to the empowerment of the speakers. 

In Nicaragua, the Law 571 on Education in the Languages of the Atlantic Coast (1980) led, first, to a literacy campaign in the native languages of the region (1980) and later to the establishment of a bilingual education program (1984/5). The 1987 Law of Autonomy, a unique model in the Latin-American context, provided a legal framework for the educational process at large.

Caribbean Creole communities, albeit likewise speaking minorized languages, have only recently started to catch onto educational models comparable to IBE. This is at least in part due to their even more conflictual self perceptions as distinct groups: while Latin American indigenous communities were for a long time considered to represent undesirable cultures and languages which should be given up for the benefits of the socio-politically dominant language, Creole communities were led to believe they had nothing of their own, just deformations of the dominant languages and cultures. The case of Nicaragua can be considered as an exception in the sense that, along with the indigenous languages Miskitu and Sumu-Mayangna, Creole was incorporated into the original IBE program. It is fair to say, however, that although pro-Creole ideology was behind the program and Creole teachers carried it out, the materials were elaborated in English as the language had not been standardized.

The aim of this conference is to compare recent experiences in mother tongue education in two distinct but at times intersecting contexts: the context of indigenous communities in Latin American countries and Caribbean Creole communities. This main focus on mother tongue education and IBE requires, however, that we also examine the language policies and the state of the art in language planning which allow for the enacting of such curricula. 

We are inviting contributions of 20 minutes, to be followed by 10 minutes of discussion. The official languages of the conference are English, Spanish, and English-based creoles. The fact that only English-based creoles are cited as official languages reflects the venue of the conference, not the Creole communities to be treated in individual papers. Please submit an electronic abstract of approximately one page to one of the two addresses below. If you are unable to send the abstract as an attachment (word or rtf), you may paste it into the body of the e-mail message. Alternatively, you may send us a hard copy through ordinary mail. 

The final deadline for sending in abstracts is November 15th, 2006. Based on the number of submissions, the organizers will review the feasibility of organizing the conference during the dates indicated or post-posing it.
