              ACL 2005 WORKSHOP ON
 
    COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO SEMITIC LANGUAGES
 
         University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

 WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION
 ====================
 
 The Semitic family includes many languages and dialects spoken by a large
 number of native speakers (around 300 Million). However, Semitic languages
 are still understudied. The most prominent members of this family are
 Arabic
 and its dialects, Hebrew, Amharic, Aramaic, Maltese and Syriac. Beyond
 their
 shared ancestry which is apparent through pervasive cognate sharing, a
 common characteristic of these languages is the rich and productive
 pattern-based morphology and similar syntactic constructions.
 
 An increasing body of computational linguistics work is starting to appear
 for both Arabic and Hebrew. Arabic alone, as the largest member of the
 Semitic family, has been receiving a lot of attention lately in terms of
 dedicated workshops and conferences. These include, but are not limited
 to,
 the workshop on Arabic Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2002), a
 special session on Arabic processing in Traitement Automatique du Langage
 Naturel (TALN 2004), the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Arabic
 Script-based Languages (COLING 2004), and the NEMLAR Arabic Language
 Resources and Tools Conference in Cairo, Egypt (2004). This phenomenon has
 been coupled with a relative surge in resources for Arabic due to
 concerted
 efforts by the LDC and ELDA/ELRA. However, there is an apparent lag in the
 development of resources and tools for other Semitic languages. Often,
 work
 on individual Semitic languages, unfortunately, still tends to be done
 with
 limited awareness of ongoing research in other Semitic languages. Within
 the
 last four years, only three workshops addressed Semitic languages: an ACL
 2002 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages and an MT
 Summit IX Workshop on Machine Translation for Semitic Languages in 2003,
 and
 the EAMT 2004, held in Malta, had a special session on Semitic languages.
 
 This workshop is a sequel to the ACL 2002 workshop and shares its goals
 of:
 
 (i) heightening awareness amongst Semitic-language researchers of shared
 breakthroughs and challenges,
 (ii) highlighting issues common to all Semitic languages as much as
 possible,
 (iii) encouraging the potential for developing coordinated approaches; and
 (iv) in addition, leveraging resource and tool creation for less prominent
 members of the Semitic language family.
 
 
 WORKSHOP TOPICS
 ===============
 
 We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues:
 
 - Computational approaches to phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and
 pragmatics of Semitic languages
 - Applications for Semitic languages such as, but not limited to, machine
 translation, summarization and information retrieval
 - Tools for processing of Semitic languages (e.g. POS taggers, parsers,
 etc.)
 - Empirical studies of unique/specific phenomena in Semitic languages
 - Creating computational resources for Semitic languages
 - Comparative computational studies of Semitic languages
 - Leveraging resources in other languages (Semitic or other) to create
 resources and tools for Semitic languages
 
 While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics, or related
 issues, we particularly welcome work involving Semitic languages with
 scarce
 resources.
 
 
 WORKSHOP FORMAT
 ===============
 
 
 The workshop will last for one day, June 29th, and will consist of:
 
 - An invited talk (by Salim Roukos, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center)
 - Several sessions of regular paper presentations
 - A panel discussion drawing on aspects of the participating papers and
 their implications for future collaboration and coordination
 
 
 
 SUBMISSION INFORMATION
 ======================
 
Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages, formatted
following the ACL 2005 guidelines
(http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles). All submissions must
be anonymous. Authors are requested to prepare their manuscripts in a
manner which disguises their identities, affiliation status, etc. Typically,
this means (1) omitting names and affiliations from the title page; (2)
refraining from excessive self-citation in the bibliography; and (3)omitting
explicit references the authors' previous work in the text body.
Please send submissions in either .pdf or .ps form. Both submission and
review processes will be handled electronically. 

For submissions we are using the START system,
http://www.softconf.com/start/ACLSemLang05/submit.html

In a separate email with subject SemCL05 please send names of Authors and
name of contact person. We are pursuing the possibility of publishing a
selection of accepted papers in a journal special issue on Semitic
computational linguistics.
