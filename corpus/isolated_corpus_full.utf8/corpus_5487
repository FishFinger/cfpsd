Full Title: JALT CALL Journal 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics;Computational Linguistics;Language Acquisition;Sociolinguistics;Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2009 

The JALT CALL Journal is one of the leading peer-reviewed international
CALL journals and is published three times per year. Following on from its
very successful conference last week, which saw 126 presentations from nine
countries, it is now publishing a special issue on the topic of 'CALL and
the Learner'. 

We are inviting contributions in one of the following areas:

Learner motivation
Computer-mediated communication (with a focus on the role of the learner)
Learners' beliefs in CALL
(Materials development for) individualising instruction 
Social networking and computer games and second language acquisition 
Mobile-assisted language learning
Supporting out-of-class language learning 
Teacher education for CALL

Submitted papers will need to make a link with the theme of the special
issue which ties in with that of the AILA Research Network for CALL and the
Learner, which was recently launched. More information about the network
and its background can be found here: www.callandthelearner.info

Prospective authors are encouraged to read the information about the aims
and scope of the network in order to ensure their contributions fit with
this theme. 

Papers are due by September 30.

More information about the journal and guidelines for the submission of
papers can be found here:
www.jaltcall.org/journal/

For questions about submitting papers or the publication process, please
contact the guest editor, Hayo Reinders at 'jaltcall at
innovationinteaching dot org'. 

We look forward to your paper submissions! 

Kind regards
