Meeting Description

Architexture: Textual and Architectural Spaces
15-17th April 2008, University of Strathclyde

A collaboration between the Departments of Architecture and English Studies

This interdisciplinary conference investigates the relationships between
architectural and textual constructions of space. It will explore the influence
of spatial theories within texts; consider how writers evoke and represent a
sense of place; and invite new perspectives on the aesthetic, physical, and
social functions of texts in the design, production and consumption of the built
environment. The social and performance events - to include a champagne
reception at the City Chambers, a walking tour of the Necropolis, a trip down
the Clyde, and visits to the old industrial and residential areas of the city -
will encourage participants to reflect on the connections between their
'academic' and other uses of text and space. 

Call for Papers

We welcome a wide range of disciplinary theorisations of the concepts of text
and space, literature and architecture. This international event aims to bring
together scholars, linguists, artists, architects, writers, urban planners and
filmmakers and many other interested individuals and organisations. We are happy
to accept contributions in any media. Proposals for 20-minute presentations and
10-minute A2 poster sessions, focused around the following Architextural themes
are invited. The accompanying questions are merely suggestive of some of the
themes that could be addressed:

Different Genres
What are the differences in the way in which novelists, poets, journalists, and
travel writers treat the subject of space in their work? How do the attempts of
architects and planners to construct a narrative of space differ between urban,
suburban and rural contexts? What if any are the methodological similarities
between the ways an architect or writer works when constructing a spatial narrative?

Historical Movements	
Movements like classicism, modernism, romanticism, and post-colonialism are
categories that are common to both architectural and literary history. How do
they relate to each other and how are notions of space dealt with within each
movement? What for instance are the connections between modernism in literature
and in architecture? How does nineteenth century romanticism relate to
eclecticism in architecture?

Public and Private Lives
The distinctions between what we understand by private and public space are
often confusing. How do architects, planners and writers tackle issues like
domesticity and the creation of private worlds? How do they tackle the
development of narrative forms in the public realm in places devoted to retail
or tourism? How have designers and writers addressed issues of memory and identity?

Notational Systems
How have the development of new technology and communication systems blurred the
boundaries between different creative disciplines? How are texts and narratives
transcribed from one discipline into another? Are there parallels between the
ways in which writers and architects experiment with form and meaning?

Abstracts of Papers (300 words max.) should be submitted by 30th January 2008,
by email to architexture@strath.ac.uk. Final draft of papers submitted for
publication by Monday 13th August 2008. Check the conference website:
www.architexture.info for further information and downloads.

Meeting Description

WoLLIC is an annual international forum on inter-disciplinary research involving
formal logic, computing and programming theory, and natural language and
reasoning. Each meeting includes invited talks and tutorials as well as
contributed papers. 

Call for Papers

15th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation
(WoLLIC 2008)
Edinburgh, Scotland
July 1-4, 2008

The Fifteenth WoLLIC will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from July 1 to July 4,
2008. It is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL), the Interest
Group in Pure and Applied Logics (IGPL), the European Association for Logic,
Language and Information (FoLLI), the European Association for Theoretical
Computer Science (EATCS), the Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC), and the
Sociedade Brasileira de Logica (SBL).

Paper Submission
Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular interest in
cross-disciplinary topics. Typical but not exclusive areas of interest are:
foundations of computing and programming;
novel computation models and paradigms; 
broad notions of proof and belief;
formal methods in software and hardware development; logical approach to natural
language and reasoning; 
logics of programs, actions and resources;
foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing, and
protection.

Proposed contributions should be in English, and consist of a scholarly
exposition accessible to the non-specialist, including motivation, background,
and comparison with related works. They must not exceed 10 pages (in font 10 or
higher), with up to 5 additional pages for references and technical appendices.
The paper's main results must not be published or submitted for publication in
refereed venues, including journals and other scientific meetings.
It is expected that each accepted paper be presented at the meeting by one of
its authors. Papers must be submitted electronically at
www.cin.ufpe.br/~wollic/wollic2008/instructions.html
A title and single-paragraph abstract should be submitted by
February 24, and the full paper by March 2 (firm date).
Notifications are expected by April 13, and final papers for the proceedings
will be due by April 27 (firm date).

Proceedings
The proceedings of WoLLIC 2008, including both invited and contributed papers,
will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume in Springer's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (tbc). In addition, abstracts will be published in the
Conference Report section of the Logic Journal of the IGPL, and selected
contributions will be published as a special post-conference WoLLIC 2008 issue
of the Journal of Logic and Computation (tbc).

Invited Speakers
Olivier Danvy (BRICS)
Anuj Dawar (Cambridge, UK)
Makoto Kanazawa (Nat Inst of Informatics, Japan)
Mark Steedman (Edinburgh U)
Henry Towsner (CMU)
(more to come...)
