Meeting Description:

CBA-2008:  'Corpus-Based Approaches To Coreference Resolution In Romance
Languages' 13-15 November 2008

Deadline for abstract submission: Thursday September 25, 2008
Workshop location: Universitat de Barcelona.
Workshop Email: cba2008@ub.edu 

Universitat de Barcelona and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya begin a series
of workshops devoted to Corpus-based Approaches to Discourse Analysis - CBA
Workshops. We are particularly interested in innovative perspectives on the use
and exploitation of corpora in going one step beyond the state of the art.

The first workshop in this series, CBA-2008, will focus on 'Coreference
Resolution in Romance Languages'.

This workshop aims to exploit annotated data in order to make the most of
machine learning techniques for coreference resolution. For coreference we
understand identifying the full chain of mentions for each entity in the
discourse, rather than pairs of antecedent-anaphor. We believe there is a need
to bring together linguists and computer scientists, and we invite unpublished
contributions which relate to issues of this field with a special emphasis on -
though not limited to - Romance languages. 

Topics of interest:
- Exploring techniques/strategies for collecting better data in this area
- Studies of relevant features for coreference resolution
- Studies of knowledge sources for coreference resolution and strategies for
inferring useful linguistic cues
- ML algorithms of coreference resolution
- Learning features from annotated/raw corpora
- Portability of English coreference resolution systems to Romance languages

- Abstracts should be anonymous, clearly titled and no more than 500 words in
length. Text of abstract should fit on one page, with a second page for
examples, figures, or references. Abstracts longer than 500 words will be
rejected without being evaluated. 
- Please note the word count at the bottom of the abstract. Note that word
counts should not include the abstract title, figure or table titles, examples,
or the list of references.
- A suggested format and style for abstracts is available at:
http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/template.html
- Three examples of how to formulate the content of the abstract can be found at:
http://www.lsadc.org/info/dec02bulletin/model.html
http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/bucholtz/sociocultural/abstracttips.html
http://www.ulcl.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=5&c=124
- The criteria used by the reviewers to evaluate abstracts can be found at:
http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/reviewprocess.html#rate
- All abstracts must be submitted as PDF documents. Specific instructions for
how to create PDF documents are available at:

If you encounter a problem creating a PDF file, please contact us for further
assistance.
Please use the first author's last name as the file name (eg. Smith.pdf). No
author information should appear anywhere in the contents of the PDF file itself.

Submission Instructions:
- Electronic submission: To facilitate the abstract submission process,
abstracts will be submitted using the form available at the conference website
at  http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/abstract.htm.
- Specific instructions for abstract submission are available on this website.
- Contact information for each author must be submitted via webform. No author
information should appear anywhere in the abstract PDF.
- At the time of submission you will be asked whether you would like your
abstract to be considered for a poster, a paper, or both. Note that this
preference is not revealed to the reviewers, and thus is not considered in the
review process. 
- Although each author may submit as many abstracts as desired, we will accept
for presentation by each author: (a) a maximum of 1 first authored paper/poster,
and (b) a maximum of 2 papers/posters in any authorship status. Note that no
changes in authorship (including deleting an author or changing author order)
will be possible after the review process is completed or for publication in the
conference proceedings.

Deadline:

- Late abstracts will not be considered, whatever the reason for the delay.
- We regret that we cannot accept abstract submissions by fax or email.
- Submissions via surface mail will only be accepted in special circumstances,

deadline (May 15, 2008) to make these arrangements.

Abstract Selection:
- Each abstract is blind reviewed by 5 reviewers from a panel of approximately
180 international scholars. Further information about the review process is
available at  http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/reviewprocess.html.
- Acknowledgment of receipt of the abstract will be sent by email as soon as
possible after receipt. Notice of acceptance or rejection will be sent to first
authors only, in early August, by email. Pre-registration materials and
preliminary schedule will be available in late August 2008.
- If your abstract is accepted, you will need to submit a 150-word abstract
including title, author(s) and affiliation(s) for inclusion in the conference
handbook. Guidelines will be provided along with notification of acceptance.
- Abstracts accepted as papers will be invited for publication in the BUCLD
Proceedings.
- Abstracts accepted as posters will be invited for publication online only, but
not in the printed version.
- All conference papers will be selected on the basis of abstracts submitted.
Although each abstract will be evaluated individually, we will attempt to honor
requests to schedule accepted papers together in group sessions. 
- No schedule changes will be possible once the schedule is set. Scheduling
requests for religious reasons only must be made before the review process is
complete (i.e. at the time of submission). A space is provided on the abstract
