Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 05-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The aim of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers involved in
the building of electronic dictionaries to discuss modifications of existing
resources in line with the users' needs (i.e. how to capitalize on the
advantages of the digital form). Given the breadth of the questions, we welcome
reports on work from many perspectives, including, but not limited to,
linguistics, computer science, psycholinguistics, language learning, and
ergonomics. We request that contributions address computational aspects. 

Call for Papers

What are people looking for when they use a dictionary? What strategies do they
use for search? What do people know before they start? These questions concern
the cognitive aspects of the lexicon, and their answers should guide the design
of online dictionaries.

Many people believe in the virtues of completeness. Yet, the quality of a
dictionary depends not only on coverage (number of entries) and granularity, but
also on accessibility of information. Access strategies vary with the task (text
understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of
consultation (word, concept, sound). Unlike readers who look for meanings,
writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper
dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing
information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via
multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse access routes.
Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual-lexical space, and the results are
displayable in a multitude of forms (as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted
alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).

Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language
technology to build and to maintain the resource. But access to the potential
wealth in dictionaries remains limited for the common user. Yet, the new
possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility
(multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are enormous. We have not even realized
their full potential yet. More than just allowing electronic versions of
paper-bound dictionaries, computers provide a freedom for rethinking
dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedia, etc., a distinction necessary in the past
for economical reasons, but no longer justified anymore. The goal of this
workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic
dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different
resources, as well as to explore the feasability of taking the user's needs,
knowledge and access strategies into account.

Topics:

For this workshop, we solicit papers addressing any of the following issues:

1. Conceptual input of a dictionary user: what is present in speakers'/writers'
minds when they are generating a message and looking for a (target) word? Does
the user have in mind conceptual primitives, semantically related words, some
type of partial definition, something like synsets, or something completely
different?

2. Access, navigation and search strategies: we would like to be able to access
entries by word form but also by meaning and sounds (syllables). Even if input
is given in an incomplete, imprecise or degraded form. The more precise the
conceptual input, the less navigation should be needed and vice versa. How can
we create local search spaces, and provide a user with the tools for navigating
within them?

3. Indexing words and organizing the lexicon: Words and concepts can be
organized in many ways, varying according to typology and conceptual systems.
For example, words are traditionally organized alphabetically in Western
languages, but by semantic radicals and stroke counts in Chinese. The way how
words and concepts are organized affects indexing and access. Indexing must
robustly allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. What efficient
organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access? What about
lexical entry standardization? Are universal definitions possible? What about
efforts such as the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) and other global structures
for the lexicon? Can ontologies be combined with standards for the lexicon?

4. NLP Applications: Contributors can also address the issue of how such
enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost
performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems such as those
evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered
in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or
translation.

Important Dates:
Paper Submission Deadline: 5th May
Notification of Acceptance: 6th June
Camera-Ready Papers Due: 1st July
Workshop: 24th August

Submission Instructions:
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work on the topic areas of
the workshop. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, should be avoided.

Submitted papers should be no longer than eight (8) pages, 4 in the case of
project reports (including data, tables, figures, and references).
Please include a one-paragraph abstract of the entire work (about 200 words) and
use the Coling 2008 LaTeX or MS Word style sheets
(http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/harold.somers/coling/style.html).
Submission will be electronic (pdf format only) via the START paper submission
webpage: https://www.softconf.com/coling08/CAL08/submit.html
