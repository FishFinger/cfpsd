We are very pleased to announce the ACM International Conference on =
Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI08) - Canary Islands, Spain, January =
13th-16th 2008
      =20
IUI 2008 will focus on **interface innovation**. We're most interested =
in truly new ideas about how people and computers could interact. If =
you've got a new idea about how to make interfaces smarter, easier to =
use, and more effective, we want to hear it!

We are inviting proposals and research papers in several categories:

    Due Date:      =20
    Monday Oct 1 '07       Long and Short Papers
    Monday Aug 27 '07    Workshop and Tutorial Proposals


General Chair:
    Steffen Staab
    Universitat Koblenz-Landau, Germany

Program Chairs:
    Jeffrey Bradshaw
    Institute of Human and Machine Cognition, U.S.A.

    Henry Lieberman
    Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A.

Why submit to IUI?
------------------
IUI is where the community of people interested in Human-Computer =
Interaction (HCI) meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. =
We're also very interested in contributions from related fields, such as =
psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc. Unlike =
traditional AI, our focus is not so much to make the computer smart all =
by itself, but to make the interaction between computers and people =
smarter. Unlike traditional HCI, we're more willing to consider =
solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge, heuristics, and =
emerging technologies such as natural language understanding or gesture =
recognition.


The IUI conference gives you a chance to present and to see work in an =
intimate, focused, no-nonsense event. It is large enough to be diverse =
and lively (we expect 150-200 people), but small enough to avoid the =
circus-like atmosphere of conferences with thousands of people. The vast =
majority of the attendees are actively involved with conceiving and =
developing cutting-edge interfaces leading to a high and fast impact of =
research results presented at IUI. It brings together people from =
academics, industry, and nonprofits. As an ACM conference, papers appear =
in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices. There will also be a =
journal publication path for selected papers. It's a single track =
conference, so you don't have to miss anything. And it's always in a =
beautiful place, in January!


IUI topics include, but are not limited=20
- Natural language and speech input and ouput;
- Example and programming based interfaces;
- Personalization, collaboration, and recommender systems;
- Interfaces that learn, teach, provide feedback, or adapt to the user;
- AI techniques such as planning and reasoning in interfaces;
- Knowledge-based systems;
- Intelligent Visualization;
- Gesture, attention, and face recognition;
- Affective computing, social computing, and aesthetic computing;
- Ubiquitous computing, ambient computing, and tangible computing;
- Novel methods for, and novel results of, evaluating intelligent user =
interfaces.
