Meeting Description:
Plurality, Unity, and Structure in Semantics

One-day workshop organized within the Chaire d'Excellence
'Ontological Structure and Semantic Structure'

This workshop addresses questions concerning the unity, plurality, and
structure of objects of reference, such as
[1] do plurals (and perhaps mass NPs) stand for single collective entities
or do they, in some way, stand for several individuals at the same time?
[2] can semantics just do with mereological composition or what kind of
nonmereological composition or structure is needed and perhaps
independently justified?

Selection Committee:
Nicholas Asher (IRIT Toulouse, University of Texas, Austin), Manfred Krifka
(Humboldt University), Friederike Moltmann (IHPST, Paris), Rick Nouwen
(University of Utrecht), Gabriel Uzquiano (Oxford University), Philippe
Schlenker (IJN Paris, UCLA)

Plurality, Unity, and Structure in Semantics

One-day workshop organized within the Chaire d'Excellence
'Ontological Structure and Semantic Structure'

October 3, 2007

Since the seminal work of Link, Boolos, and others, recent research in
linguistics and philosophy has undergone various shifts of interest that
this workshop aims to bring together. For example, recent descriptive work
on plurals and mass has concerned itself also with their relation to
kind-denoting NPs as well as with modifiers that make reference to the part
structure of an entity independently of the categories of plural and mass
(such as 'whole', 'together', 'completely'). Moreover, in dynamic semantics
there has been a move away from postulating plural entities in the models
to uses of concurrent and structured assignments. Finally, in philosophy,
new approaches to plurals without plural entities have been explored as
well as to questions concerning the structure and 'pluralization' of
complex or dependent objects such as propositions, facts, states, tropes,
and 'qua objects'.
This workshop welcomes submissions in any of those areas for a
thirty-minute talk. Please send an anonymous abstract (two pages maximum
including references), together with a separate page containing title,
author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address to:

plurality@univ-paris1.fr - under construction

Time: October 3, 2007 (inbetween Ealing and CSSP)
location: Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, 45 rue d'Ulm,
