Announcement of Data Release and Second Call for Participation

                      Second i2b2 Shared-Task and Workshop
          Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data
         Obesity Challenge (A Shared-Task on Obesity): Who's obese and  
what
   co-morbidities do they (definitely/likely) have?

                          Data Release: 15 March, 2008
                          Evaluation: 23-25 June, 2008
                      Paper Submission: 1 September, 2008
                  Workshop: 7 November, 2008 in Washington, DC

   Organizer: Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside,
   i2b2, a National Center for Biomedical Computing
   Website: https://www.i2b2.org/NLP

The obesity challenge is a multi-class, multi-label classification task
focused on obesity and its co-morbidities. The data for the challenge
consist of discharge summaries from Partners Healthcare. All records  
have
been fully de-identified. Obesity information and co-morbidities have  
been
marked at a document level as present, absent, questionable, or
unmentioned in the documents. For each patient, both textual judgments,
i.e., what the text explicitly states about obesity and co-morbidities,
and intuitive judgments, i.e., what the text implies about obesity and
co-morbidities, are provided. The goal of the challenge is to evaluate
systems on their ability to recognize whether a patient is obese and  
what
co-morbidities they exhibit.

The obesity challenge opened to preregistration on February 1, 2008.
Training data for the challenge will be released in installments; the
first installment will be released on March 15, 2008. The rest of the
installments will follow soon after. Test data are scheduled to be
released for only three days and will be used only for evaluation
purposes. The results of the challenge will be presented at the workshop
organized by i2b2.

Evaluation Dates, File Formats, and Evaluation Metrics.

The obesity challenge evaluation will be on only the test data. Each  
team
is allowed to upload up to three system runs. System output is  
expected in
the form of standoff annotations, following the exact format of the  
ground
truth annotations provided by i2b2. Precision, recall, and f-measure  
will
be used as evaluation metrics.

Participants are asked to submit a short paper describing their system  
and
analyzing their performance. Authors of top performing systems and of
particularly novel approaches will be invited to present or demo their
systems at the workshop.
