                    FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS: KR 2008
                 Eleventh International Conference on
         Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

              Sydney, Australia, September 16 - 19, 2008

               Collocated with NMR-08, ICAPS-08, CP-08

           The single registration fee includes attendance
                  to most events for all conferences
                                   
                      http://www.kr.org/KR2008/
                                   
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) is a vibrant and
exciting field of human endeavour. KR&R techniques are key drivers of
innovation in computer science, and they have led to significant
advances in practical applications in a wide range of areas from
Artificial Intelligence to Software Engineering.

Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by reasoning engines
are an integral and crucial component of intelligent systems. Semantic
Web technologies, the design of software agents and Bio-Informatics
technologies, in particular, provide significant challenges for KR&R.

We intend KR2008 to be a forum for the exchange of new ideas, issues,
and results among the community of researchers in the principles and
practices of KR&R systems. We encourage papers presenting substantial
new results in the principles of KR&R systems that clearly contribute
to the formal foundations or show the applicability of the results to
implemented or implementable systems.  We also encourage ``reports
from the field" of building knowledge bases, applications,
experiments, developments, and tests. Such papers should be explicitly
identified as reports from the field by the authors, to ensure
appropriate reviewing, and should include a section on evaluation.

Papers must be submitted in AAAI style (pdf only)

                      http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php

Paper length is 7 pages maximum including title, author information
and references.  Authors may add to the paper an optional, clearly
marked Appendix containing technical material (such as proofs,
evaluation results etc.)  supporting claims made in the paper. The
Appendix must not exceed 2 additional pages in AAAI style. The
evaluation of the submission will be based on the quality of the
paper. The optional Appendix will be used in case reviewers are in
doubt about claimed results.

Submission will be through the Easychair conference management system

                 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=KR-2008

Conference proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. Final versions
of papers will be considerably longer than the submissions: for each
accepted paper 11 pages in AAAI style will be allocated in the
proceedings.

Topics of interest include:

- Exception tolerant and inconsistency-tolerant reasoning,  
  Paraconsistent logics
- Nonmonotonic logics, Default logics, Conditional logics,
  Argumentation
