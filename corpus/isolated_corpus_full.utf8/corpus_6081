Meeting Description:

Young Linguists' Meeting in Pozna? 2010
YLMP2010, 23-25 April 2010, Pozna?, Poland
http://ylmp.pl
ylmp@ifa.amu.edu.pl

Young Linguists' Meeting in Pozna? (YLMP) is a conference organised by and for
young linguists who appreciate the significance of interdisciplinary research
and therefore want to go beyond the traditional branches of linguistics. We
believe that the connection between linguistics and other fields of study, such
as psychology or sociology, is both crucial and pervasive. Our goal is to
present the advantages of an integrated approach and emphasize its importance
for contemporary linguistic research. 

The meeting which was held in 2009 was intended to be the first of a series of
annual meetings. It was meant as a forum for discussion for all those who were
interested in language and its connections with other fields of modern science.
The idea came from the then M.A. student ?ukasz Paku?a, who since then has been
collaborating with members of the IFA staff and his fellow students, Ma?gorzata
Trojan, Dorota Jaworska and ?ukasz Kozanowski, in the organisation of YLMP. 

Call for Papers

We are happy to announce that the Young Linguists' Meeting in Pozna? (YLMP2010)
will take place on 23-25 April 2010 in Pozna?, Poland. The Meeting will be

Submissions:
The leitmotif of the YLMP2010 will be "Linguistics: A separate branch or an
integrated field of science? Recent trends in linguistic research".  Proposals

linguistics, are invited.

The conference is addressed to students who are enrolled in a Ph.D., M.A. or
