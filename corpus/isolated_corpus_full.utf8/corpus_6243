Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europea (SLE), Vilnius University,
Lithuania, 2-5 September 2010=20

Call for Papers

Within the framework of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica=
=20
Europea held at Vilnius University, Lithuania, we would like to propose a
workshop on the cognitive and functional mechanisms that account for the
formation and representation of the morpho-phonological word in the mental
lexicon. The workshop encourages researches and discussions around
psycholinguistic and psychologically-oriented computational models of langu=
age
acquisition, with an emphasis on word learning and representation. Lexical
representations are known to have a multidimensional nature, as demonstrate=
d by
long-standing psycholinguistic research on the role of phonological,
morphological, morpho-phonological and phonotactic regularities affecting
lexical processing. On one hand, models that emphasize the roles of activat=
ion
and competition in spoken word recognition (Luce and Pisoni 1998; Marslen-W=
ilson
1989, among others) have largely shown that the lexical level is marked by
competitive effects associated with similarity neighborhood activation;
similarly, following the most recent models of morpho-lexical processing,
morphemes are not recognized in isolation but rather relationally in the co=
ntext
of other phonologically similar material, and the two factors that mostly s=
hape
the morpho-lexical routine are neighborhood density and relative frequency =
of
the morpheme (Luce, Pisoni and Goldinger 1990; Burani and Laudanna 2003, am=
ong
others).  On the other hand, the investigation of probabilistic phonotactic
information, referring to the sub-lexical level in terms of probabilities o=
f
segments and sequences of segments, demonstrates that the legality and
probability of phonotactic patterns has demonstrable influences on the
representation and processing of word-sized stimuli (Vitevitch et al. 1997,
among others). Far from being confined to the domain of general linguistics=
 and
psycholinguistics, the debate also deals with controversial aspects of
computational processes exploited in language data processing, where phonot=
actic
and lexical knowledge have often been independently tested (e.g. Bailey and=
 Hahn
2001). The workshop aims at exploring the most innovative approaches, mostl=
y
devoted to combining behavioural experiments on human perception and produc=
tion
(well-formedness judgments, word vs. non-word perception, etc.) and
computational investigation of the dynamics underlying lexical processing
(word-likeness and lexical neighborhood, phonotactic transition probabiliti=
es
etc.) (see e.g. Frisch, Large and Pisoni 2000; Coady and Aslin 2004; Albrig=
ht
2002; Calderone, Celata and Herreros 2008). The workshop raises the fundame=
ntal
question of whether and to what extent a robust correlation can be set betw=
een
the behavioural patterns and the output of the computational simulations,
obtained in response to a comparable linguistic input.
