Dear student,


 HCSNet Hands-on Workshop on Mashups for Human Communication Science

		27-28 July 2009, Macquarie University

	     http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09mq


CALL FOR MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

Mashups are all about presenting information from various sources in
an integrated Web application. While early experiments with
multimedia-multiweb application integration were done by savvy
programmers who would effectively decode yet unpublished APIs of
applications such as Google Maps, currently there is a wide range of
software platforms for the development of mashups, and building a
mashup is becoming increasingly easier by everyone. In this hands-on
workshop, experts from leading mash-up development technologies will
introduce their products and then groups will be formed to build
mash-ups on the spot. Emphasis will be given to mashups related to
HCSNet's Priority Areas.


KEYNOTE PRESENTATIONS

There will be presentations by:

* Neil Wilkinson, Technical Director at Yahoo! 7
   o An intro to Yahoo!'s Open Strategy - focus on YQL (Yahoo! Query
     Language)

* Pamela Fox, Developer Programs Engineer for the Google Maps API
   o Creating Maps Mashups: From Data to Map

* James Hogan, from Queensland University of Technology
   o Making Mashups for Data Intensive Research


AUDIENCE

The workshop will attract leading researchers and developers in
language technology and human communication sciences but we are also
targetting students at Macquarie University.

Students of COMP and ISYS units, Honours, Masters, and PhD students
are encouraged to submit an expression of interest.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will run over two days. The central component of the
workshop will take place in PC labs with all the software required to
build mashups, and with technical assistance. There will be extensive
tutorials and presentations by experts in mashups, and the workshop
will conclude with presentations of the mashups built over the two
days.


SUBMISSIONS

Submit a paragraph of 100-150 words in length indicating the reasons
why you are interested in participating in this workshop and a topic
on which you would like to develop a mashup, and a paragraph
describing your background BY MONDAY 29 JUNE. Please send the
submissions by using the link at
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/mashups09mq.



Places are limited so do send your information by the due date.


IMPORTANT DATES

    * Submission of Abstracts:     29 June 2009
    * Notification of Acceptance:  13 July 2009
    * Registration:                 6 July 2009
