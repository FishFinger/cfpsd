Première annonce et appel à communications / first announcement and
call for papers:


                 4th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                  and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI'07)

                             28-30 June 2007
                          Brno, Czech Republic

                             CALL FOR PAPERS

The fourth MLMI workshop is coming to Brno in the Czech Republic,
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005)
and Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the
different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine
learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and
human-computer interaction.  The motivation for creating this joint
multi-disciplinary workshop arose from the actual needs of several
large collaborative projects.

MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual conference of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007), which will
take place in Prague on June 25-27, 2007.


* Important dates

Submission of full papers:  23 February 2007
Submission of extended abstracts:  23 March 2007
Submission of demonstration proposals:  23 March 2007
Acceptance decisions:  17 April 2007
Workshop:  28-30 June 2007


* Workshop topics

MLMI'07 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers),
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine
learning and multimodal interaction:

  - human-human communication modeling
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above


* Satellite events

MLMI'07 will feature special sessions and satellite events such as the
Summer school of the European Masters in Speech and Language
(http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/emasters/) and the PASCAL Speech Separation
Challenge II (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlincol1/SSC2/).  To
propose other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please
contact the organizing committee.


* Guidelines for submission

In common with the previous MLMI workshops, revised versions of
selected papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

Submissions are invited in one of the following formats:
  - full papers for oral or poster presentation (12 pages)
  - extended abstracts for poster presentation only (1-2 pages)
  - demonstration proposals (1-2 pages)

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/, following the Springer LNCS format
for proceedings and other multiauthor volumes
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0).


* Venue

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital
of Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the
country's judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of
almost four hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also
the cultural center of the region.

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and
Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km).

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental
(http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet
part of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The
local organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology
(http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was
founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
