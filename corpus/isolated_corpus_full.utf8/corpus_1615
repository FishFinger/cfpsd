Call for Participation:  Workshop on Advanced Dialogs=20

The VoiceXML Forum Tools Committee is holding a one-day workshop on =
Advanced Dialogs for voice-activated systems on August 23, 2007 from 9 =
a.m. to 4 p.m.  at the New York Marriott Marquis.  This workshop is our =
second on Advanced Dialogs and follows a first successful session held =
at SpeechTEK West 2007.

The purpose of the workshop is to promote technology exchange among =
spoken language experts and to explore what dialog specification =
concepts should be standardized for deploying advanced voice-activated =
services.  Attendees will analyze alternative approaches and suggest =
recommendations for how standards should proceed for supporting advanced =
dialogs.=20

The Workshop will be co-located with SpeechTEK East 2007 but no =
SpeechTEK registration is required.  There is a $50 fee, which includes =
the workshop and lunch.

Admission to the workshop is by invitation only.  To receive an =
invitation, please submit a use case for an advanced dialog.  The use =
case need not describe an entire service; rather it depicts an exchange =
- perhaps a dozen or two utterances - between a caller and an automated =
service.  The use case may be in dialog or flowchart form.  A sample =
dialog form use case (one using a non-advanced dialog) is attached =
below.  Note that we use the following definition to distinguish basic =
dialogs from advanced dialogs:

Advanced Dialog: A voice user interface specification that cannot =
efficiently be represented by a finite state machine.

The goal of this exercise is to produce examples of study cases to =
illustrate why advanced dialog engines are needed and as a test model =
for crafting an advanced dialog strategy.

If you can't think of an advanced dialog use case, we will accept a =
short position paper on the topic of what kind of service might require =
an advanced dialog.

Please submit use cases (or position papers) to dialogs@voicexml.org.  =
Use cases and papers submitted will be published at www.voicexml.org.  =
All material provided in advance of or during the workshop will be =
considered to be in the public domain.  Registration instructions will =
be included with the invitation.

Please note the following deadlines:

Dates:
    Use case submission:  July 10, 2007
    Invitations sent:  July 19, 2007
    Registration:  August 1, 2007
    Workshop: August 23, 2007

-----------------------------------

Example of a basic (not advanced) dialog *:

IVR:  Thank you for staying at the Sleepy Driver Motel.  Would you like =
to order room service, complain about the hot water, or schedule a =
wakeup call?

Caller:  I want a wakeup call.

IVR:  What time do you want your wakeup call?

Caller:  Five thirty a.m.

IVR:  Did you say, 'nine thirty a.m.'?

Caller:  No.  Five thirty.

(The IVR remembers that the caller asked for a.m.)

IVR:  Did you say, 'five thirty a.m.'?

Caller:  Yes.

IVR:  Happy dreams.

* Note that this use case would not qualify for an invitation because it =
may be efficiently implemented with a finite state machine.  Note also =
that it is not necessary to cover all possible responses (e.g. we do not =
illustrate ordering room service) or all possible error conditions (no =
response, system outages, etc.).=20
