Meeting Description:

A two day interdisciplinary conference for postgraduates in Occitan studies 

Call for Papers

During the 9th congress of the Association Internationale d'Etudes Occitanes
(Aachen, August 2008), the idea of a conference for graduate researchers working
on Occitan was put forward.  This conference, organised by the postgraduate
students present in Aachen, will be held at the Centre Universitaire
Jean-François Champollion in Albi, on the 11th and 12th of June 2009. 

In the context of the increasingly diverse and interdisciplinary nature of
research on Occitan language and culture, postgraduate students from all
disciplines are invited to present their research projects and exchange
different methods with fellow young researchers in Occitan studies.
The conference aims to provide an interactive forum where constructive
discussions between students can encourage collaborative projects and identify
new areas of research.
Contributions on all aspects of Occitan language and culture are welcomed, on
topics including, but not limited to: linguistics, history, literature,
sociology, musicology, and ethnography.  Each paper should present a single,
well-defined aspect of the author's research, and may touch on the role of
interdisciplinary work in this research.   

Abstracts, of 300 words maximum, should be submitted by e-mail to the conference
address nouvelles.recherches.oc@gmail.com by 10 January 2009.  Notification of
acceptance/rejection will be given in mid-February.

Papers may be in Occitan, French, another Romance language or English.  Each
presentation should last approximately twenty minutes and will be followed by
ten minutes for questions.  

It is envisaged that the conference proceedings will be published, to which end
finished articles should be submitted by 30 June 2009.

The conference is organised under the auspices of the Association Internationale
d'Etudes Occitanes.

Organising committee :
Elodie de Oliveira, Université Paris IV (linguistics/modern literature).
Louise Esher, University of Oxford (linguistics).
Céline Baquié, Université Paris IV (modern literature).
Aurélia Lassaque, Université Montpellier III (modern literature).
