Meeting Description:

CALICO'09 Pre-Conference Workshop on Automatic Analysis of Learner Language
(AALL'09): From a better understanding of annotation needs to the development
and standardization of annotation schemes
March 10 or 11, 2008, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ. 

Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: December 1, 2008

In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers working on the analysis
of learner language in the broad sense, including work on annotation schemes for
learner corpora and NLP techniques used to detect learner errors and other
learner language properties. We invite abstracts addressing these general
issues, including but not limited to:

- Which properties of learner language are useful and relevant to obtain for
Foreign Language Teaching and current Second Language Acquisition research?
- What annotation scheme or (error) taxonomy is appropriate for this and how do
different annotation schemes compare?
- How reliably can errors and other properties of learner language be obtained
automatically given the current state-of-the art in NLP?
- What is the impact of the specific properties of learner language on the
(re)use of NLP technology? How does it impact performance and the potential use
of such technology in foreign language teaching tools?
- Which annotated learner language corpora have been used or could be used to
evaluate the performance of different approaches to analyzing learner language?

The workshop is intended to follow up on the pre-conference workshop on the
Automatic Analysis of Learner Language held at CALICO 2008
(http://purl.org/net/calico-workshop).

We invite submissions of anonymous two page abstracts in an email with the
abstract as a pdf attachment. Name, affiliation, and email address should only
be included in the text of the email, not in the abstract in the pdf attachment.

Send submissions to: calico-workshop@ling.osu.edu
Submission Deadline: December 1
Please use the following Subject: Submission to AALL '09

The workshop is organized by the ICALL Special Interest Group of
CALICO (http://purl.org/calico/icall), currently chaired by Xiaofei Lu
(Pennsylvania State University) and Detmar Meurers (Universit√§t T√ºbingen).
