- A suggested format and style for abstracts is available at:
http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/template.html
- Three examples of how to formulate the content of the abstract can be found at:
http://www.lsadc.org/info/dec02bulletin/model.html
http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/bucholtz/sociocultural/abstracttips.html
http://www.ulcl.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=5&c=124

http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/pdfinfo.html.
If you encounter a problem creating a PDF file, please contact us for further assistance.
Please use the first author's last name as the file name (eg. Smith.pdf). No author information should appear anywhere in the contents of the PDF file itself.

Submission Instructions:
- Electronic submission: To facilitate the abstract submission process, abstracts will be submitted using the form available at the conference website at  http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/abstract.htm.
- Specific instructions for abstract submission are available on this website.
- Abstracts will be accepted between April 1 and May 15.
- Contact information for each author must be submitted via webform. No author information should appear anywhere in the abstract PDF.
- At the time of submission you will be asked whether you would like your abstract to be considered for a poster, a paper, or both. Note that this preference is not revealed to the reviewers, and thus is not considered in the review process. 
- Although each author may submit as many abstracts as desired, we will accept for presentation by each author: (a) a maximum of 1 first authored paper/poster, and (b) a maximum of 2 papers/posters in any authorship status. Note that no changes in authorship (including deleting an author or changing author order) will be possible after the review process is completed or for publication in the conference proceedings.

Deadline:
- All submissions must be received by 8:00 PM EST, May 15, 2008.
- Late abstracts will not be considered, whatever the reason for the delay.
- We regret that we cannot accept abstract submissions by fax or email.
- Submissions via surface mail will only be accepted in special circumstances, on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us well in advance of the submission deadline (May 15, 2008) to make these arrangements.

Abstract Selection:
- Each abstract is blind reviewed by 5 reviewers from a panel of approximately 180  international scholars. Further information about the review process is available at http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/reviewprocess.html.
- Acknowledgment of receipt of the abstract will be sent by email as soon as possible after receipt. Notice of acceptance or rejection will be sent to first authors only, in early August, by email. Pre-registration materials and preliminary schedule will be available in late August 2008.
- If your abstract is accepted, you will need to submit a 150-word abstract including title, author(s) and affiliation(s) for inclusion in the conference handbook. Guidelines will be provided along with notification of acceptance.
- Abstracts accepted as papers will be invited for publication in the BUCLD Proceedings.
- Abstracts accepted as posters will be invited for publication online only, but not in the printed version.
- All conference papers will be selected on the basis of abstracts submitted. Although each abstract will be evaluated individually, we will attempt to honor requests to schedule accepted papers together in group sessions. 
- No schedule changes will be possible once the schedule is set. Scheduling requests for religious reasons only must be made before the review process is complete (i.e. at the time of submission). A space is provided on the abstract submission webform to specify such requests.
