First Call for Participation
February 2009

We are pleased to announce that the registration to EVALITA 2009,
the second evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and
Speech tools for Italian, is now open.

The general objective of Evalita is to promote the development of
language technologies for the Italian language, providing a shared
framework where different systems and approaches can be evaluated
in a consistent manner.

We invite participation, both from academic institutions and
industrial organizations, in eight tasks, all for Italian.
With respect to the previous edition, tasks also include a range of
Speech tasks and a new Textual Entailment task.

Text tasks:

- PoS-Tagging
- Parsing
    - Dependency Parsing
    - Constituency Parsing
- Lexical substitution
- Entity Recognition
    - Named Entity Recognition
    - Local Entity Detection and Recognition
- Textual Entailment

Speech tasks:

- Connected Digits Recognition
    - Clean Digits
    - Noisy Digits
- Dialogue System Evaluation
- Speaker Identity Verification
    - Application
    - Forensic

As with the previous edition, guidelines describing the different tasks
will be distributed to participants.

Participants will also be provided with training data and will have
the chance to test their systems with the evaluation metrics and
procedures to be used in the formal evaluation.

The results of the evaluation will be disseminated at the final
workshop, which will be organized in conjunction with AI*IA 2009
and will take place in Reggio Emilia.

In order to register for one or more of the EVALITA 2009 tasks,
please go to the registration page of the EVALITA 2009 website:
http://evalita.fbk.eu/registration.html

Please notice that some weeks ago there has been a change in the
important dates.

Updated information is always available on the website at
