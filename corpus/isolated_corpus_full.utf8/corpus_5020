Full Title: Ehu International Workshop on Ergativity 

Date: 04-Nov-2009 - 06-Nov-2009
Location: Bilbao, Spain 
Contact Person: Itziar Laka
Meeting Email: ergativity@ehu.es

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Linguistic Theories; Morphology;
Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 08-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

Approximately twenty five percent of the world's languages exhibit ergativity in
their grammars. Despite the growing amount of recent research on ergativity,
there is no shared understanding yet on its nature, or on how to implement it in
linguistic theory, and despite advances made in the last decades in the areas of
language acquisition and natural language processing, it is still unknown what
the impact of ergativity and other associated linguistic phenomena is in
language development and processing. 

Call for Papers

This workshop intends to gather researchers in theoretical linguistics,
typology, acquisition and processing studies who work on ergative languages, in
order to discuss the latest developments and some resilient problems in the
study of ergativity as a linguistic trait. 

Invited Speakers:
Julie Legate (U. of Delaware)
Anoop Mahajan (UCLA)
Esther Torrego (UMass Boston)

Abstract Submission:
Researchers working on issues related to ergativity are invited to submit an
abstract for oral presentation. Presentations will be allotted 30 minutes plus
10 minutes for discussion. Authors are asked to submit their abstracts in two
.PDF files, one anonymous and one with the author's name and affiliation, to the
following address:
ergativity@ehu.es

The body of the message should include the title of the paper, name of the
author(s), affiliation(s), surface mail address and e-mail address. Abstracts
should be no longer than two pages in length (including examples and
references), in Times New Roman 12-point type, single line spacing and 2,5 cm.
margins. The official language of the workshop is English.

Deadline for abstract submission: June 8th, 2009

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
