  22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information

ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)  
is organized every year by the Association for Logic,
Language and Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different  
sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface
between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers  
foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops,
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest:  
Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful,  
attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The
school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for  
discussion for students and researchers interested in the
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information.
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLI?2009  
website: http://esslli2009.labri.fr/.


The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,  
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the
22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in  
the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics,
computer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3  
traditional ESSLLI streams:


-Language and Computation
-Language and Logic
-Logic and Computation
We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a  
prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010
website www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010, through EasyChair on  
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010, not later than

******* Monday, September 7, 2009 *******

Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the  
guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that
do not conform with these guidelines may not be considered.

GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS:

ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and  
consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course
proposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative  
content and structure of the course, as well as state the course?s
objectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who  
want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent
one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week  
of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two  
proposed courses.

TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:

  Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

  Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

  Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material  
by the ESSLLI?2010 local organizers

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not  
assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for
people who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of  
areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from
other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring  
disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly  
interdisciplinary
research community. Foundational courses should require no special  
prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific
methods and general appreciation of the field of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the  
activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an
introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young  
researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good
understanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such  
courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields
to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus  
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research
community. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and  
Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g.,
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an  
audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and
computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the  
level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of  
advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for
advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes  
sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to
provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to  
present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well
defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the  
theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify
the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and  
expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential
submitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are  
required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for the  
organization and program of the workshop including inviting the  
submission of
papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular,  
each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for
Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the  
submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all  
members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop
contributors must register for the Summer School.

TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:

  Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

  Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

  Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to  
ESSLLI?2010 PC chair

  Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers

  Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers

  Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers

  Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops

  May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors

  Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of  
workshop proceedings to the ESSLLI?2010 Local Organizers.

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the  
Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate
to be determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop  
proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website
www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010.

The proposers are required to submit the following information:

* Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two  
per course or workshop
* Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if  
available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s);
* Title of proposed course/workshop;
* Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)
* Stream (one of: Language & Computation, Language & Logic, Logic &  
Computation)
* Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance  
to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp.
   expected participation in the workshops)
* External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain  
external funding for travel and accommodation expenses)
* Further particulars (any further information that is required by the  
above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course
   objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching  
experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the
   interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers  
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer
schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants  
fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation  
(up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the
lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while  
proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot  
guarantee
full reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations  
outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be
taught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to  
cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the
splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers.

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,  
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost  
of attending ESSLLI?2010 lower.
