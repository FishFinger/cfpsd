Meeting Description:

Title of the workshop:
Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge

Web site:
http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/

The workshop seeks to explore methodologies developed from scratch for a variety
of languages, and perhaps their reapplication to the processing of English
texts. We invite submissions on the topics we list below, and on closely related
topics in the general spirit of the workshop. We target the problem of automatic
extraction of some form of natural language semantics from corpora and
application of the knowledge extracted in that way in systems that deal with
natural language. 

Final Call for Papers

Title of the workshop:
Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge

The host conference:
6th International Conference on Multimedia and Network Information Systems,
Wroclaw, Poland, September 18-19, 2008 

Web site:
http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/
       
The proportion of Web pages written in English keeps decreasing, but a majority
of text-handling tools and techniques have been developed for English and tested
on English resources. Many languages have been reasonably well served by the
existing systems, but large typological differences (complex morphology, rich
inflection, freer-order syntax, not to mention cultural biases) tend to make
those tools and resources less than fully adequate. This may be particularly
true of deeper processing, including the acquisition of natural language
semantics from text.

Work on any language is welcome; we particularly encourage submissions related
to ''less privileged'' languages. The workshop will be held in English, to
ensure the broadest dissemination of its contributions. We have room for up to
50 papers, including posters, so there will be ample opportunity to report on
work in progress. To suit the host conference, papers on applications of the
semantic knowledge extracted from text will also be considered; such
applications include machine translation, parsing, sentiment analysis,
information retrieval, information extraction, and text mining.

Topics:
Distributional semantics, semantic relatedness, semantic similarity
Extraction of lexico-semantic relations
Extraction of logical models for natural language semantics
Extraction of selectional restrictions
Lexicon extraction from corpora
Pattern-based methods in lexical knowledge acquisition
Recognition of expressions of opinions and emotions in text
Resources and tools for word-sense disambiguation
Software support for lexical knowledge acquisition
Thesaurus construction, extension and critique

Schedule:
submission: May 30, 2008
reviews in: June 13, 2008
camera-ready: June 27, 2008
