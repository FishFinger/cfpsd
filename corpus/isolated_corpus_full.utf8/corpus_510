This conference aims to provide a forum for presenting research in Japanese and Korean linguistics, thereby facilitating efforts to deepen our understanding of these two languages, which have striking typological similarities. Papers in all sub-areas of Japanese and Korean linguistics are invited. Presentations, except for those by the keynote speakers, will be 20 minutes long and will be followed by a 10-minute question and answer period. 

The 16th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference will be held at Kyoto University in Japan from 7-9 October 2006. 

The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers working in the field of Japanese and Korean linguistics, in order to provide new insights into these two languages, which exhibit a profound typological affinity. The conference will also be a place where both well-established and young scholars, as well as students of Japanese and Korean linguistics, can interact and exchange research results and ideas.

Presentations at this year's conference include such varied areas as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics. The conference also involves keynote talks from Kwang Chung and S-.Y. Kuroda, and invited talks from Mamoru Saito and James Yoon.

We would like to invite anyone working with Japanese/Korean language related fields.
