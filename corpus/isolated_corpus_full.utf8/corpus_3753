Meeting Description:

Department of English: 5th International Conference
Theme: Mapping Africa in the English Speaking World
University of Botswana
02nd - 04th June, 2009

Since 1998 the Department of English in the Faculty of Humanities at the
University of Botswana has hosted a biennial conference to discuss issues
concerning English language and literature in Africa. The 2009 conference,
Mapping Africa in the English Speaking World, will provide a platform to engage
with various issues relating to the representation of Africa, past and present,
in English. The department hopes that dialogue around such issues will
contribute to better understanding of the image(s) of Africa in the
English-speaking world, the relationships between Africa and English and the
extent to which English and other African related issues such as various
languages traditions (written and oral), cultures, etc inter-relate; the
construction of identities and development of relationships in multi-lingual
contexts; how culture and knowledge are effectively communicated between
communities; and so on. 

Call for Papers

The suggested themes and sub-themes of the conference include: 

The representation of Africa in various modes of communication (in English) in: 
(a) Spoken and written literary texts  
(b) The media 
(c) Theatre, film and other modes of performance 
(d) Music
(e) Anthropology, history, linguistics, sociology and other academic discourses.

Conceptions of African multilingualism, nationalism, identities and culture in
English cultures within Africa and beyond 

The English language in Africa: 
(a) Advantages and disadvantages of using English in Africa
(b) The English(es) of the African Diaspora
(c) The Africanization/indigenisation of English in Africa 
(d) English and postcolonial Africa
(e) Africa's enrichment of English: the contribution of Africa and the African
Diaspora to the communicative and expressive Capacity of English 

Perceptions of power relations between African languages and English
Conflicting interests: teaching African cultures in the English language;
teaching English in an African culture.
Representations of Botswana culture by foreign vs Botswana writers.

The department hopes that dialogue around such issues will contribute to better
understanding of the image(s) of Africa in the English-speaking world, the
relationships between Africa and English and the extent to which English and
other African related issues such as various languages traditions (written and
oral), cultures, etc inter-relate; the construction of identities and
development of relationships in multi-lingual contexts; how culture and
knowledge are effectively communicated between communities; and so on. 

Abstracts of not more than 250 words on any of the above theme and sub-themes
