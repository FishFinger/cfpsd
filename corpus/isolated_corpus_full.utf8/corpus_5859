22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010,
University of Copenhagen, Denmark


CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS


The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is
organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org )
in different sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the
interface between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers
foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops,
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest:
Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful,
attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has
developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for
students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of
Logic, Language and Information. For more information, visit the FoLLI
website, as well as ESSLLI2009 website: http://esslli2009.labri.fr/ .

The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 22nd
annual Summer School on important topics of active research in the
broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics, computer
science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3
traditional ESSLLI streams:

- Language and Computation
- Language and Logic
- Logic and Computation

We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a 
prescribed form
that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website
www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010, through EasyChair on 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010 , not later than

******* Monday, September 7, 2009 *******

Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the 
guidelines
below while preparing their submissions; proposals that do not conform
with these guidelines may not be considered.


GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS:

ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of
five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course proposals should give a
brief overview of the topic and a tentative content and structure of
the course, as well as state the courses objectives and clearly
specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who want to offer a long,
two-week course, should submit two independent one-week courses (for
example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more
advanced course during the second). The ESSLLI program committee has
the right to select only one of the two proposed courses.

TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline
Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by 
the ESSLLI2010 local organizers

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming 
any
background knowledge. They are intended for people who wish to get
acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them.
Ideally, they should allow researchers from other fields to acquire the
key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community.
Foundational courses should require no special prerequisites, but may
presuppose some experience with scientific methods and general
appreciation of the field of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES:
Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer
School. They are intended to provide an introduction to the
(interdisciplinary) field for students, young researchers, and other
non-specialists, and to equip them with a good understanding of the
course field's basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable
experienced researchers from other fields to acquire the key
competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community.
Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can
build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g., an introductory
course in computational linguistics should address an audience which is
familiar with the basics of linguistics and computation. Proposals for
introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as
compared to standard texts in the area (if available).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of 
advanced
Masters or PhD students. Proposals for advanced courses should specify
the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one
week and consist of five 90-minutes sessions, one per day. The aim of
the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and
other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should
have a well defined theme, and workshop organizers should be
specialists in the theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops
should justify the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of
attendants and expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15
potential submitters working in the field of the workshop. The
organizers are required to give a general introduction to the theme
during the first session of the workshop. They are also responsible
for the organization and program of the workshop including inviting the
submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In
particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out
a Call for Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the
submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members
of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop
contributors must register for the Summer School.

TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:

Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline
Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to 
ESSLLI2010 PC chair
Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers
Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers
Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers
Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops
May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors

Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop
proceedings to the ESSLLI2010 Local Organizers for reproduction.

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer
School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate to be
determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop 
proposals will be available soon on
the ESSLLI 2010 website www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010.

The proposers are required to submit the following information:
* Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two 
per course or workshop
* Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if available), 
of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s);
* Title of proposed course/workshop;
* Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course)
* Stream (one of: Language & Computation, Language & Logic, Logic & 
Computation)

* Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance to 
ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp.
expected participation in the workshops)
* External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain 
external funding for travel and accommodation expenses)

* Further particulars (any further information that is required by the
above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course
objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching
experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the
interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS:
Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all
teaching and organizing at the summer schools is done on a voluntary
basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as possible.
Lecturers and organizers are not paid for their contribution, but are
reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to fixed maximum amounts,
that will be communicated to the lecturers upon notification). It
should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world are
welcomed, the School cannot guarantee full reimbursement of travel
costs, especially from destinations outside Europe. Please note that in
case a course or workshop is to be taught/organized by two lecturers, a
lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses
for one lecturer; the splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers.

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost
of attending ESSLLI2010 lower.
