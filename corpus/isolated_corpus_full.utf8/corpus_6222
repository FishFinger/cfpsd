Meeting Description:

The aim of the conference is to pursue dialogue between applied linguists a=
nd=20
theoreticians about methodological issues in linguistic education. In the e=
ra of
globalization, when political and administrative borders in the educational
sphere are brought down, issues of international and intercultural communic=
ation
in different professional areas become even more acute. There is a growing
demand to increase the efficiency of higher learning educational programs c=
alled
upon to enhance the second or foreign language communicative competence of
would-be specialists. Yet it is no secret that the existing methods of teac=
hing
a foreign or second language are far from being satisfactory in terms of
expected efficiency. This is symptomatic of a general methodological proble=
m: we
lack holistic understanding of how natural language shapes the cognitive do=
main
of human interactions. The conference aims to contribute to the ongoing
discussion of the problem in the cognitive/linguistic community.=20
