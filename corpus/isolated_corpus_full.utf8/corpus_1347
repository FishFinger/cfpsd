                 WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

          ACL-PASCAL Workshop on Textual Entailment and Paraphrasing


Date:      June, 28 (afternoon) and 29, 2007
Location:  Prague, in conjunction with ACL 2007

Workshop web page:   http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/WTEP
Conference web page: http://www.acl2007.org/

Based on a lot of resuests to postphone the submission deadline, we
extended the deadline to March 30, 2007.


Recognizing and generating textual entailment and paraphrase are =
regarded as
important technologies in a broad range of NLP applications, including =
machine=20
translation, information retrieval, information extraction, =
summarization,=20
question answering and text generation. Both textual entailment and =
paraphrasing=20
address relevant aspects of natural language semantics. Entailment is a=20
directional relation between two expressions in which one of them =
implies the=20
other, whereas paraphrase is a relation in which two expressions convey =
essentially=20
the same meaning. Indeed, paraphrase can be defined as bi-directional =
entailment.=20
While it may be debatable how such semantic definitions can be made =
well-founded,=20
in practice we have already seen evidence that such knowledge is =
essential for=20
many applications.=20

There have been two lines of workshops in this field. One is a series of =
three=20
workshops on paraphrase -- in Tokyo 2001, in Sapporo at ACL-2003 and in =
Jeju at=20
IJCNLP-2005.The other is the Workshop on Empirical Modeling of Semantic=20
Equivalence and Entailment (at ACL-2005), and two workshops of the =
previous=20
PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (2005 and 2006).
We combine those two lines of similar effort together at this workshop =
in order=20
to see the convergence of the field and exchange ideas among a wider =
audience.
The workshop has two parts, one is the general session where submission =
is open,=20
and the other is the concluding workshop of the 3rd PASCAL RTE =
Challenge. The=20
program will include general session papers and selected presentations =
and a poster=20
session of RTE-3 systems. See =
http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/ for=20
details about the RTE-3 challenge (with result submission deadline on =
March 12).

This CFP calls for papers for the general session. Any research topic =
related to=20
textual entailment and paraphrasing in any language is welcome. More =
specifically,=20
topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Definitions of textual entailment and paraphrasing
* The relationship between the two problems
* Typology of entailment/paraphrasing
* Representation levels
* Utilizing background knowledge
* Acquisition methods (automatic and manual)
* Recognition and generation of textual entailment and paraphrasing
* Inference methods
* Existing and potential applications
* Computational modeling of linguistic theories of =
entailment/paraphrasing
* Open resources
* Evaluation methods
* Data analysis
