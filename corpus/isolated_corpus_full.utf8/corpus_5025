Apologies for multiple postings.

Workshop: Biomedical Information Extraction
http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/biomedicalIE 

In conjunction with the 7th International Conference
Recent Advances on Natural Language Processing RANLP-2009, 14-16
September 2009


Undoubtly, the availability of information for biomedicine in an
electronic format has been rapidly increasing. The Medical Literature
Analysis and Retrieval system (Medline) houses millions of biomedical
scientific literature publications. PubMed offers the power of a
search engine for accessing the Medline content. On the other hand,
the electronization of clinical data within the Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) provides another powerful source for information
extraction.
Access to integrated information is critical for health care
improvement, research, and the overall science of healthcare delivery
and personalized medicine. Information extraction from the scientific
literature is distinct from information extraction from the clinical
narrative as these two types of genre have their own stylistic
characteristics and pose different methodological challenges. In
addition, biomedical information spans multiple languages thus
necessitating methods for multi-lingual information extraction.

In addition to the biomedical scientific literature and clinical data,
the large number of health-related web resources is increasing day by
day. The content of these resources is very variable and difficult to
assess. Furthermore, the number of people searching for health-related
information is also increasing. The development of tools to support
the process of describing the content of medical web resources with
meta-data that facilitate their retrieval, and with quality labels by
certified authorities, is crucial for the delivery of content of
better quality to health information consumers. Multi-lingual
information extraction has a significant role to play there also.

The focus of this workshop is natural language processing and
information extraction for biomedicine, including scientific and
clinical free-text as well as health-related web resources within one
or many languages. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Natural language processing techniques for basic tasks, e.g.
  sentence boundary detection, tokenization, part of speech tagging,
  shallow parsing and deep parsing. Evaluation and comparison with the
  general domain;

* Efforts to create sharable biomedical lexical resources, including
  the annotation of biomedical data for linguistic and domain events;

* Biomedical named entity recognition;

* Methods for higher level biomedical language processing, e.g.
  relation discovery, temporal relation discovery, anaphoric relation
  discovery;

* Terminology/ontology biomedical named entity mapping;

* Integrated knowledge management of scientific and clinical free-text
  data

* Knowledge representation and management technologies (e.g. OWL, RDF,
  Annotation Schemas, etc.) that enable the creation of
  machine-processable descriptions of health-related web resources

* Content collection and information extraction techniques that allow
  the quality labeling of web resources and the continuous monitoring
  of already labeled ones

* Multi-lingual information extraction

Important dates:

*	Submission deadline: 6 June 2009
*	Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2009
*	Camera-ready copy due from authors: 24 August 2009
*	Workshop: 17 or 18 September 2009

Submission instructions:

Submissions should be A4, two-column format and should not exceed
seven pages including cover page, figures, tables and references. The
workshop papers should follow the RANLP format which is available at
the RANLP website http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009 in the Second Call
for Papers.  Papers should be submitted electronically in *PDF* format
using the conference submission system START. Detailed instructions
about the workshop submission will be announced at the workshop
website.

Review and multiple submission policy

The review process is anonymous. The paper text should not reveal the
authors identity. To maintain the submissions, all authors' names and
addresses should be registered in the START system when the paper is
submitted; this information will be open for the workshop organizers
only. Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Programme
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines
regarding how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers for
inclusion in the proceedings. The full workshop proceedings will be
distributed at the event. The workshop papers will be included in the
ACL Anthology.

The workshop calls for articles describing original research. Authors
may submit the same paper at several events. In this case they must
notify the organizers in a separate mail to [savova dot guergana at
mayo dot edu], to inform them that the paper might be withdrawn
depending on the selections at some other event.

Organizing committee:

Guergana Savova, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester,
Minnesota, USA
Vangelis Karkaletsis, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications,
Athens, Greece
Galia Angelova, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria

Programme committee (to be announced in the second Call for Papers)

Workshop venue:

The workshop will be held at the Samokov Hotel in the resort of
Borovets as a post-conference event of RANLP-09. The picturesque
resort of Borovets is located in the Rila mountains and is one of the
best known winter resorts in South-East Europe, a frequent venue for
world skiing events. The resort is 1350 m above sea level, at the foot
of the highest peak on the Balkan Peninsula - Moussala (2925 m). The
resort of Borovets is 73 km from Sofia and the International airport
of Sofia can serve as an arrival/departure point. In addition to
regular public transport, the organizers will provide daily shuttle
buses from Sofia airport to the Samokov hotel at an inexpensive
rate. A taxi from Sofia to Borovets is relatively cheap; it is also
possible to take a taxi from the International airport in Sofia to the
workshop venue.
