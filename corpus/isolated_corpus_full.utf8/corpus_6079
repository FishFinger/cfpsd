Meeting Description:

14th EURALEX International Congress 

We take great pleasure in inviting you to take part in the 14th EURALEX
International Congress that will be held in Leeuwarden/Ljouwert, The Netherlands
from 6 July until 10 July 2010. The Congress will be organized by the Fryske
Akademy (Frisian Academy). The EURALEX Congresses bring together professional
lexicographers, publishers, researchers, software developers and others
interested in dictionaries of all types. The programme will include plenary
lectures, parallel sessions, software demonstrations, a special session for
students and work-in-progress, a book and software exhibition, and social events
for participants and their guests.  

Guest Speakers:
We are delighted to announce our guest speakers for this conference. Since the
lexicography of non-state languages is a special feature of the congress, we are
particularly happy that Dr Sarah Ogilvie, from Oxford, will address the
audience. She will read a paper entitled: 'On Lexicography and Endangered
Languages: What Can Europe Learn from the Rest of the World?' Prof. Dr Rolf H.
Bremmer, from Leiden University, will explain how Frisian and English are
related. The well-known etymologist Prof. Dr Anatoly Liberman, from the
University of Minnesota, will discuss 'The Genre and Uses of the Etymological
Dictionary.' The traditional Hornby lecture will be delivered by Prof. Dr Paul
Bogaards, from Leiden University and editor of the International Journal of
Lexicography. Prof. Bogaards will explore the subject of 'Dictionaries and
foreign language learning.' Our fifth invited speaker will be announced shortly.
