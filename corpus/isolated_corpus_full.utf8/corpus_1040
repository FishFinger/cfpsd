Meeting Description:

3rd Workshop on Contrast: Contrast - towards a closer definition 

Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS), Berlin, Germany 

Second Call for Papers - Contrast07

May 3rd - 4th, 2007

Organizers: Philippa Cook, Werner Frey, Ewald Lang, Sophie Repp, Fabienne Salfner

Invited Speakers:
Julia Horvath (Tel Aviv)
Valeria Molnar (Lund)
Jennifer Spenader (Groningen)

Second Call for Papers:
The role of contrast has been investigated in many different areas: in the study
of text organisation, in the study of topic and focus and the
information-packaging of the clause, in the study of various linguistic means
for the demarcation of contrast such as contrast markers, prosody, or clause
structure. This has been done both from the perspective of theoretical
linguistics as well as psycho- and computational linguistics.

The notion of contrast usually applied takes contrast to be built on the
existence of alternatives, although the views on what role the alternatives
actually play differ. Relevant questions concern, for example, the contextual
salience of the alternatives, whether the set of alternatives is closed or open,
and/or whether or not contrastivity implies exhaustivity.

The purpose of this workshop is to elucidate what the crucial components for a
definition of contrast are, what conditions there are on alternatives in a
contrast relation, and whether these conditions are semantically or/and
pragmatically determined. Thus, we are interested in precise specifications of
contrast.

A further area we would like to address is how contrast is formally marked and
whether different marking strategies within a single language point to the
existence of different types of contrast: Do different types of contrast receive
different formal marking? Is this spelt out via prosodically differing
accents/tunes, and/or is it realised in different syntactic positions? What does
the existence of different types of contrast imply for their interpretation?

Submissions:
We invite submissions to any of the above aspects in all areas of linguistics
(pragmatics, semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology) and their interfaces. We
welcome both theoretical contributions as well as papers working with e.g.
psycho-, corpus- or computational linguistic evidence.

Authors should submit an anonymous abstract. The length of abstracts for talks
should be at most 2 single-column pages including literature. All submissions
should include a separate cover page specifying the authors' names, affiliation,
address, e-mail address and title of the paper. The abstracts should be
submitted electronically (pdf, ps or doc format) to:

contrast07@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Important Dates:
Deadline for Submissions: March 5th, 2007
Notification of Acceptance: March 23rd 2007
Conference: May 3rd - 4th, 2007

Meeting Description:

The 2007 International Course and Conference on Role and Reference Grammar will
be hosted by the Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas, at the Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México, in México City, 6-10 August, 2007. The
international Conference will be preceded by two-day (course) workshops. The
Conference will stage papers and plenary sessions. 

Keynote Speakers:

The 2007 International Conference on Role and Reference (RRG) Grammar will deal
with issues in linguistic theory in its wider discursive, cognitive and
typological perspective. Papers dealing with further elaboration of RRG in areas
like morphology, syntax, semantics, information structure, as well as language
processing are encouraged. The workshops will include lecture sessions at three
levels: introductory, graduate and specialized. The introductory and graduate
sessions will be taught in Spanish and will provide the basics and core
theoretical principles of RRG for those not yet acquainted with the theory. The
specialized workshops will deal with advanced topics on RRG, and will be
presented by RRG specialists.

Abstracts must be received electronically by March 31, 2007 at 2007RRG@gmail.com

Abstracts should be no longer than two pages, including data and references, and
must be submitted as Word documents (a PDF version is also required if special
characters are included). The abstracts should be anonymous. The email message
must include the following information: author's name(s), affiliation, email
address, and title of abstract. The selection of papers for presentation will
have been communicated by May 1, 2007. The talks will last twenty minutes,
followed by another ten minutes for discussion.

Further information including registration fee, travel, accommodation, social
events, will be on the Conference website at
http://www.filologicas.unam.mx/2007rrg.html.
