***** TSA 2009 CALL FOR PAPERS *****

1st International CIKM Workshop on Topic-Sentiment Analysis for Mass Opinio=
n Measurement

November 6, 2009
Hong Kong

http://sites.google.com/site/tsa2009workshop


*****SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP*****

This workshop seeks to bring together researchers in both computer science =
and social sciences who are interested in developing and using topic-sentim=
ent analysis methods to measure mass opinion, and to foster communications =
between the research community and industry practitioners as well.

The increasing amount of user-generated content on the Internet and social =
media and the digitization of large number of government and institutional =
documents provide new opinion-rich data sources for researchers to examine =
individual and group perceptions on products, organizations, and social iss=
ues at a large scale, and thus contribute to the research and practice in t=
he areas of political science, social policy, communications, and business =
intelligence.

On the other hand, researchers are tackling the problem of processing large=
 amount of opinion-rich data using various approaches. The increasing numbe=
r of relevant publications in top data mining, information retrieval and na=
tural language processing conferences (KDD, SIGIR, ACL, WWW, etc.) has witn=
essed the growing interest in automatic opinion analysis. Both TREC and TAC=
 (Text Analysis Conference) have set up individual tracks for opinion retri=
eval and analysis tasks.

In recent years topic detection and tracking techniques have been well deve=
loped to identify the issues discussed in a large text collection. Sentimen=
t analysis is catching up to detect the polarity of opinions expressed in t=
exts. However, many times real-world applications have to take into conside=
ration of both topics and sentiments for precise opinion measurement. Topic=
 and sentiment alignment is crucial for opinion retrieval, extraction, cate=
gorization, and aggregation on various issues. Topics and sentiments could =
also have sophisticated interactions. For example, the choice of topics and=
 the attention distribution among topics might bear hidden opinions as well.

How do we build synergistic topic and sentiment models for text documents? =
How do we tackle the domain-dependency problem of sentiment analysis? How d=
o we identify users' needs and integrate them into the design of opinion an=
alysis systems? What are the successful applications of topic-sentiment ana=
lysis for mass opinion measurement? What lessons have the pioneers learned?=
 How do we evaluate the automatic mass opinion measuring tools with regard =
to the reliability and validity? This workshop solicits submissions to addr=
ess these problems and more.

We hope this workshop can advance research in topic-sentiment analysis, mak=
e connections between research community and industry practitioners and enc=
ourage development of high performance tools and systems that can work at t=
he web scale for real world applications.



*****TOPICS OF INTEREST*****

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

* Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, and aggregation
* Topic and sentiment alignment in opinion analysis
* Applications of topic-sentiment analysis, e.g. corporate reputation measu=
rement, political orientation categorization, customer preference study, pu=
blic opinion study
* Issues in using topic-sentiment analysis as a new research method for mas=
s opinion estimation, such as reliability, validity, sample bias, etc.
* Sentiment identification and filtering at various text granularity
* Domain-dependency of sentiment analyzers
* Evaluation methodologies
* Performance issues, scalability and efficiency
* Web-based system demonstration
* Novel algorithms, tools and systems
* Construction of benchmark data sets
