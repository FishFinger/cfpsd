Workshop on Interface-based Approaches to Information Structure

Date: 13 - 15 September 2008
Location: University College London, UK
Workshop Website: http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/is/

Invited Speakers:

Ever since the debate between generative semantics and interpretive semantics, one of the central questions in grammatical theory is to what extent interpretation can be tied to syntactic position. Currently, there is a trend towards an isomorphic mapping, found in work on thematic interpretation (Baker 1988, Hale & Keyser 1993, 2002, Ramchand to appear), ordering of adverbs and adjectives (Cinque 1999), the interpretation of indefinites (Diesing 1992, Meinunger 2000, Adger 1993), etc. The same idea has also been used in the area of information structure, most explicitly in Rizzi (1997) and subsequent work.

In this workshop, we are interested in recent developments in information structure, and in particular in approaches that do not necessarily tie pragmatic interpretation to specific syntactic positions. One motivation behind these approaches is the expectation that they may lead to a more constrained syntax. We believe that information structure is a fruitful area to investigate the mapping between syntax and interpretation, as the same discourse notion can be expressed by various means, such as pitch accent, word order, morphological markers and so on. The rich variety in the type of empirical data creates a good testing ground for distinct hypotheses about the mapping.

There are two broad questions that we would like to explore. The first is how the syntactic distribution of discourse-related items can be explained without relying on designated functional projections. Proposals currently on the market argue that this can be achieved by exploiting independently motivated properties of the interfaces. The idea has been implemented in a variety of ways. Zubizarretta (1998), for example, relies on prosody, Neeleman & van de Koot (to appear) and Kucerova (2007) utilise the interpretative component, while Wagner (2007) makes use of both. 

The second question is whether traditional notions like topic and focus can be taken as grammatical primitives. Various researchers have attempted to reduce the number of notions that grammar can refer to in this domain.  There have been proposals that derive focus from givenness (Krifka 1998, Schwarzschild 1999, Sauerland 2004) and that aim to decompose contrastive topics (Büring 2003, Wagner 2007). A better understanding of these notions opens up the possibility of discovering new empirical generalisations. These may not only affect the relation between syntactic position and interpretation, but also the correspondence between interpretation and prosodic cues such as pitch accent and stress (for relevant discussion, see Dilley 2005 and Xu 2007). 

This workshop aims to provide a space to discuss and compare interface-based proposals and consider the issues that may be challenging for them. Proposals that account for the syntactic distribution in terms of semantics alone, for example, may encounter difficulties in explaining the fixed positions of focus and topic in languages like Basque, Hungarian and Turkish. Similarly, for analyses that account for the syntactic distribution of focus in terms of nuclear stress assignment alone, it is surprising that focus assignment in Chadic languages may correspond to differing prosodic phrasing (Kenstowicz 1985).

Abstracts are invited for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute commentary by a designated commentator. Accepted authors will be asked to submit a preliminary version of their papers (up to 15 pages) for the commentators. Selected papers from the workshop will be considered for peer-reviewed book publication.

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in 12-point font with 1'' margins, including data and references. Authors are requested to submit two copies of their abstract, one with their name and one anonymous. Abstracts must be submitted as a pdf attachment to: is-workshop@ling.ucl.ac.uk. The names of the files should be surname-named.pdf and surname-anon.pdf.

The body of the e-mail should contain the following information:
1. Name(s) of author(s) 
2. Title of talk 
3. Affiliation(s) 
4. E-mail address(es)

Important Dates:
Submission deadline for abstracts: 1 March 2008
Notification of acceptance: early May 2008
Deadline for draft for commentators: 15 June 2008
Responses from commentators: mid-August 2008
Workshop: 13 - 15 September 2008

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of Language Studies of the City University of Hong Kong will organize a Conference on 'Translation, Language Contact, and Multilingual Communication' - the second of a series of annual conferences - to be held from 13 to 15 August 2008 in Hong Kong. The Conference will be preceded by a Pre-Conference Institute on 11 and 12 August 2008. 

Officially launched in March 2006, The Halliday Centre has the distinct honour of being named after the world-renowned linguist, Professor M.A.K. Halliday. The Halliday Centre aims to expand opportunities for collaboration with global partners in China and the Asia-Pacific Region, Europe, North America and elsewhere, concentrating on research relating to corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and comparative language studies. 

Call for Papers

2nd HCLS Conference
Translation, Language Contact, and Multilingual Communication

The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of Language Studies (HCLS) invites you to participate in an International Conference on 

''Translation, Language Contact, and Multilingual Communication''

11 - 12 August 2008: Pre-Conference Institute
13 - 15 August 2008: Conference

City University of Hong Kong (CityU)

http://www.hallidaycentre.cityu.edu.hk/HCLS-C2-2008

Plenary Speakers:
Christian Matthiessen (Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia)
Adriana Pagano (University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil)
Erich Steiner (University of Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany)
Elke Teich (Technical University Darmstadt, Germany)
Chunshen Zhu (City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong)

The objective of the conference is to explore (the modelling of) translation, relate it to other forms of communications in contexts of multilinguality, and suggest ways in which translation as process and as product may contribute to language contact. Among relevant questions arising out of this theme are: What are the specific characteristics of translation, as opposed to other forms of text production? And hence, what are possible specific properties of translations as texts? Furthermore, what is the relationship of translation to other multilingual situations of communication? Also, and importantly, are there interesting senses in which we would want to speak of inter-semiotic translations, involving different modalities (music, visual, etc.?). And in what senses, and on which levels, is translation a context and a vehicle of language contact and language change? These questions are meant to illustrate some avenues of thought to be explored in the conference, but many ot!
 hers will no doubt be raised by contributors and participants.

The field is thus excitingly open to, and in need of, interpretation. We invite you to participate in this venture by presenting your thoughts on any aspect relevant to the topic of our conference. Please send abstracts for papers (35 minutes + 5 minutes discussion), approximately 400 words, in MS Word format to HCLS@cityu.edu.hk no later than 31 March 2008. Please show your name, designation, institution and country of residence on a separate page.

Information about a Pre-Conference Institute to be held 11 and 12 August will become available at http://www.hallidaycentre.cityu.edu.hk/HCLS-C2-2008 as soon as possible.

We look forward to receiving your abstracts and hope you will be able to participate in this conference at CityU in August 2008.

Yours sincerely,

Convenors:
Jonathan J. Webster, City University of Hong Kong, Director, HCLS
Erich Steiner, University of Saarland, Germany, Guest Convenor
Ruqaiya Hasan, Macquarie University, Australia, Programme Director, HCLS
