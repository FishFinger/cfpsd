Meeting Description

Natural Language Processing has long been used to automatically analyze language
produced by language learners. While much interesting research has been
reported, it is difficult to determine the state of the art for such automatic
analyses of learner language. For example, which error types and other language
properties can be detected and diagnosed automatically? How reliably is this
done, for which kind of learner language? 

These questions seem worth exploring given that for sustained progress in the
automatic analysis of learner language it arguably is essential to discuss and
compare the performance of different analysis methods, preferably on identical,
real-life data sets. As a prerequisite, it also is important to come to an
agreement on the error types and other learner language properties that are
useful and realistic to analyze.

These issues are not only relevant to NLP in Intelligent CALL but also intersect
in important ways with the research on learner corpora, the annotation schemes
developed for those, and the related Second Language Acquisition research.

In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers working on the analysis
of learner language in the broad sense, including work on annotation schemes for
learner corpora and NLP techniques used to detect learner errors and other
learner language properties. 

Second and Final CFP for the CALICO'08 Pre-Conference Workshop on
Automatic Analysis of Learner Language:
Bridging Foreign Language Teaching Needs and NLP Possibilities

March 18 or 19, 2008. University of San Francisco.

Submission Deadline: November 19, 2007

In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers working on the analysis
of learner language in the broad sense, including work on annotation schemes for
learner corpora and NLP techniques used to detect learner errors and other
learner language properties. We invite abstracts addressing these general
issues, including but not limited to:

- Which properties of learner language are useful and relevant to obtain for
Foreign Language Teaching and current Second Language Acquisition research?

- What annotation scheme or (error) taxonomy is appropriate for this and how do
different annotation schemes compare?

- How reliably can errors and other properties of learner language be obtained
automatically given the current state-of-the art in NLP?

- What is the impact of the specific properties of learner language on the
(re)use of NLP technology? How does it impact performance and the potential use
of such technology in foreign language teaching tools?

- Which annotated learner language corpora have been used or could be used to
evaluate the performance of different approaches to analyzing learner language?

We invite submissions of anonymous two page abstracts in an email with the
abstract as a pdf attachment. Name, affiliation, and email address should only
be included in the text of the email, not in the abstract in the pdf attachment.

Send submissions to: calico-workshop@ling.osu.edu
Submission Deadline: November 19

The workshop is organized by the ICALL Special Interest Group of CALICO,
currently chaired by Detmar Meurers (Ohio State University)
and Anne Rimrott (Simon Fraser University).
