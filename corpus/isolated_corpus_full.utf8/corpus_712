Hi all,

We've had an overwhelming response to the call for submissions for the Student Poster session as part of SummerFest '06 so we've decided to extend the session and run a couple of different streams over the course of the evening. This means that we now have room to accept more submissions!

If you would like to attend SummerFest '06 all you need to do is submit a title and 200-word abstract for the Student Poster session by Wednesday 25th October and we'll send you further details about how you can register for SummerFest '06 and get your travel expenses covered by HCSNet. Don't miss out, get your submission in today!

Here is the link to the Student Poster session so you can find out more information http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest06/posters

And here is the link to find out more about the great courses we have on offer at this year's Summer School http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest06/summerschool

Please send your submissions to sfest06@hcsnet.edu.au by COB Wednesday 25th October.

We look forward to seeing you at this year's SummerFest!

Cheers,

Kym Buckley
SummerFest '06 Organiser
