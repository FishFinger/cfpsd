Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2007 

Meeting Description
Held in conjunction with the 18th Int'l Congress of Linguists (CIL 18).
Organized by Chungmin Lee (Seoul Natl U) and Ferenc Kiefer (Hunagrian Academy of
Sciences) in a dynamic perspective on semantics and/or pragmatics. 

It is fairly well established by now that meaning is regarded as representing
update potential rather than merely truth conditions, taking a dynamic
perspective on semantics and/or pragmatics. Topic - Focus information structure
becomes more complex because of discourse-connected, largely quantificational,
contrastiveness; sets of alternatives are involved in Contrastive Topic and
Contrastive Focus. Contrastiveness and the range of alternatives must be further
explored. 

At the same time, sets of alternatives are required in the computation of scalar
implicatures. What would be the range of relevant or comparable alternatives?
Gricean, neo-Gricean, relevance-theoretic or other 'relevant'? Utterances with
Contrastive Topic generate scalar implicatures. How do other utterances generate
scalar implicatures? Is the exhaustivity operator exh good enough? What would be
an adequate representation - pragmatic, semantic or syntactic? How can a
game-theoretic approach serve as a new model? What other scales work except
Horn's entailment scales? We need a forum to discuss and resolve these
cutting-edge issues. 

Invited Speakers 
Larry Horn (Yale)
Robert van Rooy (Amsterdam)
Enric Vallduvi (Pompeu Fabra)
