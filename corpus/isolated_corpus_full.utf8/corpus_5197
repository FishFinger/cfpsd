Full Title: Constructions and Frames 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science;Computational Linguistics;General Linguistics;Semantics;Sociolinguistics;Typology 

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2009 

Constructions and Frames is an international peer-reviewed journal,
published by John Benjamins, that provides a forum for construction-based
approaches to language analysis. Constructional models emphasize the role
of constructions in stating language-specific and cross-linguistic
generalizations. Frame Semantics elaborates the analysis of form-meaning
relationships by focusing on lexical semantic issues that are relevant to
grammatical structure.

Constructions and Frames publishes articles which range from descriptions
of grammatical phenomena in different languages to
constructionally-oriented work in cognitive linguistics, grammaticalization
theory, typology, interactional linguistics, poetics, and sociolinguistics.
Articles that explore applications to related fields, e.g. communication
studies, computational linguistics, lexicography, psychology, and
anthropology, are also invited.

Constructions and Frames invites submissions on relevant topics.
Submissions for Volume 1 Issue 2 will be accepted until 30-Jun-2009 at
least. Please contact the journal's editors:
Kyoko Ohara: ohara@hc.cc.keio.ac.jp, Kiki Nikiforidou: vnikifor@enl.uoa.gr

Advisory Editors: Mirjam Fried, Jan-Ola Ostman

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2009
