CoNLL Shared Task 2008



              Final Call for Participation



The shared task at the Conference on Computational Natural

Language Learning (CoNLL) 2008 will be devoted to the joint

parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies. This effort

unifies the shared task evaluations of the past four years

under a common umbrella. The task has several novel points:



1. Performing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) on a

    dependency-based representation for semantic relations,

2. The SRL problem will address not only propositions

    centered around verbal predicates (from PropBank) but

    also around nominal predicates (from NomBank).

3. The syntactic dependencies to be modeled will be more

    complex than the ones used in the previous CoNLL

    evaluations. We now include dependencies internal to

    base noun phrases, a cleaner representation of gapping,

    traces, etc.



This shared task evaluation is separated into two challenges:

a closed challenge, where systems have to be built strictly

with information contained in the given training corpus, and

an open challenge, where the participants are encouraged to

use any kind of external tools and resources.



The shared task will be part of the CoNLL conference to be

held in conjunction with Coling-07 in in Manchester, UK,

August 16-17, 2008.



The important dates for the shared task are as follows (please

note that this is a tentative timeline and it may shift

slightly before the shared task starts):



1. Registration of participants - February 25th

2. Release of a small trial data set - February 29th

3. Release of training and development data sets - March 10th

4. Release of test data - May 9th

5. Submission of test runs - May 16th

6. Submission of papers - May 30th

7. Notification of acceptance - June 16th

8. Camera-ready deadline - June 30th



In order to take part in the shared task, participants should

register their intent to participate, in either or both of the

two tracks, by sending an e-mail to conll08st@lsi.upc.edu.



The website for the CoNLL shared task 2008 is

This site is updated continually, so please make sure

to check it out from time to time.
