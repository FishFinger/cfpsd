Meeting Description:

Every year, the annual conference on Technology for Second Language Learning
(TSLL) provides a venue for researchers and practitioners of CALL and related
technologies to share their findings and theoretical perspectives on an issue of
general interest to those involved in the use of technology for second language
acquisition. 

Call for Papers

This year, the seventh annual TSLL will be held in conjunction with the
inaugural conference of Pronunciation in Second Language Learning and Teaching.
The Conference will explore how the teaching of speaking and listening can be
facilitated through the use of technology as well as important issues raised by 
trying to promote spoken interaction using technology.

We welcome papers and poster presentations addressing all facets of technology 
for oral communication including:
 
- How can technology be used to promote spoken interaction?
- How can new technologies best be blended with printed materials to draw on
their complementary strengths? 
- How can the use of spoken corpora improve materials design and classroom 
teaching?
- How can listening materials be made interactive using computer technology?
- How can technology be used to assess listening and speaking skills?
- How can multimedia technology enhance listening comprehension?
- How can technology be used to supplement spoken language instruction for
varied student populations from young learners to teens to adults to specific 
purposes students?
- In what ways do teacher education programs need to change to help 
promote the use of technology for teaching oral communication?

Please submit a 250-word abstract to Ivon Katz (ivon@iastate.edu) by May 1, 2009
if you wish to present a paper or a poster at the conference.  Acceptances will
be sent out by May 15.  Please specify whether you would like your abstract to
be considered as a paper or a poster.
