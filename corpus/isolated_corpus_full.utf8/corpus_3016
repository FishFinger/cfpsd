Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:   

THE NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE, CULTURE AND CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONS   
Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA   
24-27 June 2009   
http://www.ManagementConference.com   

The primary interest of the Management Conference is knowledge-based social and economic change. Driven by globalisation and advances in information and communications technologies, this change has been characterised in terms of emerging information/knowledge societies and a global knowledge-based economy.

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Proposals are reviewed within four weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.ManagementConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Boston in June 2009.

Also, we would like to remind you of the 2008 Conference which will be held 5-8 August at Cambridge University, UK. Please visit www.ManagementConference.com for details.   

Yours Sincerely,

Marcus Breen   
Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA   
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Knowledge, Culture and Change in Organisations
