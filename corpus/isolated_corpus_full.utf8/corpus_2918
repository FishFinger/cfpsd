EACL 2009: First Call for Papers
March 30 - April 3, 2009
Athens, Greece
URL: http://www.eacl2009.gr


Submission deadline: October 10, 2008


EACL 2009 is the 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics. The conference invites the
submission of papers on substantial, original, and unpublished
research on all aspects of computational linguistics, including, but
not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
- spoken language processing and language modeling;
- word segmentation, tagging, and chunking;
- syntax, parsing, and grammar formalisms;
- lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation;
- compositional semantics and textual entailment;
- pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue;
- lexicon, lexical databases, and ontologies;
- generation and summarization;
- information retrieval, question answering, and information
  extraction;
- machine translation and multilingual systems;
- dialogue systems and multimodal systems;
- language resources and tools, and resources for lesser studied
  languages;
- linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language;
- machine learning and algorithms for natural language;
- evaluation methodology.


Requirements

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for
presentation at EACL 2009 cannot be presented or have been presented
at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other conferences or
workshops must indicate this on the submission page.


Review and Selection

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind, and all submissions will
receive three independent reviews. Final decisions on the program will
be made by the Program Committee, consisting of the Program Co-Chairs
and Area Chairs.  Submissions will be assessed with respect to
appropriateness, clarity, soundness/correctness, meaningful
comparison, originality/innovativeness, and impact of ideas or
results.


Publication and Presentation

All papers that are accepted will be published in the proceedings of
the conference, and will be presented as a poster or an oral
presentation.  Authors will be asked on submission to state their
preferred mode of presentation, and the program committee will attempt
to fulfill as many of these preferences as possible, organizational
factors permitting.  EACL 2009 will additionally aim to give poster
presentations higher status than usual (by scheduling, physical
arrangement, combination with refreshments). The proceedings will not
distinguish long papers by presentation format.


Submission Information

All submissions must be electronic in PDF and must follow the
two-column format of EACL proceedings. Authors are strongly
recommended to use the style files available on the conference web
site. The maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages of content
and one (1) additional page of references. The page limits have to be
strictly observed.

As reviewing will be double-blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". (Do not use anonymous
citations.) Do not include acknowledgments. Papers that do not conform
to these requirements will be rejected without review.

The deadline for submission is 23:59 CET on October 10,
2008. Additional instructions for electronic submission will be posted
on the conference website at http://www.eacl2009.gr.
