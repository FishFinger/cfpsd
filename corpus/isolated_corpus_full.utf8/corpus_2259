Full Title: Abstract Objects: Semantics and Philosophy of Mathematics 

Date: 29-Feb-2008 - 01-Mar-2008
Location: Paris, France 
Contact Person: Alexandra Arapinis

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics 

Call Deadline: 13-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description:

Joint Paris-Arché Workshop:

Institut d'Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences et des Techniques,IHPST
(CNRS/Paris 1/ENS)
Arché, The AHRC Research Centre for the Philosophy of Logic, Language,
Mathematics and Mind, University of St Andrews, Scotland, UK

Internal Speakers:

Paul McCallion (Arché-StAndrews)

The issue of the existence and nature of abstract objects has a long and
controversial history in philosophy. On the one hand, such objects - in
particular, numbers and sets - are apparently the subject matter of ordinary
mathematical thought, and seem to be indispensable to an account of mathematical
content. On the other hand, how can we come to refer to and know about such
objects, since we cannot interact causally with them? This issue naturally
extends to broader questions in general semantics. Can the intuitions deposited
in the semantics of ordinary language play a role in an explanation of reference
to abstract objects? To what extent can plural quantification provide an
'ontologically innocent' account of the matter?

This workshop aims at promoting interdisciplinary research on this topic at the
interface between semantics, ontology, and the philosophy of mathematics. 

We invite high-quality papers on the topic. Electronic submissions to the
following address are welcome:

alexandra.arapinis@malix.univ-paris1.fr

Please include your name and institutional affiliation in the body of the
e-mail, and attach an anonymous abstract of no more than two pages for
refereeing. Abstracts can be submitted in .doc, .rtf, .ps, or .pdf.

Authors will be notified of acceptance by January 31, 2008.
