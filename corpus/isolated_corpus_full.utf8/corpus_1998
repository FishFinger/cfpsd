Meeting Description

'Lexical meaning' is of particular relevance in argumentation, as it is the
context as a whole that activates interpretation processes: encoded meaning can
be considered as a tool for arriving at the intended (i.e. communicated)
meaning. From this communicative-pragmatic point of view, great attention must
be paid to the implicit communicated meaning (Carston 2002), which can be
presupposed (Greco 2003) or inferred. Textualizing procedures of argumentative
moves have received considerable attention in linguistic research oriented
towards discourse analysis (Rigotti 2005; Rocci 2005; Stati 2002 e 1990). These
studies fall within so-called Argumentation Theory (van Eemeren & Grootendorst
2004; Walton 1996; Plantin 1999), which operates from an interdisciplinary
perspective, where linguists interact with philosophers and communication
theorists. 

The ''auxiliary lexicon of argumentation'', a set which includes a wide range of
elements (functional words, simple and composite lexemes, free phrases,
locutions, propositions, etc.), communicates the argumentative functions of
utterances as well as the relations between them. They can be made explicit, for
example, through the use of connectors, which allow parts of the text to be
organised whether produced by a single speaker or co-produced by two or more
speakers. On the other hand, they may be left implicit, in which case textual
relations are recognized by means of interpretive processes that can be
''activated'' also by their encoded meaning (cfr. Moeschler 1989; Stati 1990;
Sperber & Wilson 1995; Dascal 2003; Gobber & Gatti & Cigada 2006).

The study of lexical meaning becomes more relevant in contexts, where it is
necessary to compare the structure of argumentative processes in texts produced
in different languages. This is because the inter-linguistic perspective
involves the inter-cultural one, especially in translating processes.

The I.A.D.A. Workshop organized by the Department of Foreign Languages and
Literatures at the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan aims to
investigate lexical meaning, in the light of inferential processes implied in
the linear structure of dialogue. The Workshop will also focus on specific
themes in three panels, coordinated by Marcello Soffritti, Margherita Ulrych and
Christian Plantin. From a translational perspective and with reference to German
and English, two panels will address encoded meaning and the encoded
meaning/effective meaning interface in argumentation; while the third will
investigate the emotive dimension of argumentative dialogues.

Following are listed several possible thematic areas of the Workshop which can
be treated, with reference to argumentative dialogue, according to different
perspectives: intra-linguistic, confrontative-contrastive, translational etc.
Suggested thematic areas:

Argumentative connectors
Words or expressions introducing illocutive functions and argumentative roles
Words or expressions used to refer to the speakers or to the source of information
Expressions introducing fallacies
Paraphrases of argumentative roles
Interface syntax/argumentative structure
Words or expressions introducing figures of word and figures of thought
Prototypical and peripheral meaning
Keywords in argumentation
Emotive meaning
Argumentation (and emotive argumentation) in conversation
Strategic use of definition in argumentative dialogues
"Logical" and "rhetorical" linguistic means

Contributions concerning other thematic areas will also be accepted on condition
that they are relevant to the general subject of the Workshop.

Workshop languages:
Italian, German, French, English.

Deadline for the presentation of abstracts:
Your anonymous abstract (2000 characters in Word format), written in English,
should be posted before 30 November 2007 to the electronic mail address
workshop.iada2008@unicatt.it. The abstract must contain the following information:

Title
Workshop Section (General Linguistics, German/French/ English Linguistics)
Language of the paper or panel: Italian, German, French, English
