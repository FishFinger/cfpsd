 WORKSHOP SCOPE
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The goal of the STEP workshop is to provide a forum for anyone active
in semantic processing of text to discuss innovative technologies,
representation issues, inference techniques, prototype
implementations, and real applications. The preferred processing
targets are large quantities of texts -- either specialised domains,
or open domains such as newswire text, blogs, and wikipedia-like text.
Implemented rather than theoretical work is emphasised in STEP.
In particular, relevant topics are:

- wide-coverage semantic/logical analysis of text
- computation and use of discourse relations
- use of lexical-conceptual and semantically related resources
- thematic role labelling in semantic representations
- word sense disambiguation in semantic representations
- implementations of specific semantic phenomena
- anaphora or ellipsis resolution in semantic representations
- implementations of sentiment analysis
- automatic detection of subjective and non-literal language
- acquisition of lexical knowledge and paraphrase from raw corpora
- background knowledge acquisition, representation, and selection
- semantic lexicons and ontologies for text interpretation
- learning semantic representations from raw text
- automated reasoning in the service of semantic analysis of text
- creation of gold standard meaning representations
- evaluation of semantic representations
- textual entailment and consistency checking
- systems that extract, represent or manipulate text meaning
- applications of semantic analysis in text processing

Applications inlude, but are not limited to, machine translation, text
understanding, question answering, summarisation, information
extraction, and the semantic web.


 SUBMISSIONS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Authors are now invited to submit short papers presenting system
descriptions, position papers, project descriptions, or ongoing work.
Selected short papers will be presented at the workshop during the
poster session.

Submissions should be in Abobe PDF format, not exceed four A4-sized
pages, written in English and typeset in a 11 point font.  Detailed
guidelines and a latex stylefile package are available at the STEP
2008 web page. Paper submission will be electronic using the EasyChair
system: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dstep2008

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the
programme committee. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop
proceedings.
