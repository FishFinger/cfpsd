Meeting Description:

Information Structure 2009
Between Linguistics and Psycholinguistics 

Call for Papers

Conference Description:
Although Information Structure (IS) was introduced in linguistics by the Prague
School functionalism [Firbas (1962/1964), Dane? (1964/1968), see Sgall, Haji?ová
& Panevová (1986), Firbas (1992) and Newmeyer (2001) for an overview], it is
only in the last few decades that systematic research on IS has started. By now,
many empirical analyses of specific facts involving IS are available [cf., among
many others, Charolles' (1997/2003) work on left-dislocated adverbials in
French]. From a theoretical point of view, recent research focuses on two major
topics: (i) the notional foundations of IS theory [cf. Vallduví (1992),
Lambrecht (1994), Erteschik-Shir (1997/2007)], and (ii) the development of
models of grammar which account for the interaction between IS, syntax and
semantics. For instance, several multi-level integrated models of grammar have
been proposed by scholars working in a functional perspective [cf. Pollard & Sag
(1994), Bresnan (2001), Jackendoff (2002), Croft (2001), Goldberg (1995),
Williams (2003), Van Valin & La Polla (1997)]. Likewise, whereas generative
studies used to exclude the influence of the context, IS notions have recently
been integrated into the 'cartographic' approach initiated by Rizzi (1997/2004)
[cf. also Haegeman (2003/2004/2006/2007)]. 

Although the relevance of IS for linguistic analysis is now widely recognized,
its precise nature and its position in human language and cognition are still
poorly understood. Besides the terminological and conceptual fuzziness that
often characterizes analyses on the basis of IS, this can be attributed to two
factors. Firstly, there still is a significant gap in the literature between
theoretical approaches and descriptive analyses of IS. Whereas the former
contain relatively few detailed empirical analyses of linguistic data, the
latter either focus on a particular linguistic phenomenon in one or several
languages or consider several IS-driven syntactic configurations in a particular
language. The second factor goes beyond the purely linguistic side of the
problem. At this stage of research it is unclear to which extent phenomena such
as topic and focus are purely linguistic notions (i.e. grammar- driven) or
belong to specific cognitive mechanisms interacting with language. It is very
likely that IS-phenomena cannot fully be captured by linguistics because IS is
in part a matter of human cognition. This suggests that linguistic research on
IS should be complemented with interdisciplinary psycholinguistic research and
vice versa, in order to test the psycholinguistic hypothesis [cf. Levelt
(1989)], according to whom IS is absolutely fundamental in language production
and prior to (rather than simultaneous with) purely linguistic processes
concerning form and meaning [cf. the research projects "Spatial Framing
Adverbials : linguistic and psycholinguistic approaches" at the laboratory
LaTTiCe Paris & "Information Structure in Language Acquisition" at the Max
Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics Nijmegen].

The aim of this conference is to bring together linguists and psycholinguists
from different theoretical perspectives to discuss the interface between IS,
syntax and semantics, as well as the application of psycholinguistic methods to
IS phenomena. We invite papers presenting an empirical analysis of specific
language facts or more general theoretical papers about the interaction between
IS, syntax, semantics and/or human cognition. We particularly welcome
contributions which, more or less explicitly, apply ideas of the key-note
speakers. A special session will be dedicated to IS in French.

Nomi Erteschik-Shir 
(Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel & Harvard University, USA)
Robert Van Valin 
(University of Buffalo, USA & Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany)

Location: London, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Jon Millington
Meeting Email: jon.millington@sas.ac.uk

Meeting Description:

The Third International Conference on the Linguistics of Contemporary English
ICLCE3
14/15-17 July 2009
Institute of English Studies
Senate House
University of London 

Second Call for Papers
 
The attention devoted to the linguistics of the English language has resulted in
a broad body of work in diverse research traditions. The aim of the ICLCE
conference is to encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas between different
frameworks and research traditions, all of which may address any aspect of the
linguistics of contemporary English. The first and second ICLCE conferences were
held in Edinburgh (2005) and Toulouse (2007) along the same lines. We aim for
the London conference to build on the success of those events.

The main conference will be preceded on 14 July 2009 by a one-day symposium to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Survey of English Usage, founded by
Randolph Quirk at UCL. The theme of this symposium will be 'Current Change in
the English Verb Phrase'.

Plenary speakers at the main conference:
James Blevins (Cambridge)
Bernd Kortmann (Freiburg)
James M. Scobbie (Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh)
Sali Tagliamonte (Toronto)
 
Instructions for the submission of abstracts can be found here:

This conference is organized by the Linguistics Department, Queen Mary,
University of London (QMUL) and the Survey of English Usage (SEU) at UCL  in
collaboration with the Institute of English Studies.
