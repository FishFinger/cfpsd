Fourteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference
July 13-16, 2009
Trinity College, Cambridge, United Kingdom
Conference website: www.lfg09.net
Conference e-mail (NOT for abstract submission): Anna Kibort (ak243@cam.ac.uk) 

Call for Papers

Abstract submission receipt deadline: 15 February 2009, 11:59 pm GMT
Abstracts should be submitted using the online submission system at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?=LFG09

The 14th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be held at
Trinity College, Cambridge, from July 13th to 16th, 2009.

LFG 2009 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical- Functional
Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the
'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel,
constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and
collaboration among
researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar
is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple
levels of structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical
relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the
following sites:
http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/
http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/lfg/

Submissions: Talks and Posters
The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15 min.
discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions can focus on results
from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel
approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical,
formal or computational. Presentations should describe original, unpublished work.

Dissertation Session
As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will give
students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other student
research dissertations). The dissertations must be completed by the time of the
conference, and they should be made publicly accessible (e.g., on the World Wide
Web). The talks in this session should provide an overview of the main original
points of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes, followed by a
10-minute discussion period. The International LFG Association (ILFGA) will pay
the conference fees for the students presenting at the student session.

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to student
submissions.

Timetable
Deadline for abstracts: 15 February 2009
Acceptances sent out:   31 March 2009
Conference: July 13-16 2009

Submission Specifications
Abstracts for talks, posters/demonstrations and the dissertation session must be
received by February 15, 2009. All abstracts should be submitted using the
online submission system. Submissions should be in the form of abstracts only.
Abstracts can be up to two A4 pages in 10pt or larger type and should include a
title. Omit name and affiliation, and obvious self-reference. Note: we no longer
ask for a separate page for data and figures (c-/f- and related structures).
They can be included in the text of the abstract, obeying the overall two-page
limit. Please submit your abstract in .pdf or .doc format. If you have any
trouble converting your
file into any of these formats, please contact the Program Committee at the
address below.

While the number of submissions is not restricted, at most one single-authored
submission or two first-authored submissions per person will be accepted for
oral presentation. Authors may want to keep this in mind when stating their
preferences concerning the mode of presentation of their submissions.

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people. Papers will appear in
the proceedings, which will be published online by CSLI Publications. Selected
papers may also appear in a printed volume published by CSLI Publications.

Organisers and Their Contact Addresses
If you have queries about abstract submission or have problems using the
EasyChair submission system, please contact the Program Committee.
