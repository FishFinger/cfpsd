Meeting Description:

Merging Textualities, Emerging Paradigms

Hosted by the Graduate Student Organization, this colloquium is organized to
provide graduate students with an opportunity to share their current work and
research interests.

Scott Schwenter
Ohio State University
Linguistics Keynote Speaker

In this Colloquium we seek to explore new and innovative ways to approach
linguistics and its idiosyncrasies. While the field has had a long trajectory,
our focus is towards the emerging perspectives that will pave the way that lies
ahead. We also aspire to comprehend the consequences and implications of these
upcoming outlooks.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

-New challenges for SLA learners in the globalized world 
-Current tendencies in bilingualism and education 
-Multilingualism: clashing identities 
-Relimiting definitions of language 
-Language expansion and power 
-Idiosyncrasies in Syntax and Semantics Interface 
-Reinterpreting meaning and form 
-Experimental phonology and phonetics 
-Pragmatics of intercultural situations 
-Novel focuses on Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics 
-Discourse analysis of multiple modalities 

Debra A. Castillo
Cornell University
Literature Keynote Speaker

The medium is the message. Using this conceptual framework, our conference will
explore how historical changes in media from the oral to the digital lead to the
emergence of hybrid literary forms and the constant reinvention of literariness
itself. With the revolution of (e)merging technologies as our schema, we seek
pluralistic and interdisciplinary research on the dynamic network linking modes
of communication, mass media and textuality.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

-Manuscripts, archives and cartography 
-The sublimation of the oral and the primacy of the visual 
-Rise and fall of the Lettered City 
-Journalism and/as literature 
-From the page to the stage and screen 
-Words, music and images
-Agency, memory and witness bearing 
-Gender performativity 
-Hybrid Genres: Factual fiction, reality and verisimilitude 
-Silence in texts and silenced texts 
-Writing in the age of blogs, collective authorship and digitalization

Please see http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/spanish/graduate/colloquia/ for more
information. 

Papers in English, Portuguese and Spanish will be considered. Reading time of
final papers is limited to 15 minutes. The organizing committee encourages
submissions of panels (not to exceed three papers) organized around a specific
topic, author, theory or work. Papers in Portuguese are strongly encouraged.

Please submit an abstract of approximately 250 words electronically by August
