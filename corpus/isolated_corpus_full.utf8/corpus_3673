The Asian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Journal
(http://www.asian-efl-journal.com/index.php) has again expanded rapidly and
is now looking for around 10-15 more volunteers as review editors and/or
proofreaders. Review editors work in small review teams, each team of 5
reviewers being supervised by an associate editor. Currently we have 12
such teams. Potential volunteers are asked to examine our webpage and our
submission criteria (http://www.asian-efl-journal.com/submissions_journal.php) 

AEJ does not make a distinction between native or non-native English users
and strongly encourages a variety of voices within a broad Asian and
international  context. We do prefer reviewers to have a strong interest
and/or experience in EFL in Asia but will consider any volunteers who feel
they can contribute to the journal's international mission. 

Volunteers should contact the Senior Associate Editor Dr Roger Nunn by
e-mail (rogercnunn@yahoo.co.u), attaching a brief CV indicating
qualifications, experience of teaching or researching in Asia and including
a list of the volunteer's own publications. Please specify if you are
interested in reviewing, proofreading or both.
