Meeting Description:

An international conference at the University of California, Los Angeles on 
the languages of Southeast Asia

January 30-February 1, 2009

This conference aims to bridge the gap between linguists research 
languages of Southeast Asia and specialists in Southeast Asian area 
studies. By providing a forum for presentations of new research and the 
exchange of ideas, we aim to create fresh conversations between scholars 
and teachers of Southeast Asian languages.  Building on the 2000 UCLA 
Conference on Heritage Language Research Priorities, we also hope to 
stimulate new research linkages with scholars and teachers working 
among Heritage language communities. 

Call for Papers

The linguistic map of Southeast Asia is extraordinarily rich, embracing a 
wide range of ethnic and typological groups, including Austronesian, 
Hmong-Mien, Mon-Khmer, Tai-Kadai, Tibeto-Burman, and the many 
language families of New Guinea. The shifting boundaries of Southeast 
Asian polities over time, historic cross-regional migration, and colonization 
have all added to the complexity of language genealogies in the region, 
making Southeast Asia a particularly fertile field not only for the study of 
specific language types and groups but also for the testing and 
development of theoretical frameworks and models of linguistic analysis. 
Recent outward migrations to the USA, Europe and elsewhere, and the 
concomitant rise in Hmong, Khmer, Lao, Tagalog and other heritage 
language groups, present further opportunities for the study of Southeast 
Asian languages.

Despite the critical place of language studies in the development of area 
studies, and the diverse implications and applications of linguistics for other 
fields, the conversation between scholars of Southeast Asian linguistics 
and specialists in Southeast Asian area studies is surprisingly thin. And, 
within the U.S., Southeast Asian language communities such as Hmong, 
Khmer, Vietnamese, Lao and Tagalog risk being sidelined in the emerging 
body of scholarship on Heritage Language learning and teaching, whose 
focus gravitates towards larger communities such as Spanish and Chinese 
speaking communities.

Keynote Speakers
Bernard Comrie (Max Planck / University of California, Santa Barbara)
Andrew Simpson (University of Southern California)
John Hartman (Northern Illinois University)

We invite papers on Southeast Asian languages in any area of linguistics-
phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, 
typology, diachronic and comparative linguistics, sociolinguistics, 
anthropological linguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis-or 
language teaching. We particularly encourage papers that engage with 
other disciplines.  Submissions from early career researchers and graduate 
students are strongly encouraged. In addition, a special poster session for 
undergraduate research will be held. Limited competitive financial 
assistance for travel is available. 

Abstracts of no more than 500 words should be sent to the UCLA Center 
for Southeast Asian Studies cseas@international.ucla.edu, by Monday, 
November 3, 2008. Please indicate whether the submission is for a talk or 
for the undergraduate poster session. Notification of acceptance will be 
sent out by December 1, 2008.

Full Title: Contrastive Media Analysis 

Date: 12-Jul-2009 - 17-Jul-2009
Location: Melbourne, Australia 
Contact Person: Martin Luginbuehl
Meeting Email: luginbuehl@ds.uzh.ch

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

Contrastive Media Analysis- approaches to linguistic and cultural aspects 
of text types 

The linguistic concept of ?text type" (sometimes also ?communicative 
genre") has proven to be a helpful concept to analyze the various (and 
culturally shaped) forms of communication in a given society. Works in the 
field of ?contrastive textology" (e. g. by Spillner, Hartmann, Adamzik, 
Eckkrammer, PÃ¶ckl) have documented that  ?identical" text types vary 
depending on different cultural contexts and different language areas. With 
a special focus on text types in the mass media the panel takes up these 
works and aims at advancing and broadening the methodological and 
theoretical discussions involved. This is due to the observation that in 
contrastive studies of text types not only the theoretical status of ?culture" 
but also the interdependent relations between the theoretical 
conceptualization of ?culture" and the methodological approaches of text 
analysis often remain unclear.

A prominent way to compare mass media texts is to compare single text 
types from different nations or language areas (and thus implying a 
concept of nation or language specific text types) and to explain the 
differences with simplified versions of concepts like ?Americanization". 
Nevertheless, mass media texts could be a source for more differenciated 
work especially if the relation between language (use) and culture is at 
stake. What makes the study of media texts challenging and rewarding is 
that they circulate globally, but they usually are adopted 
(or ?indigenized"/?localized") for a local spectator-/readership at the same 
time.

Therefore the leading questions of the panel are:
- When comparing text types from different cultural contexts which texts 
are ?equivalent" and can therefore be compared appropriately?
- Which aspects can be compared - and how can the selection of these 
aspects be justified by the texts that are analyzed? To what extent does 
the corpus compilation influence the findings?
- What are the implications of different understandings of ?culture" (e.g. 
culture as a homogeneous ?whole" vs. culture as a hetergeneous, dynamic 
and process-related concept)? Should ?culture" be related to entire nations 
(as it is the case in many studies), to a language area or to another (local 
or translocal) ?community of practice"?
- How can the macrophenomenon ?culture" be related to a micro analysis 
of text structures? How can it empirically be made plausible that text types 
of a group reflect  specific, culturally shaped world views?
- How can one allow for the often postulated tendency towards 
globalization and internationalization on the one hand and cultural 
fragmentation and hybridization of social affiliation on the other hand?

These and related questions should be addressed by the speakers  while 
concentrating on mass media texts (if other text types are studied, the 
above questions should be addressed and the relevance for the study of 
mass media texts should be made clear). The goal of the panel is not only 
to gain a deeper understanding of the  methodological and theoretical 
aspects but also to discuss (and further develop) ways of contrastive 
media analysis.

If you are interested in contributing a paper to this panel please  
send a 600 word abstract to Martin LuginbÃ¼hl (luginbuehl@ds.uzh.ch) and 
Stefan Hauser (stefan.hauser@gmx.ch) by 15th October 2008.

Panel Organisers:
Stefan Hauser (University of Zurich) and Martin LuginbÃ¼hl (University  
of Zurich)
