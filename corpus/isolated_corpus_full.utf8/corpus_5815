     Semantics for the Rest of Us: Variants of
      Semantic Web Languages in the Real World

    http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2009/SemRUs-ISWC09/

       Workshop held in conjunction with the
    Eighth International Semantic Web Conference
          26 October 2009, Washington, DC

The Semantic Web is a broad vision of the future of personal computing,
emphasizing the use of sophisticated knowledge representation as the  
basis for
end-user applications' data modeling and management needs. Key to the
pervasive adoption of Semantic Web technologies is a good set of  
fundamental
"building blocks" - the most important of these are representation  
languages
themselves. W3C's standard languages for the Semantic Web, RDF and  
OWL, have
been around for several years. Instead of strict standards compliance,  
we see
"variants" of these languages emerge in applications, often tailored  
to a
particular application's needs. These variants are often either  
subsets of OWL
or supersets of RDF, typically with fragments OWL added. Extensions  
based on
rules, such as SWRL and N3 logic, have been developed as well as  
enhancements
to the SPARQL query language and protocol.

This workshop will explore the landscape of RDF, OWL and SPARQL  
variants,
specifically from the standpoint of "real-world semantics". Are there
commonalities in these variants that might suggest new standards or new
versions of the existing standards?  We hope to identify common  
requirements
of applications consuming Semantic Web data and understand the pros  
and cons
of a strictly formal approach to modeling data versus a "scruffier"  
approach
where semantics are based on application requirements and implementation
restrictions.

The workshop will encourage active audience participation and
discussion and will include a keynote by  Sandro Hawke (http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/ 
).

Topics of interest include but are not limited to

- Real world applications that use (variants of) RDF, OWL, and SPARQL
- Use cases for different subsets/supersets of RDF, OWL, and SPARQL
- Extensions of SWRL and N3Logic
- RIF dialects
- How well do current Semantic Web standards meet system requirements?
- Real world `semantic' applications using other representations (XML,  
JSON)
- Alternatives to RDF, OWL or SPARQL
- Are ad hoc subsets of SW languages leading to problems?
- What level of expressive power does the Semantic Web need?
- Does the Semantic Web require languages based on formal methods?
- How should standard Semantic Web languages be designed?

SUBMISSION

We seek two kinds of submissions: full papers up to ten pages long and
