Call for Papers

Ever since the debate between generative semantics and interpretive semantics,
one of the central questions in grammatical theory is to what extent
interpretation can be tied to syntactic position. Currently, there is a trend
towards an isomorphic mapping, found in work on thematic interpretation (Baker
1988, Hale & Keyser 1993, 2002, Ramchand to appear), ordering of adverbs and
adjectives (Cinque 1999), the interpretation of indefinites (Diesing 1992,
Meinunger 2000, Adger 1993), etc. The same idea has also been used in the area
of information structure, most explicitly in Rizzi (1997) and subsequent work.

In this workshop, we are interested in recent developments in information
structure, and in particular in approaches that do not necessarily tie pragmatic
interpretation to specific syntactic positions. One motivation behind these
approaches is the expectation that they may lead to a more constrained syntax.
We believe that information structure is a fruitful area to investigate the
mapping between syntax and interpretation, as the same discourse notion can be
expressed by various means, such as pitch accent, word order, morphological
markers and so on. The rich variety in the type of empirical data creates a good
testing ground for distinct hypotheses about the mapping.

There are two broad questions that we would like to explore. The first is how
the syntactic distribution of discourse-related items can be explained without
relying on designated functional projections. Proposals currently on the market
argue that this can be achieved by exploiting independently motivated properties
of the interfaces. The idea has been implemented in a variety of ways.
Zubizarretta (1998), for example, relies on prosody, Neeleman & van de Koot (to
appear) and Kucerova (2007) utilise the interpretative component, while Wagner
(2007) makes use of both. 

The second question is whether traditional notions like topic and focus can be
taken as grammatical primitives. Various researchers have attempted to reduce
the number of notions that grammar can refer to in this domain.  There have been
proposals that derive focus from givenness (Krifka 1998, Schwarzschild 1999,
Sauerland 2004) and that aim to decompose contrastive topics (Büring 2003,
Wagner 2007). A better understanding of these notions opens up the possibility
of discovering new empirical generalisations. These may not only affect the
relation between syntactic position and interpretation, but also the
correspondence between interpretation and prosodic cues such as pitch accent and
stress (for relevant discussion, see Dilley 2005 and Xu 2007). 

This workshop aims to provide a space to discuss and compare interface-based
proposals and consider the issues that may be challenging for them. Proposals
that account for the syntactic distribution in terms of semantics alone, for
example, may encounter difficulties in explaining the fixed positions of focus
and topic in languages like Basque, Hungarian and Turkish. Similarly, for
analyses that account for the syntactic distribution of focus in terms of
nuclear stress assignment alone, it is surprising that focus assignment in
Chadic languages may correspond to differing prosodic phrasing (Kenstowicz 1985).

Abstracts are invited for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute
commentary by a designated commentator. Accepted authors will be asked to submit
a preliminary version of their papers (up to 15 pages) for the commentators.
Selected papers from the workshop will be considered for peer-reviewed book
publication.

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts should
be at most 2 pages in 12-point font with 1'' margins, including data and
references. Authors requested to submit two copies of their abstract, one with
their name and one anonymous. Abstracts must be submitted as a pdf attachment
to: is-workshop@ling.ucl.ac.uk. The names of the files should be
surname-named.pdf and surname-anon.pdf.

The body of the e-mail should contain the following information:
1. Name(s) of author(s) 
2. Title of talk 
3. Affiliation(s) 
4. E-mail address(es)

Important Dates:
Submission deadline for abstracts: 1 March 2008
Notification of acceptance: early May 2008
Deadline for draft for commentators: 15 June 2008
Responses from commentators: mid-August 2008
Workshop: 13 - 15 September 2008
