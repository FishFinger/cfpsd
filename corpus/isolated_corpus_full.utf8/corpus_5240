RATIONALE

Learning and teaching resource are available on the Web - both in
terms of digital learning content and people resources (e.g. other
learners, experts, tutors). They can be used to facilitate teaching
and learning tasks. The remaining challenge is to develop, deploy
and evaluate Social information retrieval (SIR) methods, techniques
and systems that provide learners and teachers with guidance in
potentially overwhelming variety of choices.

The aim of the SIRTEL=ED09 workshop is to look onward beyond recent
achievements to discuss specific topics, emerging research issues,
new trends and endeavors in SIR for TEL. The workshop will bring
together researchers and practitioners to present, and more
importantly, to discuss the current status of research in SIR
and TEL and its implications for science and teaching.


TOPICS OF INTEREST (but not limited to):

* Recommender systems and collaborative filtering in educational
settings
* Defining the scope, purpose and objects of social information
retrieval in TEL
* Novel ways of generating input for recommenders (explicit and
implicit methods)
* Ranking of search results to support individualised learning needs
* Integrating SIR services in existing educational platforms
* Folksonomies, tagging and other collaboration-based information
retrieval systems
* Social navigation processes and metaphors for searching information
related to teaching and learning
* Social networks and interactions in learning communities to
facilitate information sharing and retrieval
* Approaches to TEL metadata reflecting social ties and collaborative
experiences in the field of education
* Pedagogic decisions, recommender systems and how to contextualise
recommender system to support learning processes.
* Interoperability of SIR systems for TEL
* Visualisation techniques in learning and teaching
* Semantic annotation and tagging for social information retrieval
purposes
* Evaluating the performance of SIR systems in educational applications
* Measuring the effectiveness of SIR systems in supporting learning
and teaching
* Evaluation the user satisfaction with SIR systems in supporting
learning and teaching


WORKSHOP SUBMISSIONS

The workshop invites several types of contributions which allow a wide
level of participation:
* Research papers (up to 8 pages)
* System Demos (up to 2 pages)
* Hands-On proposals (1-pager)
* Abstract for Pecha Kucha (1-pager)

Submissions should be sent to: sirtelworkshop@gmail.com
