Software engineering, testing, and quality assurance for natural language
processing
An NAACL-HLT 2009 workshop
Boulder, CO
June 5, 2009
http://compbio.uchsc.edu/SETQA-NLP2009

Natural language, as an input type, has unique characteristics that present
special problems for software testing, quality assurance, and even
requirements specification.  This workshop is intended to stimulate research
in all areas of software engineering for natural language processing.  The
goals of the workshop include raising awareness of the need for good
software engineering practices in NLP, stimulating research on same, and
disseminating the results of current work in this area.

The target audience is researchers interested in natural language processing
software, including testing and standardization, as well as grammar
engineering.

Submissions of full papers and poster abstracts are solicited in all areas
of software and grammar engineering, testing and quality assurance as they
relate to natural language processing.  Some suggested areas are:

* Patterns for design, coding, refactoring, and unit testing of language
processing systems
* Test suite design and generation
* Special issues in metrology for natural language processing
* Grammar/rule engineering
* Usability
* Standardization of tools and/or resources
* Design for and evaluation of reliability and robustness
* Scalability issues in training and deployment
* Reusability and toolkit design
* Concurrency and multithreading for NLP
* Theoretical issues in software engineering for NLP

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: Monday, March 6, 2009, 11:59 PM East Coast time
Notification of acceptance: Monday, April 6, 2009
Camera-ready copy due: Monday, April 13, 2009
Workshop: Friday, June 5, 2009

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Full papers: Revised ACL guidelines for full papers this year allow for 8
pages of text plus one page of references.

Poster abstracts: Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages.
Accepted abstracts will be published in a separate section of the workshop
proceedings.  Appropriate poster topics include preliminary results,
application notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Submission format: Submissions must be in PDF and should follow the
two-column format of the ACL proceedings.  Ensure that you are *not* in A4
format.  Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting
specifications.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or
Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting website at
http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html.

Submit your paper or abstract via the workshop web site at
https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/SETQANLP2009/ by 11:59 PM on Monday,
March 6, East Coast time.  Submissions need not be anonymous.  Authors who
cannot submit a PDF file electronically should contact the workshop
organizers well in advance of the submission deadline.

Dual submission policy: Papers may not be submitted to the software
engineering, testing, and quality assurance workshop if they are or will be
concurrently submitted to another meeting or publication.
