semantics-pragmatics, lexical semantics, language acquisition, etc.). The
conference is open to work done from any theoretical perspective in formal
linguistics. The official language of the conference is English.

University) will offer a course (program below) which will be held from the 1st

Científica'). Due to the limited number of slots for talks, the scientific
community might relocate some talk submissions to the poster session.

body of the message should include the title of the paper, the name of the
author(s), his/her (their) affiliation(s) and whether the abstract is to be
