==================================================================
2009 Summer Computer Simulation Conference (SCSC'09)
Grand Cevahir Hotel and Convention Center Istanbul, Turkey
July 13-16, 2009

http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/SCSC09-CFP.htm

Sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International
==================================================================


As part of the 2009 International Simulation Multi-conference (ISMc'09)

http://www.scs.org/confernc/summersim/summersim09/cfp/summersim09.htm ,

the 2009 Summer Computer Simulation Conference (SCSC'09) is a premier
international forum and annual conference sponsored by The Society for
Modeling and Simulation International which covers state-of-the-art
developments in computer simulation methodologies, technologies, as well
as scientific, industrial, and business applications.


SCSC'09 features a comprehensive program ranging from introductory
tutorials to state of the art research and practice. SCSC'09 includes
keynote speeches presented by technology and industry leaders, technical
sessions, professional development courses and seminars, poster
presentations; as well as vendor exhibits. Papers and proposals for
panels, tutorials, workshops, seminars, exhibits, other technical are
solicited. All contributed papers will be peer reviewed. Papers should
be submitted electronically to http://www.softconf.com/scs/SCSC09/.  Final
version of all the papers should comply with the SCS conference format.
The best contributed paper will be given an award sponsored by ACM
SIGSIM. A selected group of full papers will be published in the special 
issue of the Simulation Journal.

Please note the following deadlines:
    Jan 31, 2009: Special session proposals
    Feb 25, 2009: Submission of papers
    Apr 21, 2009: Notification of Acceptance
