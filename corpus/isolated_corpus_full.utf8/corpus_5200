Meeting Description:

Sarajevo Linguistic Gathering is a conference open for general linguistics, with
focus on (south) Slavic languages. SinFonija is a traveling conference and is
also wide, spanning all areas of (formal) linguistics. Its primary goal is to
connect people on the area of ex Yugoslavia and ex Austria-Hungary, but it is
open to participants from everywhere. 

Call for Papers

The International Bosnia Forum, its Center for Modern Linguistics (and The
University of Nova Gorica) are pleased to invite you to submit papers for the
fourth linguistic meeting 'SLG 4' (Sarajevo Linguistic Gatherings), which will
take place on September 24, 25, and 26, 2009, in Sarajevo. Our Gathering will
incorporate a conference called Sinfonija 2 (Syntax+Phonology+language
analysis), first held last October at the University of Nova Gorica in Slovenia.

The theme of SLG meetings is general and (south) Slavic linguistics. In
particular, we invite speakers whose work on the phonology, morphology, syntax
and semantics of (South) Slavic languages may be related to phenomena in general
linguistics, or vice versa.

The conference will be held in 6 sessions organized around key-lectures by
following invited speakers:

- Wayles Browne (Cornell University)
- ?eljko Bo?kovi? (University of Connecticut)
- Anne Zribi-Hertz (Universite de Paris 8)
- Tobias Scheer (Universite de Nice)
- Penka Stateva (Univerza v Novi Gorici)
- Sergey Avrutin (Utrecht University)

Submission guidelines:
Abstracts are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for discussion).
Abstracts must be anonymous and written in English. They should be one page long
with one-inch margins and typed in Times New Roman (Title: 14 point, Body: at
least 11 point) of MS Word format. An optional second page is allowed only for
diagrams, figures, data and references. Any non-standard fonts should be
embedded in the PDF document. Submissions are limited to one individual and one

Abstract submission deadline: May 20, 2009
