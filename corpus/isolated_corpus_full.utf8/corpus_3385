Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

Literary Translation in Praxis. This panel is presented in conjunction with the
panel 'Lost (and found) in Translation.' While the latter focuses on scholarly
and theoretical examinations of translation, the former will explore the praxis
of translation. Panelists will read aloud from their current translation project
and speak briefly about the project and the translation issues. 

Call for Papers

Although translation is often described as an impossible task, the reality
proves otherwise. In truth translation can and does occur all around us every
day. Sacred texts like the Bible, philosophical works by Plato and Aristotle,
medieval works and a whole host of canonical ''world'' literature are read by
most of us in translation. Further, many students of foreign language will turn
to translation at some point in their language career: as a whim, a hobby, a
creative exercise, a linguistic challenge or as an academic exercise or piece of
paid employment.

Submissions are welcome from all languages, with preference given to German and
Scandinavian languages. Translations must be into English.

If you are interested in participating please send a brief biography and a one-
page description of your translation project to Maureen Gallagher, University of
Massachusetts Amherst, mogallag@german.umass.edu.

The submission deadline is September 15, 2008.

Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Language Family(ies): Germanic 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

Lost (and Found) in Translation This panel will explore diverse aspects of
translation studies, including but not limited to translation as a means of
transmitting cultural information, the strategies of domestication and
foreignization, studies in reception, reputation and survival, translation in
the two Germanies, the politics and ideology behind translation and translation
choices, ethics and translation, and the intersections between translation and
race, class and/or gender. 

Call for Papers

As translation studies and translation theory has emerged as a discipline,
scholars such as Gideon Toury, Lawrence Venuti, André Lefevere, Itamar
Even-Zohar, Susan Bassnett, Edwin Gentzler and Maria Tymoczko have challenged
our assumptions about translation and deepened our understanding of the process.

Translation is not merely a mechanical rendering of linguistic meaning, but a
complex and dynamic process involving the transmission of linguistic, literary
and cultural meaning. Translation theorists and practitioners have offered many
metaphors for translation:  rewriting, violence, close reading, cannibalism,
adaptation or manipulation of a text. They have encouraged us to view the
translator as a dynamic force, as a creative influence, as an author, as one who
intervenes.

This panel seeks to explore issues of translation in a German studies context,
whether it be the Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka that are regularly
read in college English classes, issues of translating medieval texts into
modern German, or the dozens of 19th century translations of James Fenimore
Cooper into German that inspired a generation of authors such as Charles
Seaslfield, Friedrich Gerstäcker and Karl May.

This panel hopes to explore diverse aspects of translation studies, including
but not limited to translation as a means of transmitting cultural information,
the strategies of domestication and foreignization, studies in reception,
reputation and survival, translation in the two Germanies, the politics and
ideology behind translation and translation choices, ethics and translation, and
the intersections between translation and race, class and/or gender. In
exploring these and other issues of translation, it will be shown that, while
much is lost in translation, much can be found as well.

Papers are welcome regarding translation either into or out of German or a
closely related language in any time period. Please send one-page abstracts to
Maureen Gallagher, University of Massachusetts Amherst,
mogallag@german.umass.edu.

The submission deadline is September 15, 2008.
