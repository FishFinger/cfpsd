Meeting Description:

This conference will explore the role of the German language in the formation and contestation of national and regional identities in Germany, Austria and neighbouring states in the centre of Europe. Its focus will be on the position and uses of German in relation to other languages in the current reshaping of central European space - whether as the dominant, officially legitimated language of Germany or Austria, as the minority language of historical migrations, or as a (potential) regional lingua franca occupying the middle ground between global English and 'national' languages.

Papers are invited that address the roles of language, experiences of and with language, and discourses about language. Preference will be given to papers that integrate consideration of ideologies, policies and practices.

Language, Discourse and Identity in Central Europe

Keynote speakers
Thomas Diez, Birmingham
Matthias Makowski, Prague
Ulrike Hanna Meinhof, Southampton
Ruth Wodak, Lancaster/Vienna

In central European space - straddling the current political borders of Germany, Austria and their eastern neighbours - the German language has long played a key role in processes of identification. What role is the relationship between German and other languages playing today in the reshaping of societies and communities in central Europe? How is this relationship articulated in discourses about language? How is it manifested in individual repertoires and social practices? How is it determined by social and cultural policies? 

This conference will explore the position and uses of German in relation to other languages in this rapidly changing region - whether as the dominant, officially legitimated language in Germany or Austria, as the minority language of migrations past and present, or as a (potential) regional lingua franca occupying the middle ground between global English and 'national' languages (Polish, Hungarian etc).

Context and rationale:

In 2004 Andreas Gardt and Bernd HÃ¼ppauf published a collection of papers with the ominous title Globalization and the Future of German (Mouton de Gruyter). This wide-ranging volume presents a critical assessment of the present position and future prospects of the German language as a 'paradigmatic example' of the future of European languages in general in the face of global forces apparently favouring the growing domination of 'global Englishes' and militating against linguistic diversity. 

In the same year, the Southampton Centre for Transnational Studies organised a conference on Language and the Future of Europe, from which selected papers have now been published in Clare Mar-Molinero and Patrick Stevenson (eds) Language Ideologies, Policies and Practices (Palgrave, 2006). In her keynote paper, Susan Gal explores the complex relations between migration, minorities and multilingualism in Europe in terms of shifting language ideologies, challenging 'the tight Herderian weave of culture, language and state in Europe' which, she argues, 'is being stretched and frayed in subtle ways.' 

In July 2007, the Centre will host a conference with the aim of developing these two themes in a particular way. It will investigate Gal's assertion further by focusing on the context of what she refers to as the 'fractal geography' of central Europe. Specifically, it will form part of a research programme, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, on the role of the German language in the formation and contestation of national and regional identities in Germany, Austria and neighbouring states in the centre of Europe (www.glipp.soton.ac.uk). 

Papers are invited that address the roles of language, experiences of and with language, and discourses about language. Preference will be given to papers that integrate consideration of ideologies with analysis of policies and/or practices. 

It is envisaged that selected papers from the conference will be published in book-form in English, and papers should therefore be given in English. Abstracts (maximum 200 words) should be sent by email by 1 February 2007 to Dr Jenny Carl at the following address: glipp@soton.ac.uk. Abstracts should be included in the body of the email, NOT as an attachment.

Questions that could be addressed:

-What impact has social, political, economic and cultural transformation had on patterns of multilingualism in central Europe?
-To what extent are pan-European discourses on multilingualism at odds with national policies and individual practices?
-Who engages in language policy-making and to what ends?
-How have 'old' and 'new' migrations into and within this region affected linguistic practices?
-How far and in what ways are identities imposed, assumed or negotiated linguistically or through reference to language?
-How do individuals use the linguistic resources available to them to position themselves and others in multilingual space?
-What role do narratives about language play in individual biographies and memories of the pre-1989 past?

Topics could include:

-Language and cultural agencies (British Council, Goethe Institut etc);
-Language and migration;
-Language and belonging;
-Language and social inclusion/exclusion;
-Language and citizenship;
-Language in multinational businesses;
-Language and the knowledge economy;
-Language and cosmopolitanism;
-Language and territory / de-territorialisation of language;
-Language and tourism;
-Urban spaces and linguistic neighbourhoods;
-Language biographies;
-Visual manifestations of multilingualism
-Media discourses (film, TV, music, print media, advertising)
-Linguistic practices in popular culture and new technologies
-Linguistic counter-cultures.
