AIMS

Several initiatives have been launched in the area of Computational
Linguistics, Language Resources and Knowledge Representation both at
the national and international level aiming at the development of
resources and tools. Unfortunately, there are few initiatives that
integrate these results within eLearning. The situation is slightly
better with respect to the results achieved within Knowledge
Representation since ontologies are being developed which describe not
only the content of the learning material but crucially also its
context and the structure.  Furthermore, knowledge representation
techniques and natural language processing play an important role in
improving the adaptivity of learning environments even though they are
not fully exploited yet.

On the other hand, eLearning environments constitute valuable
scenarios to demonstrate the maturity of computational linguistic
methods as well as of natural language technologies and tools.  This
kind of task-based evaluation of resources, methods and tools is a
crucial issue for the further development of language and information
technology.

The goal of this workshop is to discuss:

- the use of language and knowledge resources and tools in eLearning;
- requirements on natural language resources, standards, and
  applications originating in eLearning activities and environments;
- the expected added value of natural language resources and
  technology to learning environments and the learning process;
- strategies and methods for the task based evaluation of Natural
  Language Processing applications.

The workshop will bring together computational linguists, language
resources developers, knowledge engineers, researchers involved in
technology-enhanced learning as well as developers of eLearning
material, ePublishers and eLearning practitioners. It will provide a
forum for interaction among members of dierent research communities,
and a means for attendees to increase their knowledge and
understanding of the potential of computational resources in
eLearning.

TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*  ontology modelling in the eLearning domain;

* Natural Language Processing techniques for supplying metadata for
  learning objects on a (semi)-automatic basis, e.g. for the automatic
  extraction of key terms and their definitions;

* techniques for summarization of discussion threads and support of
  discourse coherence in eLearning;

* improvements on (semantic, cross-lingual) search methods to in
  learning environments;

* techniques of matching the semantic representation of learning
  objects with the user's knowledge in order to support personalized
  and adaptive learning;

* adaptive information filtering and retrieval (content-based
  filtering and retrieval, collaborative filtering)

* intelligent tutoring (curriculum sequencing, intelligent solution
  analysis, problem solving support)

* intelligent collaborative learning (adaptive group formation and
  peer help, adaptive collaboration)

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submissions by young researchers are especially welcomed.

* Format. Authors are invited to submit full papers on original,
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should be
submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007
stylefiles and not exceeding 8 pages. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are
available at:

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm

* Demos. Submission of demos are also welcome.  Papers submitted as
demo should not exceed 4 pages and should describe extensively the
system to be presented.

* Submission procedure. Submission of papers will be handled using the
START system, through the RANLP Conference.  Specific submission
guidelines will be posted on the workshop site shortly.

* Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members
of the Program Committee.

* Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at
least one of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop
participants are expected to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration
fee.
