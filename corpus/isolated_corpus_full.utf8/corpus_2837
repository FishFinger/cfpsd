SKY Journal of Linguistics is the annual publication of the Linguistic
Association of Finland (SKY). SKY JoL welcomes linguistic research from all
theoretical and methodological persuasions. 
The submissions have to be unpublished original and high-quality work.
Every manuscript is reviewed by at least two anonymous referees. In
addition to papers on any linguistic topic, SKY JoL publishes short
'squibs' (3-5 pages) and book reviews. The languages of publication are
English, French and German. SKY JoL appears both in print and as a
free-access web journal.  

The deadline for initial submissions for the next volume (21, to appear in
January 2009) is the end of May 2008. The deadline is strict. Submissions
arriving after the deadline will be postponed to next year. Provided that a
manuscript is accepted for publication without major revisions, it will in
the normal course of events appear in January 2009.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
