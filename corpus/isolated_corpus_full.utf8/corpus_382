Meeting Description:

This conference will explore the role of the German language in the formation and 
contestation of national and regional identities in Germany, Austria and neighbouring states 
in the centre of Europe. Its focus will be on the position and uses of German in relation to 
other languages in the current reshaping of central European space - whether as the 
dominant, officially legitimated language of Germany or Austria, as the minority language 
of historical migrations, or as a (potential) regional lingua franca occupying the middle 
ground between global English and 'national' languages.

Papers are invited that address the roles of language, experiences of and with language, and 
discourses about language. Preference will be given to papers that integrate consideration of 
ideologies, policies and practices. 

Context and rationale:
In 2004 Andreas Gardt and Bernd HÃ¼ppauf published a collection of papers with the 
ominous title Globalization and the Future of German (Mouton de Gruyter). This wide-
ranging volume presents a critical assessment of the present position and future prospects of 
the German language as a 'paradigmatic example' of the future of European languages in 
general in the face of global forces apparently favouring the growing domination of 'global 
Englishes' and militating against linguistic diversity. 

In the same year, the Southampton Centre for Transnational Studies organised a conference 
on Language and the Future of Europe, from which selected papers have now been 
published in Clare Mar-Molinero and Patrick Stevenson (eds) Language Ideologies, Policies 
and Practices (Palgrave, 2006). In her keynote paper, Susan Gal explores the complex 
relations between migration, minorities and multilingualism in Europe in terms of shifting 
language ideologies, challenging 'the tight Herderian weave of culture, language and state in 
Europe' which, she argues, 'is being stretched and frayed in subtle ways.' 

In July 2007, the Centre will host a conference with the aim of developing these two themes 
in a particular way. It will investigate Gal's assertion further by focusing on the context of 
what she refers to as the 'fractal geography' of central Europe. Specifically, it will form part 
of a research programme, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, on the 
role of the German language in the formation and contestation of national and regional 
identities in Germany, Austria and neighbouring states in the centre of Europe 
(www.glipp.soton.ac.uk). 

The main focus of the conference will therefore be not on 'the future of the German 
language' but rather on the position and uses of German in relation to other languages in the 
current reshaping of central European space - whether as the dominant, officially legitimated 
language of Germany or Austria, as the minority language of historical migrations, or as a 
(potential) regional lingua franca occupying the middle ground between global English and 
'national' languages.

Papers are invited that address the roles of language, experiences of and with language, and 
discourses about language. As with the previous conference, preference will be given to 
papers that integrate consideration of ideologies, policies and practices. 

It is envisaged that selected papers from the conference will be published in book-form in 
English, and papers should therefore be given in English. Abstracts (maximum 200 words) 
should be sent by email by 1 February 2007 to Dr Jenny Carl at the following address: 
glipp@soton.ac.uk. Abstracts should be included in the body of the email, NOT as an 
attachment.

Questions that could be addressed:
-What impact has social, political, economic and cultural transformation had on patterns of 
multilingualism in central Europe?
-How has migration into and within this region affected linguistic practices?
-How far and in what ways is linguistic difference 'heard' and 'seen' in these multilingual 
settings?
-Are new language ideologies emerging?
-Who engages in language policy-making and to what ends?
-How far and in what ways are identities imposed, assumed or negotiated linguistically or 
through reference to language?
-How do individuals use the linguistic resources available to them to position themselves and 
others in multilingual space?
-What role do narratives about language play in individual biographies and memories of the 
pre-1989 past?

Topics could include:
-Language ideologies
-Identity narratives
-Negotiations of identity
-Language biographies
-Visual manifestations of multilingualism
-Globalisation and its discontents
-Media discourses (film, TV, music, print media, advertising)
