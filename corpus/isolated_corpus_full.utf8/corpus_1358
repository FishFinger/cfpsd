BSNLP 2007: Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing
2007 with Special Theme: Information Extraction and
Enabling Technologies ACL 2007  Workshop Prague, Czech
Republic, June 29 2007
http://langtech.jrc.it/bsnlp2007


SUMMARY:

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: extented to April
9
Notification of Acceptance: April 30
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.


TOPIC AND MOTIVATION:

The recent political and economic changes in Central
and
Eastern Europe and the related on-going enlargement of
the
European Union brings into focus new cultures and
languages. 
Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic
group have 
an outstanding role because of their rich cultural
heritage 
and the widespread use - over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavonic languages,
with the 
focus on Information Extraction (IE) and enabling
technologies 
for this language family. The task of IE is to
identify a 
predefined set of concepts from natural language text.
The 
spectrum of IE tasks ranges from named-entity
recognition, 
through relation extraction and co-reference
resolution to the 
identification of complex events and cross-document
entity 
profile extraction. Although a considerable amount of 
IE-related work exists, most of the studies are
concentrated 
on a few major languages. Research on this topic, as
well as 
on general-purpose NLP tools in the context of
Balto-Slavonic 
languages, is still in its early stage and is
progressing 
relatively slowly. Due to some specific  phenomena
like the
highly inflectional character and relatively free word
order, 
a construction of IE systems and other language
processing 
tools (question-answering, text summarization, machine

translation) for these languages is an intriguing and 
challenging task.

This workshop can be seen as the follow-up to the
successful 
workshop on Information Extraction for Slavonic and
Other 
Central and Eastern European Languages
(http://lml.bas.bg/IESL2003) held in conjunction with
the 
RANLP 2003 conference. It is also related to the EACL
2003 
workshop on Morphological Processing of Slavic
Languages 
(http://nl.ijs.si/mpsl03). In particular, we would
strongly 
encourage submissions describing systems, resources or

solutions that are made available to the wider public,
as 
these would help to promote computational linguistics 
applications for these languages.

AREAS OF INTEREST include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP, in
particular 
in the context of IE and enabling technologies

- text segmentation
- morphological analysis
- morphology models
- morpho-syntactic disambiguation
- named-entity recognition 
- named-entity disambiguation (e.g., geo-referencing)
- named-entity lemmatisation
- term and keyword extraction
- name variant recognition and merging
- syntactic parsing and chunking
- co-reference resolution
- word sense disambiguation
- corpus-based knowledge acquisition

B. Multilingual IE frameworks and techniques applied
to these languages

- tools and resources (freely available for research
purposes will be preferred)
- experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data
and processing resources
- comparative evaluation between languages

C. IE solutions for these languages:

- scenario template filling / event extraction
- relation extraction
- automatic pattern learning
- corpus studies and statistical techniques for IE
- IE from Web sources
- IE-based ontology population
- IE evaluation
- IE techniques for Question/Answering and Answer
Extraction
- Utilisation of IE-based techniques in other NLP
applications

INTENDED AUDIENCE

The goal of this workshop is to bring together
researchers and 
practitioners working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic
languages, in 
particular on IE and core technologies supporting IE
for these 
languages. The workshop will give an opportunity to
exchange 
ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle
problems in 
this field of research, and to make available
resources more 
widely known.

SUBMISSION

Papers should describe original work and should
indicate the 
state of completion of the reported results. In
particular, an 
overlap with previously published work should be
clearly 
mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
novelty, 
technical strength, clarity of presentation,
usability, and 
significance/relevance to the workshop. 

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the
ACL 
2007 main-conference proceedings and should not exceed
eight 
(8) pages, including references. We recommend to use
either 
the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word style file,
which 
can be found at
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper
should not
include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, 
self-citations and other references that could reveal
the 
author's identity should be avoided. 

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted
format for 
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be
submitted no 
later than April 9, 2006 using the submission webpage 
http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007/submission 
(or
http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS12/submit.html).


Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the
Program 
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive
guidelines 
regarding how to produce camera-ready versions of
their papers 
for inclusion in the ACL workshop proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: extented to April
9
Notification of Acceptance: April 30
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.

LOCATION

Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is located
in the 
centre of Europe. It is one of the most valuable
historical 
city reserves in Europe. The historical core of the
city is 
listed in the UNESCO World Cultural and Natural
Heritage 
Register. The workshop itself will take place in the
TOP HOTEL 
Praha, located in the quiet neighbourhood of the
Prague 4 
district, only 15-20 minutes from the historic centre
of Prague. 

Prague is easily reachable by car, bus or train from
central 
Europe (only 3-hour drive from Vienna or Budapest or 4
hours 
from Berlin or Munich), by cheap flights from the rest
of 
Europe, and by several direct flights from overseas.
