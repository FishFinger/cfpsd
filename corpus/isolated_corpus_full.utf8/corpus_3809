<strong>Call for Maps for 5th Iteration on &#8220;Science Maps for Science
Policy Makers&#8221;<br>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://scimaps.org/cfs.php">http://scimaps.org/cfs.php</a><br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background and Goals</strong><br>
The Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit was created to inspire
cross-disciplinary discussion on how to best track and communicate
human activity and scientific progress on a global scale. It has two
components: physical exhibits enable the close inspection of high
quality reproductions of maps for display at conferences and education
centers; the online counterpart (<a href="http://scimaps.org/">http://scimaps.org</a>)
provides links to a selected series of maps and their makers along with
detailed explanations of how these maps work. <br>
<br>
Places &amp; Spaces is a 10-year effort. Each year, 10 new maps are
added, which will result in 100 maps total in 2014. Each iteration of
the exhibit attempts to learn from the best examples of visualization
design in existence. To accomplish this goal, each iteration compares
and contrasts four existing maps with six new maps of science. Themes
for the different iterations/years are as follows: <br>
<br>
1st Iteration (2005): The Power of Maps<br>
2nd Iteration (2006): The Power of Reference Systems<br>
3rd Iteration (2007): The Power of Forecasts<br>
4th Iteration (2008): Science Maps for Economic Decision Makers<br>
<br>
5th Iteration (2009): Science Maps for Science Policy Makers <br>
6th Iteration (2010): Science Maps for Scholars<br>
7th Iteration (2011): Science Maps for Visual Interfaces to Digital
Libraries<br>
8th Iteration (2012): Science Maps for Kids<br>
9th Iteration (2013): Science Maps for Daily Science Forecasts<br>
10th Iteration (2014): How to Lie with Maps <br>
</p>
<p>Places &amp; Spaces was first shown at the Annual Meeting of the
Association of American Geographers in April 2005. Since then, the
physical exhibit has been displayed at more than 90 venues. Recent
display locations include: </p>
