Meeting Description:

The 34th Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development
November 6-8, 2009

The Boston University Conference on Language Development (BUCLD) was started in 1976 by students in the Applied Psycholinguistics Program. The Conference involves year-round planning and draws over 500 people from all over the U.S. and around the world. It includes presentations in such areas as theoretical approaches to language acquisition, cross-cultural language development, second language development, language disorders, and literacy development. Each year, close to 500 abstracts are submitted to the conference, from which about 87 papers and 66 posters are chosen for presentation. Internationally renowned researchers also give keynote and plenary addresses, as well as a lunch symposium on a topic of current interest.
