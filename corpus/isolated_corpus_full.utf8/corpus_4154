			      CALL  FOR  PAPERS
			      ==================

				 PACLING2009

     Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics

			     September 1-4, 2009
		     Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan
	       http://sig.media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/pacling2009/


SCOPE

Pacling2009 is a low profile, high-quality and workshop-oriented conference whose aim is to 
promote friendly scientific interaction relating to computational linguistics among Pacific 
Rim countries.  The emphasis of the conference is on interdisciplinary scientific exchange 
demonstrating openness towards high-quality research falling outside current dominant 
“schools of thought”, and on technological transfer within the Pacific region.  The 
conference represents a unique forum for scientific and technological exchange, being smaller 
than ACL and COLING, and more regional with extensive representation from the Pacific.


TOPICS

Substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any topics in computational 
linguistics, including, but not limited to, the following:

 * Phonology and Phonetics
 * Morphology and Morphological Analysis
 * Syntax and Syntactic Analysis
 * Semantics and Semantic Analysis
 * Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis
 * Spoken Language and Dialogue
 * Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing
 * Text and Message Understanding
 * Text and Message Generation
 * Machine Translation
 * Text Summarization
 * Information Extraction and Text Mining
 * Information Retrieval and Question-Answering
 * Language Learning
 * Natural Language Interfaces
 * Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontology
 * Semantic Web
 * Semantic Computation

In addition to these topics on general computational linguistics, Pacling2009 will also have 
a workshop to discuss the challenging theme below:

         Language and Human Mind.

This theme covers research areas of modeling a human mind in terms of natural, efficient and 
sympathetic communication between humans and computers, i.e. user-model-based communication 
systems, emotional and affective expressions comprehension, understanding of other person’s 
mind, etc.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors should prepare anonymous submissions, in English, of up to 6 pages including 
references.  Guidelines and style sheets (based on the ACL styles) are available at the web 
site:
    http://sig.media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/pacling2009/

Papers that are being submitted to other conferences, whether verbatim or in essence must 
declare this fact. If a paper appears at another conference, it must be withdrawn from 
PACLING2009. Papers that violate these requirements are subject to rejection without review.
All papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format, through a web-based submission 
system. The link to the submission web site will be soon made available on the web site.


PUBLICATIONS

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in paper and in CD-ROM.
