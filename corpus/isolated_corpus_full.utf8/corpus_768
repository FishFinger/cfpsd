==================================================

     19th European Systemic Functional Linguistics
            Conference and Workshop

               23rd-25th July 2007
              SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany
          http://www.uni-saarland.de/ESFLCW

==================================================

=========================
= FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS =
=========================

We invite submission of abstracts of papers for presentation at the
conference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFERENCE THEME

Data and interpretation in linguistic analysis

Traditionally, linguists approach their object of research using
hermeneutic methods. As the often introspective interpretation
involved may be difficult to follow, results are frequently not
replicable.  For reasons of cost involved, this methodology often
allows the interpretation of a restricted number of examples only,
even if the researcher is interested in language in use. Therefore,
inductive methodologies of the sciences and social sciences have
gained some influence on linguistic research. These inductive
methodologies, however, sometimes make us blind to the fact that data
need to be interpreted at some point. What is more, the data itself
may already involve interpretation, as in annotated corpora. In terms
of its underlying philosophy, Systemic Functional Linguistics allows
the combination of both: a genuinely humanities-based approach to
interpreting data combined with empirical methodologies taking
advantage of electronic corpora together with computational tools and
techniques for the study of language in use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

PAPERS

Papers on the topics below will be welcomed, though the following is
by no means an exhaustive list, and in keeping with tradition, papers
not strictly related to the theme or outside of the SFL perspective
will also be considered.

1. Corpora and other types of data for analysis

2. Example-based studies and generalizability

3. The role of interpretation in
    - phonology
    - lexicogrammar
    - semantics
    - discourse

4. Cohesion and coherence - the relative importance of interpretation
    in both

5. Interpretation in non-linguistic modes (i.e. visual, musical etc.)

6. Socio-cultural positions of power and interpretation

7. Contrast between languages or varieties and the (in)dependence
    of/on interpretation

8. Context of Situation and Context of Culture as frames for and
    constraints on interpretation

9. Learning or teaching a new language: new interpretations, or just
    new ways of expression?

10. Translation: Changing the encoding, and/or changing the interpretation?

Presentations will be of 20 minutes duration plus question time. An
additional poster session may be created to accommodate demos and
other suitable presentations. There will be a book of abstracts
accompanying the conference. Additionally, we plan to publish selected
contributions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

WORKSHOPS

There will be space for one or two half day workshops covering a
specific topic in a hands-on session. We therefore invite proposals of
approximately 1000 words describing the topic and approach.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSIONS

All submissions will be reviewed anonymously by two reviewers. Please
send submissions by email to ESFLCW@uni-saarland.de specifying "ESFLCW
submission" in the subject line and providing:

  - For each author: name, title, affiliation in the body of the mail
  - Title of paper
  - Abstract (approximately 400 words) (workshop proposal approximately
    1000 words)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES

  - Abstract submission: 31st January 2007
  - Notification of acceptance: 15th March 2007
  - Early registration: 30th April 2007

For those attending the ISFC in Odense, please note that we have

free for travel between Odense and SaarbrÃ¼cken.
