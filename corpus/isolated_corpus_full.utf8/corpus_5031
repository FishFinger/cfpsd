Rio de Janeiro, 14-17 July 2009 (//http://www.issi2009.org
<http://www.issi2009.org/>//)/

Call for papers and presentations
ISSI 2009 Conference Workshop on July 14th:

*/Tracking and evaluating interdisciplinary research:
metrics and maps/*

This workshop aims to contrast perspectives on how to measure and map
interdisciplinary research, exploring recent advances on three research
fronts:

1.  Conceptualizations and associated measures of interdisciplinarity,
e.g. in terms of knowledge integration, network analyses, and
disciplinary diversity.

2.    Varied approaches to visualize (map) the relative position of
bodies of research, ranging from that of an investigator to an emerging
field.

3.    Assessment of the benefits and downsides of interdisciplinary
research (e.g., on citation impact), and the ensuing science policy
implications.

The workshop will include comments by selected discussants and time to
exchange ideas and to identify promising research avenues. /See
attachment for more details/
