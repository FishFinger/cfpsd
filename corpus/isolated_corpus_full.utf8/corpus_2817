PURPOSE/HISTORY:

   WORLDCOMP is the largest annual gathering of researchers in computer
   science, computer engineering and applied computing.  In 2007, the
   congress attracted over 2,000 scientists and researchers, including 148
   sponsored students.  For 2008, we anticipate to have about 2,400
   attendees from over 80 countries.

   WORLCOMP'08 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
   lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
   poster presentations.  In recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers
   included: Prof. Michael J. Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John H. Holland
   (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. H. J. Siegel (Colorado State U.);
   Prof. Barry Vercoe (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U. of California,
   Berkeley); Prof. David Cheriton (Stanford U.), Prof. A. K. Dunker
   (Indiana U. and Purdue U.); Prof. Jun Liu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys
   (developer of X Window, ...); Dr. Chris Rowen (President and CEO,
   Tensilica, Inc.); and many other distinguished speakers.

   prepare their papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited
   to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously
   published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The
   first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,
   name, affiliation, postal address, email address, and telephone
   number for each author.  The first page should also identify the

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
   impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts
   in the field who are independent of the conference program committee.
   The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of
   the program committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of
   the track that the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make
   the final decision.
