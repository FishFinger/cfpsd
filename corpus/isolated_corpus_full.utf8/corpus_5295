***********************************************************************
Workshop on Advanced Technologies for Digital Libraries 2009 (AT4DL =20
2009)
8 September 2009, Trento (Italy)
http://www.cacaoproject.eu/at4dl

Submission deadline: 18 June 2009
***********************************************************************

AIM and SCOPE
The fast growth of digital material is challenging for research in =20
many disciplines. The EU has funded many projects to advance research =20=

in this field and facilitate end-user access to cultural and =20
scientific heritage. The ENRICH, Europeana, CACAO, GAMA, NEEO and =20
TELplus projects, funded by the eContentplus programme, have joined =20
forces to organise a workshop as a satellite event of ICSD 2009 =
(http://www.icsd-conference.org/=20
).

The workshop aims to bring together stakeholders in order to present =20
an overview of state-of-the-art systems in the field and identify open =20=

research problems that require further work.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts describing running =20
projects in the field of Digital Libraries. Research projects of any =20
size are welcome, ranging from EU to PhD projects. Preference will be =20=

given to projects that will be able to demonstrate a functioning =20
prototype. We also invite the submission of posters describing =20
research in progress that will be on display during the workshop.

We are particularly interested in the following topics:

* Analysis of users' requirements and use of DL systems.
* DL systems for supporting e-research.
* Integration of Classification Systems, Subject Headings and IR =20
methods.
* Multi-modal indexing of DLs.
* Language Technologies: cross document co-reference and temporal =20
information extraction.
* Linking and clustering data in DLs.
* Ontology learning for DL systems.

SUBMISSION
Each extended abstract may consist of up to three (3) pages of content =20=

and one (1) extra page for references.
Submissions should be made following the Author's Instructions for =20
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).
Submission/reviewing will be electronic, managed by the EasyChair =20
system. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF.
The PDF file of the paper must be uploaded to the system by the =20
submission deadline. See details at the workshop website: =
http://www.cacaoproject.eu/at4dl


IMPORTANT DATES
* Paper Submission: 18 June 2009
* Notification of Acceptance: 30 July 2009
* Camera Ready Deadline: 25 August 2009


WORKSHOP STRUCTURE:
* In the morning, short presentations of accepted abstracts
* In the afternoon, posters and demos time

PUBLICATIONS
All the accepted abstracts and posters will be made available online =20
before the Workshop as pre-prints published in the Bozen-Bolzano =20
University Press series and will be distributed on a CD at the time of =20=

the workshop. Following the workshop, it is planned to publish the =20
full papers as post-proceedings in Springer LNCS, the publication of =20
which is expected in early 2010.
