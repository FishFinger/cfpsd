Call Deadline: 13-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 35th annual meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society will take place at
the University of California, Berkeley, on February 14-16, 2009. The meeting
will consist of a General Session, a Parasession, and a Special Session. 

Call for Papers

General Session
The General Session will cover all areas of linguistic interest. We encourage
proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks and also welcome papers on
language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology, cognitive
science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology.

Invited Speakers
- William Croft, University of New Mexico
- William Hanks, University of California, Berkeley

Parasession: Negation
The Parasession invites papers on negation from various theoretical perspectives
(cognitive, historical, typological, generative, functional, etc.) and in
relation to any linguistic sub-domain (semantic, pragmatic, syntactic,
morpho-phonological, lexical). Submissions that introduce new data from
understudied languages are especially welcome.

Invited Speakers
- Laurence Horn, Yale University
- William Ladusaw, University of California, Santa Cruz

Special Session: Non-speech modalities
The Special Session will explore non-speech linguistic modalities such as sign
language and gesture, whether independently or in relation to spoken language.
We invite papers on grammatical topics as well as those dealing with issues of
language acquisition, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics and cognitive science.
Papers with historical and typological perspectives are also encouraged.

Invited Speakers
- Ulrike Zeshan, University of Central Lancashire
- Adam Kendon, University of Pennsylvania

Submission Guidelines

Deadline
Abstracts must be received electronically by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time,
Thursday, 13 November 2008. No late submissions can be accepted. Authors will be
notified of (non-) acceptance by mid-December.

Guidelines
An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. In the case of
joint authorship, one address should be designated for communication with BLS.
Abstracts should be as specific as possible, with a statement of topic,
approach, and conclusions, and must fit on one page in 12-point font with 1"
margins. So that the review process may remain anonymous, authors should not
include their names or otherwise reveal their identity anywhere on this page.
Data and examples must be given within the body of the text rather than at the
end, though references may be included on a separate page if necessary.

Submissions
All abstracts must be submitted electronically as PDF documents. Further
instructions for electronic submissions are available at
http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/BLS/abstracts.html

Presentation and Publication
Presentations are allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. Presented
papers are published in the BLS Proceedings. Authors agree to provide
camera-ready copy (up to 12 pages) by 15 May 2009.
