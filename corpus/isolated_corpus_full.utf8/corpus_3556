Contact Person: Jon Millington
Meeting Email: jon.millington@sas.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The attention devoted to the linguistics of the English language has resulted in
a broad body of work in diverse research traditions. The aim of the ICLCE
conference is to encourage the cross-fertilization of ideas between different
frameworks and research traditions, all of which may address any aspect of the
linguistics of English. The first and second ICLCE conferences were held in
Edinburgh (2005) and Toulouse (2007) along the same lines. We aim for the London
conference to build on the success of those events. The main conference (15-17
July) will be preceded on 14 July by a one-day symposium to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Survey of English Usage. The theme of this symposium will be
Current Change in the English Verb Phrase.

Abstracts:
Abstracts are welcome on any area of the structure and use of contemporary
varieties of English: phonology, phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics,
discourse, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, dialectology, etc.

You may submit an abstract either for the workshop on 14 July or for the main
conference (15-17 July).

Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm margins,
single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal character

"Author (date)" in the body of the abstract; you do not need to include full
references.

Please send two copies of your abstract. One of these should be anonymous and
one should include your name, affiliation and email at the top of the page,
directly below the title. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by members
of the organizing committee and advisory board. The named file should be
camera-ready, as it will be used in the abstracts booklet if the proposal is
accepted.

Abstracts must be in PDF file format and should be submitted by email to
iclce2009@qmul.ac.uk, with a copy to Devyani Sharma (d.sharma@qmul.ac.uk) and to

Meeting Description:

LULCL II 

Lesser Used Languages and Computer Linguistics (LULCL) II 
'Combining efforts to foster computational support of minority languages'

13th - 14th of November 2008
European Academy Bolzano/Bozen, Italy

http://www.eurac.edu/lulcl2 

Call for Papers 

Deadline extended to 29th of September 

Following up on the "Lesser Used Languages and Computer Linguistics (LULCL)"
conference in 2005, the Institute for Specialized Communication and
Multilingualism at the European Academy Bozen/Bolzano is pleased to announce a
second scientific meeting on computational approaches for lesser used, lesser
standardized and lesser resourced languages. LULCL II will take place the 13th
and 14th of November 2008 at the European Academy Bozen/Bolzano. The aim of the
colloquium is to provide an overview of ongoing research activities and to
strengthen the research community and its practices. This year's LULCL
colloquium puts a special focus on bringing together efforts from several
related research communities, in order to join best practices, approaches and
techniques and to add value to individual initiatives. In addition to lesser
used languages, other types of language, including language varieties, sign
languages, learner language and spoken language pose similar issues for
researchers, having to do with sparse resources, little standardization, and
challenges with automatic processing and building up of computational resources.
The colloquium will provide an opportunity to learn what tasks are analogous and
shared among the different research communities, what practices and resources
could be exchanged and generally how the groups could gain from working together
and how they can bring forward lesser used languages. 

The research communities of interest for this colloquium are:
Lesser used / minority languages
Language varieties
Sign languages
Learner languages
Spoken language

During the two-day event invited researchers of each field will present ongoing
research activities by pointing out challenges inherent to the automatic
processing of a particular lesser resourced / lesser standardized language and
relating it to the broader picture of working with lesser resourced / lesser
standardized languages in general. The emerging dialogue should give particular
consideration to smaller projects and thus help them to disseminate their
objectives and to enter the international research community.

Call for Posters
In addition to presentations by invited speakers this call for posters is open
to all researchers working with lesser used, lesser resourced and lesser
standardized languages. 

Topics of particular interest include:
Corpora
Lexicographic resources
Terminological resources
Computer assisted language teaching and learning 
Tools and resources for translation 
Language tools - Multimedia and internet

Representation and access of non-written language 
Impact of computational approaches to support/strengthen a language 
Transferability of approaches developed for major world languages

Posters may range from theoretical work to descriptions of resources and
applications. We encourage PhD students to submit their research. 
The colloquium's language is English. Reviewing is non blind. 
Please submit an abstract (including relevant bibliography) of no more than 1000
words to : communication.multilingualism@eurac.edu

Important Dates
New deadline: 
September 29th 2008: Submission of abstracts for poster presentations
