Context and Contexts: parts meet whole?

A panel organized at the 11th International Pragmatics Conference of the
International Pragmatics Association (IPrA)
July 12-17, 2009, in Australia (Melbourne)

More general information about the conference can be accessed via:
http://ipra.ua.ac.be/

The concept of context has undergone some fundamental rethinking in the
scientific community, where it is no longer seen as an analytic prime. Rather
than being looked upon as an external constraint on linguistic performance,
context tends to be analysed as a product of language use, as interactionally
constructed and as negotiated. This is due to the fact that communication is
both context-creating and context-dependent (Bateson 1972) and that in
communication context is imported and invocated (Levinson 2003).

Context has been conceptualized with respect to the dichotomies of figure versus
ground, and given-and-there versus re-constructed, it has been assigned the
status of a dynamic construct, and it has been looked upon as never saturated
(Goodwin and Duranti 1992). Furthermore, it has been assigned the status of a
relational construct (Fetzer and Akman 2002) relating communicative acts and
their surroundings, relating communicative acts, relating individual actors and
their surroundings, and relating the set of individual actors and their
communicative acts to their surroundings. It has been further refined by the
differentiation between social context, sociocultural context, linguistic
context (or co-text) and cognitive context, and between micro, meso and macro
contexts (Fetzer 2004).

Degrees of connectedness between context and communicative acts are subject to
debate. Such connectedness might be taken minimally as the one between
indexicals and the context, or as pragmatic ''situatedness'' of communicative
acts in context (Bach 1994, Cappelen and Lepore 2005, Kaplan 1989, Mey 2001,
Recanati 2004).

The goal of this panel is to examine the complexity of context and its
multifaceted and multilayered nature, tackling one (or more) of the following
aspects:

- the connectedness between the indexicality of social action and context(s)
- the connectedness between intentionality of communicative action and context(s)
- the connectedness between micro contexts and their embedding contexts (for
instance, linguistic constructions seen as a constitutive part of utterances;
locutionary and illocutionary acts seen as constitutive parts of speech acts; or
meta-representations; or illocutionary-force-indicating devices,
contextualization cues or other types of connectives)
- the connectedness between meso contexts and their embedding contexts (for
instance, genre, speech event, activity type, frame or communicative project)
- the connectedness between macro context (for instance, culture, institution
and society) and their embedded meso / micro contexts

Advances in Frame Semantics: Corpus and Computational Approaches and Insights

Theme Session to be held at ICLC 11, Berkeley, CA
Date: July 28 - August 3, 2009
Organizer: Miriam R. L. Petruck

Theme Session Description:

Fillmore (1975) introduced the notion of a frame into linguistics over thirty
years ago.  As a cognitive structuring device used in the service of
understanding, the semantic frame, parts of which are indexed by words (Fillmore
1985), is at the heart of Frame Semantics. While researchers have appealed to
Frame Semantics to provide accounts for various lexical, syntactic, and semantic
phenomena in a range of languages (e.g. Ostman 2000, Petruck 1995, Lambrecht
1984), its most highly developed instantiation is found in FrameNet
(http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu). An ongoing research project in
computational lexicography, the FrameNet database provides for a substantial
portion of the vocabulary of contemporary English, a body of semantically and
syntactically annotated sentences from which reliable information can be
reported on the valences or combinatorial possibilities of each lexical item.

FrameNet has generated great interest in the Natural Language Processing
community, resulting in new efforts for lexicon building and computational
semantics. Advances in technology and the availability of large corpora have
facilitated developing FrameNet lexical resources for languages other than
English (with Spanish, Japanese, and German the most advanced, and Hebrew,
Italian, Slovenian and Swedish at early stages). These projects (necessarily)
also test FrameNet's implicit claim about representing conceptual structure,
rather than building an application driven structured organization of the
lexicon of contemporary English. At the same time, FrameNet has inspired
research on automatically induced semantic lexicons (Green and Dorr 2004, Pado
and Lapata 2005) and automatic semantic role labeling (ASRL), or ''semantic
parsing'' (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002, Thompson et al. 2003, Fleischman and Hovy
2003, Litkowski 2004, Baldewein et al. 2004).  Frame Semantics has proven to be
among the most useful techniques for deep semantic analysis of texts, thus
contributing to research on information extraction (Mohit and Narayanan 2003),
question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004, Narayanan and Sinha 2005), and
automatic reasoning (Scheffczyk et al. 2006, Scheffczyk et al., 2007).

In 1999 (at ICLC 6 in Stockholm), researchers began to address cognitive aspects
of Frame Semantics explicitly in a public forum during a theme session on
Construction Grammar, the sister theory of Frame Semantics.  The goal of the
2009 theme session is to bring together researchers in cognitive, corpus and
computational linguistics to (1) present their work using corpus approaches for
the development of FrameNet-style lexical resources and FrameNet-derived
representations for computational approaches to semantic processing and (2)
share their insights about advances in Frame Semantics. We are particularly
interested in work that attends to the cognitive dimension in Frame Semantics.

Submission Procedure:
Abstracts must be
- a maximum of 500 words 
- submitted in .pdf format
- received no later than the Sept 30, 2008 deadline
- sent with the title of the paper, name(s) of author(s), affiliation and a
contact e-mail address
- sent to miriamp@icsi.berkeley.edu

Important: Both the theme session proposal and the individual contributions will
undergo independent reviewing by the ICLC program committee.
