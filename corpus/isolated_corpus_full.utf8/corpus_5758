Additionally, the number of Semantic Web events attracting several =
hundred attendees grows larger every year and industrial interest =
includes the majority of the large software and service companies. The =
4th Asian Semantic Web Conference (ASWC 2009) will present the latest =
research and development of the Semantic Web and its related =
technologies. It will bring together researchers in relevant disciplines =
such as artificial intelligence, knowledge modeling, logic, databases, =
social networks, Web services, distributed computing, Web engineering, =
information systems, natural language processing, multimedia, and =
human-computer interaction.
=20
ASWC 2009 will include a Research Track, a Semantic Web in Use Track, a =
