Second Call for Papers

                        VVPS'09

                    2nd Workshop on
            Verification and Validation of
           Planning and Scheduling Systems

             http://www-vvps09.imag.fr

                  September 20, 2009
                 Thessaloniki, Greece

Held in conjunction with the International Conference on Automated
Planning and Scheduling, ICAPS 2009, September 19-23, 2009:

 http://icaps09.icaps-conference.org


Topic and Objectives:

Verification techniques, such as model checking, and planning
techniques have many commonalities. Planning and scheduling (P&S)
systems are finding increased application in safety- and
mission-critical systems that require a high level of assurance.
Experience has shown that most errors are in domain models, which can
be inconsistent, incomplete or inaccurate models of the target
domains. However tools and methodologies for verification and
validation (V&V) of P&S systems have received relatively little
attention. The objective of this workshop is to maintain an
interaction between the V&V and P&S communities, to identify
specialized and innovative V&V tools and methodologies that can be
applied to P&S. Topics of interest include: V&V of domain models,
using technologies such as static analysis, theorem proving, and model
checking; consistency and completeness of domain models; domain model
coverage metrics; regression, stress and boundary testing; runtime
verification of plan executions; generation of robust plans;
compositional verification of domain models; how to structure domain
models which are more amenable to static analysis; inspection methods;
the relationship between timed automata and domain models;
investigations of the impact wrt. V&V of procedural versus declarative
plan models; etc. The first VVPS workshop was held with ICAPS in 2005
in Monterey, California: http://planning.cis.strath.ac.uk/vvpsws.


Submission and publication:

There are two types of submissions: short position statements and
regular papers. Position papers are a maximum of two pages. Regular
papers are a maximum of 10 (ten) pages. Papers will be printed as a
hard-copy hand-out, and workshop findings and a workshop report will
be published on the workshop website. All papers should be typeset in
the AAAI style, described at
http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php.
An attempt will be made to publish the best papers in
a journal after the workshop.


Important Dates:

Paper submission: June 23, 2009
Review Period: June 25, July 18, 2009
Notification of acceptance/rejection: July 22, 2009
Final version due: Aug 8, 2009
Workshop Date: Sep 20th, 2009
