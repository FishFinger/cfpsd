On behalf of the Conference Organizing Committee, we would like to inform you of
the:

Four Corners Conference on Immigration
Mesa State College 
Grand Junction, CO
9 October - 10 October 2009      
Website: www.mesastate.edu/spanish/fcc 

On October 9-10, 2009 Mesa State College will host a conference on immigration
issues that seeks to bridge the gap between academic scholarship and the
experience of immigration in the field.  Papers or panels that explore the
interaction between scholarship and action on immigration issues are most
welcome.  How do theory and practice relate to each other in social services,
national security, criminal justice, identity, art, literature, language or
culture?  This conference is intended to be multi-disciplinary. Scholars and
practitioners in the humanities, social sciences, human services, business and
criminal justice are encouraged to submit proposals.  The goal of the conference
is:
1. To offer a venue for the convergence of theory and practice as related to
immigration
2. To explore multiple approaches to issues surrounding immigration
3. To provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary exchange 
4. To promote understanding, encourage thought and further scholarship related
to issues of immigration.

Conference organizers also invite proposals for complete panels or roundtables
related to immigration.
