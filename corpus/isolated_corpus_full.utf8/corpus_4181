Conference Description
Although Information Structure (IS) was introduced in linguistics by the Prague
School functionalism [Firbas (1962/1964), Dane? (1964/1968), see Sgall, Haji?ová
& Panevová (1986), Firbas (1992) and Newmeyer (2001) for an overview], it is
only in the last few decades that systematic research on IS has started. By now,
many empirical analyses of specific facts involving IS are available [cf., among
many others, Charolles' (1997/2003) work on left-dislocated adverbials in
French]. From a theoretical point of view, recent research focuses on two major
topics: (i) the notional foundations of IS theory [cf. Vallduví (1992),
Lambrecht (1994), Erteschik-Shir (1997/2007)], and (ii) the development of
models of grammar which account for the interaction between IS, syntax and
semantics. For instance, several multi-level integrated models of grammar have
been proposed by scholars working in a functional perspective [cf. Pollard & Sag
(1994), Bresnan (2001), Jackendoff (2002), Croft (2001), Goldberg (1995),
Williams (2003), Van Valin & La Polla (1997)]. Likewise, whereas generative
studies used to exclude the influence of the context, IS notions have recently
been integrated into the 'cartographic' approach initiated by Rizzi (1997/2004)
[cf. also Haegeman (2003/2004/2006/2007)]. 

Although the relevance of IS for linguistic analysis is now widely recognized,
its precise nature and its position in human language and cognition are still
poorly understood. Besides the terminological and conceptual fuzziness that
often characterizes analyses on the basis of IS, this can be attributed to two
factors. Firstly, there still is a significant gap in the literature between
theoretical approaches and descriptive analyses of IS. Whereas the former
contain relatively few detailed empirical analyses of linguistic data, the
latter either focus on a particular linguistic phenomenon in one or several
languages or consider several IS-driven syntactic configurations in a particular
language. The second factor goes beyond the purely linguistic side of the
problem. At this stage of research it is unclear to which extent phenomena such
as topic and focus are purely linguistic notions (i.e. grammar-driven) or belong
to specific cognitive mechanisms interacting with language. It is very likely
that IS-phenomena cannot fully be captured by linguistics because IS is in part
a matter of human cognition. This suggests that linguistic research on IS should
be complemented with interdisciplinary psycholinguistic research and vice versa,
in order to test the psycholinguistic hypothesis [cf. Levelt (1989)], according
to whom IS is absolutely fundamental in language production and prior to (rather
than simultaneous with) purely linguistic processes concerning form and meaning
[cf. the research projects "Spatial Framing Adverbials : linguistic and
psycholinguistic approaches" at the laboratory LaTTiCe Paris & "Information
Structure in Language Acquisition" at the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics Nijmegen].

The aim of this conference is to bring together linguists and psycholinguists
from different theoretical perspectives to discuss the interface between IS,
syntax and semantics, as well as the application of psycholinguistic methods to
IS phenomena. We invite papers presenting an empirical analysis of specific
language facts or more general theoretical papers about the interaction between
IS, syntax, semantics and/or human cognition. We particularly welcome
contributions which, more or less explicitly, apply ideas of the key-note speakers. 

A special session will be dedicated to IS in French.

Meeting Description:

The conference is concerned with the concept of translocation, which denotes
more than a simple 'change of location' or 'dislocation' (which often implies a
privileging of 'origins' over 'new' locations), because this concept can leave
open points of departure and destination. Translocation is not only a process
(the transfer of people, cultural products, borders), but can also mean a new
kind of location, a trans-location consisting of fractured and variously
connected spaces. 

Second Call for Papers

The English department of WWU Muenster University will be hosting the 20th
annual conference of the Association for the Study of the New Literatures in
English (ASNEL) from 21st to 24th May 2009. The conference focuses on the
phenomenon of Postcolonial Translocations, investigating not only the global
movements of people, cultural products and ideas. Additionally, new kinds of
location, trans-locations consisting of fractured and variously connected
spaces, are taken into account. 

ASNEL is the leading academic association for anglophone postcolonial and
transcultural Literary and Cultural Studies in the German-speaking countries.
The conferences attract an international audience and provide an important forum
for researchers in this field. For the 2009 conference, c.120 papers and up to
200 participants from 25 different countries are expected.

In addition to discussing various issues regarding Postcolonial/Transcultural
Studies in general, the conference focuses on literary and cultural
manifestations of globalisation, transnationalism, migration and diasporic
phenomena. Keynote speakers and panellists will examine subjects on authority
and authenticity, border regimes and border crossings, travel literature, and
changing conceptions of space. Selected panels include Cosmopolitan Film
Cultures, Translocating Cosmopolitanism, Imagining Translocal Space,
Transmigration, Translocal Food and its Representations and Black British
Translocations. 

The 2009 ASNEL conference will also feature a section on the teaching of New
English Literatures in schools. The School Teaching Forum offers sessions for
practicing teachers and students, a panel for academics and school-teachers as
well as general theoretical and methodological discussions.

Confirmed keynote speakers include Professor Ien Ang, Professor of Cultural
Studies and currently an Australian Research Council Professorial Fellow at the
University of Western Sydney, and Professor Diana Brydon who is a holder of the
Canada Research Chair in Globalization and Cultural Studies at the University of
Manitoba.

The second call for papers ends on the 06 February 2009.
