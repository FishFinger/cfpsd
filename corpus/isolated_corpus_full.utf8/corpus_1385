  Evolutionary Computation in Games at CEC'07 in Singapore: Extended Deadline
  p.hingston@ecu.edu.au

Dear Evolutionary Computation/Games Researcher,

This email is a further reminder about the special session on evolutionary
computation in games to be held at the upcoming IEEE Congress on
Evolutionary Computation (CEC'07).  CEC'07 will be held in Singapore
from 25-28 September 2007.

PAPER SUBMISSION IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE ON 31 MARCH 2007.


Special session on: Evolutionary Computation in Games
=====================================================

Games have proven to be an ideal test domain for the study of evolutionary
algorithms as not only are they fun to play and interesting to observe,
but they provide competitive and dynamic environments that model many
real-world problems.  Evolutionary techniques have successfully been
applied to many different kinds of games, however a number of research
questions still remain.  This special session aims to bring together
leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to
discuss recent advances and explore future directions in this field. .....
