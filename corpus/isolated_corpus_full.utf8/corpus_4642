functional), semantics, comparative linguistics, and cognitive linguistics.
Topics from other linguistic disciplines are welcome as well.

Russian, and should be accompanied by an abstract of up to 10 lines written
in the language of the article, an extended abstract (1,800 to 2,000
characters long) written in English (only for articles written in French,
German, Italian, and Russian) and a list of relevant key words.

Manuscripts should be sent as e-mail attachments (Word documents only) both
to the Editor-in-Chief of Suvremena lingvistika, Ida Raffaelli
(ida.raffaelli@ffzg.hr) and to the Managing Editor Mislava Berto?a
(mbertosa@ffzg.hr). All contributions are peer-reviewed by two anonymous
reviewers. Manuscripts may be rejected, accepted subject to revision, or
accepted as such. There is no limit to the number of pages.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
