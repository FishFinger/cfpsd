Full Title: International Workshop on Intercultural Collaboration 
Short Title: IWIC 2009 

Date: 20-Feb-2009 - 21-Feb-2009
Location: Palo Alto, CA, USA 
Contact Person: Susan Fussell
Meeting Email: iwic2009@khn.nict.go.jp
Web Site: http://langrid.nict.go.jp/iwic2009/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Translation 

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

The main theme of this workshop is intercultural collaboration, from both technical and socio-cultural perspectives. Topics will include collaboration support (such as natural language processing, Web, and Internet technologies), social scientific analyses of intercultural interaction, and case studies that increase mutual understanding in our multicultural world. 

Call for Papers

Submissions will be considered for papers, panels, demonstrations, and posters.

Papers 
Papers are solicited on any aspect of intercultural communication and collaboration. Papers can describe studies of intercultural communication and collaboration or present new technologies to assess and support intercultural interaction. Examples of suitable paper topics include: 

- Field studies of intercultural collaboration in global organizations or in local communities
- Laboratory studies of intercultural collaboration
- Survey studies of cultural differences in collaboration styles
- Case studies of intercultural collaboration using information technologies
- Cultural responses to cross-cultural interaction
- Computer supported intercultural collaboration
- Ubiquitous/ambient technologies for intercultural collaboration
- Internet and web technologies for intercultural collaboration
- Frameworks for manual or automatic measurement of properties of intercultural communication
- Multilingual communication technologies
- Interoperability of language resources
- Usability of language resources for intercultural collaboration
- New methods or measures for the study of intercultural collaboration

All papers are expected to be suitable for a multidisciplinary audience and focus on issues of intercultural collaboration. Full papers should be no longer than 10 pages. Papers should be formatted according to the ACM SIGCHI template and submitted in PDF format.  Details on the submission procedure will be provided in the near future. Please see the SIGCHI author instruction page (http://sigchi.org/chipubform/) for more information and downloadable templates. 

All full papers will be evaluated using a double-blind review process.  Authors should omit their names and affiliations from the title area of the paper and conceal references to their own prior work by referring to it in the third person (e.g., authors should say ''In an earlier study, Jones and Smith found ?'' instead of ''In an earlier study, we found ?'').  Papers that have not been appropriately anonymized will be returned without review.

Panels, Demonstrations and Posters
IWIC will also feature three categories of nonarchival submissions: Panels, demonstrations and posters.  Submissions for these categories should be no longer than 3 pages in length using the ACM template (see above).  

Unlike paper submissions, panels, demonstrations and posters will not be blind reviewed.  Authors should include their complete names and contact information at the top of their submitted PDF file.
 
Panels: Individuals may submit proposals for panels of three or four talks on a related theme in intercultural communication. Panel submissions will not be archival, so panelists may discuss previously published work. Submissions should provide each panelist's background and contact information, as well as a brief statement of his or her position on the panel theme.

Demonstrations: Individuals may submit proposals to present demonstrations of new technologies for intercultural communication.  Demonstration proposals should clearly describe the motivation for the tool and how it will be demonstrated at the workshop. Demonstration descriptions will not be archival; therefore, demonstrations can include both previously published work and work that is not yet ready for publication.

Posters: Individuals may submit proposals to present informal posters during the workshop. Poster descriptions will not be archival; therefore, posters can describe both previously published work and work that is not yet ready for publication.

Review Process: 
Submitted papers, panels, and demonstrations will be reviewed by a panel of distinguished researchers in the area of intercultural communication and collaboration.

Important Dates:
Deadline for papers, panels, posters and demonstrations: June 30th, 2008
Author notification: September 30th, 2008
Deadline for camera ready papers: November 30th, 2008

Meeting Description:

COLING 2008 Workshop
TextGraphs-3
Graph-based Algorithms for
Natural Language Processing	

In connection with COLING 2008, the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics August 18-22

The workshop will be held on August 24, 2008, in conjunction with COLING in Manchester, UK. 

Call for Papers

Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of graph theory into natural language processing. Graph theory is a well studied discipline, and so is the field of natural language processing. Traditionally, these two areas of study have been perceived as distinct, with different algorithms, different applications, and different potential end-users. However, as recent research work has shown, the two disciplines are in fact intimately connected, with a large variety of natural language processing applications finding efficient solutions within graph-theoretical frameworks.

In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a graph and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-based representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic role assignment, summarisation, sentiment analysis and up to the study of the evolutionary dynamics of language.

The TextGraphs workshop addresses a broad spectrum of research areas and brings together researchers working on problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for natural language processing as well as on the theory of graph-based methods. Different NLP applications use different graph-based approaches, and bringing together researchers from different fields fosters the exchange of ideas. Furthermore, looking at graph-based methods from the perspective of diverse applications facilitates a discussion about the theory of graph-based methods and about the theoretical justification of the empirical results within the NLP community. This discussion is vital because further progress in graph-based NLP applications is impossible without deeper understanding of basic theoretical principles.

Starting with TextGraphs-3 we would like to have one area of graph-based NLP research as the primary topic for discussion. We intend to set this year's focus on large scale lexical acquisition and representation. Efficient graph methods can help to alleviate the acquisition bottleneck for lexicon construction and resource building. They also provide smarter representation schemes for the lexicon that facilitate fast search and word retrieval. SIGLEX endorsed our workshop proposal for COLING-08.

We invite submissions of papers on graph-based methods applied to NLP problems. Especially, we encourage submissions regarding:
- Large-scale lexical acquisition using graph representations
- Graph-based representation schemes of the mental lexicon

Other topics include, but are not limited to:
- Graph representations for ontology learning
- Graph labeling and edge labeling for semantic representations
- Encoding semantic distances in graphs
- Graph algorithms for word sense disambiguation
- Graph methods for Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, Text Mining and Understanding
- Random walk graph methods
- Spectral graph clustering
- Small world graphs in natural language processing
- Semi-supervised graph-based methods
- Statistical network methods and analysis
- Dynamic graph representations for NLP
