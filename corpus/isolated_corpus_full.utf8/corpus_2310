Aston University Postgraduate Conference in Corpus Linguistics: Thursday 22=
nd May 2008
http://acorn.aston.ac.uk/postgraduate_conference.html

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

The objective of the Postgraduate conference in Corpus Linguistics, organiz=
ed by the ACORN project team of the School of
Languages and Social Sciences at Aston University, is to enable postgraduat=
es to present their corpus-related research. By
combining the conference with the Aston Corpus Symposium, which will take p=
lace on the following day, postgraduates will also be
able to hear experts talk about their past and current projects.

Corpus studies have had an immense impact on language description over the =
past 20 years, dispelling many myths and discovering
many hitherto unforeseen aspects of language in use. Wider impacts have als=
o been felt through work on discourse analysis, genre
analysis, and in translation studies. In recent years, attention has been i=
ncreasingly focussed on the use of corpora for
teaching and learning.

Presentations can focus on any corpus-related topic.

Abstracts written in English of max 300 words (with bibliographical referen=
ces) for a 20 minute paper should be sent by 15th
February 2008 to kosemi@aston.ac.uk or g.r.yepes@aston.ac.uk. The preferred=
 file formats are .doc and .pdf. Author's name,
affiliation, and contact details should be provided in a separate attachmen=
t.

Authors of accepted abstracts will be notified by 1st April 2008.

The conference will be followed by Aston Corpus Symposium, which will take =
place on Friday 23rd May. More information on the
symposium is available at http://acorn.aston.ac.uk/symposium.html.
