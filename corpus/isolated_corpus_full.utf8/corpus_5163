CALL FOR PAPERS
  
The First International Workshop on Cognitonics (October 
12 - 13, 2009)in conjunction with the Multi-Conference 
"Information Society 2009"
(October 12 - 16, 2009, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, 
Slovenia, http://is.ijs.si/urnik_eng.asp?lang=eng)

Co-Chairs: Dr. Vladimir A. Fomichov (*) and Dr. Olga S. 
Fomichova (**)
  (*) Faculty of Business Informatics, State University - 
Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia
(**) State Educational Centre "Dialogue of Sciences", 
Moscow, Russia

#Workshop Theme
One of the most important negative aspects of quick 
technological development in the modern information 
society is the observed shifts in the systems of values of 
people. The first shift is the shift from the eternal 
values to commercialized values. The second shift is a 
consequence of the underestimation of the value of 
national cultures in contrast to the overestimation of the 
on-going processes of globalization (by the young 
generation, in particular).    The third shift is dealing 
with the existing gap between the rational, pragmatic, 
self-oriented development and spiritually-coloured 
emotional development of the personality. The expanding 
gap destroys the integrity of the human nature.

The goal of the workshop is to start combing the efforts 
of the scholars from numerous scientific fields in order 
to establish a new synergy aimed at supporting the 
harmonic development of the personality in the modern 
information society and, as a consequence, to compensate a 
number of negative shifts in the systems of values of 
people taking place in this society. It is intended to 
establish this synergy under the framework of a new 
scientific discipline - Cognitonics.

Now only initial configuration of Cognitonics does exist. 
The scholars from various fields will be able to 
considerably expand this initial configuration, proceeding 
from their scientific backgrounds and national cultures.

The workshop (being a part of the Conference on Cognitive 
Sciences) will have two tracks:
(1) Humanities Track
(2) Computer Science and Web Science Track
The working language of the workshop is English.

#Registration
The participants of the workshop register for the 
Multi-Conference "Information Society-2009 (IS-2009)" 
(Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 
http://is.ijs.si/urnik_eng.asp?lang=eng).
The registration fee (see the IS-2009 Web-site) covers the 
participation in all sessions of IS-2009, a hard copy of 
the IS-2009 Proceedings, coffee-breaks, and a Cocktail 
Party (October 13th, 14:00 - 15:30).

#Goals of Cognitonics

There are weighty grounds to believe that the modern 
information society has accumulated a lot of such problems 
concerning the development/underdevelopment of the 
personality that for solving these problems it is 
necessary and possible to elaborate a unified, fundamental 
approach. This approach is the creation of a new 
scientific discipline - Cognitonics (see Informatica. An 
International Journal of Computing and Informatics 
(Slovenia), 2006, Vol. 30, No. 4, pp. 387-398, URL 
www.informatica.si/vol30.htm#No4).

      Cognitonics is aimed at keeping the integrity of the 
nature of the human being and, consequently, conducing to 
overcoming a gap between spiritual, emotional and 
intellectual  (rational, pragmatic) development of the 
person in the new reality of swift changes, technological 
challenges, and globalization. Cognitonics is studying and 
looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of 
processing information and developing emotional sphere of 
the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three 
mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an 
indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic 
information processing skills of the learners, linguistic 
mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad 
mental outlook being important preconditions of successful 
work practically in every sphere of professional activity 
in information society.

      From the standpoint of educational practice, 
Cognitonics proposes an answer to the following question: 
what precious ideas and images accumulated by the mankind, 
at what age, and in what a way are to be inscribed into 
the conceptual picture of the world of a person in order 
to harmonize his/her intellectual and spiritually-coloured 
emotional development.

      Cognitonics formulates a new, large-scale goal for 
the software industry and Web science: to develop a new 
generation of culture-oriented computer programs and 
online courses (in the collaboration with educators, 
linguists, art historians, psychologists) - the programs 
and online courses intended for supporting and developing 
creativity, cognitive-emotional sphere, the appreciation 
of the roots of the national cultures, the awareness of 
the integrity of the cultural space in the information 
society, and for developing symbolic information 
processing and linguistic skills, associative and 
reasoning abilities of children.

#Topics (their list is not exhaustive)

(1) Humanities Track

- The methods and experience of developing a broad mental 
outlook and creativity,
- Establishing ties between self-paced activity and the 
necessity to keep pace with time,
- Looking for the philosophical roots of modern 
technological achievements and forecasting their impact on 
the nature of human being,
- Looking for the new ways of introducing the eternal 
values of the humanity and the changes in the perception 
of the world in the educational programs in the form of 
cross-disciplinary courses,
- Analyzing the negative shifts in the modern society and 
the response of the young generation to these shifts.

(2) Computer Science and Web Science Track

(2-1) The methods of designing and experience of using 
culture-oriented computer intelligent systems (local 
computer network based or Web-based) for:
- developing linguistic mechanisms of young children, 
teenagers, university students, and adult learners,
- expanding mental outlook through learning history, 
literature, poetry, art, architecture, ecology, etc.;
(2-2) The structure of online courses for developing 
linguistic mechanisms and expanding mental outlook of the 
learners,
(2-3) cognitive preconditions of introducing children to 
computers.
