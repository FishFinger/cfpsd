Meeting Description:

With the technological advancement, digital dictionary (e-dictionary as well as
on-line and desktop dictionary) is emerging as a standard format of dictionary
dwindling the use of the traditionally valued paper dictionary. Apart from the
traditional look-up use for spelling, meaning and usage, the digital dictionary
has gained additional uses in the emerging domains of language use like for
spell checker, grammatical use, etc. In the newer domains of language use and
research, digital dictionary as well as other digital lexicographical resources
(DLR) like WordNet, thesarus, lexipedia, glossary and lexicon (general as well
as domain specific), etc. are of immense value. They form a basis of various
aspects of NLP. These DLR, constructed either via automatic acquisition (i.e.
scanning of the paper dictionary or other resources) or hand-crafted, pose a
challenge both lexicographically as well as computationally.
