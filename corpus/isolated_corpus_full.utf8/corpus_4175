Full Title: Language Teaching 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2009 

For the first time in the field, the leading journal Language Teaching CUP
now includes a section of research papers dedicated exclusively to
replication studies. This area of research receives little or no specific
attention in the mainstream journals but needs to play a far more
significant role than it has up to now in our field. In keeping with the
survey characteristics of Language Teaching, we also encourage submissions
of meta-analyses which attempt to combine or synthesise a series of
comparable research replications. 

More details about this permanent Call for Papers can be obtained from the
Editor at: gporte@gmail.com
