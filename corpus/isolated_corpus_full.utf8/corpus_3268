2nd Workshop on Information Credibility on the Web (WICOW 2008)

          in conjunction with 17th ACM CIKM 2008 


           October 30, 2008, Napa Valley, California
            http://www.dl.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wicow2



* AIM OF THE WORKSHOP *

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion about issues
related to information credibility and its evaluation.

As computers and computer networks become more sophisticated, a huge
amount of information, such as that found in Web documents, has been
accumulated and circulated. Such information gives people a framework 
for organizing their daily lives. A well-functioning society needs technology
 that can be used to manage this wealth of information and, in particular, 
investigate its credibility. This technology would be able to handle a wide 
range of tasks: extracting credible information related to a given topic,
organizing this information, detecting its provenance, clarifying
background, facts, and various related opinions and the distribution of
them, and so on. Especially, as the Web is becoming a major source of
information nowadays, it is necessary to provide efficient and reliable
methods for evaluation of Web content's trustworthiness. 


* TOPICS *

We invite submissions on any aspects of information credibility on the
Web. Topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Information credibility evaluation and its applications
- Content analysis for credibility evaluation
- Sentiment analysis of content
- Credibility of Web search results
- Search models and applications for trustworthy content
- Conflicting opinion detection and analysis
- Credibility evaluation of user-generated content (e.g., Wikipedia)
- Information credibility evaluation in social networks
- Analysis of information dissemination
- Estimation of author and publishing venue reputation
- Spatial and temporal aspects in information credibility
- Estimation of information age, provenance and validity
- Sociological and psychological aspects of information credibility
- Users study for information credibility
- Risk assessment of information credibility
- Multimedia content credibility
- Persuasive technologies
- Information credibility in online advertising and Internet monetization
- Object identification on the Web


* IMPORTANT DATES *

- July 20, 2008 - Paper submission
- August 10, 2008 - Notification of acceptance
- August 15, 2008 - Camera-ready paper submission (hard deadline for publication in proceedings)
- October 30, 2008 - Workshop


* SUBMISSION *

Submissions should be sent in English in PDF format via the submission website. Papers should 
adhere to ACM formatting guidelines and should not exceed 8 pages. They must be original and 
have not been submitted for publication elsewhere. We encourage also position papers outlining 
interesting research directions. 

The accepted papers are going to appear in CIKM Workshops Proceedings published by ACM either 
as full (up to 8 pages) or short papers (up to 4 pages) depending on the review results. 
At least one author of each accepted submission should register by the end of the early 
registration period in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings.
