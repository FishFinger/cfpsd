Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce that the International Symposium "Transcultural
Mediations in Iberoamerican Spaces - Languages, Literatures and Translation=
",
organized by the Modern Literatures and Languages Department of the Univers=
ity
of Montreal, will be held from May 20 to May 22, in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.

Referential Framework:

Current reality confronts us with the problems of diversity, life in societ=
y and
survival on the planet. The imperative need to give adequate and effective
answers to such challenges leads us to rethink the modality of the exchange=
s
that arise in the organization of space and human interactions. To this end=
, we
propose to explore three spheres of transcultural mediations: namely those
related to languages, literatures and translation. This exploration will
consider mediations produced in Iberoamerican spaces characterized by the
presence and contact of different cultural horizons (mainly Amerindian,
European-Criollo and Afro-descendant).

Languages: Spanish in contact with other languages; history of Spanish in
America; teaching of Spanish as a second language.

Literatures: Genre and canon building; orality/literacy interaction; electr=
onic
and print medias, publicity.

Translation: Intervention or agency of the translator (adaptation,
appropriation, rewriting); cultural and symbolic representation of the Othe=
r;
conceptualization of translation according to cultures.

Plenary sessions: several plenary sessions will take place with well known
keynote speakers from the three fields referred to above.

The official languages of the Symposium will be: Spanish, French and Englis=
h. A
certificate of attendance and participation will be issued by the Universit=
y of
Montreal.=20

Call for Papers:

Academic Program:

Papers (30 min. including 10 min. for questions): A two folio (4000 charact=

Decisions by the scientific committee will be communicated in December 2009=
