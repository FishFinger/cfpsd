Contact Person: Nina Topintzi

Web Site: http://www.enl.auth.gr/symposium19/ 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Phonology; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 'Mapping Asymmetries: Phonology, Syntax & Information Structure' workshop
aims at exploring areas of mismatches and asymmetries in the mapping with
respect to any of the levels of syntax, phonology, and information structure. 

Call for Papers

A rich amount of research has acknowledged the interconnection between syntax
and phonology. The debate however on how and to what extent this relationship is
realized still remains lively. There have been many different approaches to such
questions: various levels of phonological phrasing have been assumed to be based
on syntactic information, either isomorphic to it or not (Selkirk 2002,
Truckenbrodt 2005, Ishihara 2006, Fery 2007, among others). Information
structure has been shown to be a fruitful area to investigate the
syntax-phonology mapping and proposals for its implementation include, among
others, Zubizarretta (1998), Neeleman & van de Koot (to appear), Kucerova
(2007), Wagner (2007), Krifka (1998), Schwarzschild (1999), Sauerland (2004),
Büring (2003), among many others. The aim of this workshop is to explore areas
of mismatches and asymmetries in this mapping with respect to any of the three
levels of description mentioned above--syntax, phonology, and information
structure. Some of the questions to be addressed include: 

How ambiguities in one level are resolved at another
Asymmetric mapping from one level to another
The extent of isomorphism between any two levels
Whether recursion extends beyond syntax to phonology and information structure;
if so, what the properties of mapping from one level to the other are

This workshop will run in parallel to the general session of the 19th
International Symposium on Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (ISTAL 19),
Thessaloniki, Greece, 3-5 April 2009. Organization details will be available in
due course at: http://www.enl.auth.gr/symposium19/. Papers on any aspect of the
syntax-phonology-information structure interface are welcome, however, priority
will be given to those that complement the workshop's inter-theoretical
orientation. 

Those interested can submit abstracts either in .pdf or .doc format. MSWord is
only acceptable if the abstract contains no special fonts. Only electronic
submissions will be considered. Abstracts should be anonymous and 300-500 words
long. Send your personal information - Name, Affiliation, and Contact Email - in
the body of the message and attach the abstract with title but without name and
affiliation. Please note that only one single or co-authored abstract can be
submitted. Submissions should be sent by 1 December 2008 to the workshop email
address: synphoninfo@gmail.com. Applicants will be notified on abstract
acceptance by 15 January 2009.

English. Every paper is allotted 30 minutes for presentation (of which the last
10 minutes will be for discussion).

The objective of this conference is to give the chance to students at all stages
in their research to present and discuss their work and have the possibility of
interchanging opinions with other students and professors. Recall that NO
DOCTORS can present their works in this conference. Abstracts with doctors or
professors as authors or co-authors will not be accepted. 

Areas of Linguistics admitted:  
- Morphology 
- Syntax 
- Discourse Analysis  
- Dialectology 
- Phonetics and Phonology  
- Phraseology
- Lexicography and Lexicology 
- Applied Linguistics  
- Clinical Linguistics 
- Historical Linguistics  
- Linguistic Typology 
- Pragmatics
- Semantics
- Sociolinguistics
- Psycholinguistics
- Translation
- Others
Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (A4), with one-inch margins, Times New
Roman, font size 12, (SILDoulos IPA93 for phonetic symbols), single-spaced. A
maximum of 5 bibliographical references can be included. 

You must send a file with an anonymous abstract and another one with the
following information: on the first line there must be the title of your talk
(in bold) and the area in which it is framed (within parentheses and in plain
style); the second line must include the author's name and e-mail address; the
third line must contain the author's affiliation; and the fourth line must be empty.
The abstracts can only be sent in electronic format, via the form that can be
found at "Inscripcions". 

Deadline for abstract submission: 15 December 2008.

Once the abstracts have passed through the selection procedure, the results will
be notified to the authors and the publication rules will be provided for the
writing up of the paper, which must not exceed 10 pages and must be handed in on
the day of the talk.
