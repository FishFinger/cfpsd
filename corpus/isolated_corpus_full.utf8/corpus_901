         --------------- Last Call for Papers --------------
 
       
         Named Entities: Recognition, Classification and Use
         
            Special Issue of Lingvisticae Investigationes



Special issue website:
http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/SpecialIssueNERLingInv/index.html


This special topic issue of the journal Lingvisticae Investigationes
is scheduled to come out in early 2008 on the broad topic of Named
Entities.

The aim is to bring out innovative papers on the issues and advances
in Named Entity recognition, classification and use, and how Named
Entities could be handled more effectively in a variety of NLP
applications.


GUEST EDITORS
-------------
The guest editors for this special issue will be (in alphabetical
order):
 
Elisabete Ranchhod
University of Lisbon
 
Satoshi Sekine
New York University



BACKGROUND
----------

Since the MUC Conferences about Information Extraction, Named Entity
Recognition and Classification (NERC) is a well-established task in
the NLP community and is regarded as a crucial technology for many NLP
applications.  The definition of what is a Named Entity (NE), however,
still remains an overt question. NEs include classical classes of
proper names (persons, organizations, geographic locations,
geo-political entities) and numeric expressions (time, currencies,
percentages).

However, the correct identification and classification of single and
multiword domain specific expressions (e.g., disease names, biological
agents causing health problems, drugs used in disease treatment)
should be an important issue for a number of NLP applications (IE, MT,
QA, etc.) and dealing with these questions has become part and parcel
of the problems dealt by the NE camp.  Likewise, reference to definite
events or entities no longer referenced as proper names in text, as
encompassed by the ACE program, has long been accepted as part of the
NER discipline.


TOPICS
------

The guest editors seek papers on original and unpublished research on
all aspects of NE recognition, classification, and use. Special topics
of interest include, but are not limited to:

   * Real applications that employ NERC technology 
   * Linguistic properties of proper names 
   * Resources (lexicons, grammars, gazetteers, ontologies) for NERC 
   * The relevance of NERC as a subtask in NLP applications
     (e.g. question- answering (QA), information retrieval (IR),
     summarization, machine translation (MT))
   * Evaluation of NERC systems and of the import of NERC in larger
     applications
   * Cross-language issues in named entity research 
   * Philosophical and methodological concerns in NERC 
   * NEs in speech and transcribed speech and other media
   * Tools for rapid development of NERC resources
   * Learning of NERC rules
   * Domain adaptability of NERC systems
