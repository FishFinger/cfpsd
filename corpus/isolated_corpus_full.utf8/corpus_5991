********** Call for Workshops / Tutorials - ECIR 2010 **********

     32nd European Conference on Information Retrieval

     The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
     28 - 31 March 2010

     In cooperation with: BCS-IRSG, ACM SIGIR, The Open University, =

Dublin City University, University of Essex
     http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/ecir2010/

****************************************************************


The European Conference on Information Retrieval provides an opportunity for
both new and established researchers to present research papers reporting
new, unpublished, and innovative research results within information
retrieval.  Proposals are invited for one-day or half-day workshops and
tutorials on the first day of the conference, Sunday Mar 28th. The deadline
for submitting workshop/tutorial proposals has been extended to the 21st
September 2009.

The purpose of ECIR workshops is to provide a platform for presenting novel
ideas and research areas in a less focused and interactive way. As such,
workshops offer a good opportunity for young researchers to present their
work and to obtain feedback from an interested and engaged community.

Tutorials inform the Information Retrieval community on recent advancements
in core IR research, related research, or on novel application areas related
to Information Retrieval.

Proposals should show on the first page title, abstract, and bio(s) of
organisers/presenters (100-200 words). Also, the proposal should indicate
whether the workshop/tutorial is for a half-day or full-day schedule. It
will be helpful if background, aim and audience are described. In the
background, it should be mentioned if a similar workshop/tutorial was held
at another venue.

Submissions to be sent in PDF format to Thomas Roelleke
"thor@dcs.qmul.ac.uk" with subject field "ECIR". For more information please
see the call on the ECIR 2010 Website:
http://kmi.open.ac.uk/events/ecir2010/call-for-workshop-tutorials.php
