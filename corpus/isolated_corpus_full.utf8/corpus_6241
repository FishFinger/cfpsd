2nd Call for Papers

Information structure has been thoroughly studied in many respects, but,
surprisingly, hierarchical aspects have not received the attention they deserve.
Some remarks supporting a hierarchical organization of information structure can
be found in Rooth (1992, 2006) and Krifka (1999), while other researchers are
inclined to assume a non-recursive model for information structure (see Tomioka
2006 for relevant discussion). Contributions to the workshop should present
evidence from phonology, syntax, or semantics that allows todecide whether
grammar involves a hierarchical and recursive information 'structure' or merely
a flat, non-recursive information 'partition'. The following topics exemplify
the kinds of questions that we hope will be addressed in the workshop (though
the list is, of course, not meant to be exhaustive).

Can the different types of information partitioning (e.g., topic-comment,
focus-background) enter a subordination relation (as argued in, e.g., Neeleman &
de Koot 2008), and if so, is their combinatorial potential constrained in a
grammatical rather than conceptual sense?

In Japanese, a topic may follow the subject or occupy the sentence initial
position. In German, topics show up in different slots, as well. These multiple
options raise the issue of whether slots related to information structure are
present both in CP and in VP, the two derivational phases proposed by Chomsky
(2005). Is there a syntactic and prosodic difference between the two layers of
IS in a clause? Can these options be realized at the same time? Is it only the
phases, that may host IS-related categories? If so, why do phases have such a
privileged status? Is this property related to their status as domains of
Spellout? Topic and focus refer to the common ground of an utterance and are as
such main clause phenomena, but elements bearing the expressive characteristics
of topics and foci appear in embedded clauses. If this argues for complex
hierarchical relations among the elements bearing markers of information
structure, the question is how these
relations are encoded prosodically, what roles accent and phrasing play in this
respect, how registers are employed and whether their use in complex information
structure is different from simple recursive structure, and how various
F0-compression operations are integrated into such a model

How do recursion and cyclicity in syntax and prosody relate to each other?
Recursivity has long been considered to be one of the core properties of syntax.
As for prosody, the Strict Layer Hypothesis states that prosodic structure has a
limited number of layers, and that recursivity is either excluded entirely from
the prosodic component or that it is strictly limited (see Selkirk 2000 for
instance). Can this view be maintained in the light of evidence from the
hierarchical organization of information structure?
