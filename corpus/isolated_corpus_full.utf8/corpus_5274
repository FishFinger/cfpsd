Meeting Description:

Capturing knowledge by using markup techniques and by supporting semantic
annotations is a major technique for creating metadata. It is beneficial
in a wide range of content-oriented intelligent applications.
One important application for instance is the Semantic Web. The research
about the WWW currently strives to augment syntactic information
already present in the Web by semantic metadata in order to achieve a
Semantic Web that human and software agents can understand. Here, one
of the most urgent challenges now is a knowledge-capturing problem,
i.e., how one may turn existing syntactic resources into knowledge
structures. A solution is to markup web documents in order to create
metadata on the web or to author new documents in a way that they
contain markup directly.

Another application is the indexing and searching of multimedia (and
multilingual) data. It is difficult to completely process the content of
multimedia data, even with technologies based on natural language
processing, image processing, machine vision and speech recognition.
Therefore, semantic annotation is one of the promising methodologies
to define semantic structures on the content. 

Call for Papers

Semantic Authoring, Annotation and Knowledge Markup (SAAKM 2009)
http://saakm2009.semanticauthoring.org/
1 September 2009

Co-located with the 5th International Conference on
Knowledge Capture (K-Cap 2009)
Redondo Beach, California, USA, 1-4 September 2009
http://kcap09.stanford.edu/

Workshop Goals

This workshop aims at bringing together members of different overlapping
communities that share the interest on semantic authoring and annotation
for developing methods and tools:
- Semantic Web researchers who use semantic authoring and annotation
to enrich the web with distributed relational meta-data in order to
enable a machine-readable web.
- Members of the human language technology community, developing
information extraction systems for the generation of meta-data
- People from the multimedia content domain, indexing and searching
of multimedia (and multilingual) data.
- Researchers who address innovative topics and applications by semantic
annotation (semantic annotation of databases, annotation of
web/grid services, semantic hypertext, etc.)
This will give an opportunity to push further the discussion upon the
potential of semantic annotation across these communities.

Topics of Interest

Potential topics include but are not limited to:
- semantic authoring and publishing
- document engineering
- deriving semantics from document structure and content
- ontology-based authoring and markup
- knowledge markup in the Semantic Web
- standards for supporting knowledge markup, e.g., RDFa, microformats, GRDDL
- using semantic annotations to define knowledge
- integrated software architecture based on semantic annotation
- multimedia annotation (e.g., by using MPEG-7)
- annotation of software components
- linguistic aspects of semantic annotation
- capturing knowledge through Information Extraction and NLP
- text mining for creating knowledge markup
- mining semantic information from blogs, forums or news sources.
- collaborative, shared tagging and annotation
- evaluation of annotation frameworks
- semantic annotation in Semantic Wikis
- semantic annotation of multilingual web sources
- deriving formal semantics from (flat or hierarchical) tagging systems
- vocabularies and ontologies for semantic authoring and annotation
- tools for supporting knowledge markup, semantic annotation,
 semantic authoring, ...
