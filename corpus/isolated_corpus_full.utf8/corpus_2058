Meeting Description

The 44th Annual Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society will be held April
24-26, 2008 at the University of Chicago. This year's conference will include a
main session on modeling language evolution, a general linguistics session, and
three parasessions, detailed below and at http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/cls/ 

General Session 

The general session invites papers on any avenue of current research in
phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics and
sociolinguistics. In addition, CLS 44 will include the following topic-oriented
sessions: 

Main Session: Modeling Language Evolution

The main session invites current research on models of linguistic change,
including both the evolution of individual languages and of the language faculty
itself. We look forward to submissions exploring such topics as: 

- The role of learning in language change 
- The causes and effects of cognitive, physical, and social biases over time 
- Mathematical and computational models of language learning and evolution 
- Experimentation and empirical surveys of the processes and systems involved in
change 
- The application of the methods, theories, and metaphors of related disciplines
like evolutionary biology, ecology, sociology, complex systems, statistical
physics, and agent-based modeling. 

Invited speaker: Simon Kirby, University of Edinburgh 
Invited speaker: TBA 

Parasession: Non-truth Conditional Facets of Meaning

This session explores the notion that sentence meaning is multifaceted. Topics
include but are not limited to: (1) the ways in which expressions that are not
traditionally considered as contributing to truth conditions are accommodated in
a truth-conditional semantics; and (2) alternative, genuinely non-truth
conditional frameworks in which the distinction between truth-conditional and
non-truth conditional meaning is not basic. 

Invited speaker: Gregory Ward, Northwestern University 

Parasession: Code-switching

This session explores the linguistic, social and cognitive dimensions of
inter-sentential and intra-sentential code-switching. Topics include but are not
limited to: syntactic and/or phonological constraints on code-switching,
socio-historical factors in the emergence and use of code-switching,
code-switching in language change, and conversational analyses of code-switching. 

Invited speaker: Jeff MacSwan, Arizona State University

Parassion: Non-verbal Communication

This session explores all forms of non-verbal communication, both within
linguistic systems (i.e. sign languages) and the ways in which non-verbal
communication interacts with linguistic competency. Possible topics include: the
evolution of sign languages, the significance of gesture and other non-verbal
communication in studying language disorders and language processing, and the
audio-visual interface as it pertains to linguistic performance. 

Invited speaker: Carol Padden, University of California, San Diego 

Presentation Format:

Each talk will be given 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for
questions. Presented papers will be published in the CLS Proceedings. 

Submission Guidelines:

Anyone may submit one abstract as the sole author and a second as co-author, or
two as co-author. All abstracts must be submitted online at
http://clml.uchicago.edu/cls44. 

Abstracts should conform to the following specifications: 

- PDF format, with filename ''Lastname - Paper Title'' (e.g., Asimov - The
Morphophonemics of Robojibwe.pdf). 
- 12-point font, 1-inch margins. 
- Include title and keywords (i.e., CLS session title, language, language
family, linguistics subfield). 
- Abstract should be no more than 500 words in length. Data, keywords, and
references are not included in the final count, but please interleave data with
the main body of the abstract if possible. Total abstract (including data and
references) should not exceed 2 pages. 
- Author name(s) should not appear on the abstract! Only in the filename. 

Please note that abstracts submitted to CLS 44 will be evaluated under a
two-tiered review system involving both external and internal reviewers. 

Deadline:

All abstracts must be submitted by 8pm CST on Friday, January 11, 2008. The
authors will be notified of acceptance decisions by mid-February 2008. 

For questions not answered in this call, please contact us at cls at uchicago
dot edu.

Meeting Description

The 37th annual meeting of the Linguistic Association of the Southwest will be
held October 17-19, 2008 at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. 

Call for Papers

Deadline for submission: June 1, 2008

Conference Theme:  ''Building Communities and Making Connections''

Abstract submissions are invited for paper presentations, poster presentations,
and panels on any research area related to language issues of special interest
in the Southwest. In addition, proposals on the conference theme are
particularly encouraged, and may include, but are not limited to:  connecting
language with non-academic areas, interdisciplinary collaborations, language
learning communities, education and language policy, and non-traditional
dissemination of language research.

In addition a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Making Connections Beyond the
Academic Community is encouraging presentations on that topic. Please indicate
in the abstract if you would like to be considered under this SIG.

Presentations are generally given in Spanish or English, although special
provisions may be made to support the use of endangered languages that have been
excluded historically from academic discourse. Presentations should be given in
the same language as the abstract.  

Paper presentations will be limited to 20 minutes followed by a 10 minute
question period.  

Poster presentations will be organized into informal poster sessions where
presenters can distribute hand-outs, explain posters, and answer questions.  

Panels should be composed of 2-4 speakers. Early submission of panel proposals
is desirable.  

Only one abstract as a single author and a second as co-author will be accepted
from any one individual.

Submissions by graduate students are welcome, and students are eligible for the
Helmut Esau Prize, a $250 cash award.

Abstract submission instructions
Electronic submissions are strongly preferred. Authors without access to email
may mail a disk copy accompanied by a paper copy to the address below.

Please include the following information:
-  Paper title
-  For all presenters: name, academic affiliation, mailing address, phone and
fax numbers, e-mail address.
-  Abstract, 250-500 words, single-spaced in 11 point Times New Roman font.  The
abstract should summarize the main points and indicate key aspects of the data,
methodology and findings.  Use of special font items should be kept to a
minimum. Omit bibliography.
-  Note A-V equipment that will be needed.

If the author(s) will not be available at the given address or e-mail during the
summer, please provide summer contact information in the cover e-mail.

All submissions should be e-mailed to LASSO2008@gmail.com as a PDF, Microsoft
Word, RTF, or text file attachment. Special font items travel best as a PDF. In
addition to sending the abstract as an attachment, please paste the text of the
abstract into the e-mail message itself.

Abstracts (disk and hard copy) may be mailed to:	

Susana Rivera-Mills
Dept. of Foreign Languages and Literatures

Acknowledgment of receipt of the abstract will be sent to the principal author.
If such notification is not received within one week, the abstract did not reach
its destination and should be resent. Notice of acceptance or rejection will be
sent by early July.

Participation in LASSO is a privilege of membership; this means that an
