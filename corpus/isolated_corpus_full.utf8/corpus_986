NAACL/HLT 2007 Workshop
Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing

http://www.textgraphs.org/ws07

Rochester, NY, April 26, 2007

Regular paper submission deadline: January 29=20
.................................................

Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of
graph theory into Natural Language Processing. In many NLP=20
applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a graph
and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent
research has shown that graph-based representations of linguistic
units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel=20
and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part
of speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and parsing to
information extraction, semantic role assignment, summarization and
sentiment analysis.=20

This workshop builds on the success of the first TextGraphs workshop
at HLT-NAACL 2006. The aim of this workshop is to bring together
researchers working on problems related to the use of graph-based =
algorithms for natural=20
language processing and on the theory of graph-based methods.
It will address a broader spectrum of research areas to foster
exchange of ideas and help to identify principles of using the graph
notions that go beyond an ad-hoc usage. Unveiling these principles will =
give rise to applying generic graph=20
methods to many new problems that can be encoded in this framework.

We invite submissions of papers on graph-based methods applied to
NLP-related problems. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Graph representations for ontology learning and word sense =
disambiguation=20
- Graph algorithms for Information Retrieval, text mining and =
understanding
- Graph matching for Information Extraction
- Random walk graph methods and Spectral graph clustering
- Graph labeling and edge labeling for semantic representations=20
- Encoding semantic distances in graphs
- Ranking algorithms based on graphs
- Small world graphs in natural language
- Semi-supervised graph-based methods
- Statistical network analysis and methods for NLP=20

Submission format:

Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages and
short papers of max. 4 pages, formatted following the NAACL 2007
guidelines. Papers should be submitted using the online submission=20
form: http://www.softconf.com/hlt/wstextgraphs/

Important dates:

Regular paper submission    January 29=20
Short paper submissions        February 4
Notification of acceptance      February 22
Camera-ready papers             March 1
