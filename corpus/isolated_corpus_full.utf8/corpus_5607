Full Title: TESL Canada Journal 


Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics;Applied Linguistics;Language Acquisition;Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2009 

Call for Submissions: Special Issue of TESL Canada Journal

Perspectives on ethics in cross-cultural, cross-linguistic research

While ethical issues have been extensively considered in medicine and
nursing (Edwards, et al, 1998; Turale, 2006), psychology and counseling
(Fisher, 2004; Stuart, 1998; West, 2002), Aboriginal studies (Davison, et
al, 2006; Ellis & Earley, 2006) and anthropology (Gottlieb, 1997), the
literature addressing ethics in applied linguistics research seems sparse.
Addressing this gap, this special issue will include articles on all
aspects research ethics pertaining to research with minority language
populations in ESL and EFL settings, and Indigenous peoples affected by the
encroachment of colonizing languages.

    We invite submissions relating to such topics as: 'giving' and
withdrawing consent in an unfamiliar language, gaining and maintaining
consent, the insider-outsider debate in TESL/SLA research, translation
across languages and cultures, ownership of data, use and abuse of research
results, our 'participant base' (which is largely middle class or
privileged), and identity concerns in cross-linguistic, cross-cultural
research.

Submissions or questions should be sent by December 31, 2009 to Dr.
Kouritzin at: kouritzi@cc.umanitoba.ca

To review author guidelines re. full-length Articles, Perspectives, and In
the Classroom categories of submission, visit the journal Website at
http://journals.sfu.ca/tesl/index.php/tesl/login and click on 'For Authors'.

Additionally, individuals interested in proposing a theme and a guest
editor (or editorial team) for subsequent Special Issues of TESL Canada
Journal are warmly encouraged to contact John Sivell (jsivell@brocku.ca) as
soon as possible; proposals for 2011 will be received until the end of
December, 2009 - or until a decision is made - with the intention of
announcing a call for submissions (2011 Special issue) in the spring of 2010.
