James Pustejovsky and Anna Rumshisky have recently published an article =

advocating an approach that uses both intuition *and* corpus data to =

develop and test linguistic theory.

Pustejovsky, J., & Rumshisky, A. (2008). Between Chaos and Structure: =

Interpreting Lexical Data Through a Theoretical Lens. Int J =

Lexicography, 21(3), 337-355. doi: 10.1093/ijl/ecn023.
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inherent tension between corpus =

data and linguistic theory that aims to model it, with particular =

reference to the dynamic and variable nature of the lexicon. We explore =

the process through which modeling of the data is accomplished, =

presenting itself as a sequence of conflicting stages of discovery. =

First-stage data analysis informs the model, whereas the seeming chaos =

of organic data inevitably violates our theoretical assumptions. But in =

the end, it is restrictions apparent in the data that call for =

postulating structure within a revised theoretical model. We show the =

complete cycle using two case studies and discuss the implications.
