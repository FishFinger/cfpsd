5th International Conference on Intelligent Environments

July 20-21, 2009

Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain
http://intelligentenvironments.org/conferences/ie09/

The 5th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE?09)
will be held at the Technical University of Catalonia, Castelldefels,
Barcelona, Spain. It is the next edition in a series of highly
successful conferences that were organized in Colchester (UK), Athens
(Greece), Ulm (Germany) and Seattle (USA) in the past four years. The
conference provides a collaborative forum for scientists, researchers
and engineers from both industry and academia to present theoretical and
practical results of Intelligent Environments research and their
application in various domains and disciplines, such as Ambient
Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Knowledge Management, Domestic
and Rehabilitation Robotic systems, Smart sensors and actuators, Space
and Architecture, Art and Design, Cultural Aspects, Social Sciences,
Legal and Ethical Aspects, Smart and Virtual Environments.

The conference program includes two invited lectures and hosts special
sessions of full papers and short papers describing PhDs and posters.
Workshops will be organized on a separate day. Information for authors
and submission guidelines and templates are available at the conference
web site. Use of the IE09 template is mandatory, and only papers
following the instructions provided will be considered for inclusion in
the proceedings, which, both for the main conference and workshops, will
be published by IOS Press under ISBN.
