Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2009

http://www.naaclhlt2009.org

May 31 =96 June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado

Deadline for full paper submission =96 Monday, December 1, 2008
Deadline for short paper submission =96 Monday, February 9, 2009

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American  =

Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human  =

Language Technology Conference (HLT) of NAACL. The conference covers a  =

broad spectrum of disciplines working towards enabling intelligent  =

systems to interact with humans using natural language, and towards  =

enhancing human-human communication through services such as speech  =

recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text  =

summarization, and information extraction. NAACL HLT 2009 will feature  =

full papers, short papers, posters, demonstrations, and a doctoral  =

consortium, as well as pre- and post-conference tutorials and workshops.

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial,  =

original, and unpublished research in disciplines that could impact  =

human language processing systems.  We encourage the submission of  =

short papers that can be characterized as a small, focused  =

contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece  =

or an interesting application note. A separate review form for short  =

papers will be introduced this year.

NAACL HLT 2009 aims to hold two special sessions, Large Scale Language  =

Processing and Speech Indexing and Retrieval.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are  =

understood to be applied to speech and/or text:

-Large scale language processing
-Speech indexing and retrieval
-Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
-Information extraction
-Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer,  human-robot  =

interaction, education and learning systems, assistive  technologies, =

digital entertainment)
-Machine translation
-Summarization
-Question answering
-Topic classification and information filtering
-Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/genre analysis)
-Topic clustering
-Text and speech mining
-Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
-Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
-Language generation
-Speech synthesis
-Speech understanding
-Speech analysis and recognition
-Multilingual processing
-Phonology
-Morphology (including word segmentation)
-Part of speech tagging
-Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
-Word sense disambiguation
-Lexical semantics
-Formal semantics and logic
-Textual entailment and paraphrasing
-Discourse and pragmatics
-Dialog systems
-Knowledge acquisition and representation
-Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
-Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons,  ontologies, =

annotated corpora)
-Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information  structure and =

sources in speech)
-Multimodal representations and processing, including speech and  gesture
