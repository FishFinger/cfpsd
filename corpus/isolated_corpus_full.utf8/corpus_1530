Meeting Description

The Role of Phonology in Reading Acquisition
Workshop at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS)

A highly controversial issue in reading research is the role of phonology in
visual word identification. Whereas some researchers argue that the decoding of
written words by means of grapheme-phoneme-correspondences is an essential
requirement for access to the mental lexicon, other researchers posit that words
which are familiar, i.e. that have been decoded before, can be associated with
their meaning directly on the basis of their stored orthographic form.
Although this controversy is important for the issue how reading is taught in
primary schools it still remains unsettled. Thus whereas the whole-word approach
in reading acquisition is based on the assumption that phonology does not play a
crucial role in reading, the now popular phonics approach relies on the teaching
of phoneme-grapheme-correspondences.
A solution of this underlying controversy is crucial for evaluating and
improving the methods applied in reading acquisition. The goal of this workshop
is to contribute to this controversy and discuss the issue which rule phonology
plays in reading acquisition. 
We will therefore discuss for example

- How reading acquisition proceeds in German speaking children,
- Which conclusions with respect to the above mentioned controversy can be drawn
from reading acquisition data of German children,
- How and to what extent German and English children differ with respect to
reading acquisition, 
- How experimental findings may help improving the teaching of reading in German
schools. 

This workshop is intended for researchers working in the areas of visual word
recognition and reading acquisition either from an experimental, theoretical or
applied perspective. Note, however, that all talks should address the importance
of their findings for German reading acquisition.

Presentations will be 20 or 40 minutes plus 10 respectively 15 minutes for
discussion depending on the number of abstracts accepted.

Meeting Description

The workshop 'Linguistic Studies of Ontology: From Lexical Semantics to Formal
Ontologies and Back' is part of the 18th International Congress of Linguists
(CIL 18).

Recent developments in the study of ontology have important implications for
cognitive science, knowledge engineering, and theoretical linguistics. In
particular, research on lexical ontology deals with how concepts are lexicalized
and organized across languages and cultures. This workshop aims to explore this
new departure in linguistic studies by building upon the three important
premises assumed in Fellbaum (1998), Schalley and Zaefferer (2007), and Huang et
al. (2007): First, that lexicalized concepts have a special status in every
language (as opposed to concepts that require complex coding), second that
lexically coded concepts can be shared by different languages, and third that
lexicalization universals are relevant for the construction of cross-lingually
portable formal ontologies. 

Final call for abstracts: Deadline May 31, 2007

Linguistic Studies of Ontology
From Lexical Semantics to Formal Ontologies and Back

Workshop at the
18th International Congress of Linguists (CIL 18)
http://cil18.org
Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea
July 21-26, 2008

Topics of this workshop include foundational issues pertaining to the relation
between formal ontology and linguistic ontologies, as well as descriptive issues
pertaining to the interface between conceptual ontologies and lexica. In
particular, we would like to focus on the following issues during this workshop:

- Cross-lingual portability of upper-ontologies
- Ontology-based approaches to comparative linguistics
- Ontology enrichment: from concept formation via complex coding to lexicalisation
- Possible relevance of formal ontological principles (e.g. Roles cannot subsume
Types) to psychological/linguistic reality
