Meeting Description:

English education has changed dramatically over the past decade, be it in 
language policy such as ELF (English as a Lingua Franca) and EIL (English as  an
International Language), in teaching purpose such as EMI (English as a Medium of
Instruction) and ESP (English for Specific Purposes), or in teaching mode such
as CMC (Computer-mediated Communication) and SALC (Self-access Language Center).
While many students, teachers and administrators are still  struggling to fully
absorb and implement those changes required by constantly evolving societies and
globalized markets and afforded by sophisticated technologies and newly forged
synergies, new developments are looming on the horizon. It is thus the purpose
of this conference to attempt a critical survey of the current state of ELT
across its subdisciplines, identify promising concepts, practices and tools, and
sketch out the road ahead that needs to be charted in order to truly prepare the
learner for challenges and opportunities that will present themselves in the
years to come.
