                             CALL FOR PAPERS
          Seventh International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference
                   PERSPECTIVES OF SYSTEM INFORMATICS
           15-19 June, 2009, Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok, Russia
                   http://psi.nsc.ru/psi09/index.shtml

[AIMS AND SCOPE]

PSI is a forum for academic and industrial researchers, developers and
users  working on topics relating to computer, software and information
sciences. The conference serves to bridge the gaps between different
communities whose research areas are covered by but not limited to
foundations of program and system development and analysis, programming
methodology and software engineering, and information technologies. The
PSI forum provides a venue for  such communities at which common problems,
methods and methodologies can be discussed and explored. In doing so, PSI
aims to support researchers in their quest to improve the reliability,
flexibility and efficiency of methods, algorithms and tools for developing
computer, software and information systems. 


The first six conferences were held in 1991, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003 and
2006, respectively, and proved to be significant international events.

The PSI 2009 Conference is dedicated to the memory of a prominent
scientist academician A.P. Ershov and to a significant date in the history
of computer science in the country, namely, to the 50th anniversary of the
Programming Department (http://pd.iis.nsk.su/, in Russian) founded by him.
Initially, the Department was a part of the Institute of Mathematics and
later, in 1964, it joined the newly established Computing Center of the
Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A.P. Ershov, who was
responsible for forming the Department, gathered a team of young graduates
from the leading Soviet universities. The first significant project of the
Department was aimed at the development of ALPHA system, an optimizing
compiler for an extension of Algol 60 implemented on a Soviet computer
M-20. Later the researchers of the Department created the Algibr, Epsilon,
Sigma, and Alpha-6 programming systems for the BESM-6 computers. The list
of their achievements also includes the first Soviet time-sharing system
AIST-0, the multi-language system BETA, research projects in artificial
intelligence and parallel programming, the integrated tools for text
processing and publishing, and many others. The scope of problems facing
the Programming Department was widening in time, its organizational
structure changed and there appeared new research directions, school
informatics and mixed computation among them. Founded in 1990, the
Institute of Informatics Systems is justly considered to be a successor of
the Programming Department keeping its main research directions and
maintaining its best traditions.

and some pictures can be found at the conference web site:
http://psi.nsc.ru/psi06/index_e.shtml

[LOCATION]

The conference will be held in Akademgorodok (Academy town), 30 km South
from Novosibirsk, the largest city of Siberia. Akademgorodok is located in
a picturesque place near the Ob lake. It is surrounded with birch and pine
forests and pleasant not only for work but for recreation as well.
Silence, beautiful landscape, and pure air are the factors promoting
scientific activity and creativity.

[TRAVELLING]

You can fly to Novosibirsk via Moscow by Aeroflot, Transaero or S7. Direct
S7 flights will bring you from Frankfurt, Hannover, Seoul or Beijing to
