       20th International Workshop on Description Logics (DL'07)
                            CALL FOR PAPERS
            Brixen-Bressanone (near Bozen-Bolzano), Italy
                            8-10 June 2007

                       http://dl.kr.org/dl2007/

The 2007 edition of the DL workshop will take place from the 8th to
the 10th of June 2007 in Brixen-Bressanone (near Bozen-Bolzano),
Italy.  This is 80 Km south of Innsbruck (where the ESWC-07 conference
will take place immediately before); direct train connections run
every hour between Innsbruck and Brixen-Bressanone.  Arrived this year
to its 20th edition, DL is the major annual event of the description
logics research community.  The workshop is thought as a gathering
forum to meet, discuss and exchange experiences among all those, both
in the academy and industry, who are interested in description logics
and in all their broad range of applications.

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline:   23 March 2007
Notification of acceptance:  27 April 2007
Camera ready papers due:     18 May 2007
DL'07 Workshop:              8-10 June 2007

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE

We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics.
Possible subjects include:

-- Foundations of description logics, including distinguishing
    features of description logics with respect to other formalisms,
    expressive power of description logics, decidability and
    complexity of reasoning, and novel inference problems and
    reasoning techniques for solving these problems.

-- Extensions of description logics, including, but not limited to,
    closed world reasoning, defaults, epistemic reasoning, temporal
    and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, and query languages.

-- Integration of description logics with other formalisms, such as
    object-oriented representation languages, database query
    languages, constraint-based programming, logic programming, and
    rule-based systems.

-- Use of description logics in applications or areas such as natural
    language, planning, learning, databases, document management,
    semistructured data, ontology design, ontology languages, ontology
    engineering, semantic web, and grid computing.

-- Building systems based on description logics, with special emphasis
    on optimization and implementation techniques.

-- Tools that exploit description Logic reasoning, such as ontology
    editors, database schema design, query optimization, and data
    integration tools.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

We invite submissions of technical papers as extended abstracts of 8
pages, and submissions of statements of interest of 2 pages.  The
technical papers will be judged according to their scientific quality,
while the statements of interest will be judged according to their
scientific relevance.  Accepted papers will be included in the
workshop proceedings as extended abstract (8 pages), regular papers
(12 pages), or as statements of interest (2 pages). The workshop
proceedings will be distributed in paper form at the workshop, and
will be made available electronically in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings
series.  Papers should follow the formatting and submission guidelines
to be found at the workshop submissions web page, and should arrive by
the paper submission deadline stated above.

VENUE

The workshop will take place in the charming town of Brixen-
Bressanone, near Bozen-Bolzano in South Tyrol at the heart of the
Dolomites - the pink mountains of the Alps.  Like Bozen-Bolzano,
Brixen-Bressanone has always been a crossroads of various cultures and
it is distinguished by its mediaeval Gothic architecture.  The
mediaeval alleys and the wealth of historical references are an ideal
starting point for excursions into the countryside and for practising
a whole variety of sports and leisure activities.  Leaving directly
from the town centre delegates can set off on their bikes or on foot
for excursions into the surrounding hills and mountains.
Brixen-Bressanone is on the main arterial road between Austria/Germany
and Italy and it is easily accessible from everywhere by train, car,
bus or plane.
