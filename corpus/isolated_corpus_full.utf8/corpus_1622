Second Announcement and Call for Papers

Workshop on NLP for Educational Resources

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
September 26, 2007
Borovetz, Bulgaria

The submission system is available at the Workshop site
http://ixa.si.ehu.es/NLP_ER2007

RANLP 2007 site
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

In this workshop we will discuss how using NLP techniques in the automatic
treatment of texts can support pedagogic goals. There are well over 100
documented projects at the use of NLP in Intelligent Computer-Assisted  Language
Learning (ICALL) (Heift & Schulze,2007); however, there are  significantly fewer
publications about the use of NLP techniques in educational areas other than
language learning.
This workshop will bring together NLP and ICALL researchers with colleagues
who are investigating NLP treatment for other educational purposes. Our main 
aim is to discuss how we can use NLP in the automatic treatment of corpora for 
pedagogical purposes as well as in the analysis of learner corpora (students 
free responses).
The contributions of this workshop will share at least two keywords: NLP and
Education. We especially seek contributions about the adaptation and integration
of NLP techniques in the following areas:

- Automatic exercise and task generation
- Controlled language
- Error diagnosis and remediation
- Essay assessment
- Fostering language awareness
- Automatic generation of didactic resources
- Analysis of learners? interlanguage
- NLP for processing texts in ICALL environments
- Learner corpora
- Learning of textual analysis (in linguistics, literature, anthropology, ?)
- Student modelling
- Text production tools (e.g. grammar and spell checkers)
- Translator training

Full Title: Computational Lexicography

Contact Person: Alexander Onysko
Meeting Email: alexander.onysko@uibk.ac.at

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Lexicography 

Call Deadline: 10-Jul-2007 

Meeting Description:
Workshop - Computational Lexicography / Computergestützte Lexikographie 

The constant rise in the popularity and the use of electronic dictionaries (on
CD-Rom and particularly on the Internet) underlines the growing importance of
these reference tools. The general shift to electronic dictionaries challenges
modern lexicography particularly in the following areas:
-Conception of dictionaries as databases
-Issues of (automatic) entry compilation
-Digitization of print dictionaries (e.g. English Dialect Dictionary,
http://www.uibk.ac.at/anglistik/projects/speed/index.html)
-Design and functionality of electronic dictionaries
-Multi-parametric searches as the basis of fast and precise retrieval of complex
information
-Electronic dictionaries as interactive tools (maps, hyperlinking, integration
of audio and video files)
-Encoding of and access to phonetic transcriptions
-From dictionary to wictionary

As part of the 35th Austrian Linguistics Conference, the workshop aims to
provide a forum for researchers, lexicographers, and software developers to
present and discuss their work on any of the aspects above and on further issues
related to computational lexicography.

We invite to submit abstracts (for 20 min presentation + 10 min discussion) of a
maximum of 500 words (excluding references) as a Word or Pdf file to
alexander.onysko@uibk.ac.at. To facilitate the review process, include the title
of the paper, name of the author(s), and contact information in the body of the
e-mail. The abstract should remain anonymous.

Deadline of submission: July 10, 2007

Notification of acceptance: July 25, 2007
