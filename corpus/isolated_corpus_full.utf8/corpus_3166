*****Call for Workshop Proposals***** 

************************************** 
Future Internet Symposium 
FIS 2008 

28th-30th September | Vienna, Austria 
http://www.fis2008.org/ 

************************************** 
The workshops at FIS008 will complement the main conference by providing a
forum for active discussions and exchange of ideas focused on one or two
cross-domain issues related to the Future Internet. The purpose of the
workshops will be to provide an informal setting for attendees, potentially
affiliated to different Internet disciplines to discuss scientific and
technical issues, share experiences, and to lay the foundations for the
establishment of the cross-domain research community which will shape the
Future Internet research agenda. From a content perspective workshop
proposals should comply with the agenda of the main conference and
concentrate on topics which are likely to benefit from interactions and
information exchange within a focused group of experts from different areas
and communities. We expect to have a wide range of workshops (full-day, or
half-day) covering fundamental research questions for the realization of the
next generation of the Internet, bringing together researchers from
different disciplines. 

Proposal Guidelines 

Workshop proposals are due to June, 15. Proposals should be no more than 3
pages in length, and contain the following information: 
- The title and brief technical description of the workshop, including the
goals, the scientific and technical issues addressed and the motivation
underlying why the topic is of particular interest for the Future Internet
community. 
- A brief description of the proposed workshop format and intended audience 
- A list of related workshops or similar events held in the last 3 years if
applicable 
- The names, contact information and short bio of the workshop organizers 

Workshop proposal should be submitted in PDF format by email to
elena.simperl@sti2.at 

Workshop organization 

Upon acceptance the organizers will be responsible for the following: 
- Producing a "Call for Papers/Participation" for their workshop. The call
should mention that at least one author of each accepted submissions must
attend the workshop and that all workshop participants must pay the workshop
registration fee. Additionally, the call should elaborate on the submission
procedures and on the publication of the workshop proceedings. 
- Producing a Web page for the workshop and submitting the URL for the Web
page to the workshop chair no later than June, 27. 
- Publicizing the workshop, distributing the call to relevant newsgroups,
mailing lists, targeting the relevant interdisciplinary audience. 

The FIS2008 Organizing Committee will support the workshop organizers by: 
- Providing publicity for the workshop series as a whole on the conference's
Web page and through additional dissemination channels 
- Providing logistics facilities for the workshop at the conference venue
including copies of the workshop proceedings.
