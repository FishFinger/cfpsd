and systems for multimodal communication;  and semantic annotation of natural
language and multimodal utterances.

-construction of representations of meaning in natural language;
-methodologies and practices for semantic annotation;
-modeling and using context in semantic interpretation;
-machine learning of semantic structures;

-computing meaning in multimodal interaction;
-construction and use of underspecified semantic representations ;
-semantic concepts and ontologies;
-approaches to textual entailment;
-the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts;
-the semantic web and natural language processing;
-semantic aspects of language generation;
-the semantics-pragmatics interface in computational perspective;
-semantic relations in discourse and dialogue;
-shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning.

ISO/SIGSEM Joint Working Group Meeting:

Immediately preceding IWCS-7, on 8-9 January 2007, a joint meeting will be held
of the ISO TC 37/SC 4 Thematic Domain Group on Semantic Content, and the ACL
SIGSEM Working Group on the Representation of Multimodal Semantic Information.
This meeting will be open to (a limited number of) IWCS-7 participants. For more
information, see http://let.uvt.nl/research/ti/iso-tdg3 and

Submission Requirements:

Three types of submission are solicited: full papers, short papers,
and project abstracts.

Full Papers:

Full papers are original papers of maximally 12 pages, that will be published in
the workshop proceedings and will have a full oral presentation of about 30
minutes at the workshop.

Short Papers:

Short papers are mini-papers of maximally 4 pages, that will be published in the
workshop proceedings and have a very brief ('flash') oral presentation at the
workshop. Authors of short papers are invited to also put up a poster and
participate in a poster session.

Project Abstracts:

Project abstracts are brief descriptions of 2 pages of ongoing, recently
completed, or starting projects. They will be published in the workshop
proceedings and will be presented in a poster session.

Submission Formats:

Submissions of all three types should be in postscript or .pdf format and
prepared with LaTeX; see the IWCS-7 website
http://let.uvt.nl/research/ti/sigsem/iwcs/iwcs7 for more information on the
style files to be used. The page limits presuppose standard 11 point Computer
Modern font. Final versions of accepted contributions will have to be submitted
as LaTeX source files to facilitate publication of the proceedings; we also aim
at publishing a selection of accepted papers in book form after the workshop.

Email your postscript or pdf file to: computational.semantics@uvt.nl

Submission Deadlines:

For full papers the submission deadline is 25 September 2006; for short papers
and project abstracts the deadline is 1 November.

Subject: Disfluency in Spontaneous Speech International Workshop 

	

Full Title: Disfluency in Spontaneous Speech International Workshop 
Short Title: DiSS'07 

Date: 02-Aug-2007 - 04-Aug-2007
Location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Corey McMillan
Meeting Email: papers@disfluency.org
Web Site: http://www.disfluency.org 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

DiSS'07 is the 5th in the series of successful interdisciplinary workshops on 
disfluency in spontaneous speech.  The next workshop will be held in Edinburgh,
Scotland from 2-4 August, 2007. 

Disfluencies - errors, self-repairs and hesitations in speech -  present
challenges for researchers in many different fields, including phonetics,
perception and production in psycholinguistics, discourse analysis,
computational linguistics and automatic speech recognition.

This workshop allows researchers from diverse backgrounds to present their 
research findings, discuss common interests, identify future directions and 
establish new collaborations.

We invite submission of 4 page papers for review by March 8 2007. Suitable 
topics include but are not limited to:

-Descriptive studies of error, self-repair and hesitation;
-Cognitive models of error, self-monitoring and self-repair;
-Experimental work on perception, comprehension, and production of speech with
disfluencies;
-Computational approaches to processing disfluent speech;
-Automatic speech recognition with spontaneous speech;
-Theoretical approaches to disfluency in speech and communication disorders.

Preferred format for submission and workshop details will be available on the 
DiSS'07 website shortly: http://www.disfluency.org.
