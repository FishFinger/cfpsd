Call for Papers

for

Indian Journal of Applied Linguistics (IJOAL)
(vol. 34, nos. 1-2, Jan-Dec 2008)

Special Number on: 
Recent trends in Neurolinguistics, Psycholinguistics & Language Cognition:
Methodologies and Innovations

Current researches in Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics from both
theoretical and experimental perspectives are diverse as a result of more
new techniques of investigations and shifts in paradigms. The research on
language processing/representation/acquisition in the brain in both normal
and disordered populations in different language or cultural backgrounds is
an active field of inquiry currently. Keeping this in perspective, Indian
Journal of Applied Linguistics (IJOAL) wishes to bring out a volume of
papers addressing these issues and solicits submissions from authors around
the world, working with different approaches and theoretical constraints.
However, because of the vastness of the field and the diversity of
participating disciplines exploring language and brain relationships
(examples: Psycholingusitics, Neurolinguistics, Psychology, Neuroscience
etc), it is decided to have representative submissions from all these
fields. Submissions of both empirical and theoretical papers are solicited
on the following broad areas but certainly not limited to. Submissions
should not be purely on linguistic issues alone but demonstrate
applications of theoretical models. But one important criterion is that
papers should be clearly addressing a specific issue that will broadly fall
under one of these areas of the volume's interest.

-Psycholinguistics
Language acquisition, reading processes, dyslexia, production,
comprehension, speech perception, production, etc

-Neurolinguistics
Studies on aphasia, language functioning in patients with Alzheimer's
Parkinson Cross linguistic studies, new methodological issues, cognitive
aspects of language processing 

-Neuroscience [Cognitive and Computational]
Vision and language, memory and language, biological models of cognition,
computational issues in literacy acquisition, knowledge representation, etc

-- The papers pertaining to the areas mentioned above should be written in
English, and be submitted in MS-Word format to the Guest Editor/Editors at
their contact address given below not later than 1st September 2007.

-- Papers should not exceed 10,000 words and should be preceded by an
abstract of 250-350 words. The title, the name(s) and full mailing
address(es) of the author(s), including e-mail addresses, should appear on
the first page of the manuscript. 

-- All papers submitted to IJOAL should be original, neither having been
previously published nor being considered elsewhere at the time of
submission.   

-- The editors will select contributions for the special issue and notify
authors of acceptance or otherwise once reports are received from the
reviewers.
