Following agreement with funding organisations in Austria, Croatia, Cyprus,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Luxemburg,
the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and the US, the European
Science Foundation (ESF) is launching a Call for Outline Proposals for
Collaborative Research Projects (CRPs) to be undertaken within the EUROCORES
Programme EuroBABEL: Better Analyses Based on Endangered Languages.  
 
The main purpose of the EuroBABEL programme is to promote empirical research on
underdescribed endangered languages, both spoken and signed, that aims at
changing and refining our ideas about linguistic structure in general and about
language in relation to cognition, social and cultural organization and related
issues in a trans-/multi-disciplinary perspective. 
 
The programme aims to support high quality multidisciplinary research and is
expected to run for 3-4 years; it includes national research funding as well as
support for networking and dissemination activities managed by the ESF. 

The DEADLINE for online submission of EuroBABEL Outline Proposals is TUESDAY, 20
MAY 2008, 12:00 PM (noon-CET). It is expected that Full Proposals will be
invited by 30 June 2008 with Tuesday 16 September 2008, 12:00 PM as expected
deadline for submission.
 
For complete information, including eligibility requirements, submission
guidelines, and more, visit the website at:

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
