Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

This workshop is part of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS 2010) at the Humboldt University, Berlin, from 23-26 February, 2010. 

Participation, interactivity, social networks, fusion of communication services and contents: These and other keywords used in context with 'Web 2.0' characterize technological advancements, which might have a deep impact on the lingual-communicative aspects related to information processing, self-portrayal and forming of communities. The aim of this workshop is a critical analysis of tendencies that are generally subsumed under the term 'Web 2.0' from the perspective of linguistics, media studies and communication studies. 

The workshop will be held in German and English. 

Call for Papers:

The focus lies on the following aspects:

Connecting Ways of Communication:

Connecting several communication channels within one platform is one of the key characteristics of Web 2.0: What has previously existed separately - Website, message board, chat, guestbook - is now growing together and used in combination. The formation of such digital nets of diverse written contents is often accompanied by a fusion of professional and user generated contents. This trend meets a growing research interest for intertextuality, hybridisation and the development of particular stylistic repertoires in environments of Web 2.0. Additionally it raises the question, whether and how stylistic conventions are formed and maintained in a form of public communication, which is nearly beyond institutional control.
 
Connecting Modalities:

The possibility to combine different sign systems has always been a strength of web in general, but this potential is multiplied by Web 2.0. Text and picture, typography and layout have always been aspects of web analysis - but now this bundle of different codes is enriched by audio streaming and embedded video; their availability and operation becomes simpler. What implications does this increasing multi-modality have on production and reception of text-based information? Which interactions between text, picture, video and other codes are currently characteristic for the different fields of activity, and which new possibilities are provided by video platforms with regard to visual communication?
 

Connecting Individuals:

Community is another important keyword in the popular discussion of Web 2.0. Evidently community-forming in the internet is not a new, Web 2.0-created ability, but has already been detected in text-based environments. It poses the question, whether and how the growing opportunities of linking and multi-modality in Web 2.0 affect tendencies of forming communities, and in what way such communities in Web 2.0-environments are structured qualitatively different in comparison to those formed on more simple platforms. 

We welcome submissions which show the state of the art in the fields discussed above, and those which present empirical studies and their consequences for methodology and theory-forming.

Interested?

If you are interested in giving a presentation at the workshop, please submit your abstract online until November 30th, 2009.
