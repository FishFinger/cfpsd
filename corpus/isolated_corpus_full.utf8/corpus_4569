The main objectives of the Sarajevo Linguistic Gatherings are:
- Advancement of generative linguistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- Development of a cooperative academic/research network between Bosnian and
other linguists, especially in areas of common interests.

(south) Slavic languages, especially Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian.
