Meeting Description:

Using Corpora for NLG: Language Generation and Machine Translation UCNLG+MT is a
pre-conference workshop at MT Summit XI, to be held in
Copenhagen on 11 September 2007. Continuing from UCNLG'05, the workshop's
general focus is data-based methods for language generation and their
evaluation. This year the special theme is Language Generation and Machine
Translation with which we aim to explore crossover points and potential for
cross-fertilisation between MT and NLG. 

UCNLG+MT - First Call for Papers

There are many branches of NLP research where language is generated
(MT, summarisation, human-computer dialogue, data-to-text generation,
document authoring, etc.). However, for the most part, these form
separate research communities and the field called ''Natural Language
Generation (NLG)'' is to some degree isolated from many of them.

The UCNLG workshops have the general aims

1. to provide a forum for reporting and discussing data-based
   methods for generating language in all areas of application;
2. to open up the NLG research field to neighbouring areas in NLP
   and to foster cross-fertilisation between these research fields;
   and
3. to promote the sharing of data in NLG and the use of data-based
   methods of evaluation.

The special theme of this second UCNLG workshop is Language Generation
and MT. Target language generation is typically given less attention than other
aspects of MT, such as evaluation, source language analysis and transfer.
Recently there has been increasing interest in combining linguistic knowledge
with statistical MT. Conversely, NLG -- where symbolic approaches have long
dominated -- has seen increasing interest in probabilistic methods. With this
special theme, we would like to explore crossover points and potential for
cross-fertilisation between MT and NLG.

The workshop also continues from UCNLG'05 in its general focus on data-based
methods for language generation and their evaluation.
We invite submissions on all aspects of using corpora in the generation of
language. Specific topics include, but are not limited

- Using NLG techniques in MT
- Combining statistical MT with rule-based techniques such as those
  developed in NLG
- Introducing linguistic filters into statistical MT
- Issues in annotating corpora for language generation
- Statistical approaches to deep and/or surface generation
- Machine learning methods for deep and/or surface generation
- Uses of corpora in the evaluation of automatically generated language
- Reuse of corpus resources developed for NLU (e.g. treebanks) in
  language generation
- Domain-specific vs. general-purpose corpora for language generation

Invited Speaker:

Kevin Knight, ISI, University of Southern California, US.


Panel on Language Generation and MT:

We will hold a panel discussion on the special theme of the workshop.
Panel members T.B.A.


Proceedings:

The proceedings of the workshop will be published by the MT Summit XI
conference organisers, in a companion volume to the main conference
proceedings.


Requirements:

Papers should describe original and unpublished work, emphasizing
actual rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the
state of completion of the reported results.  Wherever appropriate,
concrete evaluation results should be included.  Papers that are being
submitted to other conferences or workshops should indicate this.


Submission information:

Submissions should be no longer than 8 (eight) pages, should follow
the MT Summit XI style guidelines, and should be sent in PDF format by
email to ucnlg@itri.brighton.ac.uk no later than 8 June 2007.  RTF
format is also accepted but not encouraged.

Reviewing of papers will be blind.  Reviewing will be managed by the
international workshop programme committee.  Final decisions on the
technical programme will be made by the workshop organisers.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations.  Self-references that reveal the authors'
identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...''.

In the body of the email submitting the paper, please include
the authors' names and affiliations, and the paper title.


Important Dates:

08 June           Submission deadline for workshop papers
29 June           Notification of acceptance to authors of workshop
                        papers
20 July             Camera-ready copy from all authors

International Colloquium on Ibero-Romance Historical Corpora (CODILEI)
Palma de Mallorca (SPAIN), October 25-27 2007

Call for Papers
This colloquium, organized by the Old Spanish Biblical Corpus research group at
the University of the Balearic Islands (Palma de Mallorca, Spain) is a venue for
specialists on the design and use of language corpora applied to the historical
study of the Ibero-Romance languages. 

We invite papers (20 minutes + 10 minutes for discussion) on any topic related
to corpus linguistics applied to the historical study of Ibero-Romance
languages. We especially encourage the participation of researchers in charge of
current corpus projects. Paper abstracts of 300 words maximum should be
submitted using the application which is in the colloquium's website (soon
available at http://www.bibliamedieval.es). Abstracts can be written in any
Ibero-Romance language or English, and will be evaluated by the members of the
scientific committee. The deadline for the submission of abstracts is May 30th 2007.

This meeting also aims at promoting the coordination of the different corpus
initiatives within the realm of Ibero-Romance historical linguistics. Time will
be devoted to discussing a number of issues related to the methodology of
corpus-based historical linguistics in the area of Ibero-Romance languages:
composition of the corpora, transcription guidelines, text preparation,
possibility of access to facsimile images, philological information that should
accompany texts (date, geographic origin, etc.), mark-up languages,
lemmatization, grammatical labels, etc.
