From: Markus Steinbach < steinbac@uni-mainz.de >
Subject: International Conference on Quotation and Meaning 
 

Full Title: International Conference on Quotation and Meaning 
Short Title: ICQM 

Date: 19-Oct-2007 - 21-Oct-2007
Location: Johannes Gutenberg - University Mainz, Germany 
Contact Person: Markus Steinbach

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

Quotation is a sort of metarepresentation that is found in all natural
languages. Linguistic research has made clear that in quotation, there are
complex syntactic, morphological and graphematic mechanisms at work. In
philosophy of language, there are long-standing debates on quotation and
paradoxes, on the use-mention distinction, and the meaning of quotation
marks and quotation expressions. More recently, quotation has become a
topic within the debate on the semantics/pragmatics distinction. Since the
aim of the conference is to bring together philosophers and linguists, we
call for high-quality papers on all aspects of the conference topic, which
will be anonymously reviewed by a reading committee. 

Submissions: Contributions to the above mentioned subjects are welcome.
Authors should submit a paper of at most 500 words, 12 font size, in PDF
format (for talks with a duration of 30' plus 10' discussion) via e-mail to
steinbac@uni-mainz.de

Invited Speakers:

Bart Geurts (Radboud University Nijmegen) 
Christopher Potts (University of Massachusetts, Amherst)
Paul Saka (University of Houston, Texas)

Local Organisation: 

Elke Brendel, JÃ¶rg Meibauer, Markus Steinbach (Johannes Gutenberg -
University Mainz)

Important Dates:

Submissions due: June 15th, 2007
Notification: July 1st, 2007
