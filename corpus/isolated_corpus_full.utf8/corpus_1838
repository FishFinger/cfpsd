Title: Monolingualism

Special issue Editor: Dr Elizabeth Ellis

Background

It is widely accepted by linguists that bilingualism and multilingualism
are more common worldwide than monolingualism. However research has
concentrated on the former two; the implication being that monolingualism
is the norm, and that bi/multilingualism constitute aberrant states. In
contrast, there is little systematic investigation of monolingualism, and,
as Romaine (1995) points out, it would be strange to find a book with the
title 'Monolingualism'. The planned monograph will carry such a title, and
the papers it seeks to include will explore the phenomenon of
monolingualism from a number of different perspectives. These perspectives
might include language ideology, language choice in education, language
policy and planning, language awareness, second and third language teaching
and others from applied linguistics and sociolinguistics.

Papers are sought which might address, but need not be limited to, the
following questions:

-How can monolingualism be defined? Can it be considered a continuum in the
same way as bilingualism? 

-What is a 'monolingual mindset'?

-How can we move beyond assertion to conduct research on the effects of a
monolingual mindset on individuals, families, communities and public policy?

-What is the impact of monolingualism on social and educational policy in
selected sites? What can be done to increase public awareness of the
effects of monolingual perspectives?

-What interdisciplinary perspectives are necessary to investigate
monolingualism, if, like bilingualism, we see it as social and cognitive as
well as linguistic?

-How can we investigate and critique monolingualism as a phenomenon while
avoiding vilifying individual monolinguals?

-How can linguists work as activists to resist monolingual discourses?

Papers which report empirical research studies focussing on monolingualism
are especially welcome.
