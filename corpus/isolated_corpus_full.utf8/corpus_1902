Meeting Description:

Conference on game theoretic pragmatics: the role of preferences and decision
making in language use. 

Second and Final Call for Papers

Games and Decisions in Pragmatics III
November 23rd-24th, 2007 
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

URL: http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/conferences/CfP-GDP-III.pdf

Recent years witnessed an increased interest in formal pragmatics and especially
the establishment of game theory as a new research methodology for the study of
language use. Game and Decision Theory (GDT) are natural candidates if we look
for a theoretical foundation of linguistic pragmatics. Over the last decade, a
firm research community has emerged with a strong interdisciplinary character,
where economists, philosophers, and social scientists meet with linguists.
Within this field of research, three major currents can be distinguished: one is
closely related to the Gricean paradigm and aims at a precise foundation of
pragmatic reasoning, the second originates in the economic literature and is
concerned with the role of game theory in the context of language use, and the
third aims at language evolution seen either from a biological or from a
cultural perspective. 

It is the aim of this conference to provide a forum for research on game
theoretic pragmatics. Pragmatics is understood in a wide sense, including not
only classical topics like Gricean pragmatics, speech act theory, rhetoric, and
socio-linguistics, but also e.g. investigations into the role of rational
behaviour in language change. We invite talks that further our theoretical
understanding of the role of preferences and decision making in language use, as
well as empirical investigations into the validity of theoretical models. 

Invited Speakers:
Patrick Grim, St. Andrews
Arthur Merin, Konstanz
Brian Skyrms, Irvine

Submissions:

submitted electronically (pdf, ps or doc format) to: gdpIII@zas.gwz-berlin.de

University Press.
