-	Call for Papers  -
Language and Gender

Submission deadline January 10, 2009

Sargasso, a Journal of Caribbean Literature, Language, and Culture is
accepting submissions for an upcoming issue with the preliminary title
'Language and Gender.' Research on Caribbean languages (especially Creoles)
in fields of inquiry such as sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics,
linguistic ethnography, and historical linguistics is welcome, as is work
that is interdisciplinary in nature.  

While recent work on Caribbean languages explores a variety of integrative
and sophisticated sociolinguistic themes, researchers working within the
field of Creole Studies have given minimal attention to language and
gender. In contrast, a vibrant stream of publications on language and
gender that is generally focused on non-Caribbean settings (e.g., Freed
2005, Holmes and Meyerhoff 2005, Cameron and Kulick 2006, Maybin et al.
2008) reflects renewed and notably widespread interest in social
categories, identities, and their links to sociolinguistic, grammatical,
and ideological phenomena. This issue of Sargasso seeks to encourage
conversation between these two areas of inquiry. It aims to explore the
insights that the analysis of gender has for deepening understandings of
phenomena such as language change, linguistic variation, meaning-making,
and shifting interpretations of 'Creole' and 'Caribbean culture.' Work
that questions or otherwise avoids male-female difference as a starting
point and / or explanation for understanding linguistic behavior is
strongly encouraged.

Themes that might be addressed include, but are not limited to:

- 'Third-wave' approaches to meaning-making
- Language, discourse, & power
- Language ideologies
- Language, gender, & socialization practices
- Language, race, and symbolic violence 
- Sociohistorical ethnography
- Demographics & language change
- Sexism, feminism, & 'the interaction factor'
- Performances of masculinity 
- Transgenderism & sexual identities
- Women in linguistics
- 'Acts of Identity'
- 'Applied creolistics' / 'Postcolonial Creolistics'

Essays should be 10-20 pages and double-spaced.  Abstracts of 120 words or
less should accompany essays.  B & W photos, illustrations, and other
graphics can be included.  Book reviews and review essays of recent
scholarship on the Caribbean are also welcome.  They should be
approximately 1,000 and 2,000 words in length, respectively.
