#####################################################################

2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI-09)

September 15-18, 2009, University of Milano - Bicocca, Milano, Italy

http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it

Sponsored By
IEEE Computer Society
Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC)
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

##################################################################
# (Papers Due: *** 10 April 2009 ***
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# by the IEEE Computer Society Press, which are indexed by EI.
##################################################################

WI 2009 will provide a leading international forum of scientific
research and development to explore the fundamental interactions
between AI-engineering and Advanced Information Technology 
(e.g., wireless networks, ubiquitous devices, social networks, and
data/knowledge grids), and their role on the next generation of
Web-empowered products, Web systems and services.  AI-engineering
refers to a new area, slightly beyond tradional AI, which encompasses:
brain informatics, human level AI, intelligent agents, social network
intelligence, knowledge engineering, representation, planning, data
mining and discovery.

WI 2009 will be jointly held with the 2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT-09).  The two
conferences will have a joint opening, keynote, reception, and
banquet. Attendees only need to register for one conference and can
attend workshops, sessions, tutorials, panels, exhibits and
demonstrations across the two conferences. We are also planning a
joint panel, joint paper sessions, and a doctoral mentoring program to
discuss common problems in the two areas.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On-Line Submissions and Publication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

High-quality papers in all WI related areas are solicited. 
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 8 pages in the
IEEE 2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the
Author Guidelines of last year at
http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/AuthorKit.asp?Community=CPS&Facility=CPS_Dec&ERoom=WI%2DIAT+2008).  
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee 
on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity. 

Note that WI'09 will accept ONLY on-line submissions, containing 
PDF versions. Please use the Submission Form on the WI'09
website to submit your paper. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that are
indexed by EI.

Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 8 pages in the
proceedings and accorded oral presentation in the main conference. 
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4
pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.

All co-authors will be notified for the submission,
notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper
to the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted,
at least one author should attend the conference to present the
paper. The acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published
on-line. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a notification. 

A selected number of WI'09 accepted papers will be expanded
and revised for inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems: 
An International Journal (http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and in
Annual Review of Intelligent Informatics
(http://www.wi-consortium.org/annual.html).

The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application
paper. Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the
best application paper award. 

More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form will be
found on the WI'09 homepage: 
http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/WI09/WIhome.htm

++++++++++
Workshops
++++++++++

As an important part of the conference, the workshop program will
focus on new research challenges and initiatives.  All papers accepted
for workshops will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published
by the IEEE Computer Society Press that are indexed by EI, and will be
available at the workshops. Detailed information is available at the
conference homepage.

Note: we will not have a separate workshop registration fee
(i.e., conference registration covers everything).

++++++++++
Tutorials
++++++++++

WI'09 also welcomes Tutorial proposals. WI'09 will include tutorials
providing in-depth background on subjects that are of broad interest
to the Web intelligence community. Both short (2 hours) and long (half
day) tutorials will be considered. The tutorials will be part of the
main conference technical program. Detailed information is available
at the conference homepage.

Note: we will not have a separate tutorials registration fee
(i.e., only one conference registration covers everything).

++++++++++++++++++++
Industry/Demo-Track
++++++++++++++++++++

We solicit Industry/Demo-Track papers by the following methods.

(1) Industry papers of 4 pages can be submitted on the same schedule as
    the research track.
(2) Separate 2 page demo proposals can submitted at a later schedule.
(3) Full regular paper submissions can include a demo option.
    That is, a full paper submissions will be asked to
    specify if they would like to give a demonstration; choice of
    demonstrations (while utilizing information from the regular reviewing
    process) will be selected based on value as a demonstration.

For options (1) and (2), more detailed instructions will be found at
the homepage: http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/WI09/WIhome.htm
