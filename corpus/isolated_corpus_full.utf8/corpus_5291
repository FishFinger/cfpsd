Notes on the Submission of Manuscripts

1.	Journal of Taiwanese Vernacular is a professional journal dedicated to
the study of Taigi or the Taiwanese language. The journal encourages two
types of submissions. First, research related to Taigi on any aspects, such
as linguistics, literature, and culture. Second, comparative works between
Taigi and other languages. Works on languages other than Taigi are also
welcome if they are helpful to the study or revival of Taigi.

2.	The journal accepts research article and book reviews. Research articles
are normally less than 10,000 words in English or 20,000 syllables in
Taiwanese. Reviews are less than 3,000 words.

3.	Manuscript style:
    A) 	Manuscripts written in Taiwanese or English are preferred. The
author may provide an extra abstract in his/her mother tongue for
publication. The author must be responsible for equivalent translation of
the abstract.
    B)	        Manuscripts written in Taiwanese must be either in Han-Roman
hybrid or Roman-only styles. Roman scripts must be either Tai-lo Phin-im
promulgated by Taiwan's Ministry of Education or Peh-oe-ji, the traditional
colloquial writing. Please use Taigi Unicode fonts for the Taiwanese Roman
scripts.
    C) 	Footnote is regarded as a note for extra information, and must be
arranged in the bottom of each relevant page. References therefore should
be arranged in the end of full text.
    D)	        The potential authors should refer to the journal's sample
style for references. For those details not provided in the sample, please
follow the journal Language. 
    E)	        Manuscripts normally include a) paper title, b) abstract in
Taiwanese, c) abstract in English, d) full text, e) references, and f)
appendix (if applicable). Abstract should be provided up to five words. 

4.	Submission and review procedures:
     A)	Manuscripts may be submitted by email. If so, please provide both
Word and PDF files with appropriate fonts. An extra hardcopy is requested
if the manuscript contains special fonts.
     B)	All manuscripts submitted will be subject to double-blind peer
review. For this purpose, please do not identify yourself in the
manuscript. On a separate sheet, please provide the following information:
a) Paper title, b) full name of the author(s), c) affiliation and position,
d) contact methods. The submitted copy of manuscripts will not be returned
in any cases, so please keep your own copy.
     C)	Only unpublished manuscripts will be considered for publication.
Please submit your manuscripts at lease four months prior to proposed issue
for publication.

5.	Copyright and honorarium:
     A)	After a manuscript has been published, its author will receive 5
copies of the journal volume in which the article appears without charge.
     B)	It is the responsibility of the author to obtain written permission
for quotations from other publications or materials, which they do not own
the copyright.
