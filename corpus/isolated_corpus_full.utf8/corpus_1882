Meeting Description:

The 36th annual meeting of the North American Conference on Afroasiatic
Linguistics (NACAL 36) will be held in Chicago, IL, USA from March 14-16, 2008
(Friday-Sunday). 

Papers are solicited for the 36th annual meeting of the North American
Conference on Afroasiatic Linguistics (NACAL 36), which will be held in Chicago,
IL, USA from March 14-16, 2008 (Friday-Sunday).

Papers on linguistic topics relevant to the languages of the Afroasiatic phylum
(Chadic, Berber, Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic) are requested. Topics
relating to all aspects of Afroasiatic languages will be considered,
particularly including phonology, morphology, syntax, comparative linguistics,
sociolinguistics, and epigraphy. These topics should be considered as general
guidelines and are not intended to be exclusive. No original paper will be
rejected on account of its subject, as long as it relates to the languages of
the Afroasiatic phylum and meets the scholarly standards established by previous
conferences.

In addition to the general sessions, there will be a special panel on
Comparative Afrasian, dedicated to Alan S. Kaye. Participants who wish to
contribute to this panel should indicate their preference when submitting the
abstract or contact Lionel Bender (eswg@siu.edu). 

Abstracts describing the precise topic treated with a length of approximately
200-300 words can be sent as an electronic version (pdf or word document) or as
a paper copy to the addresses specified on the registration page on the website
(www.nacal.org). The deadline for submission is December 1st, 2007.
