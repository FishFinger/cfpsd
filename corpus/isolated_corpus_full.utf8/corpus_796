Meeting Description:

Precedence Relationships in Phonological Grammar

The CUNY Phonology Forum presents a conference focused on 
investigating all aspects of precedence (temporal or sequential) relationships 
in phonology. The conference will bring together subdivisions of cognitive 
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, 
philosophy, psychology, etc. to create a broad survey of the issues, 
successes and approaches in understanding the nature of precedence in 
phonology. (We use the terms 'precedence,' 'temporal' and 'sequential' 
interchangeably below to keep the area of interest broad.)

Invited Speakers: (This is a preliminary list)
-Justin Fitzpatrick, University of London  University of London (Title to be 
announced)  
-Elizabeth Hume, Ohio State University The interaction of phonetic and 
frequency factors in metathesis and other phonological processes.
-William Idsardi, University of Maryland
-Charles Reiss, Concordia University-Adjacency as a long-distance relation
-Andrew Nevins, Harvard, The Precedence Model Meets Performance Data

November 10, 2006: deadline for submission of abstracts
December 1, 2006: notification of acceptance
January 25/26, 2007: Precedence relationships in phonological grammar

The CUNY Phonology Forum invites 20 minute papers on any aspect of 
precedence (temporal or sequential) relationships in phonology for a 
conference to be held at the City University of New York, Jan 25/26, 2007. 
We invite papers from any subdivision of cognitive science such as formal 
linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, philosophy, psychology, 
etc. Scholars with ideas broadly within the penumbra of the suggested 
topics listed below are heartily encouraged to make a submission. (We use 
the terms ''precedence,'' ''temporal'' and ''sequential'' interchangeably
below to 
keep the area of interest broad.)

-What is unique to temporal (or sequential) representation in phonology? 
What is derivable from general cognitive functions?

-Does temporal representation change over the course of language 
acquisition (e.g. from syllable representations to segment representations)?

-Where are temporal relations encoded in the phonology? On each featural 
tier?  Strictly on the X-tier? Or are they all derivable from syllabic or
other prosodic structure?

-What do 'non-concatenative morphology' (e.g. reduplication, infixation, root 
and template morphology) and ludlings tell us about the existence and 
manipulation of ordering relationships in phonology?

-Do progressive and regressive operations (either local or long distance) in 
phonology yield insights into sequential order of phonological segments?

-How can sequential information be manipulated and/or referred to in 
phonology? E.g., what are the underlying formal mechanisms involved in 
metathesis, linearity, contiguity, etc.?

-How does the phonological representation of ordering information get 
translated into phonetic information?

Invited Speakers:

Justin Fitzpatrick, University of London (Title to be announced)
Elizabeth Hume, Ohio State, The interaction of phonetic and frequency 
factors in metathesis and other phonological processes.
William Idsardi, University of Maryland (Title to be announced)
Andrew Nevins, Harvard, The Precedence Model Meets Performance Data
Charles Reiss, Concordia University, Adjacency as a long-distance relation

Important Information:
 
Form of Abstract and How to Send it:
Abstracts should consist of a one page description of the paper (12pt font) 
with a second page for references, data and/or illustrations. Abstracts 
should be emailed as an attachment (PDF format) to 
precedence@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, November 28, 
2006. The subject line should be ''precedence conference.'' Authors should 
include title of the paper, name of the author(s) and affiliation in the
body of 
the email.
