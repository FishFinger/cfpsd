Theme Description

Since its Aristotelian and Stoic origins, logic has failed to satisfy natural
logical intuitions. 'Some F is G' is intuitively taken to imply that 'Not all F
is G', but logic tells us that we are wrong. 'P or Q' is intuitively taken to
imply that P and Q are not both true, but logic again tells us that we are
wrong. The clash was made worse by the advent of standard modern predicate
logic, which tells us that 'All F is G' is true when there are no Fs, as when it
is said that All mermaids have a bank account. Natural speakers definitely feel
that such sentences are false, but we are told that they are true.

This question has quite a history, and the prevailing view in our day is that
the clash can be neutralized with the help of the Gricean maxims. There is,
however, a growing body of opinion holding that the Gricean maxims do not do the
work they were hired for. For example, the maxims fail to explain why a sentence
like 'He couldn't move forward or backward' is immediately understood as 'he
couldn't move forward and he couldn't move backward', whereas 'He couldn't move
forward and backward' is not immediately understood as ''he couldn't move
forward or he couldn't move backward''. Yet if the maxims were worth their salt,
they should explain this difference. 

Recent work has opened the perspective of a new, more logically oriented,
approach. It is claimed that the linguistic, cognitively real, meanings of the
words all, some, not, and, and or form a sound system of predicate logic that
differs crucially from modern standard logic and does greater justice to natural
logical intuitions. Certain restrictions on standard mathematical set theory
generate a predicate logic that is a much better reflection of natural logical
intuitions than standard logic. This point of view opens a vast perspective of
original and exciting research.

Logicians of the past, especially but not only the Middle Ages, have offered
many surprisingly original insights into the questions at hand, relying
exclusively on their natural intuitions of meaning and consistency. In general,
the issues raised in the context of modern studies and debates have a long and
highly relevant history, which is, in most cases, hardly known to the
researchers involved. Conversely, historians of logic tend to look at their
research object with a magnifying glass, anxious to put together a true and
balanced picture of what went on at the time. This work is, of course,
indispensable, but the historians tend to follow current debates only from a
distance. That being so, they risk missing gems in the works of their
protagonists. To put it bluntly, the modern practitioners of logic tend to have
little knowledge of the past, while the historians of logic could be more
conversant with the issues that are topical in modern studies.

It is the purpose of the conference to bring together practitioners and
historians of logic under the overall banner of natural logic and its cognitive
roots. The organizers hope and expect that the conference will contribute to
greater mutual openness and greater flexibility on both sides, while new and
fruitful acquaintances are made and new ideas may be triggered. 

For this conference we welcome papers on any topic related to the issues raised
above. In particular, we solicit submissions that bring history and modern logic
together against the background of natural language, or submissions on the
methodological or philosophical aspects of the relation between logic and
language or language use, but papers that are specifically historical or
specifically systematic are also welcome.
