Meeting Description

Festschrift in Honour of Professor Paul Mbangwana

A Festschrift to honour Professor Paul Nkad Mbangwana on his 65th birthday in
2008 will be held at the Department of English, Faculty of Arts, University of
Yaounde I on 5 - 6 June 2008. 

Professor Paul Mbangwana is one of the most prominent language scientists the
universities of Cameroon have ever had. In fact, he has trained or contributed
to the training of most Cameroonian linguists.

The three areas of his research works i.e. English speech (Cameroon English
usage), contact linguistics (bilingualism, multilingualism, Pidgins), and oral
literature have all been enriched in fundamental ways by his ideas.

The courses he taught over the years including Research Methodology, Methodology
in Language Teaching and Learning, Spoken English, Usage and Meaning, Semantics
and Pragmatics - have yielded numerous batches of enthusiastic researchers who
are now working in all professional domains for their career development.

His expertise has taken him to universities in many countries in Africa, Europe
and America.

He is Fellow of Cameroon Academy of Science, Fellow of New York Academy of
Science and Member of International English Usage.

The Festschrift ceremony will include three key events: a symposium, Academic
Honours and a Gala Night. 

Details on each of these events are outlined in the Festshrift programme below:
the Symposium will take place on Day One and part of Day Two and the Academic
Honours and Gala Night will take place on Day Two.
