Full Title: Suvremena lingvistika 


Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories;Neurolinguistics;Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-Nov-2009 

Suvremena lingvistika is one of the leading Croatian linguistic journals
which publishes scholarly articles and reviews from various linguistic
fields and disciplines. It publishes primarily articles based on a clearly
defined theoretical framework, with a precisely elaborated methodology
which analyzes linguistic materials or discusses certain linguistic topics.

The editorial board of Suvremena lingvistika decided that the issue 69/2010
should be dedicated to the thematic area of typological linguistics. Within
the general, rather broad framework of the thematic area several subtopics
have been planned. We especially encourage contributions concerning the
following typological topics: language universals and linguistic theory,
typologically rare and unique features, diachronic stability and areal
diffusion of typologically salient features, typological profiles of the
languages of Europe, and neurolinguistic processing of typologically
different language structures. 

Manuscripts may be submitted in English, French, German, Italian and
Russian, and should be accompanied by an abstract of up to 10 lines written
in the language of the article, an extended abstract (1,800 to 2,000
characters long) written in English (only articles written in French,
German, Italian, and Russian), and a list of relevant key words.

Manuscripts should be sent as e-mail attachments (Word documents only) both
to the Editor-in-Chief of Suvremena lingvistika, Ida Raffaelli
(ida.raffaelli@ffzg.hr) and to Managing Editor Mislava Berto?a
(mbertosa@ffzg.hr).

All contributions are peer-reviewed by two anonymous reviewers. Manuscripts
may be rejected, accepted subject to revision, or accepted as such. There
is no limit to the number of pages. 

Submission deadline: 1 November 2009

Details about the journal and free access to articles can be found on
http://suvlin.ffzg.hr. Free access to Suvremena lingvistika is also
available via EBSCO and CEEOL. The journal is indexed in prominent
databases (MLA, BL, Sociological Abstracts, LLBA, ERIH, DOAJ).
