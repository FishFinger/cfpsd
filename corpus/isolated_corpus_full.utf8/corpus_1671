Final Call for Participation

EUROLAN 2007 - Eighth Biennial Summer School

SEMANTICS, OPINIONS AND SENTIMENTS IN TEXT
http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/

Faculty of Computer Science, Al. I. Cuza University
Iasi, Romania


Registration open at http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/html/reg.html.
New deadlines!

The EUROLAN 2007 Summer School will teach how to seize the difference 
between what a text explicitly conveys and what is hidden behind its 
words, to know how sentiments and emotions are expressed by authors, how 
could they be identified and how to make use of them in writings.
It offers two weeks of intensive study in the emerging areas of 
sentiment and opinion analysis complementing deep semantic analysis, and 
their applications to discourse and dialogue, next generation Semantic 
Web, applications of Natural Language Processing to blogs, wikis, etc. 
Lectures will consist of half- and full-day seminars, together with 
hands-on labs to provide to PhD, master or even undergraduate students 
in-depth understanding and experience.

The venue of EUROLAN 2007 is the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi 
- the capital city of the historical region of Romanian Moldavia.

Since its inception in 1993, the EUROLAN summer schools have gained a 
high reputation in the scientific community devoted to different areas 
of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. They are 
well known also for the degree of camaraderie that develops among 
students and professors. Eurolaners learn a lot, while also having much 
fun during the daily social events.
