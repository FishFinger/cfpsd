Journal of Information Assurance and Security (JIAS) - Call for Papers

http://www.dynamicpublishers.com/JIAS/

JIAS is a peer reviewed international journal with a key objective to
provide the academic and industrial community a medium for presenting
original research and applications related to information assurance
and security. JIAS invites authors to submit their original and
unpublished work that communicates current research on information
assurance and security regarding both the theoretical and
methodological aspects, as well as various applications in solving
real world information security problems.

Guidelines for Contributors
JIAS publishes two types of articles: regular papers and brief papers.
Review management is primarily under the direction of an associate
editor, who will solicit reviews for each submission. The associate
editor will ordinarily make a recommendation after receiving three
independent reviews. To avoid delays in processing your paper, please
follow these guidelines.

Submission of Manuscripts
All correspondence concerning submissions is between the author and
the Editor-in-Chief (s). To submit your paper for consideration, visit
the web submission system found at:
http://www.dynamicpublishers.com/JIAS/author/submit.php

Specifically, conference records and book chapters that have been
published previously are not acceptable unless and until they have
been enhanced significantly. Please ensure that in the cover letter
(comments to editor-in-chief)you state that the work being submitted
has not been published elsewhere, nor is it under review currently by
another publication.

Frequency of Publication
Journal of Information Assurance and Security (ISSN 1554-1010) is
published quarterly by Dynamic Publishers, Inc, Atlanta, GA 30362,
USA, in the months of March, June, September, and December.
