We are pleased to announce the release of the development dataset for the
CLEF-QA 2008 track "Question Answering on Speech Transcripts" (QAst).
We take this opportunity to launch a first call for participation in this
evaluation exercise.
 
QAst is a CLEF-QA track that aims at providing an evaluation framework for
QA technology on speech transcripts, both manual and automatic.
A detailed description of this track is available at:
http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~qast
 
It is the second evaluation for the QAst track.
Last year (QAst 2007), factual questions had been generated for two
distinct corpora (in English language only). This year, in addition to
factual questions,
some definition questions are generated, and five corpora covering three
different languages are used (3 corpora in English, 1 in Spanish and 1 in
French).
 
Important dates:
 
# 15 June 2008: evaluation set released
# 30 June 2008: submission deadline
 
The pilot track is organized jointly by the Technical University of
Catalonia (UPC), the Evaluations and Language resources Distribution Agency
(ELDA) and Laboratoire d'Informatique pour la Mécanique et les Sciences de
l'Ingénieur (LIMSI).
 
If you are interested in participating please send an email to Jordi Turmo
(turmo_AT_lsi.upc.edu) with ''QAst'' in the subject line.
 
Best regards,
 
QAst organizers.
