Meeting Description:

SHESL 2010 Conference - Paris, January 29-30, 2010

The disciplinarization of linguistic knowledge =97 History and Epistemology

The 2010 annual meeting of SHESL (Soci=E9t=E9 d'Histoire et d'Epist=E9molog=
ie des Sciences du Langage) will be devoted to the historical evolution of =
linguistic knowledge toward a full-fledged discipline, a process referred t=
o here as disciplinarization. The period under focus spans the 19th and 20t=
h centuries, though reference may be made to more remote periods. A compara=
tive perspective on different linguistic traditions is also encouraged.=20

Disciplinarization involves a number of issues which relate to the conditio=
ns in which the various forms of linguistic inquiry have come to stabilize =
into a body of knowledge, and to the ways in which this body of knowledge h=
ad been transmitted (through the founding of schools and traditions, the cr=
eation of university chairs, specialized journals, research teams, academic=
 societies, the organization of conferences, etc.). Due consideration shoul=
d be paid to the dissemination of linguistic knowledge beyond the academic =
circle as well as to the various types of technical or social application o=
f this knowledge. In this respect, educational aspects are the most relevan=
t, since they are at the crossroads of dissemination and application. They =
concern the "projection" of a body of linguistic knowledge to the field of =
language instruction, be it at primary and secondary school level or in hig=
her education. Beyond educational aspects, and from a more general standpoi=
nt, we are especially interested in papers which question the meaning and t=
he very validity of the notion of application (or applied linguistics), as =
it has been used (and still is) in theories of language. Monographs on auth=
ors or a specific school or tradition are welcome too.

SHESL (Soci=E9t=E9 d'Histoire et d'Epist=E9mologie des Sciences du Langage)=
 CNRS Research Group on the History of Linguistic Theories (HTL Group, UMR =
7597 - University of Paris 7)
With the support of the Research Group EA 2288 DILTEC (University of Paris =
3)

Organized by Jean-Louis Chiss (DILTEC, University of Paris 3) and Dan Savat=
ovsky (HTL, University of Bourgogne), with the participation of Danielle Ca=
ndel (HTL Group) and Jacqueline L=E9on (HTL Group)=20

Call for Papers:

Proposals are invited for papers which might consider one or more of the fo=
llowing main themes (the=20
list is not exclusive):

-The ways in which linguistic research has been or is organized and structu=
red in different countries and cultures, and at different times (movements =
and schools, their affiliation to religious or philosophical traditions; pr=
ocedures for sanctioning academic achievements; the structuring of research=
 programs and teams; recruitment procedures for the hiring of academic staf=
f etc.). To this we may add, as another  aspect of disciplinarization, the =
reflections that linguists and grammarians of all times have conducted on t=
he history of their own field.=20

-The institutional, political and social aspects of the linguist's work whi=
ch are consequent upon the newly emerging status of linguistics as a profes=
sional practice. In this respect, the fields to which linguists apply their=
 expertise deserve special attention (linguistic policies and planning, edu=
cational policies, the emergence and development of "language professions",=
 etc.). Of direct relevance too are the various technical applications of l=
inguistics developed in recent times, such as machine translation and man-m=
achine dialogue systems, Natural Language Processing, etc.

-Historical and epistemological reflections on the notion of application it=
self, and on the "applicationist trend" in the field of language teaching (=
whether of the mother tongue or of foreign languages). We believe that the =
latter issue, which was hotly debated in the 1980s-1990s, is worth revisiti=
ng. Finally, it may be profitable to examine the repercussions on linguisti=
c research of all forms of social demand, most notably (though not exclusiv=
ely) when this demand emanates from the educational community.=20

Abstracts (400 words maximum) should be submitted by e-mail, in MS Word for=
mat, to shesl@neuf.fr before October 1, 2009.=20

Abstracts should include: name and affiliation, e-mail address, title of pa=
per. Abstracts are refereed by the conference committee.=20

Notification of acceptance November 1, 2009.=20

Official languages : French or English.
