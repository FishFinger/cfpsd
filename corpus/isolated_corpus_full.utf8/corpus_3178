Full Title: Symposium on Urban Place Names 

Date: 13-Aug-2009 - 16-Aug-2009
Location: Helsinki, Finland 
Contact Person: Terhi Ainiala
Meeting Email: terhi.ainiala@kotus.fi

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

The goal of this cross-disciplinary symposium is to gather scholars to discuss
the current theoretical and empirical challenges of urban place name research. 
The following issues, inter alia, will be addressed in the symposium: in what
ways are power structures and social identities constructed and contested
through the naming of streets and everyday places?  What is the role of place
names in the formation of lived everyday meanings and cognitive perceptions of
urban space? What is the contribution of specific disciplines to the study of
urban toponymies, and how might interdisciplinary approaches to it be best
facilitated? 

Call for Papers:

International symposium, Helsinki 13-16 August 2009

The Research Institute for the Languages of Finland cordially invites the
submission of paper proposals for its cross-disciplinary symposium on urban
place names. The symposium will be heldfrom the 13th-16th of August 2009, in
Helsinki, Finland.

Objectives:
Recent years have witnessed a considerable rise in the interest in the
linguistic aspects of urban processes. In particular, institutional procedures,
commercial aspirations and everyday meanings related to toponymic landscapes
have been studied in different historical and present-day urban settings. The
goal of the path-breaking symposium is to gather scholars to discuss the current
theoretical and empirical challenges of urban place name research. 

We invite scholars from different countries and disciplines (e.g., linguistics,
onomastics, geography, history, cultural studies, anthropology, sociology,
political science, and literary studies) to present theoretical openings and
case studies on the above and related subjects. 

The symposium will consist of keynote lectures, thematic sessions and excursions. 
The symposium language is English.

Keynote Speakers:
Prof. Maoz Azaryahu, Haifa University 
Prof. Staffan Nyström, Uppsala University

Symposium Site:
The symposium will be organized in Vuosaari, Helsinki. The venue of the
symposium is Hotel Vuoranta (http://www.sodexo.fi/en-GB/hotel_vuoranta/). It is
located in beautiful coastal surroundings, only a metro trip away from downtown
Helsinki. 

Accommodation: 
Hotel Vuoranta (http://www.sodexo.fi/en-GB/hotel_vuoranta/) is the most
convenient place to stay during the symposium. More low-budget accommodation is
