               *** December 10-11, 2007 ***
   =20
** OVERVIEW
=20
A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised=20
by the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA).=20
This event will be the fifth annual installment of the workshop in its=20
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop=20
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

The ALTA Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Australian=20
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues=20
ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards=20
for markup, through various aspects of document processing.=20

The goals of the workshop are:=20
=20
 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community=20
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;=20
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community=20
   and with the wider international LT community;=20
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;=20
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;=20
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research=20
   and projects;=20
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence=20
   community to become aware of local LT research;=20
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand=20
   and overseas.=20
=20
As with the 2006 Workshop, there will be poster presentations=20
in addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive

discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage=20
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any=20
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the=20
same status in the proceedings.
=20
** Topics
=20
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished=20
research on all aspects of natural language processing,=20
including, but not limited to:
=20
 * speech understanding and generation;=20
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,=20
   and discourse;=20
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;=20
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;=20
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;=20
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;=20
 * summarisation;=20
 * machine translation and translation aids;=20
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;=20
 * natural language and multimodal systems;=20
 * message and narrative understanding systems;=20
 * evaluations of language systems;=20
 * computational lexicography.=20
=20
We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT=20
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the=20
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT=20
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.=20
=20
** Submission Format
=20
Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL=20
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages; this limit does=20
not include references (the aim being to encourage thorough citation=20
of related work, as is the policy in EMNLP
<http://www.cs.jhu.edu/EMNLP-CoNLL-2007/your-final-paper.html>  this
year). We strongly=20
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style=20
files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and example=20
documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve=20

including font and page size restrictions.
=20
The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces=20
problems, please contact the organisers beforehand.
=20
If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be=20
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged=20
to send an early version with the typographical complexity of=20
your final intended version so that we can check it is printable.=20
All papers should include the full authors' names and affiliations.=20
(Note that this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines=20
adopted for ACL conferences.)
=20
Detailed directions for submission will be made available at=20
the workshop website.=20
