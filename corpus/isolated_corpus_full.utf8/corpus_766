Harmony, Diversity and Intercultural Communication

Call for Papers 

China Association for Intercultural Communication 
International Association for Intercultural Communication Studies

Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, PR China
 June 22-24, 2007

From ''the age of discovery'' to this millennium, globalization has been
underway and it has dramatically altered the relations and connections between
peoples from different cultural background. The intensification of technological
change across telecommunication and human interactions presents new political,
cultural, and moral dilemmas and opportunities. Social change, cultural
differences, identity, uncertainty, diversity and world order in the process of
global communication demand fresh perspectives and new systems of explanation.
In such rapidly changing world, communication plays a much more important role
today than ever before: People from different cultural backgrounds are actively
using the appropriation of communication resources to construct their cultural
and social right, style, and identity. Communicative resources thus become an
integral part of an individual's symbolic and social capital, which can be every
bit as essential as real property resources were once considered to be.
Therefore, to understand and develop intercultural knowledge and skills become
most critical for a productive and successful life in the 21st century. 

China Association and the International Association for Intercultural
Communication Studies (CAFIC and IAICS) are now soliciting submissions for the
International Conference on Intercultural Communication to be held on June
