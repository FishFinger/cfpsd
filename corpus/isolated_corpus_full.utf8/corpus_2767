3. The relation between sound and meaning as a function of linguistic categories and structures. The Workshop will focus on experimental and interdisciplinary approaches with the ultimate objective of boosting international research and collaboration. 

The following subjects and disciplines are related to the Workshop:
1. Cognitive Linguistics
2. Neurolinguistics
3. Speech Production
4. Speech Acoustics
5. Phonology
6. Morphology
7. Syntax

13. Discourse Linguistics
14. Language Pathology
15. Sociolinguistics
16. Language Education 
17. Computational Linguistics
18. Language Technology 

Submission of abstracts covering fundamental linguistic notions, such as segments, syllables, words, phrases and discourse units, are invited with reference to the aims of the Workshop. The Workshop will contain a combination of plenary oral and poster sessions along with interdisciplinary panel discussions.
