Arena Romanistica

2nd call for papers:

Didactic studies in Romance languages

The second issue of Arena Romanistica focuses on didactics, plurilinguism
and language acquisition from an epistemological point of view. A
particular emphasis is given to the challenges that arise in
multilinguistic and multicultural settings from the interaction of Romance
languages as well as between Romance languages and other languages.
Didactics, plurilinguism and language acquisition have emerged as important
fields within Romance studies. These disciplines are characterized by a
strong link between theory and its applications, as well as
multidisciplinary and multicultural approaches. Therefore, developments in
these subject fields could have significant impact on the field of Romance
studies as a whole, through theoretical and methodological innovations, but
also by expanding its scope geographically and thematically. 

Within this domain, we welcome and encourage theoretical as well as
empirical contributions from the fields of linguistics, cultural and
literary studies, in all Romance languages as well as in English. Arena
Romanistica is an international, refereed journal of Romance studies. 

Submission deadline: 14th May 2007

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
