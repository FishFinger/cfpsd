Meeting Description

The workshop 'Re-writing Linguistic History - (Post)colonial Reality on the
Fringes of Linguistic Theories' will be held at the upcoming INST-conference on
the theme 'Knowledge, Creativity and Transformations of Societies (KCTOS)' in
Vienna, 6th-9th December 2007.  

The workshop seeks to reassert the place of (post)colonial reality within
linguistic theories, which unfortunately were designed for other contexts but
have been applied to these contexts without a conscious regard for discrepancies. 

Papers that approach the issue from quantitative and qualitative perspectives
and/or introduce alternative analytical frameworks are welcome. 
 
Send abstracts to Eric A. Anchimbe at anchimbe_eric@yahoo.com
Deadline: August 28th, 2007. 

Re-writing Linguistic History - (Post)colonial Reality on the Fringes of
Linguistic Theories

For the past several decades, linguistic studies of (post)colonial societies
have been built on theories, platforms, templates and frameworks constructed in,
and for, the west. As Franz Boas rightly said at the turn of the last century,
''the internal structure of languages and societies must be allowed to emerge on
their own, without the distorting imposition of European templates upon them''
(see Handbook of American Indian Languages). The distorting impact of foreign
models, as the case may be, prohibited researchers from investigating peculiar
characteristics of these societies as outcomes of their sociohistorical
completeness. For instance, Africa's multilingualism has often been described on
a par with European multilingualism. This is theoretically misleading because
whereas European multilingualism involves several written languages, the African
context involves only one (or two) written languages existing alongside oral
languages founded on oral cultures and transmitted orally. It is about  time
more natural and region-based findings were made that handle postcolonial areas
not as being on the fringes of the west but as constituting centres of their own.

This section of the KCTOS conference (December 6-9, 2007) addresses the
following (and more) linguistic issues in postcolonial areas that have been
studied with foreign-based theories:

1. Postcolonial linguistics (how colonialism rolled the dice in approaches to,
and conceptions of, languages in these contexts)
2. Postcolonial pragmatics (face, politeness, turn-taking, name-calling, etc.)
3. Notions of bilingualism and multilingualism (oral vs. written languages and
cultures)
4. Construction of (multiple) linguistic identities (allegiance to languages)
5. Endangerment(?) and survival of indigenous languages in the face of
international (official) languages like English and French.
6. Language contact and (socio)linguistic outcomes

Papers with strong insights into the above topics and related ones are invited.
Priority will be given to papers that propose new (and promising) analytical
frameworks to particular linguistic processes in postcolonial areas.
Quantitative and qualitative approaches are welcome.

NB: Papers will be published in TRANS 17
(http://www.inst.at/trans/index.htm). 
Selected papers will be published as a book.

Send abstracts to Eric A. Anchimbe at anchimbe_eric@yahoo.com by August 28th, 2007.
