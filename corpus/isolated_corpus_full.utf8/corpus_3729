Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2009

http://www.naaclhlt2009.org

May 31  June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado

Deadline for full paper submission  Monday, December 1, 2008
Deadline for short paper submission  Monday, February 9, 2009

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American  
Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human  
Language Technology Conference (HLT) of NAACL. The conference covers a  
broad spectrum of disciplines working towards enabling intelligent  
systems to interact with humans using natural language, and towards  
enhancing human-human communication through services such as speech  
recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text  
summarization, and information extraction. NAACL HLT 2009 will feature  
full papers, short papers, posters, demonstrations, and a doctoral  
consortium, as well as pre- and post-conference tutorials and workshops.

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial,  
original, and unpublished research in disciplines that could impact  
human language processing systems.  We encourage the submission of  
short papers that can be characterized as a small, focused  
contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece  
or an interesting application note. A separate review form for short  
papers will be introduced this year.

NAACL HLT 2009 aims to hold two special sessions, Large Scale Language  
Processing and Speech Indexing and Retrieval.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are  
understood to be applied to speech and/or text:

-Large scale language processing
-Speech indexing and retrieval
-Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
-Information extraction
-Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer,  
human-robot  interaction, education and learning systems, assistive  
technologies, digital entertainment)
-Machine translation
-Summarization
-Question answering
-Topic classification and information filtering
-Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/genre analysis)
-Topic clustering
-Text and speech mining
-Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
-Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
-Language generation
-Speech synthesis
-Speech understanding
-Speech analysis and recognition
-Multilingual processing
-Phonology
-Morphology (including word segmentation)
-Part of speech tagging
-Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
-Word sense disambiguation
-Lexical semantics
-Formal semantics and logic
-Textual entailment and paraphrasing
-Discourse and pragmatics
-Dialog systems
-Knowledge acquisition and representation
-Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
-Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons,  
ontologies, annotated corpora)
-Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information  
structure and sources in speech)
-Multimodal representations and processing, including speech and  gesture


Submission information will soon be available at: http://www.naaclhlt2009.org
