                     NAACL HLT 2009: Student Research Workshop
                             --- DEADLINE EXTENSION ---

The Organizing Committee of the Student Research Workshop at NAACL HLT 2009=
 in
Boulder, Colorado would like to announce that the deadline for submissions =
has
been extended to

                  *** Monday January 26, 2009, 23:59 EST. ***

The Student Research Workshop is intended particularly as a venue for PhD a=
nd
M.S. students who have a clear research plan and some preliminary results t=
hat
indicate that their idea might work. We invite and encourage submission of
work in progress!  Unlike conference papers, we don't expect completely
finished work --- this is a place where you can present and get feedback on
your research plan while your graduate work is still work in progress. Mult=
i-
authored papers are allowed, but the first author of the paper must be a
student, and the paper must be presented by a student at the workshop.

Notification of acceptance is March 2, final versions are due March 31.

Please note the following changes and updates to the orginal CFP:

- It is no longer required that ALL authors of the paper be students.
  However, the first author must be a student, and the paper, if accepted,
  must be presented by a student.

- We are now also accepting short papers (4 pages). These papers are only
  considered for poster presentations. They are not eligible for oral
  presentation and subsequent discussion by panelists.

- Thanks to an NSF grant, we are able to substantially support (although not
  fully fund) conference travel for one student author per full-length (i.e.
  6-page) paper accepted for oral presentation. Poster presentations are not
  eligible for travel support.

- The Student Workshop will be interleaved with the NAACL HLT main conferen=
ce
  in a way that the student session in each track (IR, Speech, NLP) is not =
in
  competition with regular sessions in the respective topic area.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Paper Submission Deadline: Monday, January 26th, 2008

Unless otherwise stated, all submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST on the spe=
cified day. =


1. General Invitation for Submissions =


The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback from a general audien=
ce
as well as from panelists. The panelists are experienced researchers who wi=
ll
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask for
suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by an
international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop will be=
 on
work in progress. The research being presented can come from any topic area
within computational linguistics and is understood to be applied to speech
and/or text. A list of topic areas is provided in the Call for Papers for t=
he
NAACL HLT 2009 Conference available at:

http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/call_for_papers.html

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is original and unpublished research. The pape=
rs
should describe original work in progress. Students who have settled on the=
ir
thesis direction but still have significant research left to do are
particularly encouraged to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange ideas w=
ith
other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for further development of
the work, papers should clearly indicate directions for future research
wherever appropriate. Multi-authored papers are acceptable if the first aut=
hor
of the paper is a student, and the paper will be presented by a student aut=
hor
at the workshop. Papers submitted for this workshop are eligible only if th=
ey
have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available publis=
hed
proceedings. Students who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Stude=
nt
Research Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their
papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper has =
been
submitted to another conference or workshop.

3. Submission Procedure

Submission will be electronic using the paper submission web page below:
https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/StudentResearch2009/

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and shou=
ld
not exceed six (6) pages, including references. Note that papers that are
shorter than 6 pages may be submitted in consideration for poster presentat=
ion
rather than oral presentation.  We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX
style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's
conference. These files are available at:

http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html

A description of the format is available there in case you are unable to use
these style files directly. All submissions must be electronic: please use =
the
submission website above to submit your paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by the
Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewers. Each
submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior researc=
hers
for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on the results of t=
he
review. Note that reviewing of papers will be double-blind; therefore, plea=
se
make sure your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self identifying references anywhere in the paper
submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed previously
(Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001) previously show=
ed
...''.

5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than 11:59 EST, January 26th, 2009. No
papers received after this deadline will be accepted. Acknowledgment will be
emailed soon after receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to auth=
ors
(by email) on March 2nd, 2009. Detailed formatting guidelines for the
preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with
their acceptance notice.
