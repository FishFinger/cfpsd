*********************************************************************
			FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

   Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology
			     (sfcm 2009)

			<http://sfcm2009.org/>

		   Workshop date: September 4, 2009

	     Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland

		  Submission deadline: March 1, 2009

*********************************************************************

This workshop concentrates on actual, working systems and frameworks
of at least prototype quality. To ensure fruitful discussions among
workshop participants, submissions on concrete morphology systems are
preferrably for German; submissions on morphological frameworks are
relevant if the framework can be used to implement components for
different languages.

In contrast to, for example, Morphochallenge, this workshop focuses on
systems and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing
linguistically motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of
linguistic categories.


*Topics*

The topics of this workshop include both technical aspects,
applications, and uses of systems and frameworks for computational
morphology. While purely theoretical submissions may be relevant, the
focus of the workshop is clearly on actual, working systems and
prototypes.

The workshop will mainly focus on German, but contributions for other
languages are encouraged in order to demonstrate open-source tools and
runtime software for full-scale morphologies. Topics include, but are
not limited to:

    * Frameworks for developing morphological components.
    * Open-source tools and resources for morphology.
    * Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms,
      especially for German.
    * Suitability of morphological components for interactive use.
    * Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.
    * Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation
      in applications.
    * Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with
      respect to performance, quality, and coverage.
    * Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance,
      hardware/software requirements, resource usage.
    * License models and legal aspects.

There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.


*Submissions*

We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages
(including references) or short papers of up to 10 pages. Papers
submitted at review stage must not contain the authors' names,
affiliations, or any information that may disclose the authors'
identity.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research
at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings
of the workshop by Springer in their series Communications in Computer
and Information Science.

The papers must use the Springer LNCS format. We recommend to use the
LaTeX2e format. Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format
guidelines. Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. For
paper submissions we use EasyChair, see

<http://www.sfcm2009.org/?Submissions>

If you have questions concerning format, EasyChair or submitting in
general, please contact us! (info@sfcm2009.org)
