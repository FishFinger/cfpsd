Meeting Description

The focus of 'Dialogue Under Occupation' is the ongoing exploration of dialogue
and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occupation. Dialogue is
intended in the sense that understanding of differing perspectives comes through
dialogue. Discourse refers to the types of talk that the various stakeholders
involved in occupation engage in (e.g., political discourse, media discourse,
public discourse).

The goal of the conference is to provide a venue to maximize the investigation
and application of differing perspectives (i.e., the dialogue or discourse of
the occupied, the dialogue or discourse of the occupiers, or the interaction
between opposing sides), and to actively promote greater understanding of the
ideologies, issues, concerns, etc. of individuals affected by occupation in its
various dimensions. 

Call for Papers

Papers from the multiple disciplines (e.g., anthropology, cultural studies,
discourse studies, education, history, linguistics, political science,
psychology, sociology) relating to hegemony, power, agency, identity, among
others, will be particularly relevant. Conference themes include, but are not
limited to, the following strands:

Discourse of Enactment:
The language of the policies and politics of occupation

Discourse of Transaction:
The language of the media and its role in spreading the policies, keeping the
occupied and the occupiers informed (or misinformed).

Discourse of Reaction:
The language of daily life under occupation: talking about the self vs. the
other, historical narratives of the occupation, center vs. periphery, the
language of the ingroup, outgroup, and/or intergroup.

Discourse of Resolution:
The language of peacemakers and peacekeepers, as well as the language of
resignation, acceptance, and coexistence.

Submission Instructions

You may submit a proposal for a paper presentation (20 minutes with 10 minutes
for questions), a panel (maximum of 4 papers limited to a 2-hour block), or a
roundtable (limited to one hour). Posters may also be submitted for works in
progress. 

Do not include any self-identifying information on the abstract; indicate only
the title and the abstract itself. On the separate cover sheet, include:

1. Title
2. Strand you are submitting to (i.e., Enactment, Transaction, Reaction, Resolution)
3. Format (paper, panel, roundtable, or poster)
4. Author(s)
