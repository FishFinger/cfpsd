                         COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS

                             (IWCS-8)

             January 7-9, 2009, Tilburg, The Netherlands

                            -------------
                             Endorsed by SIGSEM,
        the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Semantics

                            -------------


                FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Tilburg University will host the Eighth International Conference on
Computational Semantics (IWCS-8), which will take place on 7-9
January 2009. The aim of the conference is to bring together
researchers interested in any aspects of the computation, annotation,
extraction, and representation of meaning in natural language, in 
multimedia objects, and in spoken, written, or multimodal dialogue.


               +--------------------------------------------+

	       +--------------------------------------------+


                                 TOPICS OF INTEREST

Areas of special interest for the conference will be computational
aspects of semantic theories; semantic annotation of natural 
language and multimodal utterances; and theoretical aspects of 
the design and implementation of  language understanding systems 
and systems for spoken, written, or multimodal dialogue.
Papers are invited that are concerned with topics in these and 
closely related areas, including, but not limited to, the following:

  * construction of representations of meaning in natural language
  * methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
  * approaches and achievements in textual entailment
  * modelling and using context in semantic interpretation

  * the semantics of semantic annotation
  * machine learning of semantic structures
  * informal and formal approaches to semantics and their combination
  * semantics and ontologies

  * the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts
  * construction and use of underspecified semantic representations 
  * semantic aspects of language generation
  * computing meaning in multimodal interaction
  
  * the semantic web and natural language processing
  * the semantics-pragmatics interface in computational perspective
  * semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
  * shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning


                   ISO/SIGSEM JOINT WORKING GROUP MEETING

Immediately preceding IWCS-8, on 5-6 January 2009, a joint meeting 
will be held of the ISO TC 37/SC 4 Working Group on Semantic 
Content, and the ACL SIGSEM Working Group on the Representation 
of Multimodal Semantic Information. This meeting will be open to 
IWCS-8 participants. For more information see

                       SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Three types of submission are solicited: full papers, short papers,
and project abstracts.

Full papers
-----------
Full papers are original papers of maximally 12 pages, that will be 
published in the conference proceedings and will have a full oral 
presentation of about 30 minutes at the conference.

Short papers/posters 
----------------------------
Short papers are maximally 4 pages long, will be published in the 
conference proceedings, and will have a very brief ('flash') oral 
presentation at the conference. Authors of short papers are 
invited to also put up a poster and participate in a poster session. 

Project abstracts
-----------------
Project abstracts are brief descriptions of 2 pages of ongoing,
recently completed, or starting projects. They will be published in
the conference proceedings and will be presented as a poster during 
a poster session.

Submission formats
------------------
Submissions of all three types should be in postscript or pdf
format and prepared with LaTeX; see the IWCS-8 website
http://let.uvt.nl/research/ti/sigsem/iwcs/iwcs8 for more
information on the style files to be used. The page limits
presuppose standard 11 point Computer Modern font. Final versions
of accepted contributions will have to be submitted as LaTeX
source files to facilitate publication of the proceedings; we also
aim at publishing a selection of accepted papers in book form
after the conference.

Email your postscript or pdf file to: computational.semantics@uvt.nl

Submission deadlines
--------------------
For full papers the submission deadline is 25 September 2008; for
short papers and project abstracts the deadline is 1 November.
