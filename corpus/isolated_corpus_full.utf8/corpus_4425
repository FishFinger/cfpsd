Call for Papers

The 1st International Workshop on
Emails in e-Commerce and Enterprise Contexts (E3C)

Held at the 11th IEEE Conference on Commerce and Enterprise Computing
(CEC 2009)

July 20th -23rd, 2009
Vienna, Austria

Workshop web site:
http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/autocompwiki/index.php/E3C
Conference web site: http://cec2009.isis.tuwien.ac.at/


Important Dates:
----------------
* Full paper submission: March 15th, 2009
* Authors Notification: April 15th, 2009
* Camera ready versions due: May 15th, 2009
* Workshop: July 20, 2009


Scope
-----
Despite the rise of competing technologies, email remains a crucial
business communication tool and an important source of enterprise
information and knowledge. According to recent surveys, (i) information
workers spend an average of 20% of their time dealing with email, and
(ii) about 80% of users prefer email as a business communication tool.
In Europe, about 98.8% of enterprises are SMEs (Small and Medium
Enterprises). With an average of 7 employees per SME, email is widely
used by SMEs to manage tasks and cooperation in conducting their
business. Web 2.0 and e-commerce systems also rely on email for
notifying users about transactions, changes, services or events.

Email is used for many functions, including alerting, archiving, task
management, collaboration and interoperability. Partly due to this
diversity of use, email is rarely a standalone information source. Email
messages often contain pointers to files (e.g., saved attachments),
links to resources and services on the Web, and references to other
people. Email communication also interconnects business transactions
with human communication, collaboration and interaction, thus providing
a rich source of information for social and business-oriented computing.

Existing email research has focused largely on topics such as
understanding social aspects of email, email task management and user
interaction with email. There has been little interaction between email
research and work on enterprise computing which considers information
from various legacy systems, business Web services, business process
templates and documents. To effectively exploit the capability of email
in e-commerce and enterprise contexts, in particular for SMEs, we
foresee the need to join efforts from these different research
communities to identify issues and share research results.

The aim of this workshop is to gather email and enterprise computing
researchers and practitioners to discuss and propose solutions for email
in e-commerce and enterprise contexts.

E3C would like to build on previous successful events such as the
Workshop on Enhanced Messaging (EMAIL-2008) at AAAI-08.


Research Topics
---------------
* Architecture for enterprise cooperation and
   interoperability over email
* Intelligent email for SMEs
* Email-based business task and process management
* Email content analysis, message summarization, information extraction
* Semantic Email and Semantic Knowledge Extraction
* Email social networks for enterprise computing
* Email analysis of exchanged documents
   for semantic alignment via negotiation
* Email Workflow Management for Business Processes
* Interconnection of email content and enterprise resources
   (legacy systems, document repositories)
* Enterprise resource mashup support for business email
* Approaches for email visualization and
   user interfaces in business contexts
* Case studies
* Business email datasets


Workshop Format
---------------
We seek original research papers and demos in the workshop:

Original research papers: we seek full papers (maximum of 8 pages in
IEEE CS style). Full papers should contain original contributions not
published or submitted elsewhere, and references to related
state-of-the-art work. Each paper will be reviewed by a minimum of three
reviewers.

Demos: The workshop also aims at having demo submissions demonstrating
the usefulness of email-based technologies for SMEs. Demo papers will be
limited to 2 pages in IEEE CS style.

Panel discussion and invited talk: we plan to have a panel to discuss
the topics of the workshop. In particular, we are seeking discussion to
understand the current status and future research on the combination of
social aspects and enterprise computing based on email. Pending
appropriate funding, we also plan to have an invited talk.

The workshop proceedings will be published by IEEE CS, following the
general rules of the CEC 2009.


Paper submission
----------------
Papers should contain original contributions not published or submitted
elsewhere, and references to related state-of-the-art work. Authors of
accepted papers are expected to present their views of the field at the
oral presentation. Full papers up to 8 pages (including figures, tables
and references) and demo papers up to 2 pages can be submitted. Papers
should follow the IEEE format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10
pt Times/Roman font. Papers should include a title, the name and
affiliation of each author, an abstract of up to 150 words and no more
than eight keywords. Authors should also provide contact addresses, if
different from the submitting electronic address. All submissions should
be electronic (in PDF) and will be peer-reviewed by a minimum of three
program commitee members.

Formatting Instructions and templates are available at
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/IEEE_CS_Latex.zip
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct.doc

Papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the proceedings,
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Please note that each
accepted paper should have at least one author register and present the
paper at the workshop to get the paper published in the proceedings.

To submit your paper, please log into the EasyChair's E3C 2009 webpage.
