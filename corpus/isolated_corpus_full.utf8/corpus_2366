Call for Papers

         The 2nd Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW II)
Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)
                  Held in conjunction with LREC 2008
                           Marrakech, Morocco

SIGANN Working Groups and Demo/Poster session, afternoon of May 26, 2008
              Paper presentations, full day May 27, 2008

Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of
supervised methods of statistical natural language
processing. Annotation encodes human knowledge about linguistic
phenomena that can be modelled statistically and reproduced by
automatic procedures. This meeting will provide a forum for annotation
researchers to work towards standardization, best practices and
interoperability, as well as to share innovative research in corpus
annotation.  We invite submissions of long and short papers, posters,
and demonstrations relating to all aspects of the linguistic
annotation of corpora.

The workshop will begin with a half-day session (afternoon of May 26) =20
devoted to
SIGANN working group sessions on Shared Corpus Annotation and Best =20
Practice Guidelines,
together with a poster/demo session. A full-day session (May 27) will =20
be devoted to paper presentations.

A separate call for participation in the SIGANN working groups =20
sessions on May 26 will be issued,
soliciting annotations of the SIGANN shared corpus and proposals for =20
best
practices/standards in linguistic annotations. We urge members of the =20
community interested in
working on any aspect of harmonization of linguistic annotations to =20
participate.

SUBMISSIONS: Long paper submissions should not exceed 8 pages in
length. Short papers and demo descriptions should not exceed 4
pages. Format requirements will be the same as for full papers of LREC
2008. For details, please consult the submission section on the
workshop website.
