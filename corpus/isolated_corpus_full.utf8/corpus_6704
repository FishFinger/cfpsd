Meeting Description:

The Stockholm Metaphor Festival is an annual two-day conference on the use =
of
figurative language, arranged by The Department of English at Stockholm=20
University. It brings together researchers from a broad range of academic=
=20
disciplines, working within different theoretical and methodological paradi=
gms,=20
in a creative, internationally oriented and friendly atmosphere.=20

Call for Papers

Keynotes: Ray Gibbs, University of California, Santa Cruz Clive Cazeaux, Ca=
rdiff
School of Art & Design=20

Deadline for abstract submission: 15 April 2010

The importance of figurative language is now generally recognized, and the
Festival offers an opportunity to present and learn about research findings
concerning figures of speech in different types of discourse, and their
cognitive, cultural, narrative, poetic, rhetorical, social or textual funct=
ions.
Contributions to the Festival can  be about the literary or linguistic char=
acter
and use of  tropes- metaphor, metonymy, simile, oxymoron, hyperbole, punnin=
g,
and irony- or the character and use of rhyme schemes and various types of
parallelism, as well as about communicatively effective interaction of diff=
erent
kinds of figurative devices. =20

Each talk is allotted 30 minutes at the Festival, roughly 20 minutes for th=
e=20
presentation and 10 minutes for discussion. There is also a separate poster=
=20
session that can be visited by all participants in the Festival. =20

Abstract guidelines: Abstracts should be written in English, and they are=
=20
expected to be about 300 to 400 words long. The abstract should have a titl=
e,
but the author's name, academic affiliation, and email address should be
indicated on a separate sheet, where it should also be specified whether th=
e
abstract is intended as a basis for a talk or for a poster presentation. Al=
l
abstracts should be emailed to Metaphorfestival@English.su.se. Information =
about
acceptances will be emailed by 15 May to all scholars submitting an abstrac=
t.

A selection of papers from each Festival is published in a peer-reviewed vo=
lume.

Conference fee: =8050 for early registration, by 31 July; =8070 from 1 Augu=
st.
