Meeting Description:

PROPOR2010
The 8th International Conference
on the Computational Processing of Portuguese

Porto Alegre, Brazil
hosted by PUCRS-Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul
April 28-30, 2010

The International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese (PROPOR)
is the main event in the area of Natural Language Processing that is focused on
Portuguese and the issues related to this language.

It has been hosted in Brazil and in Portugal: Lisbon/PT (1993), Curitiba/BR
(1996), Porto Alegre/BR (1998), Évora/PT (1999), Atibaia/BR (2000), Faro/PT
(2003), Itatiaia/BR (2006) and Aveiro/PT (2008). 

Call for Papers

Topics of Interest:
Any topic of language and speech processing of Portuguese, including any applied
task (e.g. word sense disambiguation, dialect identification, etc.), basic issue
(e.g. parsing, evaluation, etc.), subdomain (e.g. phonology, dialogue, etc.),
application (e.g. speech recognition, question answering, etc.), type of
resource (e.g. corpora, ontologies, etc.), linguistic phenomenon (e.g. prosody,
anaphora, etc.), or in any area benefiting from language and speech processing
of Portuguese (e.g. information retrieval, subtitling, e-learning, research in
the humanities, etc.), under any methodological perspective (e.g. machine
learning, symbolic, etc.), from the industry or from any contributing academic
discipline, including but not limited to Computation, AI, Engineering,
Linguistics or Cognitive Science.

Important Dates:
September 21, 2009 Deadline for full paper submission
October   31, 2009 Notification of acceptance
November  16, 2009 Camera-ready papers due

Submission:
Authors are invited to submit two kinds of papers:
- full papers: reporting substantial, original and completed work, especially
those that may contribute in a significant way to the advancement of the area-
wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results should be included.
- short papers: preference will be given to reports on ongoing work, position
papers and potential ideas to be discussed. Authors will be able to express
their preference for full/short papers but the final decision is on the program
chairs. Short papers may be selected for oral or poster presentation and should
be up to 4 pages in length. Full papers will be presented in an oral session and
should be up to 10 pages in length.

For the sake of accommodating the widest range of contributors, full paper
acceptance is restricted to two papers per author.

Submissions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers. In order to ensure
blind review, the author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body
of the submission and self-reference should be in the third person. Submissions
are written in English.

As in previous PROPOR editions, publication of full papers in an LNAI volume is
planned. Selected short papers will be taken under consideration for LNAI
publication.
