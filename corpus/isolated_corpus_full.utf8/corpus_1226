Meeting Description:

Current Approaches to Spanish and Portuguese Second Language Phonology is a
conference that aims to include a wide range of approaches to the study of
second language phonology, as well as a wide range of contexts, from acquisition
of Spanish phonology by English speakers to the acquisition of Portuguese
phonology by Spanish speakers, from classroom-based learning to full immersion
in the culture of the second language, and more. By focusing on the breadth of
approaches that scholars are taking to the study of second language phonological
acquisition in Spanish and Portuguese, this conference aims to represent the
state-of-the-art in second language phonological acquisition. 

The sound system is often the most salient feature of second language speech,
especially to the non-specialist, yet it receives little attention when compared
to other areas of investigation within studies of second language acquisition.
While studies of the acquisition of the sound systems of Spanish and Portuguese
by second language learners date back as far as the beginnings of the field of
modern linguistics, and while studies within this area of linguistic inquiry
have continued ever since and appear to be growing in numbers, there has never
been a forum - whether a meeting or a publication - to bring together the
community of scholars conducting research in this area.

Abstracts are invited for presentations on any topic related to the second
language acquisition of the Spanish and Portuguese sound systems, and the theme
is intended to be construed as broadly as possible. The aim is to include in the
conference a wide range of approaches to the study of second language phonology,
as well as a wide range of contexts, from acquisition of Spanish phonology by
English speakers to the acquisition of Portuguese phonology by Spanish speakers,
from classroom-based learning to full immersion in the culture of the second
language, to name just a few of the possibilities.

Anonymous one-page abstracts (with a second page allowed for references and/or
examples) should be submitted as e-mail attachments. Abstracts should be
submitted as Word (preferable) or PDF documents. Please embed any special fonts.
The body of the e-mail should contain the author's name, affiliation, e-mail
address, mailing address, and phone number. Each author may submit at most one
abstract as sole author and one jointly authored abstract.

Submit to: hispling@umn.edu

Abstract deadline: September 15, 2007
