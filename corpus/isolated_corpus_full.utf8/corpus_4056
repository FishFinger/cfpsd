~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CALL For Papers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special Issue on Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
International Journal of Computer Processing of Oriental Languages (IJCPOL)
World Scientific http://www.worldscinet.com/ijcpol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arabic is a Semitic language spoken by over 250 million people, in an
area extending from the Arabian Gulf in the east to the Atlantic Ocean
in the west. It is one of the six official languages of the United
Nations. It is also the language in which some of the world's greatest
works of literature, science, and history have been written.

Arabic is a strongly structured and highly derivational language.
Arabic language processing requires the treatment of the language
constituents at all levels. Each level requires extensive study and
exploitation of the associated linguistic characteristics. Over the
last few years, Arabic natural language processing (ANLP) has been
gaining increasing importance, and has found a wide range of
applications including: machine translation, information extraction,
and tutoring systems. These applications require developing innovative
approaches and techniques for natural language analysis, natural
language generation, and linguistic resources.

Various forums have been dedicated to ANLP:
=95 Special track on Natural Language Processing, The  International
Conference on Informatics and Systems (NLP-INFOS 2008), Cairo Univ.,
Egypt.
=95 Workshop on HLT & NLP within the Arabic world: Arabic Language and
local languages processing: Status Updates and Prospects, LREC, 2008
=95 Computational Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages, workshop
series (04, 07).
=95 International Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools
(NEMLAR 2004), Cairo Egypt,

This special issue of the International Journal of Computer Processing
of Oriental Languages is intended to present the state-of-the-art in
research on Arabic natural language processing, Arabic computational
linguistics, applied Arabic linguistics and related areas. This call
is intended to be as broad as possible. We solicit original research
papers on topics including, but not limited to:
=95 Linguistic resources (corpora, electronic dictionaries, treebanks, etc.)
=95 Transliteration, transcription and diacritization
=95 Part of speech tagging
=95 Morphological analysis and generation
=95 Shallow and deep parsing
=95 Machine translation
=95 Word sense and syntactic disambiguation
=95 Semantic analysis
=95 Information extraction and retrieval
=95 Question answering
=95 Text clustering, and classification
=95 Text summarization
=95 Text and web content  mining
=95 Named entity recognition
=95 Colloquial-based language processing

>>>>Important Dates <<<<<
=95 Submissions due for review: 15 Jan 2009
=95 Notification of 1st decision: 30 April 2009
=95 Revisions due: 30 May 2009
=95 Notification of acceptance: 30 June 2009
=95 Final version submitted: 15 July 2009
=95 Issue publication: 2010

>>>>>Submission Guidelines <<<<<
Submissions should be 3,000 to 7,500 words (counting a standard figure
or table as 200 words) and should follow the journal's style and
presentation guidelines (see

should be limited to 10 citations. To submit a manuscript, access the
Journal online submission system at
http://www.worldscinet.com/ijcpol/editorial/submitpaper.shtml.  In the
message to editors, please state clearly that the paper is submitted
to the special issue on Arabic NLP.  An electronic version of the
paper should also be submitted directly to the Guest Editor by e-mail
at the same time.
