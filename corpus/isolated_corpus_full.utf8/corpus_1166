Second Call for Papers

Fifteenth Manchester Phonology Meeting

24-26 May 2007

Deadline for abstracts: 1st March 2007

Conference website: www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/15mfm.html

Background

We are pleased to announce our Fifteenth Manchester Phonology Meeting  
(15mfm). The mfm is the UK's annual phonology conference, with an  
international set of organisers; it is held in late May every year in  
Manchester. The meeting has become a key conference for phonologists  
from all corners of the world, where anyone who declares themselves to  
be interested in phonology can submit an abstract on anything  
phonological in any phonological framework. In an informal atmosphere,  
we discuss a wide range of topics, including the phonological  
description of a wide variety of languages, issues in phonological  
theory, aspects of phonological acquisition and implications of  
phonological change.

Special Session

There is no conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on anything,  
but, following the success of such sessions in previous years, a  
special themed session has been organised, entitled 'Where is  
allomorphy?' This will feature invited speakers and conclude in an  
open discussion session when contributions from the audience will be  
very welcome. Abstracts which attempt to deal overtly with the issues  
involved with this (from any perspective) are certainly welcome.

Special Session Speakers (in alphabetical order)
- Ricardo Bermudez-Otero (University of Manchester)
- Mirjam Ernestus (Radboud Univeristy & Max Planck Institute, Nijmegen)
- John McCarthy (University of Massachusetts)
- Glyne Piggott (McGill University)

Abstract Submission

This is a summary - please consult the website for full details
www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/15mfm.html

- There is no obligatory conference theme - abstracts can be submitted  
on anything. Abstracts should be sent to Patrick Honeybone as  
attachments to an email (patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk) by 1st March 2007.

- Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm or one  
inch margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and  
with normal character spacing.

- Please send two copies of your abstract - one of these should be  
anonymous and one should include your name, affiliation and email  
address at the top of the page, directly below the title. All  
abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by members of the organising  
committee and advisory board.

- Please use one of these formats for your abstract: pdf, Word, or  
plain text. If you need to use a phonetic font in your abstract,  
either embed it in a pdf file, or use the Doulos SIL font

- Full papers will last around 25 minutes with around 5 minutes for  
questions, and there will be a high-profile poster session lasting one  
and a half hours. Please indicate whether you would prefer to present  
your work as an oral paper or a poster, or whether you would be  
prepared to present it in either form.

- If you need technical equipment for your talk, please say so in the  
message accompanying your abstract and we will do our best to provide  
it, although this cannot be guaranteed.
