Location: Batumi, Georgia 
Contact: Sergei Nirenburg 
Contact Email: sergei@umbc.edu 
Meeting URL: http://ilit.umbc.edu/ASI 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Meeting Description: 

The NATO-sponsored Advanced Study Institute on Advances in Language
Engineering fror Low- and Middle-Density Languages is devoted to the
development of computational language resources for languages for which
these resources are not available or are underdeveloped. Related research
and development is being carried out around the world and progress on one
language or group of languages can guide work on others. The Institute will
seek to facilitate new language engineering initiatives for additional
languages and to expose linguists and software engineers to a variety of
techniques and case studies.

Students, researchers and practitioners interested in the topic are welcome
to apply. Visit the ASI website (http://ilit.umbc.edu/ASI) for more
information on Financial Support and Eligibility. 

Second Call for Participation

Submission Deadline Extended till August 31, 2007

NATO Advanced Study Institute on
Advances in Language Engineering
for Low- and Middle-Density Languages

Batumi, Georgia
October 15-27, 2007

AIMS 

This Advanced Study Institute is devoted to the development of computational
language resources for languages for which these resources are not available or
are underdeveloped. Related research and development is being carried out around
the world and progress on one language or group of languages can guide work on
others. The Institute will seek to facilitate new language engineering
initiatives for additional languages and to expose linguists and software
engineers to a variety of techniques and case studies.

Structure

The Institute will include mini-courses, lectures, workshops, software
demonstrations and, possibly, a poster session and a panel discussion.

Target Audience

The Institute is geared toward students and practitioners of computational
linguistics, linguistics and computer science. 

Applications For Participation

If you would like to participate in the Institute, please submit the application
form available on the Institute's website: http://ilit.umbc.edu/ASI. Please pay
attention to eligibility conditions related to your country of citizenship. The
NEW deadline for application submissions is August 31, 2007. Selection of
participants will be carried out by the co-directors in consultation with the
lecturers.

Financial Support

The Institute has funds to offset the travel and living expenses of those
participants who do not have other sources of travel support. You can indicate
on the Application for Participation whether you would like to be considered for
financial support. If you are granted such support, you will be expected to
attend the full two weeks of the Institute.

Participation Options

Participants may:

-	Simply attend the ASI.
-	Attend the ASI and submit a proposal to do a system demonstration.
-	Attend the ASI + submit a paper to be considered for workshop presentation or
poster session.

See the Web site for details about submissions. All submissions will be reviewed
by a subset of the lecturers. Authors of outstanding papers may be invited to
contribute to a collection to be published after the Institute by IOS Press. The
program of the Institute will be made sufficiently flexible to accommodate any
accepted presentations, demos and posters.

Location

Batumi is a resort town on the Georgian Black Sea coast. You can find more about
it, for example, in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batumi
