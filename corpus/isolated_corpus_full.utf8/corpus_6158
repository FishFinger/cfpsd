The primary focus of this of this interdisciplinary workshop will be how to translate principles of neuroplasticity to aphasia rehabilitation. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of how the brain responds and recovers from injury and how re-training of skills may be optimised depending on a range of neurobiological and environmental factors. While much of this work has been carried out in animal models or with a focus on motor function, it has been proposed that significant benefits will result if the field of aphasia rehabilitation can harness and translate this new foundational knowledge in neuroplasticity. The governing principles of neuroplasticity may also provide a unifying framework for combining impairment based and social based approaches to aphasia rehabilitation.

Professor Leslie Gonzalez Rothi (University of Florida) is a leader in translating principles of neuroplasticity to aphasia and will give a keynote presentation around this theme. In addition to focusing on neuroplasticity, the workshop will focus on other future interdisciplinary directions in this field including interactions between speech pathology and social psychology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, neuroscience, and psychology.
Audience

It is expected that this workshop will be of interest to clinicians and researchers including speech pathologists, linguistics, cognitive neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists, social psychologists, speech scientists, computer scientists.
Event Format

The workshop will include a keynote address by Professor Gonzalez Rothi, papers on topics relevant to aphasia rehabilitation, group discussions, and a continuation of the Aphasia Forum held in 2008 which sought to identify future directions and priorities in aphasia research.
