Meeting Description:

The 2009 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration
(IEEE IRI-2009)
Sponsored by: The IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society
August 10-12, 2009
Tuscany Hotel, Las Vegas, USA

Call for Papers

Highlights:

- There will be new IRI Society (SIRI) Memberships and Awards.
- IEEE IRI 2009 will be held at Tuscany Hotel at an incredible rate of $45/night.
- The following Special/Featured Topic Issues have been approved to include
papers from IEEE IRI 2009

1. International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering
(http://ejournals.wspc.com.sg/ijseke/ijseke.shtml)
2. Informatica (http://www.informatica.si/)
3. International Transactions on Systems Science and Applications
(http://siwn.org.uk/itssa/)
4. International Journal of Information & Decision Sciences (IJIDS)
(http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=306)

The increasing volumes and dimensions of information have dramatic impact on
effective decision-making. To remedy this situation, Information Reuse and
Integration (IRI) seeks to maximize the reuse of information by creating simple,
rich, and reusable knowledge representations and consequently explores
strategies for integrating this knowledge into legacy systems. IRI plays a
pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration,
validation, and extrapolation of information; and applies both information and
knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains. This
conference explores three major tracks: information reuse, information
integration, and reusable systems. Information reuse considers optimizing
representation methodologies; information integration studies strategies for
creatively applying models in novel domains; and reusable systems focus on
ontological opportunities for deploying models and corresponding processes.

The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from
academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that
address real-world problems with real-world solutions. 

The conference features contributed and invited papers. Theoretical and applied
papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions,
open forum workshops, and keynote speeches. A forum will be conducted with the
intent of bridging IRI and Systems of Systems and why the future of intelligent
computing- including computing applications - will lie at the juxtaposition of
these two topical areas. There will be new IRI Society Memberships and Awards. The
conference includes, but is not limited to, the areas listed below:

- Large Scale Data and System Integration
- Component-Based Design and Reuse
- Unifying Data Models (UML, XML, etc.) and Ontologies

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
