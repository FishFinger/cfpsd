The aim of the present conference is to bring together researchers with a range
of views on humour and politics. The relation of humour and politics is
definitely not a straightforward one. The central question that could be raised
here is whether humour influences politics and shapes both political figures and
political acts. Furthermore, we would like to draw the attention on what
actually happens whenever humour occurs in political settings or is used to
refer to political affairs.

We welcome contributions on humour in:
political speeches
humour in political campaigning and political conferences
humour in parliamentary debates
humour and democracy
humour and leadership
military humour
humour in totalitarian societies
humour in wartime
political humour in the media
translation and political humour

In order to meet these objectives, the organizers invite contributions from 
both linguistic and related non-linguistic disciplines such as:
political studies
sociology
philosophy
media studies
cultural studies
psychology

The elaboration of joint methodological frameworks is strongly encouraged. 
Contributions from empirical studies are most welcome. There will be a special
panel on Humour, Politics & the Media.

The program of the conference will include plenary lectures, parallel sessions,
roundtable works and discussions. Further details concerning the program as well
as accommodation and registration will be available in the Second Circular on
http://www.lit.ugal.ro/. 

Submissions
The main conference sessions will involve 40 minute talks (30 minutes + 10
minutes for discussions) and poster presentations. Contributions can focus on
results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel
approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives. Presentations should describe
original, unpublished work. The number of submissions is restricted to one
single-authored submission and one submission in co-authorship. Selected papers
will appear in a printed volume.

Dissertation Session
We are hoping to hold a special session that will give students the chance to
present recent Ph D or MA dissertations. The dissertations must be completed by
the time of the conference. The talks in this session should provide an overview
of the main original points of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes,
followed by a 10-minute discussion time. 

Submission of Abstracts: 
deadline for submitting abstracts is May 30th, 2009. 
Abstracts of 350-500 words should be sent to politicalhumorconf-at-email.com . 
Acceptances will be sent out by June 15th, 2009. If you have any queries 
concerning submissions, please contact the organizers at the email address
indicated above.
Contributions will be accepted in English, French and Romanian.

Participation fee
ISHS member 35 EURO
Regular participant 45 EURO
