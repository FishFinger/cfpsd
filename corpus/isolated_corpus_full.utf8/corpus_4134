The PADTAD 2009 workshop is a two days event at ISSTA 2009 focusing on
techniques and systems that aid in the testing, analysis, and
debugging of multi-threaded/parallel/distributed applications
systems. The workshop has a practical and applied emphasis on systems
that have been implemented in (at least) prototype form. The workshop
concentrates on works whose main contributions are in the field of
testing, debugging, and education.

Although debuggers and profilers are the traditional examples of
testing and debugging tools on sequential machines, there are issues
unique to concurrent systems that are not commonly addressed. Examples
of such significant challenges include deadlock, load imbalance, data
sharing patterns, race conditions, and contention. Established testing
techniques and tools are insufficient for non-sequential programs
because they largely ignore timing and scheduling which are inherent
in concurrent systems.  Beyond the shortcomings on current tools and
technologies, the rising generating of programmers and designers need
to be more versed in concurrent systems design and programming.

Education and curriculum are critical to fully realizing the full
potential of multi-core technology as we need to begin training now
the students who will make multi-core happen in a large scale.  As
such, we strongly encourage abstracts and regular papers devoted to
education and curriculum at all levels including pedagogy, exercises,
projects, experience reports, etc.

Following is a broad list of topics of interest to the workshop:

	* Curriculum and education for multi-core design, programming,
       testing, and analysis
     * Techniques for multi-core processors
     * Techniques for MPI and OpenMP or other library based
       applications
     * Transactional memory
     * Tools for testing or debugging of
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Test generation algorithms for
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Debugging advanced network interface technologies (e.g.,
       Myrinet, VIA)
     * Debugging and testing Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed
       applications
     * Testing and Debugging of
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications written
       using domain-specific languages
     * Using static analysis or formal verification to enhance
       debugging and testing of
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Formal specification of concurrency libraries, and uses in
       compliance testing of implementations
     * Detecting race conditions and deadlocks
     * Replay of Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Finding timing bugs early in the process
     * Testing real-time Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed
       applications
     * Fault injection of Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed
       applications
     * Testing the fault tolerance of
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Testing and debugging techniques for timing related bugs in
       hardware
     * Pilots in applying new testing techniques to
       Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed applications
     * Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed review techniques and
       review tools
     * Teaching of Multi-threaded/Parallel/Distributed system
       design, verification and testing

Accepted papers, as well as education session abstracts, will be
published in a CD-ROM proceedings and will be included in the ACM
Digital Library.

Intel=AE's Threading Building Blocks - a Shared Memory Parallel
Programming Library By Arch Robison, Senior Principal Engineer, Intel
Corporation

This tutorial is an introduction to Intel's Threading Building Blocks
(Intel's TBB), a commercially supported open-source C++ template
library for shared-memory parallel programming, notably for multi-core
processors. Though threads are a popular means of shared-memory
parallel programming, they are a low-level unstructured construct
whose undisciplined use can cause both correctness and performance
problems. This tutorial explains these problems and how TBB addresses
them, without resorting to special compilers or languages. The
tutorial will explain the architecture of TBB, its motivation, and how
to effectively apply TBB to problems by using parallel generic
programming. Attendees will get some hands on experience with TBB
