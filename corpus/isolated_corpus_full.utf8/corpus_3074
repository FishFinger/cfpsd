Meeting Description:

Conference Themes:
Since 1992, the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)
has successfully brought together leading researchers and developers from the
database, information retrieval, and knowledge management communities. The
purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the
development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future
research directions through the publication of high quality, applied and
theoretical research findings.

Industry Day:
As CIKM 2008 will be held in Napa Valley, just one hour to the north of San
Francisco, one of the goals of the conference is to embrace the innovative
spirit of the Bay Area/Silicon Valley in bridging further the
academic-commercial gap in the database, information retrieval, and knowledge
management communities. To help achieve this goal, we will have a series of
invited speakers and an industry day (separate from the industry research track)
where luminaries, primarily from industry and from the VC (Venture Capital)
community, will provide insights on how DB/IR/KM technologies are/can be
leveraged to make a billion-dollar success.

In CIKM 2008, we will continue the tradition of promoting collaboration among
multiple areas. We encourage submissions of high quality papers on all topics in
the general areas of databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management.
Papers that bridge across these areas are of special interest and will be
considered for a ''Best Interdisciplinary Paper'' award.
