             CALL FOR PAPERS, POSTERS AND DEMOS

====================================================================

      Workshop on Collaborative Construction, Management
            and Linking of Structured Knowledge

                   October 25, 2009
       
               Collocated with ISWC-2009
      Westfields Conference Center, near Washington, DC., USA
   
      Paper submission: August 10, 2009  (13 days from today)

      http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/gc3/iswc-workshop/

====================================================================

Objectives
-----------

Many have argued that the next generation of the Web (Web 3.0) will grow 
out of an integration between Semantic Web and Social Web (Web 2.0) 
technologies.Can ontology management benefits from social web? Can 
Wikipidia be a style of collaborative ontology authoring? How to exploit 
user feedback for constructing structured knowledge? In these and many 
other questions lie the opportunity and the challenge to integrate 
knowledge bases approaches to social web ones. This integration involves 
several very different aspects of technology and social practice. Recent 
workshops and journal special issues have been devoted to methods for 
extracting ontologies and other structured knowledge from resources such 
as Wikipedia and other loosely structured data; or on using Semantic Web 
representations to describe the social structures and interactions in 
Web 2.0; or on mapping existing data using semantic technologies. In 
this workshop, we want to focus on another aspect of linkage between 
Social Web and Semantic Web techniques:  collaborative and distributed 
methods for constructing and maintaining ontologies, terminologies, 
vocabularies, and mappings between them, throughout their entire life cycle.


Topics of interest
-------------------

They include (but are not limited to):
- Collaborative creation and editing of structured knowledge
- Collaborative creation of ontology mappings
- Efficient methods for maintenance and evolution of structured 
knowledge that was created collaboratively
- Individual and group incentives for collaborative knowledge 
construction and maintenance
- Ontology repositories, knowledge bases, and their utility in the 
Social Web.
- Metadata management
- User interfaces for collaborative tools for creating structured knowledge
- Inconsistency management and user-specific views of ontologies
- Workflows for collaborative construction and linking of structured 
knowledge
- Evaluation of collaborative tools: methods, metrics, and experimental 
reports


Submission guidelines
---------------------

Papers submitted to the workshop must follow the same submission 
guidelines of the ISWC'09 conference. Submissions must be in PDF format 
in Springer format (for instruction see 
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-2-72376-0)
We solicit in this workshop two types of contributions:

1. Research papers analysing the process of collaborative construction, 
management and linkage of structured knowledge; the requirements for 
supporting technologies and the field of exploitation of such knowledge. 
Formatted papers must not be longer than 10 pages.

2. Demos papers describing relevant tools and prototypes. Formatted 
papers must not be longer than 2 pages.


Important dates
----------------

Paper submission: 10 August 2009
Notification : 31 August 2009
Workshop : 25 October 2009
