Meeting Description

Cognitive and Functional Perspectives on Dynamic Tendencies in Languages

The aim of the conference is to bring together linguists working in the
functional and cognitive linguistic paradigms. We invite linguists who take a
functional and/or cognitive perspective in describing and explaining linguistic
phenomena in the language(s) they are researching and those working on language
dynamics from a functional or cognitive perspective to participate.
We especially encourage linguists working on the Uralic languages to submit
papers, in the hope of expanding the Cognitive Linguistic paradigm with data
from these languages; researchers involved with other languages and language
families are, of course, also most welcome. We also encourage papers on
grammaticalization and those looking at the role of oral and written forms, or
different language varieties, in language change, as well as changes in grammar
resulting from language contact. Furthermore, presentations dealing with
different usage-based models, including construction grammar, are also welcome.

Keywords

cognitive and functional studies on grammar
grammaticalization
dynamics of language
synchronic and diachronic language change
language contact: aspects of grammar
usage-based approaches and models
emergent grammar
language typology
language evolution
Uralic languages

Meeting Description

TaLC 8
8th Teaching and Language Corpora 
Instituto Superior de Línguas e Administração (ISLA), Lisbon

3 July 2008 (pre-conference tutorials and workshops)
4-6 July 2008 (main conference)

Following the previous seven and highly successful TaLC conferences in Lancaster
(1994 and 1996), Oxford (1998), Graz (2000), Bertinoro (2002), Granada (2004)
and Paris (2006), the 8th international Teaching and Language Corpora conference
(TaLC 8) will bring together practitioners and theorists with a common interest
in the use of corpora for:

- first and second language teaching and learning
- language awareness raising
- teaching languages for specific purposes
- student-centered linguistic investigation
- interpreting and translation studies
- cultural and historical studies
- teaching literature
- developing pedagogic grammars and learner dictionaries 

TaLC 8
8th Teaching and Language Corpora 
Instituto Superior de Línguas e Administração (ISLA), Lisbon

3 July 2008 (pre-conference tutorials and workshops)
4-6 July 2008 (main conference)

TaLC 8 invites proposals for position papers, reports of work in progress,
case-histories of successful corpus applications, and introductions to relevant
new resources. Proposals may be for 20-minute papers or posters or software
demonstrations.

We also welcome proposals for pre-conference tutorials and workshops. This year,
we would particularly like this to include hands-on workshops on the use of
corpora to teach specific languages, especially English, French, German,
Portuguese and Spanish.

The official language of the main conference is English.
Language-specific pre-conference workshops should be presented in the
language being focused on.

Proposals for papers, posters and software demos should be sent before
15 February 2008. Pre-conference tutorials and workshop proposals
should be sent before 31 January 2008.

All proposals will be blind reviewed. Authors of those accepted for inclusion
will be notified by 30 April.
