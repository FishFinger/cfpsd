2ND CALL FOR PAPERS
=20
RANLP-07 WORKSHOP ON ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF MULTILINGUAL LEXICONS
=20
Sponsored by Expert System Inc. (http://www.expertsystem.net/)
Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (ACL-SIGLEX)
=20
Borovetz, Bulgaria
September 30, 2007=20
=20
Workshop site:
http://www.wlv.ac.uk/~in8113/amml07/=20
=20
AIMS=20
=20
The current trend of information exchange on the Internet to become ever
more multilingual has stimulated new important developments in the field
of multilingual NLP. The present workshop is concerned with the problem
of automatic management of lexical resources, which lie at the heart of
many multilingual technologies.=20
=20
Recently there has been an increased interest in the automated discovery
of equivalent expressions in different languages. New interesting
directions have sprung up, such as the use of the Web and comparable
corpora for this task, and new kinds of lexical phenomena, such as
multiword expressions and named entities, have come into focus.=20
=20
This workshop will bring together researchers working on a broad range
of problems related to the management of multilingual lexical resources
- their acquisition, maintenance, customization, and re-use. The scope
of the workshop includes evaluation of multilingual lexicons intended
for a broad range of applications: from personalized glossaries for a
translation project to large-scale machine-readable dictionaries and
databases.=20
=20

TOPICS=20
=20
Specific topics of interest for the proposed workshop are:=20
=20
* Acquisition of lexical knowledge from parallel and comparable corpora,
and from the Web=20
* Porting, merging and domain customisation of existing lexical
resources using NLP technologies=20
* Acquisition of domain terminology=20
* Acquisition of multi-word expressions=20
* Acquisition of translations for polysemous words=20
* Acquisition of multilingual lexical taxonomies=20
* Named Entity transliteration=20
* Acquisition of cognates and loanwords=20
* Extraction of equivalent phrases and sentences from comparable corpora

* Applications of multilingual lexicons and their evaluation within:=20
      - Statistical Machine Translation=20
      - Computer-Aided Translation=20
      - Information Retrieval (Question Answering, Text Retrieval, Text
Classification and Clustering)=20
      - Knowledge Management=20
=20

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS=20
=20
* Format. Authors are invited to submit full papers on original,
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should be
submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007
stylefiles and not exceeding 8 pages. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are
available at:=20
=20
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm=20
=20

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review.=20
=20
* Submission procedure. Submission of papers will be handled using the
START system. Specific submission guidelines will be posted on the
workshop site shortly.=20
=20

the Program Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed
comments, and to score submitted papers on the following factors:=20
      - Relevance to the workshop=20
      - Significance and originality=20
      - Technical/methodological accuracy=20
      - References to related work=20
      - Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)=20
=20
* Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the authors
agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at least one
of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop participants are
expected to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration fee.=20
