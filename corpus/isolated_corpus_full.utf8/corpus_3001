Call for Papers 

The Second ISLOJ
International Symposium on the Languages of Java
4-5 June 2009 
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, Senggigi, Lombok, Indonesia

Keynote Speakers: 
Dr. Thomas Hunter: The interaction of irrealis with the symmetrical voice system
of Old Javanese. 
A speaker on Sasak: TBA

The island of Java is home to several major languages. Javanese -- spoken mainly
in Central and East Java -- is the world's 10th or 11th largest language in
number of native speakers; has one of the oldest and fullest recorded histories
of any Austronesian language; and has the most fully articulated phenomenon of
speech levels of any language. Sundanese -- spoken in West Java -- has over 27
million speakers, and Madurese -- spoken on the neighboring island of Madura and
throughout parts of East Java -- has over 13 million speakers. The speech level
system is shared by the geographically, historically, and linguistically related
languages on the neighboring islands of Bali and Lombok. Each of these languages
displays a range of dialects, isolects, continua, and contact varieties and yet
they have received relatively little attention from linguists. With this
symposium, we offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect of
Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese, Balinese and Sasak to come together and share
their findings.  

Abstracts are invited for papers to be presented on any linguistic topics
dealing with the languages of Java--broadly understood: Javanese, Sundanese,
Madurese, Balinese and Sasak. Given the location of the conference, papers on
Sasak are especially encouraged. Papers on other languages will be judged
according to their relevance to the symposium topic.  Papers are welcome from
any subfield of linguistics and from any approach or theoretical background.
Studies of non-standard(ized) versions, dialects, and isolects, including
contact varieties are particularly welcome. All papers are to be presented in
English.

Persons wishing to present papers at the symposium are invited to submit a
one-page abstract in electronic from (PDF or MSWord) to Thomas Conners at the
following address: oranghutan@cbn.net.id

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2009

Please note that the 13th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian
Linguistics (ISMIL 13) will be held immediately following ISLOJ, also at the
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, on 6-7 June, 2009. For more info:
