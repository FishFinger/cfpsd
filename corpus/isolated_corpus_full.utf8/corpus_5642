CALL FOR PAPERS
4th International Workshop on Semantic Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP 2009)
December 14-15, 2009
San Sebastian, Spain
http://www.smap2009.org
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CALL FOR PAPERS*
-----------------
The Semantic Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP) Initiative was founded during the summer of 2006 in an effort to discuss the state of the art, recent advances and future perspectives for semantic media adaptation. After three successful workshops, SMAP 2006 (Athens, Greece), SMAP 2007 (London, United Kingdom), and SMAP 2008 (Prague, Czech Republic) the Semantic Media Adaptation and Personalization workshop series has consolidated as a reference event in order to discuss about the newest advances in the field, including a 2-days main track of high-quality scientific papers. Thus, the 4th SMAP workshop 
   * will be held in San Sebastian, Spain
   * will be hosted by VICOMTech-IK4 Applied Research Centre (http://www.vicomtech.org)
   * will take place on Monday and Tuesday, December 14th and 15th, 2009.

We strive to have a diverse academic audience, varying from young researchers working on PhD level to experts in the field. The workshop aims to provide a platform for exchanging fresh ideas and expertise, and for obtaining feedback on ongoing research. As with previous SMAPs, plans are in place to have all the papers presented at the workshop published by the IEEE Computer Society and selected papers to appear either in an edited volume or in a special journal issue.


*WORKSHOP TOPICS*
-----------------
SMAP 2009 will aim to address several issues of semantic multimedia technologies in multilingual environments such as, but not limited to:
    * Semantic content creation and modelling
    * Semantic-driven multimedia indexing and retrieval
    * Multimedia ontologies, reasoning and Semantic Web adaptation technologies
    * Content customization and adaptation
    * Multilingual content navigation
    * Social multimedia tagging and multimedia content communities
    * Multimedia content annotation tools
    * Intelligent search, content retrieval and filtering
    * User modelling, intelligent personalized interfaces and dynamic profiling
    * Multimedia and open standards
    * Semantic context modelling and extraction
    * Context-aware multimedia applications
    * and so on


*WHO CAN PARTICIPATE*
---------------------
The 2009 Workshop aims not only to bring back together the researchers and practitioners from 2006, 2007 and 2008, but also to welcome new ones in order to explore recent and emerging developments in the field of semantic media adaptation and personalization, building on the achievements of the previous Workshops. Specifically, SMAP 2009 will consolidate any prior efforts to advance beyond a workshop meeting to a focused meeting of a society of researchers and practitioners.


*IMPORTANT DATES*
-----------------
Submission of full papers:                                    *July 24, 2009* 
Notification of acceptance/rejection:                          August 17, 2009 
Submission of camera-ready papers and author registration:     September 8, 2009
