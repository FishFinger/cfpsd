Meeting Description:

RANLP 2009 Workshop on Partial Parsing 2: Between Chunking and Deep Parsing

Motivation:

After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are happy to
announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a standard means of
integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as
information retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which
efficiency and robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and
deep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer
than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses:
partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple
chunking) without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial
parsing is not a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to
almost full parsing. This workshop will bring together researchers who work
on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Scope:

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted to):

- Linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: syntactic
and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical structure, semantic
information (anaphora, disambiguation);
- Development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine learning,
hybrid;
- The usability of language resources for the development of partial
parsers;
- Multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;
- Experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers
for new languages;
- Technical aspects of partial parsers: robustness, scalability; time and
space complexity; expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs.
context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);
- Applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question
answering, machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical
information, etc.;
- Evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different
partial parsing tasks, etc.;
- Ways of combining multiple partial parsers;
- Comparison (classification) of partial parsers.
