Meeting Description:

Distributional Lexical Semantics:
Bridging the gap between semantic theory and computational simulations
Workshop at ESSLLI 2008, Hamburg, August 4-9 2008 

Final Call for Papers

Workshop at ESSLLI 2008, Hamburg, August 4-9 2008

Background and Motivation

Corpus-based distributional models (such as LSA or HAL) have been claimed to capture interesting aspects of word meaning and provide an explanation for the rapid acquisition of semantic knowledge by human language learners. However, although these models have been proposed as plausible simulations of human semantic space organization, careful and extensive empirical tests of such claims are still lacking.

Systematic evaluations typically focus on large-scale quantitative tasks, often more oriented towards engineering applications (see, e.g., the recent SEMEVAL evaluation campaign) than towards the challenges posed by linguistic theory, philosophy and cognitive science. This has resulted in a great divide between corpus-driven computational approaches to semantics on the one hand and theory-driven symbolic approaches on the other - a situation that is characteristic of the linguistic and of most of the cognitive
tradition. Moreover, whereas human lexical semantic competence is obviously multi-faceted -- ranging from free association to taxonomic judgments to relational effects -- tests of distributional models tend to focus on a single aspect (most typically the detection of semantic similarity), and few if any models have been tuned to tackle different facets of semantics in an integrated manner.

Our workshop purports to fill these gaps by inviting research teams and individual scholars to test their computational models on a variety of small but carefully designed tasks that aim to bring out linguistically and cognitively interesting aspects of semantics (see below for details). To this effect, annotated datasets are available on the workshop page: http://wordspace.collocations.de/doku.php/data:start. Participants are encouraged to explore them and highlight interesting aspects of their models' performance, conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis, etc.

Tasks and Data Sets

Small annotated data sets are available on the workshop page. Participants are invited to apply their computational models and conduct a thorough analysis of the results. The goal is not to achieve better precision than competitors, but to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, analyze and explain errors, etc. Theoretical discussions of the data sets from a linguistic or cognitive perspective are also invited and will complement the empirical findings.

Ongoing work on data set preparation can be monitored at http://wordspace.collocations.de/doku.php/data:start. The workshop wiki is intended to provide a forum to discuss the organization of the tasks.

We offer the following tasks:
Categorization:
- concrete nouns categorization
- abstract/concrete nouns discrimination
- verb categorization

Modelling free association:
- correlation with free association norms

Generation of salient properties of concepts:
- comparison with speaker-generated features

Important Dates:
- April 4, 2008: Paper submission deadline
- April 24, 2008: Notification
- August 4-9, 2008: Workshop in Hamburg (during the first week of ESSLLI)

Paper Submission Instructions:
We welcome papers reporting results of experimenting with word space models on one or more workshop tasks, as well as comparing different models on the same task(s). Authors are asked to carry out their own evaluation, using if possible the tools provided on the website.

We also welcome papers focussing on:
- methodological and theoretical issues concerning word space models;
- open challenges for distributional methods for semantic analysis;
- interactions with formal approaches to meaning;
- interactions with cognitive research on human semantic memory.

The papers should not be longer than 8 pages, and they should be submitted
anonymously in PDF format following the ACL2008 stylesheet.

Submission must be sent to lexsem08@gmail.com, no later than April 4, specifying 'paper submission' in the subject and the authors' names
and affiliation in the message body.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
