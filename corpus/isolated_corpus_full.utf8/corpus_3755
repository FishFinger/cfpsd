Final Call for Papers

3rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE AND AUTOMATA THEORY AND
APPLICATIONS (LATA 2009)

Tarragona, Spain, April 2-8, 2009

http://grammars.grlmc.com/LATA2009/

*********************************************************************

AIMS:

LATA is a yearly conference in theoretical computer science and its
applications. As linked to the International PhD School in Formal
Languages and Applications that was developed at the host institute in
the period 2002-2006, LATA 2009 will reserve significant room for
young scholars at the beginning of their career. It will aim at
attracting contributions from both classical theory fields and
application areas (bioinformatics, systems biology, language
technology, artificial intelligence, etc.).

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

- algebraic language theory
- algorithms on automata and words
- automata and logic
- automata for system analysis and programme verification
- automata, concurrency and Petri nets
- biomolecular nanotechnology
- cellular automata
- circuits and networks
- combinatorics on words
- computability
- computational, descriptional, communication and parameterized
  complexity
- data and image compression
- decidability questions on words and languages
- digital libraries
- DNA and other models of bio-inspired computing
- document engineering
- extended automata
- foundations of finite-state technology
- fuzzy and rough languages
- grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, multidimensional,
  unification, categorial, etc.)
- grammars and automata architectures
- grammatical inference and algorithmic learning
- graphs and graph transformation
- language varieties and semigroups
- language-based cryptography
- language-theoretic foundations of natural language processing,
  artificial intelligence and artificial life
- mathematical evolutionary genomics
- parsing
- patterns and codes
- power series
- quantum, chemical and optical computing
- regulated rewriting
- string and combinatorial issues in computational biology and
  bioinformatics
- symbolic dynamics
- symbolic neural networks
- term rewriting
- text algorithms
- text retrieval, pattern matching and pattern recognition
- transducers
- trees, tree languages and tree machines
- weighted machines

STRUCTURE:

LATA 2009 will consist of:

- 3 invited talks
- 2 invited tutorials
- refereed contributions
- open sessions for discussion in specific subfields or on
  professional issues (if requested by the participants)

Invited speakers will be:

Bruno Courcelle (Bordeaux): Graph Structure and Monadic Second-order
Logic (tutorial)
Markus Holzer (Muenchen): Nondeterministic Finite Automata: Recent
Developments (tutorial)
Sanjay Jain (Singapore): Role of Hypothesis Spaces in Inductive

SUBMISSIONS:

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and
unpublished research. Papers should not exceed 12 single-spaced pages
and should be formatted according to the standard format for Springer
Verlag's LNCS series (see
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors?SGWID=3D0-40209-0-0-0)..=
 Submissions

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlata2009

PUBLICATIONS:

A volume of proceedings published by Springer in the LNCS series will
be available by the time of the conference.

Two special issues of the journals Information and Computation
(Elsevier, 2007 impact factor: 0.983) and Journal of Logic and
Computation (Oxford University Press, 2007 impact factor: 0.821)
containing extended versions of selected papers will be published
after the conference.

As well, a post-conference volume will be published in the series
Studies in Computational Intelligence (Springer) containing extended
versions of the papers on subjects closest to the series' scope.

REGISTRATION:

The period for registration will be open since September 1, 2008 to
April 2, 2009. The registration form can be found at the website of
the conference: http://grammars.grlmc.com/LATA2009/
