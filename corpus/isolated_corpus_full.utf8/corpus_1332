Subject: Editor Jeremy Taylor on Resource Accessibility 
 


Dear Subscribers,

My name is Jeremy Taylor. I am an editor for conference calls and announcements. 
I correspond daily with conference organizers from around the world to ensure 
conference information is up-to-date and accessible to all. I routinely add 
requested changes such as start dates and registration deadline reminders to our 
online database. I am also working with a team of fellow LINGUIST crew members 
to improve the conference submission user-interface by making it more intuitive, 
efficient, and speedy. 

I enjoy the opportunity to work for LINGUIST because I believe that the more 
easily we can make resources accessible to all of you linguists around the world, 
the faster and stronger the discipline of linguistics itself will grow and 
develop. So I am personally pleased that I can play a small part in that growth. 

Of course, all of you also play a part in this endeavor because your annual 
donations help support graduate students like me in running the LINGUIST List! 
You are ensuring the continuation of this great free resource and also enabling 
students to have an exceptionally valuable learning experience in their chosen 
field. So my thanks to all of you for your donations to Fund Drive 2007! Don't 
forget to look below to find out how many calls were posted this year in your 
subfield.

Jeremy Taylor
LINGUIST Editor

Subject: Calls & Confs: The Facts 

	

Dear Subscribers,

No matter what your area of expertise or interest may be, we offer detailed 
conference announcements to connect you with fellow scholars all across the 
world. Our Calls and Conferences area already contains nearly 200 conference 
announcements and calls for papers for 2007 alone. Conference announcements and 
calls for papers for 2008 are already up and viewable as well. Most conferences 
deal with multiple topics, so a variety of scholars can submit papers and share 
the most cutting-edge information.

For the years 2007 and 2008, the following list shows just how many conferences 
per linguistic subfield we currently have for you to choose from in our database:

20 	Anthropological Linguistics 
81 	Applied Linguistics
33 	Cognitive Science 
76 	Computational Linguistics
3 	Discipline of Linguistics
44 	Discourse Analysis 
2 	Forensic Linguistics 
100+ 	General Linguistics
40 	Historical Linguistics
5 	History of Linguistics
41 	Language Acquisition 
10 	Language Description 
13 	Lexicography 
20 	Linguistics and Literature
19	Linguistic Theories
15 	Morphology
7	Neurolinguistics
4	Philosophy of Language
19	Phonetics
27	Phonology
36	Pragmatics
19	Psycholinguistics
50	Semantics
60	Sociolinguistics
35	Syntax
34	Text/Corpus Linguistics
17	Translation
19	Typology
3	Writing Systems

Within the Calls & Conferences facility, you can submit a conference announcement, 
or a call for papers, or the program for an existing conference. Posting 
conferences, programs, and calls on LINGUIST is a free and highly efficient means 
of reaching potential participants anywhere in the world about your activities. 
After assuring that all crucial information is provided, your posting will be 
emailed to over 26,000 linguists who currently subscribe to have these important 
notices sent to them. You can also search through all past and current conferences 
by a combination of topic, date, language, title, or location. Once you find a 
conference you are interested in, you can view detailed program information and 
the call for papers that includes instructions on how to submit your paper. 

The following link will take you to the Calls & Conferences facility:

http://www.linguistlist.org/callconf/index.html 

It is our goal that these free public services will continue to promote 
interconnections within the global linguistics community and contribute to the 
growth of linguistics as a mature discipline. However, we rely crucially on your 
support each year during our Annual Fund Drive. By contributing a donation, no 
matter how small, you enable us?and especially our graduate students?to continue 
working to provide you these valuable services. We are very grateful for your 
support and always welcome comments you may have to improve our services. Thank 
you for taking the time today to participate in our goals!

Sincerely,
The LINGUIST Crew

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
