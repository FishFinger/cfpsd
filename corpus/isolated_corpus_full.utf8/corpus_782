Full Title: Journal of Universal Language 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics;None 

Call Deadline: 30-Jan-2007 

The First Call for the Journal of Universal Language (8:1) 

Honorarium: 
As a token of our gratitude, the contributors will be awarded the $500
honorarium (which is subject to taxation). 

The Journal of Universal Language provides a forum for discussions of
theoretical or practical research that pays close attention to language
usage, so as to provide a channel of communication between researchers of
various viewpoints. The primary aim of the journal is to encourage work
that makes people recognize the importance of the better communication tool
to those unfamiliar with linguistic knowledge, as well as work that makes
the complex nature of language more accessible to those working outside the
linguistic framework under review. 

The journal is structured to include:
- work on artificial language, communication & culture in language usage,
typology, and universality in language;
- interdisciplinary contributions written with applied linguists in mind;
- brief notes, comments or observation concerning official languages;
- reaction/replies to recent papers;
- book reviews of important linguistic titles;
- letters to the editors.
