Meeting Description:

Call for Papers - VALS-ASLA Conference 2008 
Changing societies: methodological challenges for applied linguistics

Lugano, USI, Facoltà di Scienze della comunicazione 
7-9 February 2008

At a time when societal changes such as the globalisation of spaces, the
circulation of goods, the mobility of individuals, and the spread of new
technologies occupy increased importance in the spheres of social life
(economic, political, educational), questions arise as to the impact of such
changes on linguistic practices, thus presenting a central challenge to the
field of applied linguistics.

The ever increasing mobility of people and circulation of goods in a globalised
marketplace trigger new language needs and practices. Consequently, new
realities are emerging from the contact between contemporary forms of language
and culture, which are tied to migration and trade, as well as computer-mediated
communication practices. The field of applied linguistics is confronted with
these phenomena today, which constitute methodological challenges for our
discipline and raise fundamental questions about our research practices. 

The VALS-ASLA conference aims to interrogate these ongoing changes by focusing
specifically on concomitant methodological challenges. In this regard, we invite
all interested scholars to submit papers and panel proposals related to the
following domains: 

- Teaching and learning of languages; 
- Globalisation and multilingualism;
- Migration, transnationalism and language practices;
- Languages at work;
- Transfer of knowledge.
