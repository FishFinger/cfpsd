Final Call For Papers

Deadline Extended!!  

Scope 
PACLING will be a low-profile, high-quality, workshop-oriented meeting whose aim
is to promote friendly scientific relations among Pacific Rim countries, with
emphasis on interdisciplinary scientific exchange demonstrating openness towards
original, fresh, and/or useful research including those which might sometimes
fall outside current dominant "school of thought", and technological transfer
within Pacific region. The conference is smaller than ACL, COLING, or IJCNLP,
but opens the door to the Global as well as the Pacific. 

Topics
Substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any topics in
computational linguistics, including, but not limited to, the following: 
- Phonology and Phonetics 
- Morphology and Morphological Analysis 
- Syntax and Syntactic Analysis 
- Semantics and Semantic Analysis 
- Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis 
- Spoken Language and Dialogue 
- Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing 
- Text and Message Understanding 
- Text and Message Generation 
- Machine Translation 
- Text Summarization 
- Information Extraction and Text Mining 
- Information Retrieval and Question-Answering 
- Language Learning 
- Natural Language Interfaces 
- Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontology 
- Semantic Web 
- Semantic Computation 

In addition to these topics on general computational linguistics, Pacling2009
will also have a workshop to discuss the challenging theme below: 
Language and Human Mind.

This theme covers research areas of modeling a human mind in terms of natural,
efficient and sympathetic communication between humans and computers, i.e.
user-model-based  communication systems, emotional and affective expressions
comprehension, understanding of other person's mind, etc. 

Moreover, two invited speakers will also give the following speeches:
"Language and Thought - the Case of Japanese"
Hideyuki Nakashima (President, Future University Hakodate),

"Mapping Language to Knowledge"
Junichi Tsujii (University of Tokyo & University of Manchester).

Camera-ready copy due: Jul 7, 2009

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
