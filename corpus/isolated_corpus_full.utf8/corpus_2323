joint National Research Project 'Levels of Analysis in the History of
Indo-European Languages', co-funded by the Italian Ministry of University

languages in one or more of the following areas:

Meeting Description:

Language Disorders in Greek

to take place on May 31st to June 1st 2008, at the Department of Speech and
Language Therapy of the Technological Educational Institute of Patras, Greece.

Taking into consideration the ongoing research on impaired language and its
implications for what we know about language and the brain, as well as
research on Greek in particular, the aim of this conference is to bring
together current research on Greek as a result of language disorder(s).
Both theoretical and experimental research is welcome on any topic of
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, or pragmatics.  
Special emphasis is given on comparative work, either between Greek and
some other language(s), or on bilingualism/multilingualism when one of the
languages is Greek.   

This year's meeting will give priority to Developmental Language Disorders 
(although work on other disorders, as well as on early language, will also
be considered). 

We are accepting abstracts for oral or poster presentations. Oral
presentations will last 30 min with an additional 10 min question period.
Abstracts should be one page long with at least an one-inch margin on all
sides and must employ a font no smaller than 12 point. A second page may
contain graphs or references. Abstracts should be sent electronically, in
Word or Pdf format, to: disordersingreek@teipat.gr

Conference date: May 31st - June 1st, 2008
Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2008
