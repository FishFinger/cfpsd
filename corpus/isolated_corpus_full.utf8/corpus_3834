ACL 2009 Student Research Workshop

Call for Papers
1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants
will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience
as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers
who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to
the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask
for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by
an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop
will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come
from any topic area within computational linguistics including, but
not limited to, the following topic areas:

  * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
  * phonetics, phonology and morphology
  * linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
  * information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
  * summarization and paraphrasing
  * speech recognition, speech synthesis
  * corpus-based language modeling
  * multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
  * spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
  * multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
  * message and narrative understanding systems

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished research.
The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who
have settled on their thesis direction but still have significant
research left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange
ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for
further development of the work, papers should clearly indicate
directions for future research wherever appropriate. All authors of
multi-author papers MUST be students. Papers submitted for this
workshop are eligible only if they have not been presented at any
other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Students
who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research
Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their
papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper
has been submitted to another conference or workshop.

3. Important Dates:

  Paper submission deadline: February 22, 2009
  Notification of acceptance: April 12, 2009
  Camera-ready submission deadline: May 17, 2009
  Conference dates: August 2-7, 2009 (run concurrently with the main
conference)

4. Funding for Travel

In previous years the Student Research Workshop has secured funding to
assist
participants with travel and conference expenses.  We will be applying
for such
funding again this year, and sincerely hope that financial constraints
do not
prevent any students from submitting their work.

5. Contact Information
