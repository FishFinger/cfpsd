23rd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC-2008)
Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil
March 16-20, 2008

Natural language processing and speech recognition (NLSP) track
http://sac08nlsp.googlepages.com

Access to textual information available in electronic form has become
widespread, with the potential of improving the lives of millions of
people worldwide. Gradually, people with diverse background and
interests become avid consumers as well as contributors of textual and
speech data, as they communicate through email, share their
experiences with others through blogs, try to keep up to date by
following the most prominent recent news, or search for relevant
information on a seemingly-infinite number of topics by using their
preferred Web search engines. For the benefit of these and many other
applications, accurate and scalable techniques are necessary to
process large amounts of written and spoken text. The track welcomes
submissions in the general area of natural language processing and
speech recognition, whether oriented towards building tools,
assembling and exploiting linguistic resources or pushing the state of
the art in various applications; topics of interest include, but are
not limited to:
- tagging
- parsing
- word sense disambiguation
- spoken language recognition
- knowledge acquisition
- text summarization
- information retrieval
- question answering
- machine translation
- natural language interfaces
- information extraction

Details regarding the submission requirements and procedure, as well
as formatting templates, are available along with other relevant
materials on the main symposium Web site at
http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2008 . In particular, initial
submissions cannot exceed 5 pages and must be submitted through the
symposium submission system at
http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2008/SubmitAbstract.aspx . Papers submitted
through any other means, or otherwise not following the submission
guidelines, will be rejected without review.
