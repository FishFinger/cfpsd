The  Konferenz  zur  Verarbeitung  natürlicher  Sprache  (''conference  on  natural  language  processing'', KONVENS), held in a two year rotation since 1992, is organized by the scientific societies DEGA, DGfS, GI, GLDV, ITG and ÖGAI.

The conference will take place at the BBAW from September 30th through October 2nd, 2008. 
 
The central theme of the Konvens 2008 will be text resources and lexical  knowledge. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

- Techniques, tools, and models from the field of computational linguistics dealing with digitization, linguistic annotation (based on standard annotation schemes) and computer?based processing of digital speech data. 
        
- Methods for the acquisition of lexical knowledge from digitized and linguistically annotated text resources of various text genres and period of origin (for example statistical and rule?based approaches, machine learning approaches, computer?aided lexicography). 

- Approaches to modeling of lexical knowledge in digital media for various purposes (for example in the context of lexicography, the use of digital lexical resources for research and teaching, design of ontologies for automatic information retrieval, or the development of computer?readable lexicons for automated natural language processing). 
 
Submissions of completed and previously unpublished work in research, development,  application, and evaluation relevant to the aforementioned topics are welcome. Also welcome are submissions to the poster and demonstration session, in which resources, tools, and ongoing projects may  be presented. 
 
Paper presentations, posters, and demonstrations should explore the potential and perspectives of speech and text technology for the development  of lexical knowledge. Also of interest are works focusing on the comparative evaluation of diverse resources, techniques, and tools. 
 
The official conference languages are German and English. All accepted submissions (full papers and short paper versions of posters and software  demonstrations) will be published in the conference proceedings available at the conference. 
 
It is planned to publish the conference proceedings at Mouton de Gruyter.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
