The Third International Conference on the Linguistics of Contemporary =

English ICLCE3 14-17 July 2009 Institute of English Studies Senate House =

University of London

Deadline: 1 February 2009

The attention devoted to the linguistics of the English language has
resulted in a broad body of work in diverse research traditions. The aim of
the ICLCE conference is to encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas
between different frameworks and research traditions, all of which may
address any aspect of the linguistics of English. The first and second
ICLCE conferences were held in Edinburgh (2005) and Toulouse (2007) along
the same lines. We aim for the London conference to build on the success of
those events.

The main conference will be preceded on 14 July by a one-day symposium to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Survey of English Usage. The theme of
this symposium will be Current Change in the English Verb Phrase.

Plenary speakers:

James Blevins (Cambridge)
Bernd Kortmann (Freiburg)
James M. Scobbie (Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh)
Sali Tagliamonte (Toronto)

Instructions for the submission of abstracts (via the Linguist List Easy
Abstracts System) can be found here:

http://ies.sas.ac.uk/events/conferences/2009/ICLCEthree/index.htm

This conference is organized by the Linguistics Department, Queen Mary,
University of London and the Survey of English Usage, UCL in collaboration
with the Institute of English Studies.
