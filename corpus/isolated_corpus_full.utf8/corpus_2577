Second Announcement and Call for Papers

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC) will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of international associations and organisations, including AAMT, AMTA, ACL, ALTA, COCOSDA and Oriental COCOSDA, EACL, EAMT, ELSNET, EURALEX, GWA, IAMT, KnowledgeWeb, LDC, NEMLAR Network, SIGLEX, TEI, Technolangue French Program, WRITE and with major national and international organisations including the European Commission - Information Society and Media, Unit E.2 ''Content and Knowledge''.

Conference Aims:
In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support to investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies and development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

Conference Topics:
Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): text, speech, multimodality

- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for LRs
- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation
- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge
- Ontologies and knowledge representation
- Terminology
- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web technologies
- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications

- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, mobile communication, machine translation, summarisation, web services, semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.
- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice activated services, etc.
- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile applications, etc.
- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation

-  HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs
- Benchmarking of systems and products
- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and dialogue systems
- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

- National and international activities and projects
- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies for LRs
- Open architectures
- Organisational, economical and legal issues

Special Highlights:
LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken, written, and other modalities - and of the respective communities. To this end, LREC encourages submissions covering issues which are common to different types of LRs and language technologies.

LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of applications and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass all those data that interact with language resources in an attempt to model more complex human processes and develop more complex systems, and encourages submissions on topics such as:

- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces,
Human-Human interactions, and content processing
- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, including emotions
- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for robotic systems

Programme:
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels.

There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.

Location: Centre for General Linguistics, Berlin, Germany

Cleft sentences have generally been described as sentence patterns that overtly embody their discourse function. As the terminology suggests, cleft constructions are formed by dividing a more elementary clause into two parts, namely an initial focus constituent and a backgrounded proposition, which is subordinated by being placed in a relative construction. Although the biclausal format of the English it-cleft seems to be clear enough, languages show a considerable amount of variation in the way they encode the equivalent of such clefts. Parameters of typological variation include: (i) the type of copula device that is employed (verbal vs. pronominal copulas); (ii) the form of the predicative relative clause; (iii) the constituents that can undergo clefting.

In this workshop, we are interested in recent theoretical and empirical developments in the analysis of cleft constructions. The submissions should therefore address some of the following issues:

- The sentential status of clefts: arguments for a biclausal or a monoclausal analysis
- The syntactic analysis of clefts: arguments for a derivation analysis or a base-generation analysis of clefts
- The syntactic structure of the copula clause: location of the copula, connection of the relative clause
- The information-structural function of a cleft: is clefting always a focusing strategy, or could it also establish a topic comment structure?
- The similarities and differences between cleft semantics and focus semantics
- The question whether clefts are always exhaustively interpreted
- Presuppositions of clefts: Do clefts always have a presupposition?
- Universality of clefts: Do all languages have cleft constructions?
- The status of the copula: evidence for a grammaticalization path from copular elements to focus markers, or vice versa

This workshop aims to provide a space to discuss and compare different theoretical approaches and empirical studies to the syntax and semantics of clefts. 

Abstracts are invited for a 30-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute question period. Accepted authors will be asked to submit a preliminary version of their papers (up to 15 pages). Selected papers from the workshop will be considered for peer-reviewed book publication.

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in 12-point font with 1'' margins, including data and references. Authors are requested to submit two copies of their abstract, one with their name and one anonymous. Abstracts must be submitted as a pdf attachment to: cleft08@zas.gwz-berlin.de. The names of the files should be surname-named.pdf and surname-anon.pdf.

The body of the e-mail should contain the following information:
Name(s) of author(s)
Title of talk
Affiliation(s)
E-mail address(es)

Important Dates:
Submission deadline for abstracts: 1 April 2008
