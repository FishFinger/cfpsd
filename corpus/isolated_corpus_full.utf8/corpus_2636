Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

We at the Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC), University of Alaska Fairbanks, are planning an informal workshop on how linguistic knowledge can form a link between scientific inquiry and indigenous perspectives of climate. Participants will include linguists, natural scientists, and cultural anthropologists as well as speakers of indigenous languages. 

Call for Papers

This workshop focuses on the question: How can knowledge of the language (both speaking expertise and knowledge of linguistic structure) inform natural science?  Discussion of this question will be facilitated both by paper presentations and by discussion groups focused on particular topics:

Topic 1: Comparing vocabularies:  How does knowledge of indigenous classifications (e.g. of land/landforms, ice, water etc.) inform scientific research? (depending on the number of suggestions, we can break this topic up into several subtopics)

Topic 2:  What can we learn from Oral Histories?

Topic 3:  Naming systems:  Place names and month/season names. What do these names tell us about climate change?

We invite abstract submissions for all topics mentioned above. We are open to your suggestions as we further refine (and add to) the structure of the workshop; however, native language must be a significant factor in all discussions.

We would especially like to see proposals for ''mixed'' group presentations including a speaker of a relevant native language.

For questions and abstract submissions, please contact Olga@lithophile.com

Meeting Description:

The aim of this conference is to provide scholars, researchers, postgraduate and undergraduate students with current research issues from all fields of linguistics & TESOL in an open and widely accessible forum.

The main features that distinguishes this conference is its focus on freedom:
- freedom from linguistic subfield divisions,
- freedom from an established and rigid theme for presentations, and
- freedom from fees

Confirmed focus speakers:
Linda Barwick, University of Sydney
Liz Ellis, University of New England
M.A.K. Halliday, University of Sydney
Ruqaiya Hasan, Macquaire University
Trevor Johnston, Macquaire University 

Call for Papers

Authors are invited to submit abstracts for papers, colloquia, poster presentations, or hot topics.

- Colloquia (abstract max of 250 words): Colloquia will be 90 minutes in length. Their internal structure is up to their organizers, but sufficient time for discussion is encouraged.

- Single papers (abstract max of 250 words): Papers will be 40 minutes in length, with 30 minutes for presentation, 10 minutes for questions/discussion.

- Hot topics (abstract max of 250 words): Hot topic talks will be 20 minutes in length, with 10 minutes for the talk and 10 minutes for Q&A/discussion. We especially welcome proposals in this category from young researchers/students with new and challenging ideas.

- Poster presentations (abstract max of 250 words): Poster presentations will be given in groups with a 30-minute allotment per session. This format may suit young researchers who want to present their work in a less formal format.
