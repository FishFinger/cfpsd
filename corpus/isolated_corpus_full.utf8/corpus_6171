Meeting Description:

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL conferences.
The workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their work
and receive feedback. Participants will have the opportunity to receive feedback
from a general audience as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced
researchers who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation. 

Call for Papers

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask for
suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by an
international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop will be on
work in progress. The research being presented can come from any topic area
within computational linguistics.  For further details, see
