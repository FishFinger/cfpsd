Meeting Description

Our workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP,
machine learning, artificial intelligence, (psycho)linguistics, etc. who are
interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding human
language learning. The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the
computational and cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing,
and help initiate interdisciplinary research projects. 

ACL 2007 Workshop on

Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Acquisition

29th June, 2007
Prague, Czech Republic

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/cognitive/cognitive.htm


Workshop Description

The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical
and machine learning methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has
yielded impressive results in numerous speech and language processing tasks,
including e.g. speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing, lexical
acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. The good results
have generally been viewed as engineering achievements.

Recently researchers have begun to investigate the relevance of computational
learning methods for research on human language acquisition. These
investigations are very important since if computational techniques can be used
to improve our understanding of human language acquisition, this will not only
benefit cognitive sciences in general but will reflect back to NLP
and place us in a better position to develop useful language models.

Some examples of recent investigations include:

- statistical lexical acquisition and analysis of corpora to gain more accurate
descriptions of the learning environment, to investigate the lexical properties
of developmental stages, and to quantify differences between child and adult
productions;

- computational models which investigate the capabilities of particular theories
(notably the benefit and practicality of Universal Grammar);

- biologically motivated neural networks which investigate the acquisition of
specific lexical constructions.

Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between NLP and
cognitive scientists. To this end, interdisciplinary workshops can play a key
role in advancing existing and initiating new research. This was demonstrated by
two successful workshops held at COLING 2004 and ACL 2005 which focused on
psycho-computational models of human language acquisition. However, in general,
there has been little space at major NLP conferences for cognitive aspects of
language acquisition. Even CoNLL which
was originally intended to provide a venue for research on
(psycho)linguistically relevant machine learning work has only occasionally
provided a forum for work.

Areas of Interest

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning

- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language acquisition

- Computational models of various components of the language faculty and their
impact on the acquisition task

- Computational models of the evolution of language

- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human
language acquisition

- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment  and its
impact on the acquisition task

- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to
e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their
relevance to research on human language acquisition

- Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and
weakly-supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical,
symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from
the cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of completion
of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with previously published
work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL 2007 main-conference
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of either the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word
Style file, which can be found at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than March 26, 2007 using the
submission webpage http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS15/submit.html.

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. Authors of
accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce camera-ready
versions of their papers for inclusion in the ACL workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.
