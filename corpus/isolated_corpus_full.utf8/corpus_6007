Full Title: 37th International Systemic Functional Congress 
Short Title: ISFC2010 

Date: 18-Jul-2010 - 23-Jul-2010
Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada 
Contact Person: Geoff Williams
Meeting Email: geoff.williams@ubc.ca
Web Site: http://isfc2010.ubcconferences.com/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics; Historical
Linguistics; Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 29-Jan-2010 

Meeting Description:

Language is constantly evolving, whether we consider it from the perspective of
its use in practical contexts or as a system. This congress presents an
opportunity to learn about, reflect on, and extend SFL's various ways of
thinking about language evolving. The focus includes work on text - context
relations in a variety of fields, including early language evolution, language
development, language education, language revitalization, multimodal relations,
multiliteracies, discourse analysis, translation studies, language policy
studies and more. We will be joined by researchers, teachers and students
working on these topics from around the globe.

The congress will be preceded by a Pre-congress Institute, comprised of three
courses, from 12-16 July. 

Call for Papers:

We are delighted to call for the contribution of papers and workshops to ISFC
2010, to be held at the University of British Columbia (http://www.ubc.ca/), in
Vancouver, Canada, July 18-23 2010. We invite submissions of papers and workshop
proposals that address the conference theme (Language Evolving), but also any
area of systemic functional linguistics.

Submission Information:

Abstracts must be submitted online (only) through the Congress website:
http://isfc2010.ubcconferences.com/ no later than midnight (PST) January 29, 2010. 

A review of the proposals will be conducted by members of the Program Committee
supported by an international panel of experts in systemic functional
linguistics. All accepted proposals will be confirmed by March 15, 2010 at the
latest.

Papers:

Proposals for regular papers may address the congress theme, but also any other
areas related to systemic functional linguistics. Such proposals should contain
the following information:

-Title of proposed contribution
-Names of presenters, institutional affiliation and e-mail address
-An abstract of maximum 200 words
-Audiovisual needs (data projector, overhead projector, whiteboard)


Workshops and Symposia:

In addition, we are inviting proposals for workshops and symposia, to be held on
Wednesday, July 21. Workshops can be a full day (from 10:30 on, after a
plenary), or half day (morning or afternoon). We encourage the organization of
workshops of different types: workshops that explore analysis, data description
or methodology; symposia around a theme; use of systemic functional linguistics
in classroom settings; or meetings of researchers with common interests (for
instance, description of a particular language). Organizers are welcome to issue
their own calls for papers, or to invite additional speakers within their
workshop. Workshops and symposia will be accepted according to space
availability, on a first-come-first-served basis.

Proposals for workshops and symposia should contain the following information:

-Title or theme of the workshop
-Names of organizers, institutional affiliation and e-mail address
-Names of additional presenters, where applicable
-A brief description of the theme and the goals of the workshop
-Audiovisual needs (data projector, overhead projector, whiteboard)

Please check the website soon for further details about the Wednesday education
strand.
