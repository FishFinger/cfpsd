Meeting Description:

Workshop at the DKGL conference in Leipzig - 25-27 Sept 2008 
Organisers: Alexander Bergs, Lena Heine (Osnabrueck, Germany) & Rolf Kreyer (Bonn, Germany) 

Over the last three or four decades, the notion of prototypicality (and the related notions of gradience, indeterminacy and fuzziness) have received focal attention in a large number of publications on cognitive aspects of linguistic categorization. However, while researchers working in cognitive linguistics emphasize the general prototypical nature of linguistic categorization, cognitive models that account for the fuzziness of language are few and far between. In addition, while Rosch and colleagues, among others, have shown that human categorization to a large extent is driven by aspects of economy, there have as of yet been only few attempts to integrate notions like 'basic level category' or 'cue validity' in a comprehensive model of mental grammar and to show how these aspects may come into play
during language processing and language production.

This theme session invites papers that present research on linguistic categorization as being derived from and tailored to language use, focusing on plausible cognitive models of categorization and of language processing and production. Especially, we would like to encourage the presentation of studies within cognitive frameworks that deal with the following topics:
- prototypicality
- gradience
- fuzziness
- indeterminacy
- variation
- usage-based models
- language production and processing
- language acquisition

Papers are welcome from the areas of corpus linguistics and natural language processing/psycholinguistics, as well as papers which address methodological concerns in the modelling of categorization.

Abstract Submissions: Please send your abstract of no more than 300 words as a Word attachment to: rkreyer@uni-bonn.de 
Deadline: The deadline for abstracts is March 1st, 2008
Notification of acceptance: March 15th, 2008
Presentation Guidelines: Papers will be allotted 20 minutes, plus ten minutes for discussion.
Further information about the conference and the theme session will be posted in due course to the following web-site:
http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~gcla08/modules.php?name=home&lang=english
