Meeting Description:

GL2009: Generative Lexicons: From Theory to Implementation
5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon
Date: Sept. 17-19 2009
Location: CNR, Pisa, Italy

The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse contributions from theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, and lexicography, which explore compositionality from the point of view of generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed, as a starting point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). This year's GL conference will be in a new format, combining both an open call for papers and a workshop on semantic annotation.  

The conference will be held over a period of three days and will be organized as a combination of technical paper presentations and posters, break-out sessions, and keynote lectures. The first day will be devoted to the annotation workshop and the second day to conference papers. The final day will be dedicated to the presentation of results from the workshop and an open discussion of remaining issues.  

The workshop and the open discussion are jointly supported by the EC-FLaReNet and the NSF-SILT projects, with the goal of identifying common future directions of research.

This conference is endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups: SIGANN, SIGSEM, and SIGLEX (pending).

Invited Speakers
Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA
Johan Bos, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy
Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh, UK
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA 

2nd Call for Papers

Important Dates
Papers due: June 1, 2009
Acceptance notice: July 1, 2009
Camera-ready version due: August 1, 2009
Conference: Sept. 17-19, 2009

Topics
 
Track 1: Open Conference

Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Polysemy and sense shifting
- Co-compositionality and creation of new word senses
- Type coercion and argument selection phenomena
- Argument realization: mapping from lexicon to syntax
- Cognitive foundations for semantic categories
- The trade-off between pragmatics and lexical knowledge
- Presupposition and commonsense knowledge
- Underspecification and word sense disambiguation

These topics can be approached from either a theoretical or computational perspective. Computational issues relating to the above phenomena include:

- Automatic knowledge acquisition
- Computational models of compositional phenomena
- Robust semantic annotation
- Evaluation of algorithms and annotation schemes

Track 2: Semantic Annotation Workshop

The annotation workshop will address general issues in the identification and markup of semantic content in text. 

Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Compositional mechanisms of argument selection and coercion
- Named entity classification including named entities, events, and temporal and spatial expressions
- Lexical substitution
- Metonymy resolution
- Textual entailment
- Word sense disambiguation
- Semantic role labeling
- Qualia in argument selection and modification constructions
- Type selection in modification of dot objects (complex types)
- Annotation environments and tools

The workshop is intended to provide feedback and training for the upcoming 2010 SemEval tasks, with a special focus on the ''Argument Selection and Coercion'' task, which deals with identifying the compositional operations involved in argument selection by a predicate.

Submission Information

GL2009 will be using EasyChair for electronic submission.  All papers should be submitted using the following website:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gl2009

Please indicate whether your submission is intended for the open call or for the workshop. The final submission deadline is June 1, 2009 11:59 EST.  

All submissions must be in PDF and must follow the two-column format. The maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages. Submissions must be anonymized, i.e. no author information should be included, and obvious self-references should be avoided.  Please use the ACL style guidelines, as specified here:

http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/paperformat.html

Regular and poster papers should follow the same guidelines.  The appropriate presentation format will be determined at the time of acceptance. 

Author Support
A limited number of fellowships to student authors travelling from the U.S. will be available to offset the cost of travel if the paper is accepted.
