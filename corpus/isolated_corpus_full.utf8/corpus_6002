Meeting Description:

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, knowledge=
 bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the development of language proce=
ssing applications that are increasingly important to the global society. S=
ubstantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such resources for th=
e world's major languages over the past decades, and new projects are devel=
oping similar resources for less widely-used languages. Some standards and =
best practices have emerged for representing and linking language corpora a=
nd annotations. Efforts such as the "Global WordNet" and the development of=
 framenets in multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical a=
nd semantic resources across languages, and there are efforts to integrate =
such resources into general-purpose ontologies such as SUMO.

As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is increas=
ingly important to develop resources in the world's languages that can be c=
ompared and linked, used and analyzed with common software, and that contai=
n linguistic information for the same or comparable phenomena. We envision =
the eventual development of a "global web" of language resources, wherein, =
for example, linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are int=
er-linked via the use of common categories, or categories that are mapped t=
o one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked not only=
 to versions in different languages, but also to each other; and common rep=
resentations enable analysis and use of resources in different languages an=
d of different types within available systems. Interoperability also foster=
s universal access to language resources, enabling researchers who have few=
er resources for performing costly and time-consuming transductions to have=
 the same capabilities as others.

The Second International Conference on Global Interoperability for Language=
 Resources will bring together designers, developers, and users of language=
 resources, tools, frameworks, and infrastructures from across the globe, i=
n order to:

-Assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for resource representa=
tion, annotation, processing, interlinkage, and access;
-Consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be used to enable =
resource accessibility, interoperability and inter-linkage;
-Consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) full interoperability, es=
pecially with regard to multi-lingual and multi-modal data;
-Consider the requirements for achieving interoperability among multi-lingu=
al resources of different types, including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bas=
es, ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks that enable the=
ir creation and exploitation;
-Work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and standards langu=
age resource representation, annotation, and use that will enable interoper=
ability;
-Consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in order to bett=
er enable cross-lingual studies;
-Provide direction for developers of resources for less widely used languag=
es;
-Promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of language resourc=
es and tools across the globe;
-Consider ways to provide central or distributed access to language resourc=
es developed throughout the world.

This year's conference will include a special focus on the use of web-based=
 technologies for interoperability and open access to language resources.=
