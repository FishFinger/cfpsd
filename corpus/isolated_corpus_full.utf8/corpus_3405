Meeting Description:

Computers and Writing 2009 Conference, University of California, Davis, June
18-21, 2009 

Call for Papers: Computers and Writing 2009 (June 18-21, 2009 University of
California, Davis)

Computers and Writing 2009 seeks papers that explore the complex social,
pedagogical and institutional dynamics around ubiquitous and/or sustainable
computing. Because computing technologies continue to extend their reach, we
encourage proposals that explain the impact and challenges of ubiquitous and
sustainable computing in different contexts: in educational settings, in
workplaces, and even into (real or virtual) leisure spaces. We are especially
interested in accounts of how teachers and students, workers and writers use
computers and other technologies in their lives at school, at work and at play.

When Computers and Writing began, the desktop revolution was just beginning and
mainframes were a not-so-distant memory. Since 1983 computers have gotten
smaller and faster and more portable, and have therefore become more embedded in
our lives. Computing has become ubiquitous. We find computers in more homes, in
more workplaces, and in more schools, though the uses and meanings of technology
can differ greatly across these contexts. Our interactions with technology have
also expanded from the keyboards, mice, and screens of desktop computers to cell
phones, microphones for speech to text input, PDAs that recognize handwriting,
digital cameras, digital audio recorders, GPS navigators, and other
ever-emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs). Today's
ubiquitous computing is not quite the utopia imagined by Howard Rheingold or
Mark Weiser nor is it the dystopia predicted by Clifford Stoll or Philip K.
Dick; it is a rather more interesting, nuanced, and complex world than we'd
imagined. 

Ubiquitous computing has produced a series of challenges for educational
institutions. Sustainable computing means finding ways to meet current
technological needs without sacrificing future innovation. As teachers and
scholars of writing, how do we avoid the curse of technological obsolescence,
even as computing rapidly evolves and expands into new corners of lived
experience? How do our uses of technology move beyond short-term interventions,
and contribute to sustained and sustainable learning across the life-span of our
students? Finally, how do we employ these technologies ethically, given their
potential impact on a local and global scale? Ultimately at stake is not just
the sustainability of computing, but also how computing can help us lead more
sustainable lives.

Submissions Open: Monday, April 28, 2008
Submission Deadline: Friday, September 19, 2008

Full Title: EACL 2009 System Demonstrations 

Date: 30-Mar-2009 - 03-Apr-2009
Location: Athens, Greece 
Contact Person: Joern Kreutel
Meeting Email: joern.kreutel@semanticedge.com
Web Site: http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/systemdemonstrations 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 05-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

The European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics invites
the submission of proposals for system demonstrations for its 12th meeting. The
areas of interest are the same as those mentioned in the call for full papers
(see http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/callforpapers) and cover all aspects of
theoretical and applied computational linguistics. Among others, submissions may
address systems of the following kinds:

- systems that support, verify or evaluate core theoretical research
- applications that demonstrate innovative transformations of theoretical findings
- development tools that ease application creation

We would like to strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems as long
as they prove technologically innovative given the current state of the art of
theory and applied research in computational linguistics. 

Call for Papers

Submission Requirements:

Each demo will be complemented by a poster at the conference and will be
allocated 4 pages in a companion volume in the conference proceedings.

Developers should outline the design of their system and provide sufficient
details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to
computational linguistics. Pointers to web sites running a demo preview will
also be helpful.

Demo submissions should also clearly indicate if any computer equipment is
expected to be provided by the local organizer. If so, please specify desired
hardware platform, hard disk and memory capacity, operating system and other
software needed in order to run the demo. If you are bringing your own laptop,
you should instead request a video projector if you need one, providing details
about PC type, screen resolution, etc.

Reviewing:
The reviewing of the submissions will be blind. It will be conducted by an
international panel of experts. Final decisions on the program will be made by
the demo chair.

Submission Information:
Submissions should follow the guidelines for authors of the main conference
track, which can be found here: http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

As reviewing will be blind, the submission should not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided.
Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.
Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without
review.

Submission will be electronic using the submission software to be made available
at  https://www.softconf.com/eacl09/demo/submit.html. The submissions must be
submitted no later than 11:59pm (23:59) GMT December 5, 2008. Submissions
submitted after that time will not be reviewed.

Important Dates:
Poster/demo submission deadline: December 5, 2008
Notification of acceptance: January 16, 2009
Camera ready versions due: February 13, 2009
EACL 2009 Conference: March 30 - April 3, 2009

Program Committee:
Jörn Kreutel, SemanticEdge GmbH / Universität Potsdam, Germany (Chair)
Colin Matheson, University of Edinburgh, UK
David Horowitz, University of Trento, Italy
Stefan Müller, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany
Wojciech Skut, Google Inc., USA

Local Organisers:
Vangelis Karkaletsis, NCSR Demokritos (Chair)
Ion Androutsopoulos, Athens University of Economics and Business 
Stelios Piperidis, ILSP Athens 
    
Student Sponsorships:
The EACL has a limited number of student sponsorships available to student
participants of the EACL 2009 main conference, the EACL 2009 demo session and/or
the EACL 2009 student research workshop.

Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more generally, to
students from countries with hard currency problems (within the geographical
area covered by EACL).

A request for student sponsorship for EACL 2009 should include the following
information:
- Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of the candidate
- Source and amount of yearly income
- Letter of motivation
- Proof of student status
- Copy of acceptance letter from programme chair / student workshop chair or
demo chair
- Letter of recommendation from supervisor
- Overview of the estimated costs

Requests for student sponsorships can be directed to the EACL at secretary@eacl.org.
