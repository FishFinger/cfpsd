EACL 2006 Workshop on

Making Sense of Sense:
Bringing Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics Together

April 4, 2006, Trento, Italy

http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/EACL06WS/

**********************
SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
**********************

The EACL 2006 Workshop on Making Sense of Sense: Bringing  
Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics Together will be  
hosted in conjunction with the 11th Conference of the European  
Chapter of
the Association for Computational Linguistics that will take
place April 3-7, 2006, in Trento, italy.


* TOPICS

Although research on lexical ambiguity has a long history in the  
field of psycholinguistics, work in this area is rarely considered in  
debates concerned with identifying relevant sense distinctions for  
NLP. Recent research in the field of psycholinguistics may offer  
significant insight into the sense distinctions that humans readily  
recognize. This workshop will explore approaches to the problem of  
sense distinction from the viewpoint of both computational linguists  
and psycholinguists, in order to bring the work in each field to bear  
on the problem.


* SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original,
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop.  Submissions
should be formatted using the EACL 2006 stylefiles with overt
author and affiliation information and not exceeding 8 pages.
The EACL 2006 stylefiles are available at
http://eacl06.itc.it/submission/submission.htm

Please send your PDF file no later than January 6, 2006, to
