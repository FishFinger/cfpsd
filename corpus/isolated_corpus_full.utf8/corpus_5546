 FIRST CALL  FOR  PAPERS
-------------------

Mining User-Generated Content for Security - MINUCS 2009

9 December 2009, Venice, Italy
   =

web: http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs

email: minucs [ad] cs [dot] helsinki [dot] fi  =



This event is co-located with the First International Conference =

on User Centric Media - UCMedia 2009 (http://www.usercentricmedia.org) =

in Venice, 9-11 December 2009

---------------
 AIM AND SCOPE
---------------

The vast and growing amount of user-generated textual content, including
online news streams, =

blogs, electronic encyclopedias (e.g., the Wikipedia), and other openly
accessible and =

dynamically changing data readily available on the Web has led to the
emergence of new =

approaches to extracting valuable, structured, and previously unknown
information from =

such data. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from
academia and =

industry who develop technologies for mining open-source user-generated
textual data =

on the Web, as well as end-users interested in exploiting such technologies
for =

knowledge discovery. The emphasis is placed on large-scale text mining
systems and =

application-oriented approaches to processing on-line textual content in the
context =

of security-related applications. Examples of such applications include: =


 * global medical and epidemic surveillance, =

 * conflict early warning, =

 * early detection of man-made or environmental hazards, =

 * risk assessment, =

 * border surveillance, =

 * cross-border crime detection, =

 * terrorism counterintelligence, =

 * other applications relevant for security, law enforcement, and public
health institutions =


Due to a multitude of challenges of diverse and complex nature that are
related to automating =

the process of mining user-generated content on the Web, we believe that
this workshop will serve =

as a forum to bring together researchers from different areas, including
data mining, language technology, =

computational linguistics, information sciences, information retrieval and
Web mining, for sharing ideas =

and discussion. In particular, we believe that there is an important gap to
be filled, since the =

aforementioned research communities have had limited interaction previously
in the context of the =

topic of the Workshop. The second major goal is to engage governmental and
inter-state user communities, =

and to bring them together with scientists and funding agencies. =


--------------------
 TOPICS OF INTEREST
--------------------

 * Mining from news streams, blogs, document repositories, and other openly
accessible and dynamically =

   changing data, including Web 2.0 content, for the purpose of identifying
threats to security or public health, =

 * Emphasis on multilingual approaches, and work on languages other than
English, =

 * Applications, such as information extraction, classification,
summarization, sentiment detection, event detection, =

   event forecasting, trend detection, information fusion, and more, =

 * Contributions in the form of applications (working systems and
prototypes) as well as theoretical results are welcome, =

 * Application domains include crisis-related event reporting, political and
environmental analysis, =

   and medical intelligence, under the general umbrella of the security
intelligence domain, =

 * Methods including machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid approaches. =


------------
 SUBMISSION
------------

We invite papers addressing primarily the language technology, natural
language processing, data mining =

and information retrieval communities, as well as the relevant end-user
groups. =

Submissions are invited in two categories: =


 * regular: research papers presenting novel approaches and solutions, and =

 * short (posters): system demonstrations, descriptions, and work in
progress

Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a web-based submission
server.
Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNICST style for LaTeX in producing
the PDF document. =

More information on this style can be found at:
http://www.springer.com/computer?SGWID=3D0-146-6-564009-0

The page limit for regular papers is 6 pages, whereas short papers are
limited to 4 pages. =

The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted
papers since the =

review process wil be blind.
More detailed information about submission is available on:
http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs/authors.shtml

Each submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program
Committee. =

Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce =

camera-ready versions.

-------------
 PUBLICATION
-------------


All workshop papers will be published in the official proceedings, =

Springer Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences,
Social-Informatics =

and Telecommunications Engineering - LNICST, of the main conference. =


Selected workshop papers will be published in "ACM Springer Mobile Networks =

and Applications (MONET) Journal Special Issue on Mobility and User-Centric
Media". =


All workshop papers will be also published on the UCMedia2009 Website. =
