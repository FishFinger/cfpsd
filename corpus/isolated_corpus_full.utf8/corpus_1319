Meeting Description:
The colloquium is to discuss issues of language and ethnic identities in the
contexts of globalization and urbanization. In the world today we see sweeping
trends of industrialization and urbanization of unprecedented scales. These
bring in tremendous amounts of population movement, ethnic contact and mixture,
and cross-cultural communication, and with all their concatenated problems. A
recently-developed field of research, Urban Language Survey, as is called
sometimes, is a cross-disciplinary attempt to address the relevant issues, with
a focus on the roles of language in the dynamic process of urbanization.
Progress has been made in areas such as typological studies of urban and rural
language situations, the formation process of urban speech communities, migrant
speech communities, communication problems in urban encounters, etc. These areas
of study have attracted researchers of different disciplines from various parts
of the world. The researchers address questions of general linguistics and
sociolinguistics, while keeping a practical interest in upholding cultural
diversity and ethnic harmony.
The colloquium is part of ICAES16. 

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (followed by 10 minutes for questions)
addressing any topic in the area of ''Language, Urbanization, and Cultural
Diversity.'' Related issues are also welcome.

Submission Guidelines: 
-- Abstracts (and talks) may be in English or Chinese.
-- Authors may submit only one abstract for the Conference.
-- Send one copy of a one page abstract for review.
-- Abstract may be submitted only by E-mail. (Please submit the abstract as an
attachment. Use WORD format, Times New Roman Font, 12-point font size. In the
body of your E-mail include the following information: title of paper, name,
academic affiliation, address, E-mail, phone and fax number.)
-- Deadline: All submissions must be received by April 15, 2007.
