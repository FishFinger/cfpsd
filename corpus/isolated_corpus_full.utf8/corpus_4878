Final Call For Papers

Workshop on Extracting and Using Constructions in NLP
http://www.sics.se/~mange/construct2009/
Pre-conference workshop NODALIDA 2009
Thursday, May 14, Odense, Denmark

Due to numerous requests, we have decided to extend the paper submission
deadline, until April 6th.

A construction is a recurring, or otherwise noteworthy congregation of
linguistic entities. Examples include collocations ("hermetically sealed"),
(idiomatic) expressions with fixed constituents ("kick the bucket"), expressions
with (semi-)optional constituents ("hungry as a X"), and sequences of
grammatical categories ([det][adj][noun]). As can be seen by these examples,
constructions are a diverse breed, and what constitutes a linguistic
construction is largely an open question.

Despite (or perhaps due to) the inherent vagues of the concept, constructions
enjoy increasing interest in both theoretical linguistics and in natural
language processing. A symptom of the former is the Construction grammar
framework, and a symptom of the latter is the growing awareness of the impact of
constructions on
different kinds of information access applications. Constructions are an
interesting phenomenon because they constitute a middleway in the syntax-lexicon
continuum, and because they show great potential in tackling infamously
difficult NLP tasks.

We encourage submissions in all areas of constructions-based research, with
special focus on:
- Theoretical discussions on the nature and place within linguistic theory of
the concept of linguistic constructions.
- Methods and algorithms for identifying and extracting linguistic constructions.
- Uses and applications of linguistic constructions (information access,
sentiment analysis, tools for language learning etc.).

Submission Procedure:
Submission is now open at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=construct09. 

Submissions should not exceed 6 pages, and should use the EACL style files
available at http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors. Reviewing will not be
blind, and authors will be given a chance to revise their papers and discuss
comments with the reviewers before final submission.

Proceedings will be published as a SICS technical report.

Important Dates:
Submission deadline: April 6
First review: April 15
Discussion period: April 15-April 22
Final papers due: May 1
Workshop: May 14

Location: Nodalida 2009 (http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/nodalida2009/), Odense,
Denmark. Workshop participants must register for the main conference. Please see
the conference website for more information regarding fees and registration.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
