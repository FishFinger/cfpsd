Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Multimodal communication: from human behaviour to computational
models' aims to provide a multidisciplinary forum to present results and discuss
issues that concern research on human multimodal communication, its modelling
and representation for computational systems. The workshop will be held in
conjunction with the 17 Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA
2009), in Odense, Denmark on May 14th 2009.

Extended Deadline (March 10th)

Multimodal Communication: from Human Behaviour to Computational Models
May 14, 2009 Workshop in conjunction with the 17 Nordic Conference of
Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2009), Odense, Denmark
(http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/nodalida2009/)
http://cst.dk/multicom2009

Goals and Scope of the Workshop
Human communication is naturally multimodal, involving the interaction of
modalities such as speech, facial expressions, hand gestures and body posture.
In order to have a better understanding of human-human communication and to
improve human-computer interaction it is essential to identify, describe,
formalize and model the interaction of the different modalities in interhuman
communication. The past two decades have witnessed numerous initiatives and
research efforts to improve the state of the art, including collection and
annotation of multimodal data, automatic recognition of the different
modalities, modeling and generation of multimodal data. However, there are still
many questions and problems concerning the annotation of multimodal data, the
technology for capturing data, not to mention the interpretation and
reproduction of complex, natural multimodal behaviour. 

The present workshop aims to provide a multidisciplinary forum to present
results and discuss issues that concern research on human multimodal
communication, its modeling and representation for computational systems. We
invite unpublished contributions in these field. Topics of particular interest
include, but are not limited to: 
- Cognitive aspects of multimodal communication
- Formal frameworks and descriptions of multimodal communication
- Representational issues (e.g. definition of annotation units, granularity of
descriptions, spatio-temporal models of non-verbal modalities, definition  of
default values, representation of multimodal meaning, inclusion of world context
etc.)
- Interaction of the different modalities
- Multimodality in intercultural communication
- Definition of communicative functions in multimodal communication
- Methodologies and tools to annotate, process and/or produce multimodal
communication
- Multimodal signal processing and its integration with manual annotation
- The annotation and validation of multimodal data
- Machine learning applied to multimodal data 
 
Important Dates:
Full paper submission: March 10, 2009
Notification: March 30, 2009
Camera-ready paper submission: April 14, 2009 Multimodal Communication 
Workshop: May 14, 2009

Submission Guidelines:
Paper submissions should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. As
reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations.  Submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL
proceedings, as NODALIDA 2009 (see the information for authors under
http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/nodalida2009) and  must use either the LaTeX style files
or Microsoft Word document template.

Paper submissions should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. As
reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. 

Submission must be electronic and must be sent at
multicom2009 @ cst.dk and costanza @ hum.ku.dk no later than March 10, 2009. 
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF.  

Proceedings
The Workshop proceedings will be published in the NEALT electronic Proceedings
series.

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Applied textual inference has attracted a significant amount of attention in
recent years. Recognizing textual entailments and detecting semantic
equivalences between texts are at the core of many NLP tasks, including question
answering, information extraction, text summarization, and many others.
Developing generic algorithms and resources for inference and paraphrasing would
therefore be applicable to a broad range of NLP applications. 

Call for Papers

The success of the first three Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Pascal
challenges and the high participation in this year's NIST-organized RTE
challenge show that there is a very substantial interest in the area among the
research community. RTE and paraphrase detection tasks have considerably
stimulated research in the area of applied semantics, and computational models
for textual inference are becoming more and more reliable and accurate as a result.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a common forum where people can discuss
and compare novel ideas, models and tools for textual inference and
paraphrasing. The workshop follows previous ACL workshops on these topics (the
ACL workshop on 'Empirical Modeling of Semantic Equivalence and Entailment',
2005, and the joint ACL-PASCAL workshop 'Textual Entailment and Paraphrasing',
2007). This line of workshops goes in parallel with the RTE challenges, now
organized by NIST, by promoting a deeper understanding of what are the
scientific achievements and the new findings emerging in the field.

Important Dates
- Submission: May 1, 2009
- Notification: Jun 1, 2009
- Camera Ready: Jun 7, 2009
- Workshop: Aug 6, 2009

The workshop is open to any research topic related to applied textual inference
and paraphrasing. More specifically, topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:
Foundational aspects
Methods and models
- Rule-based methods
- Machine learning methods
- Probabilistic models
Computational modeling of linguistic theories
Learning textual inference rules and paraphrases from data
Applications of textual inference
Evaluation methodologies of textual inference and paraphrasing
Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of existing methods
Automatic and semi-automatic methods for building corpora for textual inference
and paraphrasing
Multilingual and language-independent techniques for textual inference ad
paraphrasing
Linguistic Analysis of Textual Inference
