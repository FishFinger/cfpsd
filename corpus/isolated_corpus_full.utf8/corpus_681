Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 20-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

In recent years, the study of the interaction between different levels of linguistic knowledge has attracted increasing interest. In order to speak or understand a language we need to access different mechanisms whose interaction cannot be fully appreciated from a non-integrated approach. This workshop aims to bring together scholars who have been working on these issues providing cross-section, cutting-edge accounts of developments in the interfaces between phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The workshop will provide a forum for discussion of methods, theoretical perspectives, and accounts of the interaction between components of the language faculty.

Special Thematic Sessions:

We would like to encourage submission of papers and posters for two special sessions dealing with:
(i) experimental approaches for the investigation of interfaces;
(ii) implications of findings on interface issues in the applied linguistics field.

Invited Speakers (abstract selection committee):

Artemis Alexiadou, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart
Andrea Gualmini, McGill University, Montreal
Carlos Gussenhoven, Radbound University, Nijmegen
Heidi Harley, University of Arizona, Tucson
Kyle Johnson, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Jamal Ouhalla, University College Dublin, Dublin
Lisa Travis, McGill University, Montreal
John Wilson, University of Ulster, Jordanstown 

Requirement for abstract submission:

Abstracts can be up to two pages long including references, data and/or illustrations. Abstracts should be emailed no later than January 20, 2007 as an attachment (PDF format) to the following two addresses:
r.folli@ulster.ac.uk;
c.ulbrich@ulster.ac.uk.

Please forward abstracts to both addresses.

The subject line of the email should be ''ONLI''.
Authors should include the following pieces of information in the body of the email:
title of the paper, 
name of the author(s) 
email address for correspondence
affiliation.

Submission is limited to one single authored paper and one joint authored paper.

If you wish to be considered for one of the two special sessions (see above) this should be indicated clearly in the body of the email.

Publication of a book from the workshop with a major publisher is planned.

Interdisciplinary Approaches to Relative Clauses

Invited Speakers:

Bernard Comrie (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology)
Elisabet Engdahl (Gothenburg)
Suzanne Flynn (MIT)
Ted Gibson (MIT)
Ed Keenan (UCLA)
Ruth Kempson (King's College London)
Jim McCloskey (UC Santa Cruz)

Organisers: Research Centre for English and Applied Linguistics, University of Cambridge and Dept. of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

Sponsors: Dept. of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Research Centre for English and Applied Linguistics (Cambridge), the Scandinavian Studies Fund (Cambridge), and the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities of the University of Cambridge (CRASSH). 

Relative clauses are complex constructions grammatically, yet very frequent and highly productive crosslinguistically. Understanding their properties is, thus, fundamental for theories of grammar, linguistic typology, language acquisition and processing. Many of their structural and interpretive properties have now been investigated and there is a growing body of work on their acquisition and processing. However, there have been insufficient efforts to integrate insights and results across different subdisciplines. Building on the success of the preparatory ''Workshop on the Typology, Acquisition and Processing of Relative Clauses'' (Leipzig 2005, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology), the conference aims  to bring together researchers investigating relative clauses from different perspectives: linguistic typology, grammatical theory, processing, first and second language acquisition, computational/corpus linguistics and historical linguistics.  There is curren!
 tly considerable interest in relative clauses throughout the language sciences and we expect contributions from all relevant subfields.  We especially encourage paper submissions on the following topics: 
 	
-Head internal relative clauses.
-Relative clauses in languages like Japanese where the relative clause is closely related to other types of prenominal modification. 
-Relative clauses in 1st language acquisition.
-Relative clauses in 2nd language acquisition from speakers with varying L1s. 
-Relative clauses in Scandinavian languages.
-Resumption in relative clauses.
-Processing of relative clauses, in particular, in different language types. 
-Production models of relative clauses.
-Comprehension models of relative clauses.

Please note that, thanks to an award from the University of Cambridge Scandinavian Studies Fund, registration fees will be waived for papers on Scandinavian languages. 

Important Dates:

Abstract Submission: 8th of January 2007
Notification of acceptance: 7th of March 2007
Early Registration: June 2007
Conference: 13-15 Sept. 2007

Abstract Submission Guidelines:

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion) and/or poster presentations on any aspect of relative clauses.  Abstracts should be submitted to http://www.easychair.org/REL07/  in PDF format, by the 8th of January 2007. Abstracts are limited to one page (using 1'' margins on all sides and 11pt font size) and a second page containing examples/data and references. Any non-standard fonts should be embedded in the PDF document. Abstracts should include a header with the name(s), affiliation(s) and e-mail contact of author(s).
