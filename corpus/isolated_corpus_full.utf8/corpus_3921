Dear PhD students:

The United Information Systems Conference (UNISCON 2009) -- a 
combination of three related conferenes -- is being held in Sydney 
(Campbelltown) in April 2009.
If your work relates IS, the Doctoral Consortium associated with it
(see www.uniscon2009.org/doctoral_consortium.pl )
provides a good opportunity to show-case and publish your research.

The only problem is -- the submission deadline is December 8th.
So you can consider it only if you have a paper almost ready to go.

Cheers,

Abhaya

Dear Bernard,

We would be thankful if you could bring the UNISCON 2009 Doctoral Consortium to the attention of
your Doctoral Students and encourage them to submit a paper for it.

For more information on the doctoral consortium, please visit 

www.uniscon2009.org/doctoral_consortium.pl

United Information Systems Conference (UNISCON 2009) will take place in Sydney, Australia from 21 to
24th April 2009 combining three exciting international scientific conferences in the area of
Information Systems:

    * 8th International Conference on Information Systems Technology and its Applications (ISTA 2008)
    * 8th International Conference on Conceptual Modelling Approaches for e-Business (eCOMO 2008) and
    * 2nd International Workshop on Model-Based Software and Data Integration (MBSDI 2009)

 In addition to its plenary sessions, this year conference will include a doctoral consortium. The
doctoral consortium will facilitate the exchange and presentation of high quality on-going research
in all aspects of Information Systems. This forum will allow doctoral students to present their work
and obtain guidance from mentors as well as to get in contact with other postgraduate students. 
 
The Doctoral Consortium track of UNISCON 2009 accepts submission of doctoral research papers mainly
in the following three areas (For specific topics in each of the areas, please visit the URL given):

    * Information Systems Technology and its Applications (http://www.uniscon2009.org/ista.pl)
    * Conceptual Modelling Approaches for e-Business (http://www.uniscon2009.org/ecom_2009.pl)
    * Model-Based Software and Data Integration (http://www.uniscon2009.org/mbsdi_2009.pl)

The best submissions (3 papers) in the above-mentioned three areas will be selected for presentation
at the relevant Conference or Workshop. Selected Doctoral Consortium full papers (5 pages) will be
published in a supplementary proceeding. 
 
Important Dates for Doctoral Consortium:
Paper submissions deadline- 08 December 2008 Notification of acceptance - 09 January 2009 Final
versions due - 16 January 2009 Doctoral Consortium Held on - 20 April 2009
 
Best Regards,
