Meeting Description:

Corpora - principled collections of data in electronic format - have emerge=
d over the last decades as a powerful analytical tool both in applied and t=
heoretical linguistics. They have turned out of particularly significant im=
portance in studies on language variation and language varieties. Indeed, t=
he wealth and amount of data  made available through corpus compilation and=
 query tools  have increasingly enabled researchers to explore differences =
across spoken and written discourse, social, diachronic and geographic vari=
eties, age groups, gender, idiolects, etc.  The widening of studies on lang=
uage variation and language varieties, however, still calls for discussion =
on significant methodological issues, which pose, among others, the followi=
ng questions: What are the major methodological problems in the research fi=
eld? What is the role of the comparative perspective? Which tools and metho=
dology best suit research?

The conference intends to focus on such issues in order to provide a better=
 definition of the concepts under investigation and bring together signific=
ant and innovative contributions in what is now understood as a widely rese=
arched area, thus presenting new tools and perspectives to be investigated.=
 This is also the main general objective of the CLAVIER research group (Cor=
pus and Language Variation Research Group), a research centre recently foun=
ded by the Universities of Bergamo, Firenze, Modena and Reggio Emilia, Roma=
 'La Sapienza', and Siena, and currently based in Modena. The point of depa=
rture is the invaluable contribution of two complementary strands of lingui=
stic investigation - corpus analysis and discourse analysis - to research o=
n language variation in English, both in quantitative and qualitative terms=
.=20

One of the purposes of the 2009 CLAVIER conference is to reinforce national=
 and international cooperation with scholars and research centres that can =
widen and complement the interest in language variation currently driving r=
esearch at the centre.

Plenaries:

Udo Fries (University of Z=FCrich)
Anna Mauranen (University of Helsinki)
Josef Schmied (University of Chemnitz)
Geoffrey Williams (University of Bretagne-Sud)=20

Call for Papers

CLAVIER2009 would like to bring together different perspectives on language=
 variation and use. Plenaries and papers will aim at giving a special insig=
ht into the following topics:  =20

A. using historical corpora to investigate diachronic language variation
B. using corpora as an innovative tool in exploring geographic varieties=20
C. corpus linguistics in the investigation of non-native language use in pr=
ofessional settings
D. corpus linguistics tools, special languages, and specialist lexicography=
.

Contributions concerning other topics will also be accepted on condition th=
at they are relevant to the special theme of the Conference.

The conference will start early in the afternoon on the first day and close=
 around lunchtime on the third day. It will be immediately preceded by a pr=
e-conference workshop on specialist lexicography organized by the Modena Le=
xi-Term research group. Conference participants are welcome to join the wor=
kshop.
