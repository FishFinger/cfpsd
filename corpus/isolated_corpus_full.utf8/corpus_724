Multimodal Corpora for Modelling Human Multimodal Behavior 

Special issue of the International Journal of Language Resources and
Evaluation http://www.springer.com/journal/10579/

Guest editors:
J.-C. Martin, P. Paggio, P. Kuehnlein, R. Stiefelhagen, F. Pianesi

This special issue is concerned with behavioral models built from
Multimodal Corpora.  'Multimodal Corpora' target the recording and
annotation of several communication modalities such as speech, hand
gesture, facial expression, body posture, etc.

The focus of this special issue is on multimodal corpora and their use for
representing and modelling human behaviors.  This includes non-verbal
communication studies and their contribution to the definition of
collection protocols, coding schemes, and reliable models of multimodal
human behaviour that can be built from corpora and compared to results that
can be found in the literature.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Studies of multimodal behaviour
- Multimodal interaction in groups and meetings
- Building models of behaviour from multiple sources of knowledge: manual
annotation, image processing, motion capture, literature studies
- Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal video corpora
- Validation of multimodal annotations
- Exploitation of multimodal corpora in different types of applications
(meeting transcription, Embodied Conversational Agent, multi-modal
interfaces, communication and clinical studies, edutainment)
- Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition, creation,
management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and multimodal corpora
- Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora
- Benchmarking of systems and products; use of multimodal corpora for the
evaluation of real systems
- Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated speech,
gaze, gesture, facial expressions)

The submitted papers might address human-computer interaction if it
concerns human modalities (e.g. 3D conversational gestures rathers than 2D
pen based interaction).

Important Dates

- Deadline for paper submission: 15th December 2006
- Notification of acceptance: 15th February 2007
- Camera-ready version of accepted paper: 15th April 2007
- Target publication date: September 2007
