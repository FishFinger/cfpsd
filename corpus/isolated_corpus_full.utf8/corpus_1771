Meeting Description:

A Seminar that reviews the early Comparative Dravidian Studies to trace its
contributions, evaluate the current comparative perspectives and project a
future plan for the growth and development of Comparative Dravidian Linguistics
is a desideratum.
To fulfill this need, the Department of Dravidian and Computational Linguistics,
Dravidian University, Kuppam is organizing a three-day International Seminar on
Dravidian Languages, Society and Culture from 15th to 17th November 2007. 

Background
Language, being the manifestation of culture reflecting the society in all the
facets of its development, any study of language will lead to a better
understanding of that culture and society. Since their inception, the
Departments of Linguistics in India have been actively engaging in comparative
studies as the thrust area. Specifically this thrust was remarkable during 1960s
and 80s. The contribution of foreign scholars has really triggered the growth of
Comparative Dravidian Linguistics.
Yet, the earlier research has not been taken to further heights. Several
scholars feel that there is a crying need to develop comprehensive Comparative
Dravidian Syntactic study. The changes that have taken place in Dravidian
languages have to be studied on a comparative perspective. Any analysis of the
genetic relationship between Dravidian and other family of languages,
specifically outside South Asia will establish the pre-history of Dravidian
family of languages. The retention aspects of Dravidian Tribal Languages have to
be identified. Further studies in language contact and convergence may expose
the origins of Dravidian languages. Identifying many new speech forms, the
regional and social dialects and locating their status have yet to be taken up
on larger scale. There is no gain saying that many of the Dravidian Tribal
Languages are endangered. The process of globalization may quicken this threat.
It is high time that the possibilities of utilizing the modern technological
advancements for the Comparative Dravidian Linguistic Studies are explored. 

Objectives
A Seminar that reviews the early Comparative Dravidian Studies to trace its
contributions, evaluate the current comparative perspectives and project a
future plan for the growth and development of Comparative Dravidian Linguistics
is a desideratum.
To fulfill this need, the Department of Dravidian and Computational Linguistics,
Dravidian University, Kuppam is organizing a three-day International Seminar on
Dravidian Languages, Society and Culture from 15th to 17th November 2007.

Seminar Themes
The Seminar aims to accentuate on the following areas for exploration:
History of Comparative Dravidian Linguistics
Sub-grouping
Innovations in Reconstructions
Comparative Dravidian Syntax
Description of New Languages

Dialects of Tribal Languages
Convergence in Dravidian Tribal Languages
Endangerment
Dravidian and other Language Families
Social System(s) of Dravidian Speakers
Social Organizations of Dravidian Speakers
DED and its Revision
Language Technology and Comparative Dravidian Linguistics

Submission Guidelines

Full Title: Workshop on Nominal and Verbal Plurality 

Date: 09-Nov-2007 - 10-Nov-2007
Location: Paris, France 
Contact Person: Brenda Laca
Meeting Email: brenda.lacaATlinguist.jussieu.fr
Web Site: http://www.umr7023.cnrs.fr/article.php3?id_article=295 

Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Semantics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 20-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

Invited Speakers:

Paolo Acquaviva (University College Dublin)
Leora Bar El (SOAS-London)
Ekkehard König (FU Berlin)

The Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality will take place on November 9th -
10th, 2007, in Paris. It is organized by the project 'Distributive dependencies:
nominal and verbal plurality' (CNRS, Fédération TUL). 

This project explores the parallels and interactions between the nominal and the
verbal domain by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality, and its
morpho-syntactic manifestations across languages.

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of plurality
are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of event
plurality and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals,
distributivity, 'pluractionals', plural nominalizations) and the nature of
cross-categorial plurality markers. 

The Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality will take place
on November 9th - 10th, 2007, in Paris. 

We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations (plus ten-minute discussions).
Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length (including examples and
references) written in French or English.

Abstracts must be anonymous and should be sent by e-mail (plain ASCII, rtf, ps
or pdf) to:
Brenda.LacaATlinguist.jussieu.fr

Please write the (first) author's name plus the word 'abstract' in the subject
line of your message (e.g., 'Dupont abstract'), and include author name(s),
affiliation, contact information and the title of the abstract in the body of
the email.
For co-authored papers indicate the email address that we should use for
correspondence.

Abstracts should reach us by August 20, 2007.
