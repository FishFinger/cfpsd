The Conference on Verbal Communication in the Public Space
6 - 8 March 2008, Galati, Romania
http://www.discorps.ugal.ro/caps.html

Participation of colleagues in last year's Conference on Communication and
Argumentation in the Public Sphere was a pleasure and an honour for us. 
Last year's experience proved that my project of editing the conference volume
as soon as possible was not realistic. It is still being edited, with the strong
hope that it will be available at the beginning of March. For exclusively
personal reasons, it is very late that I am announcing quite informally this
year's edition, which will be smaller and more narrowly directed towards the
conference theme, which stays as announced on the conference site, as the dates
of the conference itself.

Some changes were made in the conference format, which is more or less the
following:
- Twenty to thirty papers will be selected from the submitted proposals to be
presented in successive (and not concurrent) sessions.
- Papers are to be submitted in narrow relation with this year's conference topics. 
- For the conference presentations, languages accepted are: English, French and
Romanian
- Presentations last 20 minutes, followed by questions and answers (5-10 minutes).
- Publication of submitted and accepted papers is possible only in English or
French, following scientific review.
- On account of the very late announcement I am making, we will also accept
submissions on the conference topics to be later published in our Communication
and Argumentation in the Public Sphere Series.

The next announcements on the conference Web will include further details on fee
payment, conference programme and accommodation arrangements. Registered
participants whose papers have been accepted for presentation will be informed
of any posting on CAPS2 Web.

Topic Areas:
- communication in the public space
- verbal communication vs non-verbal communication in the public space
- argumentation in institutional contexts
- argumentative practice in public space
- persuasion strategies in verbal communication
- cooperation and conflict in the public space
- approaches to public discourse
- communication with the individual and the group
- discourse analysis - public space discourse
- conversational approaches
- narrow linguistic issues relevant to the general topic 
- evidentiality in verbal communication
- pragma-dialectical approaches to argumentation
- evidentiality and argumentation (special section)
