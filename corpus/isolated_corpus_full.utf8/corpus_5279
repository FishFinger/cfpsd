Meeting Description:

The third edition of the Brussels conference on Utterance Interpretation and Cognitive Models will take place on February 5-7, 2009. The first edition addressed the issue of the semantics/pragmatics interface from a cognitive perspective and drew essentially on the work of semanticists, pragmaticists and philosophers of language. The second broadened the perspective by inviting the views of scholars from the related subfields of syntax, cognitive linguistics and evolutionary linguistics. For this third edition, the focus will be on the developmental and cognitive determinants of utterance interpretation. On the one hand, the ontogenetic development of our ability to interpret linguistic utterances provides invaluable insights into adult cognition; on the other, the methods of cognitive psychology, with their emphasis on experimental inquiry and empirical results raise crucial epistemological questions for the progress of research in the field. The focus of this third edition!
  is fully in keeping with our continued ambition to reach across disciplinary boundaries and bring together researchers who, though belonging to different schools or traditions, all take a view of interpretation that is informed by cognitive concerns and share the assumption that the ultimate test for any theory of utterance interpretation is its psychological plausibility. 

Call for Papers

Abstract Submission: 

In addition to keynote lectures, the conference will feature parallel sessions with contributed papers. We welcome submissions of abstracts for 25-minute papers that focus on the psychological or cognitive underpinnings of utterance interpretation or, conversely, address the implications that theories of any aspect of utterance interpretation can have for the psychology of language and for cognitive science at large. We also welcome papers from scholars who study utterance interpretation in connection with language development, impaired communication, non-verbal communication and non-human communication. Abstracts will be anonymously refereed by members of the program committee.
