Meeting Description:

1st  International Conference on Crosscultural Humour - "Humour that Divides;
Humour that Unites"

In the current scientific research paradigm in the European context there are
but a few studies on humour with a focus on crosscultural differences. But given
the globalised outlook of today's communication, it is worth questioning the
role that humour plays in bringing people together, as well as creating an
international community of speakers who share a large body of principles,
strategies and practices. However, the cultural specificities of each country
and region contribute to dividing people, rather than uniting them, in their
enjoyment of humour. Besides, at the level of interpersonal communication, this
dual role of humour also obtains, for instance in setting in-groups apart from
out-groups. Briefly put, our aims are:

- to broaden the scope of analysis towards an international and crosscultural
focus. 

- to analyse the differences and specificities of humour practices within a
local and national dimension.

- to undertake an innovative but enriching dialogue among several disciplines on
the nature and textual representation of humour given the
overlapping/distinctive traditions in the European dimension.

- to foster the cooperation and collaborative research among researchers and
scholars in this multifaceted area of studies;
 
- to enhance the understanding of individual communities by mapping out European
traditions across periods and territories;
 
- to promote the intercultural dialogue based on the assumption that the
European sphere is the privileged crisscrossing space for a fruitful dialogue
between traditional and cultural maps, especially reflected on the perception
and understanding of humour;

- to have fun. 

Anyone interested in presenting a paper related to this theme is invited to send
a proposal to Alcina Sousa (ninita@uma.pt), University of Madeira, Campus da
