2nd Call For Papers: Urban and Rural Landscapes: Language, Literature, and
Culture in Modern Ireland, DUCIS, Dalarna University, Sweden, 6-7 November 2008

Throughout the twentieth-century Ireland has seen its rural and urban landscapes
undergo dramatic change. For centuries, rural Ireland had been central to the
socio-politics of the island, but in the post-Second World War years there has
been a ''widespread rejection of rural life'' (Brown 2004: 199) with the rural
population migrating abroad or to the urban centres in the island. Thus by the
1970s, the population of Dublin and its environs consisted of over a million
people, doubling the figures from the early 1950s. The Celtic Tiger economy and
the post-Tiger context of the present moment have also seen dramatic changes in
the landscapes of rural and urban Ireland. Urban centres have grown rapidly in
numbers and in the diversity of origins of their population; rural areas have
changed significantly with the establishment of multinational companies, and an
increasing number of people moving to the countryside and commuting to work in
urban areas. The aim of this conference is to analyze these changing urban and
rural landscapes, both physical and psychic, mapping how they are reflected in
literature, culture, and language from the turn of the twentieth century to the
present day. Papers are welcome from a broad range of disciplines including:
Literary Studies; Ecocriticism; Media/Film Studies; Cultural Studies and Popular
Culture; Postcolonial Studies; Gender Studies; Critical Theory; Linguistics
Studies. Possible topics include but are not limited to:
- Cosmopolitan hybridity and the ''real Ireland''
- New suburbs and new Irish identities
- Pastoral nostalgia/Urban malaise
- Women in urban and rural Ireland
- Religion and the urban/rural experience
- The representation of sacred spaces in Irish art and literature
- Fairy tale and folklore, especially works of Wilde, Lady Gregory and W.B. Yeats
- Irish peasantry and nation-building
- Ambiguities of primitivism in the construction of Irish identity
- Tradition and modernity in urban/rural Ireland
- Urban and rural expressions of Irishness; City slickers and country bumpkins 
- The city as spectacle and the theatrical spaces of Dublin Covert and overt
prestige in rural and urban Ireland
- Traditional/modern: Variation and change in Irish English
- Urban trends and rural conservatism

The following plenary speakers will participate: 
Prof. Raymond Hickey, Dept. for Anglophone Studies, University of Duisburg and
Essen 
Dr. Kieran Keohane, Dept. of Sociology, University College Cork
Prof. Kevin McCafferty, Dept. of Foreign Languages, University of Bergen.
Prof. Catherine Nash,  Dept. of Geography, Queen Mary, University of London
