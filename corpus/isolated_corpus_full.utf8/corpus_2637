Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

We would like to draw your attention to the 3rd ICSOFT 2008 - International Conference on Software and Data Technologies (http://www.icsoft.org), which has currently an open call for papers.
ICSOFT 2008 will be held in Porto (Portugal) next July 5-8, organized by INSTICC in cooperation with IICREST and co-Sponsored by WfMC (Workflow Management Coalition).

The yearly meeting place of top researchers and practitioners in Software Engineering, Data Management, and applications related to Information Technologies, ICSOFT is now one of the largest conferences in the world in its area; organized in an yearly basis, ICSOFT provides a forum for top researchers to regularly present their work.

The conference proceedings will be indexed by ISI Proceedings, INSPEC and DBLP. EI is evaluating the proceedings of the previous ICSOFT for possible inclusion in the index. 

The conference has a double-blind review process and after a strict selection procedure all accepted papers will be published in the proceedings (paperback and CD-ROM) under an ISBN. Every year, extended versions of the best papers of the conference are published in a book, by Springer-Verlag.

Two prestigious awards (the "Best Paper Award" and the "Best Student Paper Award") will be announced during the conference. These awards, signs of excellence for their recipients, are selected from the set of outstanding full papers presented at the conference, based on the best combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation produced by the reviewers.

Special sessions are invited. To propose a special session please contact the secretariat.

We would like to draw your attention also to the following specialized satellite workshops:
- Int'l Workshop on Metamodelling - Utilization in Software Engineering (MUSE) 		
- Int'l Workshop on e-Health Services and Technologies (EHST) 		
- Int'l Workshop on Architectures, Concepts and Technologies for Service Oriented Computing (ACT4SOC)
(see details below)

You may obtain further information at the conference web site (http://www.icsoft.org). Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Special sessions are also invited. If you wish to propose a special session, please contact the secretariat.

Kind regards,
Mónica Saramago
