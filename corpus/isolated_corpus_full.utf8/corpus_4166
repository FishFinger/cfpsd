Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is on language contact and language change in multiple and bimodal
bilingual minorities. 

Call for Papers

The workshop aims at exploring the language contact and language change
phenomena that characterize multiple linguistic minorities. It focuses on but is
not confined to signed, Uralic and Caucasian languages.

On the one hand, we intend to explore the situation of bimodal bilingualism.
Data from changes in multi-modal bilingual contexts can lead to new insights
into bilingualism, the typology and structure of languages, and language change
and contact in general. Research into bimodal bilingualism can draw upon several
methods and approaches developed for studying the bilingualism of other minority
languages, and vice versa.

On the other hand, we know that it is difficult to reach the bilingual
individuals and communities that are deaf and belong to several linguistic
minorities. Therefore, we approach the bimodal target via individual studies on
minority languages. More specifically, we concentrate on the issue of language
change in contact in the context of a typologically wide range of minority
languages. We are looking for answers to questions such as the following:

- How do deaf children of (hearing) parents belonging to linguistic minorities
(e.g., Nganasan) communicate with the Deaf communities in their country and with
their own parents?
- How does their language change?
- How can we test the change in the structure of the languages in contact in a
uniform way?
- What are the factors that influence the developments?
- Can we work towards a typology?

Invited Keynote Speakers:
Csilla Bartha (hearing) (Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest): The situation of
the Deaf and national minorities in Hungary
Östen Dahl (hearing) (Stockholm University): Contact induced changes in tense
and aspect systems
Tatiana Davidenko (Deaf) (Moscow Centre for Deaf Studies and Bilingual
Education): Sign Language Diversity in Post-Soviet Countries 
Anna Komarova (hearing) (Moscow Centre for Deaf Studies and Bilingual
Education): Development of Bilingual Education of the Deaf in Post-Soviet Countries.
Gaurav Mathur (Deaf) (Gallaudet University): The relationship between agreement
and finiteness in sign languages
Johanna Mesch (Deaf) (Stockholm University): Variations in tactile 
signing - the case of one-handed conversation
Helle Metslang (hearing) (University of Tartu): Changes in Finnish and Estonian
tense and aspect
Christian Rathmann (Deaf) (Hamburg University): Minority Communities within
German Deaf Community
Don Stilo (hearing) (Max Planck Institute, Leipzig): Introduction to an Atlas of
the Araxes-Iran Linguistic Area
