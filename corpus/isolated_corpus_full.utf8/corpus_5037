First call for papers

RULE 2009
10th International Workshop on Rule-Based Programming
http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/rule/

Brasília, Brazil
Sunday 28 June 2009

Deadline for abstracts: 10 May 2009

A satellite event of RDP 2009 - http://rdp09.cic.unb.br/
======================================================================

The fundamental concepts of rule-based programming are present in many
areas of computer science, from theory to practical
implementations. In programming languages, term rewriting is used in
semantics as well as in implementations that use bottom-up rewriting
for code generation. Rules are also used to perform computations in
various systems; to describe logical inference in theorem provers; to
specify and implement constraint-based algorithms and applications;
and to describe and implement program transformations. Rule-based
programming provides a common framework for viewing computation as a
sequence of transformations on some shared structure such as a term,
graph, proof, or constraint store. Rule selection and application is
typically governed by a rich set of sophisticated mechanisms for
recognizing and manipulating structures.

After the development of the principles of rewriting logic and of the
rewriting calculus in the nineties, languages and systems such as
ASF+SDF, BURG, CHRS, Claire, ELAN, Maude, and Stratego contributed to
demonstrate the importance of rule-based programming. The area has
since been experiencing a period of growth with the emergence of new
concepts, systems, and applications domains, such as Domain Specific
Languages, Generative and Aspect-Oriented Programming, and Software
Engineering activities like maintenance, reverse engineering, and
testing.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the
various communities working on rule-based programming to foster
advances in the foundations and research on rule-based programming
methods and systems; and to promote cross-fertilization between theory
and practice, and the application of rule-based programming in various
important domains.

Rule'09 is the tenth in a series of workshops. The first Rule workshop
was held in Montréal in 2000, and subsequent editions took place in
Firenze, Pittsburgh, Valencia, Aachen, Nara, Seattle, Paris, and
Hagenberg.

TOPICS:

We solicit original papers on all topics related to rule-based
programming including but not limited to:

Theory and Languages for rule-based programming: Advances in pattern
and rewriting calculi, Advances in rewriting logic, Complexity
results, Static analysis, Semantics, Type Systems, Implementation
techniques, Domain-specific Languages.

Rule-based specification: Business rule systems, Policy specifications.

Applications: Software analysis and transformation, Software
development and testing, Reengineering, Security.

Paradigm combinations of Rule-based programming: with Functional
Programming, with Logic Programming, with Object-oriented programming,
Language embedding and extensions.

Tool and System descriptions: Usability engineering for rule-based
programming tools, Experience in building or using rule-based
programming systems, Practical aspects of rule-based programming
systems, Empirical evaluation of rule-based programming.

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION:

Authors are invited to submit a short paper (5-7 pages) by
10 May 2009. Preliminary proceedings will be available at the
workshop. Papers should be written in English, and submitted in
PostScript or PDF format, using the EPTCS style files.

Submission is through the Easychair website:

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rule2009

After the workshop authors are invited to submit a revised version (12
pages) of their presentation. Accepted contributions will appear in an
issue of Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(http://www.eptcs.org).

Authors and participants will also be invited to submit an article to
a special issue of a journal that will celebrate 10 years of RULE.
