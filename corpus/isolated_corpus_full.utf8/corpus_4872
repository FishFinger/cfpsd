CALL FOR PAPERS



Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation, Disambiguation  =

and Applications
(MWE 2009)



Workshop at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference



Singapore, 06 August 2009



http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=3DCONF&page=3DCONF_40_MW=
E_2009___lb__ACL__rb__



**************************************************************



Description

Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) are an indispensable part of natural  =

languages and appear
steadily on a daily basis, both new and already existing but  =

paraphrased. Thus, the
automated processing of MWEs is important for many natural language  =

applications. The
meaning of MWEs can be either motivated or arbitrary. Native speakers  =

master most MWEs,
while learners of a foreign language have to learn MWEs by heart. The  =

interpretation of
MWEs poses a major challenge for automated analysis helping both  =

groups easily master
MWEs.

The growing interest in MWEs in the NLP community has led to many  =

specialized workshops
held every year since 2001 in conjunction with ACL, EACL and LREC;  =

there have been also
two recent special issues on MWEs published by leading journals: the  =

International
Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation, and the Journal of  =

Computer Speech and
Language.

As a result of the overall progress in the field, the time has come to  =

move from basic
preliminary research to actual applications in real-world NLP tasks.  =

Following this
trend, the LREC-MWE'08 focused on gathering resources and creating a  =

common repository in
order to rank MWE candidates and facilitate further research.

Workshop topics

(1) Identification. Identification is a major problem for MWEs. The  =

MWE identification
task is to determine whether a MWE is used non-compositionally  =

(figuratively) or
compositionally (literally) in a particular context. The  =

identification of MWEs by
automated means is a difficult task, as it does not suffice to store  =

the MWE into a
dictionary database. Rule-based (morphosyntactic rules) and/or  =

statistical approaches may
be needed to identify MWEs in context.

(2) Interpretation. Semantic interpretation of MWEs, particularly noun  =

compounds and
determinerless prepositional phrases, is the task of determining the  =

implicit semantic
relation holding between the MWE's sub-components. This specific area  =

is inviting
research on (linguistically) identifying the semantic relations (SRs)  =

and automatic SR
interpretation in MWEs. The relation inventories used can be of  =

different granularity and
dependent on the particular type of MWE construction. In some cases,  =

MWE's semantics can
be also specified in terms of a suitable paraphrase.

(3) Disambiguation. Disambiguation (Semantic classification) is the  =

task of specifying
the semantics of MWEs based on an inventory of semantic relations. It  =

tends to presuppose
the ability to classify the (degree of) compositionality of MWEs and  =

applies only to
compositional MWEs. The aim is to specify the semantics of MWEs in  =

terms of predefined
semantic categories, e.g., in WordNet.

(4) Applications. Identifying MWEs in context and understanding their  =

syntax and
semantics is important for many natural language applications,  =

including but not limited
to question answering, machine translation, information retrieval, informat=
ion
extraction, and textual entailment. Still, despite the growing  =

research interest, there
are not enough successful applications in real NLP problems, which we  =

believe is the key
for the advancement of the field.

Submission information

Submissions must describe substantial, original, and unpublished work.  =

Submissions will
be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength,  =

significance and relevance to
the conference, and interest to the attendees. Full papers may consist  =

of up to eight (8)
pages in total (references icluded) and will be presented orally. The  =

deadline for paper
submission is May 1, 2009 (GMT + 8).
The official style files for ACL/IJCNLP 2009 are available at:
http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/.
The workshop submissions should use the same formatting guidelines. As  =

the reviewing will
be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and  =

affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We  =

previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith  =

previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements  =

will be rejected
without review.
Submission is electronic using paper submission software at:
https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/MWE/
