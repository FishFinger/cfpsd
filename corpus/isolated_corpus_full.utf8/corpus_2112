Meeting Description

Defective paradigms: missing forms and what they tell us

Defectiveness in morphological paradigms remains a serious challenge to
linguistic theory. This two-day conference will assess our current
understanding of defectiveness and plot the directions for future research. 

2nd Call for Papers

Defective paradigms: missing forms and what they tell us

An important design feature of language is the use of productive patterns. We
have 'enjoy' - 'enjoyed', 'agree' - 'agreed', and many others. On the basis of
this productive pattern, if we meet a new verb 'transduce' we know that there
will be the form 'transduced'. Even if the pattern is not fully regular, there
will be a form available, as in 'understand' - 'understood'. Surprisingly, this
principle is sometimes violated, a phenomenon known as defectiveness, which
means there is a gap in a word's set of forms. The missing singular form of
English 'scissors' is one example, and more striking instances can be found in
languages with more complex systems of inflection (for example, Russian nouns
that lack a genitive plural, or verbs which lack a first person singular form).
Although such gaps have been known to us since Classical times, they remain one
of the most poorly understood aspects of grammar, and challenge reigning models
of the acquisition and application of inflectional rules.

In the context of a research project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research
Council (UK), the Surrey Morphology Group will be holding a two-day conference
(April 10-11, 2008) in London with the aim of assessing our current
understanding of defectiveness and plotting the directions for future research.
We invite abstracts for papers on any aspect of defectiveness. Time allotted for
papers is 40 minutes, including 15 minutes for questions. The invited speakers are:

Stephen Anderson (Yale University)
Harald Baayen (Univesity of Alberta)
Roger Evans (University of Brighton)
Marianne Mithun (University of California at Santa Barbara)
Gregory Stump (University of Kentucky) 

Anonymous abstracts (500 words maximum) should be sent as an attachment by
e-mail to m.baerman@surrey.ac.uk by November 30, 2007, with contact information
contained in the body of the message. Any questions may also be sent to the
above address.
