University in collaboration with the "Semio-linguistic, the Didactic
and computer science Laboratory", Franche-Comt=E9 University and the

  Computational Linguistics the opportunity to meet and share their
  experience as developers, researchers and teachers; =


  - present to NooJ users the latest linguistic resources and NLP
  applications developed for/with NooJ, its latest functionalities,
  as well as its future developments; =


  - offer researchers and graduate students two tutorials (one basic
  and one advanced) to help them parse corpora and build NLP
  applications using NooJ. =


  - Present NooJ's Arabic resources to all researchers in Arabic
  studies : linguists, computational linguists as well as all
  researchers who work with/on Arabic corpora. =


NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment
used to formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography,
lexical and productive morphology, local, structural and
transformational syntax) using a large gamut of computational devices
(from Finite-State Automata to Augmented Recursive Transition
Networks). NooJ includes tools to construct, test, debug, maintain and
accumulate large sets of linguistic resources, and can apply them to
large texts. =


Modules for a dozen languages are already available for free download:
Arabic, Armenian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, English, French,
Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. A dozen of
