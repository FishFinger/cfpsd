Workshop on Voice and Voice Disorders 

Description

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December 1st-5th 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on voice and voice disorders.

The voice provides a canvas for our thoughts and the texture for our identity; its production requires the orchestration of muscular activity worthy of an Olympic gymnast; it links ideas to action and provides a foundation for communication. This one-day workshop will cover research on a range of factors concerned with the voice, from its articulation to vocal function and action.

Topics will include the professional and neurological disorders of voice and their management, the training of voice, and the role of voice related information in communicating under difficult circumstances. Current practice and recent advances in voice analysis techniques will be discussed.

Intended Audience

This workshop should be of interest to speech scientists, linguists, speech pathology practitioners and researchers, voice professionals, psychologists, and members of the Speech and Human Communication Disorders Priority areas. For enquiries about the workshop, contact David Copland at d.copland@uq.edu.au.

Submissions for presentation at the workshop are sought. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

Voice analysis techniques 
neurological voice disorders and their treatment
