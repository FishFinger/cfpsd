Meeting Description:

Workshop proposal for SLE/2009/Lisbon 9-12 Sept. 2009

Title of workshop: 
Theory of mind approaches to linguistic description and communicative ex-planation.

Conveners: Werner Abraham/Vienna & Elisabeth Leiss/Munich
Conveners' configurations: 
werner_abraham@t-online.de;  e.leiss@germanistik.uni-muenchen.de 

Call for Papers

Categories to be addressed: cross-linguistic modal verbs (root vs. epistemics),
modal particles (their polyfunctionality), modal adverbs, mood operators; all
kinds of multiple shifters in the Jakobsonian sense; logical co- and
subordinating operators.

Addressees/participants/contributors: empirical linguists, philosophers of
language, L1 and L2 investigators, and theorists of translation.

Outline of workshop topic and particular research questions to be addressed:
While such epistemic adverbials as probably, to the best of my knowledge,
certainly, among a variety of others, as well as analytic declaratives such as
it is probable/ certain that p etc. refer to speaker information and his
knowledge status, both modal verbs and modal particles go be-yond this layer of
speaker concern in that they render access to the source of speaker's knowledge
status, on the one hand, and to the speaker's concern for the addressee's level
of knowledge and thematic concern on the other (cf. German
Fremdbewusstseinsabglich for the somewhat neutral English Theory of mind).
Diewald (1991), referring to Jakobson's (1971) earlier insight and terminology
("shifters"), has called this the "double deixis/shifting/displacement" of the
two categories in question. The fundamental point of departure for research
questions is a dictum by Sperber &Wilson (Relevance 1986: 4-5): Thoughts do not
simply travel from Speaker to Addressee (as in Shannon-Weaver's 1949 tele-phone
model). We don't send out communications to addressees when we are engaged in
linguistic intercourse. What we do, instead and much rather, is try to ascertain
what exists, on the part of the addressee, in terms of shared knowledge relevant
to the present linguistic interaction and in terms of what is in need of
correction on either part. A very telling illustration may be provided by the
two German modal lexemes ja "yes-PARTICLE" vs. eben "flat- PARTICLE": While ja
makes an appeal to the addressee's full consent on the basis of shared
encyclopedic knowledge about p, the contribution eben, rather than appealing to
a common knowledge horizon, derives such an appeal from what has been part of
the previous discussion between Sp and Addr. German modal particles are a
telling difficulty for translators from German into other languages.

The present workshop undertakes it to anchor "double" or "multiple deixis" in
syntax and semantics-pragmatics. In pursuing this aim, fundamental claims with
respect to the serialization of adverbs and modal particles will be made against
the background of investigations entertained by Cinque 1998 and/or Frey &
Pittner 1998, on the one hand, and novel investigations into the classification
of embedded sentences as by Haegeman (2006),  Coniglio (2008), and Abraham
(2008), on the other. 

The discussion may lead, directly or indirectly, to research questions such as: 
- Jakobson's original idea about 'shifters' was that "on 15 May"/"in England"
and "yesterday"/ "here" differ with respect to "origo shifting" ('deixis
displacement'): speaker and referencer shift apart when "yesterday"/"here" is to
be understood. Past tense is another displacing step. We call this 'multiple
(speaker) deixis', and we try to find out where such multiple deixis, or origo
displacement, is manifested linguistically.
- Generally speaking, multiple deixis reveals itself in realms of modality (such
as modal particles and modal verbs, both sharing categorial polyfunctionality).
What are other grammatical categories that project multiple deixis?
- Illocutive power is generally restricted to independent clauses. What is the
deeper systematic reason behind the fact that some, but by far not all dependent
clauses bear independent illocutive power such that they allow for multiple
deixis categories?
- Is illocution the only category addressing multiple deixis? Is it mood and
modality?
- CP-expansion is required for anchoring information about the speaker involving
FORCEP (Speaker deixis) as the illocutive anchor category in languages like
Germanic languages. Are other categories involved?
- Are there other pragmatic, speaker-oriented anchors beyond FORCEP?
- Does the illocutive category of ForceP have to be split up to host more
instances of multiple deixis - and, if so, in which hierarchical order?
- To what extent does Mood establish an instance of multiple deixis? Consider
the Dutch modal verb zoud- taking over the German irrealis subjunctive function.
Think of oratio obliqua subjunctive in German.
- Categories nowadays carrying multiple (speaker) deixis have obviously not
always done so in diachrony. How does such a change come about, and what are its
accompanying grammaticalization traits?
- Likewise, how does multiple deixis, or theory of mind, develop linguistically
in L1, and which categories are involved in which sequential order and based on
what categorial hierarchy?
- L2 may also be a research ground to the extent that certain categories carry
multiple deixis in one language, but not in another.
- Is theory of mind the type of investigation that yields a systematic
pragmatics - and the only systematic one -, i.e., a type of pragmatics that is
linguistic and not encyclopedic? 
- The role of (multiple) accent or the fundamental lack of it may be a source of
multiple deixis (and its total absence). Does this carry over to other
linguistic distributional criteria?
- Are multiple deixis, or theory of mind development as well as distinctions,
accessible to brain imaging? What are the categorical essentials of such brain
scanning?
- To the best of our understanding, Relevance theoretical approaches are not
identical to those on theory of mind/multiple deixis. Multiple deixis is far
more restricted linguistically. Grice's maxims appear to have a closer relation
with multiple deixis - which exactly? And one would like to fathom out where
Relevance and multiple deixis converge and maybe even move into intersecting fields.
	 
The conveners invite submissions to this workshop in the form of abstracts.

They should state research questions, approach, method, data, and (expected)
results.
- Deadline for submission: January 15, 2009
- The abstracts will be evaluated by the scientific SLE-committee; word of
acceptance is expected by 31 March 2009.
- Papers to this workshop will have to be read in 20 minutes, 10 minutes are
reserved for discussion.
