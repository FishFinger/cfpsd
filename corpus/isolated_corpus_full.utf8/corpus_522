Meeting Description:

Workshop :
The emergence of pragmatic markers : innovation, routinisation and
pragmaticalisation of approximators and related markers

University of Bielefeld (Germany), 30th November- 1st December 2006

Organisation : Barbara Job and Wiltrud Mihatsch 

Faculty of Linguistics and Literature, University of Bielefeld

Discourse functions such as the structuring and the connection of discourse
segments, repairs, hesitation marking, modalisation, backchannelling and the
indication of loose talk can be realized by highly heterogeneous linguistic
means, which in turn can be more or less conventionalised.

Approximation is still a little-studied phenomenon compared to other discourse
functions. Here we find quite heterogeneous means, for instance lexical
expressions such as 'approximately', the approximative effects of disjunctive
constructions (e.g. 'four or five'), parentheticals such as 'say', former
prepositions such as 'about', and former nouns such as 'kind (of)'. On the
referential level, these markers can all serve to blur the boundaries of
semantic categories, on the discourse level they can signal naming problems,
figurative meaning, emergency categorisations in the case of word-finding
problems, a speaker's distance towards his or her own utterance, or a higher
degree of politeness. Thus, there appears to be a strong link with modality.

We subsume all these discursive elements under the more general term "pragmatic
marker".

In the past few years the study of the linguistic forms of pragmatic markers and
their linguistic status has considerably advanced. However, diachronic analyses
have appeared only relatively recently.

The aim of the workshop is to discuss the processes that lead to the emergence
of pragmatic markers by bringing together scholars with diverse theoretical and
empirical outlooks and from different philologies in order to address
theoretical, methodological and empirical aspects which can help to elucidate
the emergence and the conventionalisation of pragmatic markers, in particular
approximation markers and modal markers.

The workshop is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
