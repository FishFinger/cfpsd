Meeting Description:

In April 2008, the 17th edition of the Sociolinguistics Symposium will be
held in Amsterdam. De Taalstudio is planning to organize a thematic panel
on sociolinguistic issues in language analysis in refugee cases. 

Thematic panel on sociolinguistic issues in the use of language analysis to
determine national origin

Language analysis is currently used by governments of various countries all
over the world as a tool to determine the origin of asylum seekers.
Following from critical comments and observations by many professional
linguists (e.g. Eades et al. 2003, Arends 2003) on the use of language
analysis, the Guidelines for the Use of Language Analysis in Relation to
Questions of National Origin in Refugee Cases were published in 2004 by an
international group of linguists (see www.iafl.org, the home page of the
International Association for Forensic Linguistics). These guidelines
provide a useful framework for research in this relatively new field, and
have inspired various linguists to contribute to our understanding of the
(im)possibilities of language analysis as a tool to determine the origin of
asylum seekers (e.g. Singler 2006, De Graaf & Van den Hazelkamp 2006, Ten
Thije to appear). Many issues in this specific field of research are
related to sociolinguistic topics such as multilingualism, code-switching,
language mixing, language contact, speech accommodation, language and
identity, the observer's paradox, the role of the interpreter, etc. 

In April 2008, the 17th edition of the Sociolinguistics Symposium will be
held in Amsterdam. De Taalstudio is planning to organize a thematic panel
on sociolinguistic issues in language analysis in refugee cases. During
this session, several independent papers around this theme are presented
and discussed. Authors are expected to give a 20 minute presentation of
their paper. To guarantee a focused and in-depth discussion, papers will be
circulated in advance to all panel members.

We hereby invite the submission of proposals for a paper on any
sociolinguistic issue related to language analysis as it is used in the
determination of origin in asylum cases. 

If you are interested in participating, please send an abstract (max. 300
words) of your paper to adegraaf@taalstudio.nl by August 1st. We will put
together a panel proposal to the SS17 organizing committee with a selection
of the abstracts we receive. By the beginning of October, we will inform
all submitters as to whether the panel proposal was accepted and which
papers are included. Full papers should be submitted by February 1st 2008.  

In your abstract, please include the following information:
- Title of the presentation
- Name(s) of the presenter(s)
- Affiliation of the presenter(s)
- Both e-mail and postal addresses

and a variety of applied linguistic fields to present their work and receive
feedback. TALGS conference offers graduate students and working professionals a
forum to showcase their research and experiences. TALGS is committed to

Research Meets Practice: We encourage submissions from graduate students and
teachers whose research and practice fall broadly under the umbrella of applied
linguistics and TESL/TEFL. We welcome cross-disciplinary proposals with
relevance to language learning and/or language teaching from a variety of
fields, including, for example, sociolinguistics, discourse studies, sociology,
education, foreign languages, and psychology. Presentations reporting on action
research (inside and outside the classroom), works in progress, and pilot
research, as well as proposals for discussion sessions and workshops are
welcome. For more information, please visit the TALGS website at
