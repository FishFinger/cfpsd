Document engineering is the computer science discipline that
investigates systems for documents in any form and in all media. It is
concerned with principles, tools and processes that improve our
ability to create, manage and maintain documents. The ACM Symposium on
Document Engineering <http://www.documentengineering.org>
<http://www.documentengineering.org/> is an annual meeting of
researchers active in document engineering.

DocEng 2009 is the ninth edition, after previous anual meetings at S=E3o
Paulo (Brazil), Winnipeg (Canada), Amsterdam (NL), Bristol (UK),
Milwaukee-WI (USA), Grenoble (France), McLean-VA (USA) and Atlanta-GA
(USA). All DocEng Proceedings are available at the ACM Digital Library
<http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=3DSERIES10668>
<http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=3DSERIES10668>.

Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

DocEng 2009 will include both long and short papers, posters,
demonstrations of working or prototype systems, and special working
sessions. All submissions will undergo a rigorous review process with
3 reviewers considering the Originality of work, the Quality of
research or analysis of experience, the Relevance to document
engineering, and Quality of presentation of ideas.

Full Papers

Full papers should describe complete works of original research.
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers
that are not being considered in another forum, with up to 10 pages
length. Full paper presentations will be 30 minutes in length.

Short papers

Short papers provide an opportunity to report on research in progress,
to present novel positions on document engineering, or to demonstrate
exciting new systems. Authors may submit short papers (up to 4 pages
in length). Short paper presentations will be 15 minutes in length.

Demonstrations

DocEng 2009 seeks public demonstrations of novel systems, to be
presented to the conference as a whole during breaks between paper
sessions. Prospective demonstrators should submit a two-page summary
of the system to be demonstrated. Demonstration proposals will undergo
a rigorous review process and summaries of accepted demonstrations
will be published in the conference proceedings. At the conference,
demonstrators will give 10-minute presentations to the assembled
conferees during breaks and a demonstration session is also planned.
Working Sessions/Workshops

Potential organizers are invited to submit working session/workshop
proposals. The session should bring together a variety of expert
voices on a topic of considerable interest. The topic may be
interesting because it is controversial, because it is of great
importance to society or to the field, or because it leads us to think
about future directions for document engineering. The proposal may be
up to two pages in length. The proposal should describe the topic of
the session and why it will be interesting to the symposium's
participants. It should also list the proposed facilitators, briefly
describing their expertise, and should note whether any facilitator's
participation is tentative. (Note: facilitators are expected to
register for the symposium.)

One author per paper is required to register and attend the conference
to present the paper if accepted for publication.


Submission Process
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, in PDF format and
formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates. Papers
