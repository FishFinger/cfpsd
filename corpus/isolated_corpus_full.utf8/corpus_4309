Vagueness in Communication (ViC 2009)
http://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/~hcschmitz/esslli2009/
July 20-24, 2009 

Final Call for Papers

Organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2009 (http://esslli2009.labri.fr/), 20-31 July, 2009 in
Bordeaux, France

Workshop Organiser:
Nikolaus Bourbax (Manfred Krifka, Rick Nouwen, Robert van Rooij, Uli Sauerland
and Hans-Christian Schmitz)

The workshop is organised as an event of the VAAG project of the ESF Eurocore
LogicCC.

Workshop Purpose and Topics:
Although vagueness has long since been an important topic in philosophy, logic
and linguistics, some recent advances have made the functions of vagueness in
natural language communication an exciting and timely research area. This
renewed interest has a distinct cross-disciplinary character and has spawned
many new research questions. While the classical instruments of dealing with
vagueness -- like multi-valued logics, truth value gaps or gluts, or
supervaluations -- have not been significantly extended, new approaches
investigate questions like context-sensitivtiy of vagueness (Kyburg & Moreau
2000), the sharpening of vague predicates in context (Barker 2002), and the
modeling of precision levels with expressions like 'roughly' or 'like' (Kennedy
2007). Within the study of comparatives and degree modification, moreover,
researchers are now exploring cross-linguistic aspects of vagueness (Beck et al
2004). On a more fundamental level, the question why there is vagueness to begin
with, what role vagueness serves in human communication, has been addressed. For
example, it has been argued that vagueness is an epiphenomenon of the
impossibility of complete shared knowledge about the extension of many terms
(e.g. Williamson 1994), hence a consequence of the cognitive limitations of
humans. It has been shown why this does not affect the utility of these terms in
communication (Parikh 1994). Game-theoretic methods have been employed that show
that being vague or imprecise can be beneficial for communication even if the
speaker could truthfully use more precise terms (de Jaegher 2003). Furthermore,
the important role of vagueness became evident in a number of empirical domains
beyond obvious examples such as the language of diplomacy -- for example, in
geographical terms (e.g. Bennett 2008) or in the description of measures of
economy (Qizilbash 2005). There are also initial experimental investigations
into the ways how speakers interpret vague terms (e.g., Bonini e.a. 1999).

The workshop aims to bring together researchers whose work contributes to the
broad inter-disciplinary line of inquiry outlined here. In particular, we welcome:
- papers that broaden the empirical base for the study of vagueness, be it
linguistic or otherwise;
- papers offering a synthesis of theories from different disciplines; and
- papers addressing the pragmatics of vagueness. 

The workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers (including advanced PhD
students) to present and discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who
work in the broad subject of the disciplines relevant for vagueness in
communication, as represented in ESSLLI.

Submission Details:
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract. Submissions
should not exceed 2 pages, including references. Submissions should be in PDF
format. Please submit your abstract via the EasyChair system:
