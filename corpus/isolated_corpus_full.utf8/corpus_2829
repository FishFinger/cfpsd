on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural language and speech 
processing, including, but not limited to:
- Pragmatics, Discourse, Semantics, Syntax, and the Lexicon
- Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology

Paper Submission:
We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging research emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay between linguistics, computer science and application domains such as biomedicine, communication systems, public services, and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance for quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should contain original material that has not been previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel submission to other publication fora as well as a significant overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories:
- full papers , describing substantial research with well-evaluated results
- short papers , typically describing ongoing research and preliminary results

All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference 
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and 
short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions are made using EasyChair: Go to:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gotall2008 
and follow the instructions.

The submissions should be sent anonymous, in PDF format.
(final version format to be specified later). 
For the final version, authors should follow the LNCS instructions: http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0

The maximum length is 12pp for full papers and 5pp for short papers.

Proceedings:
Accepted papers of both categories will be published in the Conference 
Proceedings, in the LNCS/LNAI series of Springer.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
