TUNA Referring Expression Generation Challenge 2009.
Part of Generation Challenges 2009, in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

SECOND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Generation Challenges 2009 is being organised to provide a common forum for=
 a number of different NLG Shared Tasks (see http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk=
/research/genchal09/). The different Shared Tasks will be presented at a sp=
ecial session of the European Workshop on Natural Language Generation, held=
 in Athens, Greece (see http://enlg2009.uvt.nl/).

As part of Generation Challenges 2009, we are organising a TUNA Progress Te=
st. This will be the third, and final, shared task involving the TUNA Corpu=
s of referring expressions. TUNA was first used in the Pilot Attribute Sele=
ction for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge, which took pl=
ace between May and September 2007; and again for three of the shared tasks=
 in the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge 2008, which was com=
pleted in May and presented during a special session at INLG'08. The TUNA'0=
9 Task replicates one of the three tasks from REG 2008, the TUNA-REG Task. =
It uses the same test data, to enable direct comparison against the 2008 re=
sults.

Background
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Referring Expression Generation (REG) has been the subject of intensive res=
earch in the NLG community, giving rise to significant consensus on the pro=
blem definition, as well as the nature of the inputs and outputs of REG alg=
orithms. Typically, such algorithms take as input a domain, consisting of o=
bjects and their attributes, together with an intended referent, and output=
 a set of attributes true of the referent which distinguish it from other o=
bjects in the domain. An additional stage is to map these attributes to a n=
atural language expression (usually a noun phrase).

 Data
=3D=3D=3D=3D
The TUNA Corpus consists of a set of human-produced descriptions of objects=
 in a visual domain of pictures of furniture and people, annotated at the s=
emantic level and paired with a domain representation. In addition to the d=
omain, each description is provided as a word string (i.e. the original hum=
an-produced description), as the set of attributes included in the descript=
ion, and as a combination of the two (where the word string is annotated wi=
th the attributes).

The corpus was collected via an elicitation experiment, in which one betwee=
n-subjects condition controlled the use of the location of an object in des=
criptions (+/-Location). In keeping with the earlier shared tasks involving=
 TUNA, only the singular data will be used for the TUNA'09 Task.

For the REG Challenge 2008, a new test set was generated by replicating the=
 original experiment. This test set has not been released in any form, and =
will be used again for the 2009 edition.

For full details about the data collection and corpus annotation scheme, se=
e: http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/~agatt/home/pubs/tunaFormat.pdf

The TUNA'09 Task
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The TUNA'09 Task is a replication of the TUNA-REG Task carried out as part =
of REG Challenges 2008. As in REG Challenges 2008, there will be a variety =
of evaluation methods to compare systems (see Section 4 below), and partici=
pants can choose which of the evaluation criteria to optimise for.
(i) Input: Following the standard REG problem definition, the input will be=
 a TUNA domain representation, consisting of objects and their properties, =
with one object designated as the intended referent.
(ii) Output: Participating systems will need to map from a TUNA domain repr=
esentation to a natural language description that describes the target refe=
rent.

Evaluation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The TUNA data set is composed of the following subsets:
(i) A development set consisting of 150 corpus items (input domain + human =
description), divided into furniture and people descriptions;
(ii) A training set consisting of 593 corpus items (input domain + human de=
scription), divided into furniture and people descriptions;
(iii) A test set consisting of 112 corpus items (input domain only), divide=
d into furniture and people descriptions. This test set was created through=
 a replication of the original TUNA elicitation experiment. It was built so=
 that for every input domain there are two human-authored outputs by differ=
ent individuals. Evaluation of system-produced descriptions will be carried=
 out by averaging against both human descriptions in the corresponding inpu=
t domain.

Participants will compute evaluation scores on the development set (using c=
ode provided by the organisers), and the organisers will perform evaluation=
s on the test data set. We will again use a range of different evaluation m=
ethods, including intrinsic and extrinsic, automatically assessed and human=
-evaluated. Intrinsic evaluations assess properties of peer systems in thei=
r own right, whereas extrinsic evaluations assess the effect of a peer syst=
em on something that is external to it, such as its effect on human perform=
ance at a given task or the added value it brings to an application.

Full details of the evaluation methods will be announced to registered part=
icipants.

Participation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Registration is now open at the TUNA'09 Task homepage (http://www.nltg.brig=
hton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/tuna). Once they have registered, participant=
s will be sent the TUNA'09 Participants' Pack which includes complete docum=
entation and the training and development data sets.

Proceedings and Presentations
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The Generation Challenges 2009 meeting will be held as a special session at=
 ENLG 2009. The session will include overviews of all the shared tasks, inc=
luding the TUNA'09 Task. The participating systems will additionally be pre=
sented as papers in the ENLG'09 proceedings, and as posters during the ENLG=
'09 poster session.

TUNA'09 Challenge Papers will not undergo a selection procedure with multip=
le reviews, but the organisers reserve the right to reject material which i=
s not appropriate given the participation guidelines.
