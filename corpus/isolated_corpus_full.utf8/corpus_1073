Dear all,

It is our pleasure to announce the release of the development dataset
for the CLEF-QA 2007 pilot track Question Answering on Speech
Transcripts (QAst). We take this opportunity to launch a second call
for participation for this evaluation exercise.

QAst is a new CLEF-QA track that aims to provide an evaluation
framework for QA technology (currently just factual QA) on speech
transcripts, both manual and automatic. A detailed description of this
track is available here:
http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~qast
Some important dates:

# 15 June 2007: evaluation set released
# 30 June 2007: submission deadline

The pilot track is organized jointly by the Technical University of
Catalonia (UPC), the Evaluations and Language resources Distribution
Agency (ELDA) and Laboratoire d'Informatique pour la M=E9canique et les
Sciences de l'Ing=E9nieur (LIMSI).

If you are interested in participating please send us an email (at
turmo@lsi.upc.edu) with "QAst" in the subject line.

Best regards,
QAst organizers
