Many prospective authors have commented that they have just returned
to work from their academic break (midterm and spring) and so
they wish to be allowed to submit their papers to the conference.
To accommodate for those who missed the original deadlines, we
have decided to extend the paper submission deadline to March 23, 2009.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to inform our colleagues
in the Far East (a frequently asked question from China, Taiwan, Korea, ...)
that the conference proceedings will be indexed in Inspec / IET / The
Institute for Engineering and Technology, DBLP / CS Bibliography, and
others.

I would be most grateful if you would share this announcement with
those who may be interested.  The paper submission deadline is
extended to March 23, 2009.  Thank you.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft papers by
   uploading them to http://worldcomp.cviog.uga.edu/ .
   Submissions must be received by March 23, 2009 and they must be in
   either MS doc or pdf formats (about 5 to 7 pages - single space,
   font size of 10 to 12).  All reasonable typesetting formats are
   acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to
   follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their papers for
   publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited
   to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously
   published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The
   first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,
   name, affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author.
   The first page should also identify the name of the Contact Author
   and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the
   content of the paper.  Finally, the name of the conference that
   the paper is being submitted to must be stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
   impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts
   in the field who are independent of the conference program committee.
   The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of
   the program committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of
   the track that the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make
   the final decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed
   by one member of the program committee.


IMPORTANT DATES:

   March 23, 2009:    Extended deadline for Submission of papers
                      (about 5 to 7 pages)
   April 16, 2009:    Notification of acceptance (those who have submitted
                      their papers in Feb. and early March, will receive
                      the status report by the end of March).
   May 2, 2009:       Camera-Ready papers and Registration due
   July 13-16, 2009:  The 2009 World Congress in Computer Science,
                      Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
                      (WORLDCOMP'09 - 22 joint conferences)

TUTORIALS:

   13 to 16 tutorials will be scheduled - all tutorials are free to
   conference registrants.  Tutorial subjects include: various aspects
   of supercomputing (parallel and distributed systems and processing),
   visualization, preparation for teaching online courses, various
   areas of security, sensor networks, bioinformatics for computer
   scientists, web services for mobile and wireless systems,
   ABET accreditation as it relates to computing, inverse problems in
   computer vision, data mining, machine learning, cryptographic,
   on-demand computing, ...

PURPOSE / HISTORY:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their
   respective fields. WORLDCOMP'09 will be composed of research
   presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations, tutorials,
   panel discussions, demo sessions, and poster presentations.  In
   recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers included:
   Prof. David A. Patterson (U. of California, Berkeley);
   Prof. Michael J. Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John H. Holland (U. of
   Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. H. J. Siegel (Colorado State U.);
   Prof. Barry Vercoe (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U. of California,
   Berkeley); Prof. Jun Liu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys (OLPC +
   developer of X Window); and many other distinguished speakers.
   For this year's conference, the keynote speakers include:
   Prof. Ian Foster (Father of Grid Computing), Dr. Eric Drexler
   (Father of Nanotechnology), Prof. Brian Athey (Head, NIH National
   Center for Computational Medicine & Biology), Dr. Jose Munoz (Deputy
   Director, National Science Foundation Office of Cyberinfrastructure),
   and many others.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
   among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
   inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
   outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
   applications) will be covered during the conferences.

LOCATION OF CONFERENCES:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo hotel, Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by hotels).  This is
   a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities and over 3,000
   rooms.  It is minutes from the airport with 24-hour shuttle
   service to and from the airport.
