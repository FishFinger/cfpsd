Call Deadline: 01-Jan-2010=20

Meeting Description:

The Societas Linguistica Europaea and the Vilnius Local Organizing Committe=
e
invite you to submit workshop, poster and paper proposals for the next annu=
al
SLE meeting. SLE meetings give a forum to high-quality scientific research =
from
all (sub)domains of linguistics. Every year local organizers pay special
attention to one specific topic. Though the next annual meeting particularl=
y
welcomes papers on 'Language contact: at the crossroads of disciplines and
frameworks', workshops, posters and individual papers are invited on topics
belonging to all fields of linguistics.=20

Call for Papers

Workshops, posters and individual papers are invited on all topics belongin=
g to
the field of linguistics. Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes
question time.

Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should =
state
research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results. The abst=
ract
will also contain three to five key words specifying the (sub)domain, the t=
opic
and the approach.=20

Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by three people. Due to the good eff=
orts
of the SLE 2009 SC, the acceptance rate of the Lisbon conference was 57% fo=
r the
general session. (More information on SLE 2009 can be found at the SLE webs=
ite)

The deadline for all abstracts (for the general session, the poster session=
 and
the workshops) is 1 January 2010. Notification of acceptance will be given =
by 31
March 2010.

Submit your title through the Submit Abstract form at the website and email=
 your
abstract as an attachment to sle@arts.kuleuven.be. The abstract should not
mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or addresses. Abstracts are
preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your abstract contains special symbol=
s,
please include a pdf version as well.

Workshops:
Since SLE 2009, more than half of the presentations take place within the
framework of thematic workshops. Proposals for workshops are hence particul=
arly
welcome. They should contain:
(i) a description of the topic (including research questions to be addresse=
d) and
(ii)a provisional list of workshop participants and a three line descriptio=
n of
their topics

We encourage workshop convenors to distribute an open call for papers on th=
e
LinguistList and other fora. The deadline for the submission of workshop
proposals is 15 November 2009. Notification of acceptance will follow by 15
December 2009. All abstracts of workshop papers have to be registered and s=
ent
to us by 1 January 2010.

Since we want all conference participants to be able to attend individual
workshop presentations, SLE workshops have to be compatible with the main
conference programme. This means that the format of the workshops must be
organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). Ea=
ch
workshop ideally comprises:

1. An introductory paper by the convenor(s) or by a key-note speaker. It sh=
ould
summarize previous research, specify the approaches to be found in the work=
shop
and explain the scope of the papers to be given.
2. Seven or eight papers. The preference is for one-day workshops, but two-=
day
workshops may also be considered.
3. A slot for final discussion on topics covered by the papers, methodologi=
cal
issues and questions for future research.

More details can be discussed with the SLE conference manager
(sle@arts.kuleuven.be).

Posters:
The next SLE meeting will hold two poster sessions of an hour for both seni=
or
and junior researchers. Posters and oral presentations will be evaluated
according to the same quality standards. In order to foster interaction, al=
l
other sessions will be suspended during the poster session.=20

The maximum size of the poster is 1,10 m x 1 m.=20
The deadline for the submission of poster abstracts is 1 January 2010.

Prize for the best presentation and the best poster:
On the basis of the ranking of the abstracts, the Scientific Committee will=
 set
up an internal shortlist with nominees for the prize of best oral presentat=
ion
and the prize for best poster. Members of the Executive Committee and the
Scientific Committee will decide on the last day of the meeting who will re=
ceive
the prizes, which consist of 500 euros.

Nominees are PhD students or postdocs who finish their dissertation in the
academic year of 2009-2010.=20

15 November 2009: deadline for submission of workshop proposals
1 January 2010: deadline for submission of poster and paper abstracts
