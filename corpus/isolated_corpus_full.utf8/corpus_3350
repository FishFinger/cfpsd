Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Language Documentation 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

The second annual meeting of the Arizona Linguistics Circle will be held October
31-November 2, 2008 on the campus of the University of Arizona.

The theme of this year's conference is 'The Interface of Language Documentation
and Formal Linguistics'. 

Call for Papers

Talks addressing technology and language documentation are also strongly
encouraged. Abstracts from all areas from linguistics are welcomed but abstracts
fitting with the theme will be given preference.

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks with a 10 minute question period to
follow. Submissions are limited to one individual and one joint abstract per
author.

Invited Speakers:
B. Elan Dresher (University of Toronto)
Alana Johns (University of Toronto)
Mary Willie (University of Arizona, Tucson)

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts should be anonymous and in PDF form, limited to one page (with 1 inch
margins on all sides and 11 point font size) with an optional second page for
examples and references. Any non-standard fonts should be embedded in the PDF
document.

Abstracts should include up to five keywords after the title, including subfield
and language (family), in order to help us match the abstracts to reviewers
familiar with the topics discussed in the abstracts.

Submissions by graduate students are particularly welcome. Graduate students are
eligible to apply for the best student abstract award with the cash benefit of
$150. If you would like to have your abstract considered for this award, note
your current student status at the top of the abstract.

Abstract submissions should be sent to arizonalinguisticscircle2@gmail.com.

Submission deadline: August 31, 2008
Notification of Acceptance: September 19, 2008
Conference dates: October 31-Nov 2, 2008

Meeting Description:

This workshop is part of the 31st Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics
Society (DGfS 2009), hosted by the University of Osnabrueck, Germany. The
workshop brings together researchers working on the learnability of linguistic
models from a formal point of view, with those working on the models' cognitive
adequacy. 

Call for papers for the DGfS 2009 in Osnabr√ºck, Germany (2nd call):

AG Learning meets Acquisition:
The learnability of linguistic frameworks from formal and cognitive perspectives
 
The workshop brings together researchers working on the learnability of
linguistic models from a formal point of view, with those working on the models'
cognitive adequacy.

In general, studies on the learnability of language account for how grammar and
lexicon of a language can be learnt, and by what means. To give an example,
considerate progress has been made recently in connectionist-based frameworks
such as Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 1993) and Harmonic Grammar
(Legendre et al. 1990). Most learnability models within OT deal with the
learning of the grammar: learning of constraint hierarchies, and learning of
constraints themselves. In most of these approaches, lexical information is
already given. Other OT approaches tackle the learning of parts of the lexicon.
Differences between approaches include whether lexicon and grammar are learnt in
turns (offline) or in parallel (online), or whether the OT grammar to be learnt
is traditional or stochastic. Current approaches to learnability within HG
include learning constraint weights, by using learning algorithms such as the
perceptron algorithm. Yet, formal results have been only seldom tested against
empirical data from language acquisition research.

The workshop will not only capture the State-of-the-Art in current approaches to
learnability, but also point out future developments in this field, especially
those pertaining to cognitive adequacy. Questions to be addressed in the
workshop include:

- What are appropriate computational models of the formalizations and why?
- What is the cognitive and psycholinguistic plausibility of these models?
- How does the research on formal models of learnability relate to
(psycholinguistic) research on language acquisition? Is there a ''missing link''?
- How can the learnability of interfaces (e.g., syntax-phonology,
semantics-phonology) be formalized?
- How can learnability account for diachronic aspects of language?

We invite anybody working within any well-established contemporary linguistic
framework (including phonology, syntax or semantics, let it be GB, the
Minimalist Program, OT, LFG or HPSG among many others), and who tackles its
learnability from a theoretical, formal or cognitive perspective. Especially
invited are contributions that contrast the learnability of a framework with
empirical data (from language acquisition, language change or psycholinguistic
experiments).

Abstract submission guidelines:
- Abstracts should be submitted for 30-minute slots (including discussion).
- 1 page (TimesNewRoman, 12pt, single-spaced, A4 margins), including references
and figures etc.
- Pdf format preferably.
- Abstracts should contain the title of the talk, but not the authors.
- Abstracts should be submitted via e-mail as attachment. The names and
affiliations of the authors along with the title of the abstract should be
included in the body of the e-mail.

Send abstracts to lma dot dgfs at gmail dot com, with ''abstract submission''
somewhere in the subject line.

Important dates:
Abstract submission deadline: August 20, 2008.
Notification of acceptance: September 15, 2008.
Conference dates: March 4-6, 2009.
