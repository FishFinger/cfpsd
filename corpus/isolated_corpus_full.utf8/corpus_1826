MT Summit XI Workshop on Patent Translation
September 11, 2007
Copenhagen, Denmark

http://www.aamt.info/patent/

--------------
Workshop Theme
--------------
Patent documents are one of the major application areas of machine
translation. The workshop aims to foster research and development of the
technology for patent translation by providing a forum in which
researchers and practitioners can exchange their ideas, approaches,
perspectives, and experiences from their work in progress.
Double submission of papers to both the workshop and the main conference
will also be welcomed.
The workshop will consist of 1-3 invited talk(s), presentation of
submitted papers, and one panel discussion.

-----------------
Areas of Interest
-----------------
Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:
- Analysis and classification for patent documents,
- MT and translation aids for patent documents,
- Contrastive studies for multilingual patent documents,
- Language resources for patent translation,
- Information extraction from patent documents,
- Evaluation techniques for patent translation,
- Multilingual patent classification and retrieval.
