Meeting Description:
This conference is the final event in a two-year European project (Covcell),
aimed at supporting language learning and teaching in an online environment by
adding tools which support collaboration and co-operation to the functionalities
already provided by the Moodle learning management system. 

Call for Papers
COSELLO

Conference on Open Source in Education and Language Learning Online
Special Theme: The problem of language learning online - Is Moodle the answer?

Friday 28th to Saturday 29th September 2007
University of Iceland
Reykjav√≠k, Iceland


www.covcell.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=62&Itemid=59


As well as showcasing the collaborative tools developed by the project, the
conference seeks to address critical issues in the field of online language
learning from two perspectives: (1) the pedagogical perspective of the
effectiveness of cohort-oriented, task-based approaches to language learning and
teaching in an online environment; (2) the technical perspective of open source
development of tools which support online language learning and teaching.

We therefore welcome papers in either of these two domains:
(1) papers concerning current issues in the pedagogy of online language learning
and teaching, especially the effectiveness of approaches that allow students to
learn language while collaborating on tasks in cohort-supported environments;
(2) papers concerning the development of open source tools which support
language learning and teaching in an online environment and especially the
suitability of such tools for use with established open-source learning
management systems such as Moodle.

Papers that address the special theme of the effectiveness of Moodle for
language learning and teaching are particularly welcome. See below for
instructions on paper submission.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will also be eligible for
consideration for publication in a book related to the theme of the conference.

Information on registration plus other practical information will be available
shortly via http://covcell.org. There will be no registration fee for this
conference.

Important dates:
15th April 2007 - deadline for submission of abstracts
27th June 2007 - notification of acceptance
28-29th September 2007 - conference

(The Covcell Project is funded by the Minerva Fund of the European Union: for
more information see covcell.org).
Requirements for abstract submission:

The abstract should be anonymous, include the title of the paper and be written
in English.
The abstract should be no more than 2 pages of A4 including all references, data
and/or illustrations. Font should be 12-point and margins 2.5cm.
The abstract should be saved as a pdf file (though rtf, doc, and odt formats can
be accepted if absolutely necessary) and the file should be called
name-abstract.pdf (where name is the name of the author or of the contact person
in the case of multiple authors), e.g. whelpton-abstract.pdf
The abstract should be e-mailed no later than 15th April 2007 to both of the
following addresses:
whelpton@hi.is
mgu@hi.is

The main body of the e-mail should include: title of paper; name of author(s);
affiliation; e-mail address for correspondence; indication of whether the author
wishes their paper to be considered for publication in the book associated with
the conference.
The subject line of the e-mail should be ''COSELLO''.

Submission is limited to one single authored paper and one joint authored paper.

Subject: Toward the Interoperability of Language Resources 

	

Full Title: Toward the Interoperability of Language Resources 
Short Title: TILR 

Date: 13-Jul-2007 - 15-Jul-2007
Location: Stanford, California, USA 
Contact Person: Helen Aristar-Dry
Meeting Email: tilr@linguistlist.org
Web Site: http://linguistlist.org/tilr/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics; Language
Description 

Call Deadline: 15-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

Please note that the deadline for abstracts has been extended to 15 March 2007.

This workshop, to be held July 13-15 at Stanford University in conjunction with
the 2007 LSA Summer Institute, will bring linguists, language engineers, and
archivists together to collaborate in the development of digital tools and
services for linguistics. This meeting, which will focus on interoperability,
will capitalize on the momentum of two workshops held in conjunction with the
2006 LSA Summer Meeting: the Digital Tools Summit in Linguistics (DTSL), and the
E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data) workshop on
"Tools and Standards: the State of the Art." 

4th Call:

Please note that the deadline for abstracts has been extended to 15 March 2007.

We invite submissions from linguists, archivists, community members, and
computer scientists. Participation will represent the perspectives of the user
and the service provider, as well as the tool developer.

Selection:

The workshop program is based on discussions in small working groups.
Participants will not submit abstracts or make individual oral presentations of
their own projects. Instead of submitting abstracts of presentations,
participants are requested to submit one-page issue statements, which will
inform the working group foci for the first conference day. In these issue
statements, we urge applicants to present one issue or idea relevant to the
technological support of linguistic scholarship.

For example, the position paper might address one or more of the following
questions:

What are the greatest barriers to interoperability?
What could this workshop do to best promote interoperability?
What sets of tools or facilities have you used that are currently interoperable?
What are the benefits and drawbacks of these and/or similar tool suites?
If you have been involved in tool development, what are the primary challenges
involved in designing interoperable tools?
If your work involves a range of non-interoperable tools, what solutions or
work-arounds have you found?
Do you agree that interoperable tools will produce interoperable documentation,
and this in turn will facilitate the development of Internet services and
digital archives? Or does this claim require qualification or explication?

Those participants who have been working since DTSL 2006 on a tool charette will
be encouraged to incorporate current design work into their position papers.

The workshop will also include a poster session. For this, we will extend
special invitations to individual projects that are developing suites of tools
or platforms that offer good examples of interoperability. If you would like to
present a poster on your project, please include a two-line project description
along with your issue statement.

Each issue paper must be accompanied by a short (half page or less) biography.

Housing will be provided for participants; and some travel support will be
available.

Send submissions to: tilr@linguistlist.org
Deadline: Issue statements and biographies are due by 15 March 2007.
Issue statements should be one page long.
Biographies should be half a page.
