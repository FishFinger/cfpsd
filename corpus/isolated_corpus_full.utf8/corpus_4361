Full Title: COSIT-Workshop on Presenting Spatial Information 
Short Title: COSIT-PSI 

Date: 21-Sep-2009 - 21-Sep-2009
Location: Aber Wrac'h, France 
Contact Person: Thora Tenbrink
Meeting Email: tenbrink@uni-bremen.de
Web Site: http://www.sfbtr8.spatial-cognition.de/cosit09-psi 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

In recent years, the availability of automatically generated spatial information
of various kinds has developed dramatically. However, recent research has shown
that automatically generated information exhibits fundamentally different
features from information provided naturally by humans when asked about spatial
information, for example, in route directions. Therefore, it is our contention
that substantial work still needs to be done in order to render spatial
information services much more supportive and cognitively suitable. 

Call for Papers

The focus of this workshop will be on issues pertaining to granularity,
relevance, and integration. Spatial information is presented to information
seekers on various levels of granularity, ranging from coarse high-level
information concerning geographic areas to detailed low-level information
concerning spatial actions in small-scale space. Not all of this information is
relevant for all purposes, and so decisions concerning granularity are directly
intertwined with issues of relevance across interaction scenarios. In this
workshop, we wish to bring together researchers concerned with the integrated
and flexible presentation of spatial information both by systems and by humans,
addressing the issue from a range of different viewpoints.

Please refer to the website for more detailed information.
