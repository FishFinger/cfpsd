Call for papers

Sociolinguistic Studies

http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/SS/index

Special issue
Analysing language to understand social phenomenon /
Analyser le langage pour comprendre les phénomènes sociaux

Editors: 

Philippe Hambye, researcher in sociolinguistics at the Centre de recherche

Rationale:

Please look at the detailed call for papers at
http://valibel.fltr.ucl.ac.be/Elements/CallforPapers_SS.pdf  

The objectives of this themed volume are the following: 

-Illustrating the way scholars from diverse sensibilities and disciplines
contribute to the understanding of social phenomenon through the analysis
of language (conceived as practices, discourses, interactions, etc);
-Clarifying the role of theories and concepts inherited from sociology in
sociolinguistics;
-Fostering a dialogue between sociolinguists and researchers from other
social sciences;
-Proposing a certain definition of sociolinguistics, of its pretensions and
aims.

Every contribution is thus expected to address issues related to the use of
sociological theories and concepts in theoretical and empirical
sociolinguistic research. Papers could emphasize:

(a) Either the illustration of theoretical concepts and questions on the
basis of case studies;
(b) Or a more meta-theoretical and disciplinary reflection.
