Announcement and Call for Papers

ICGL2010: The Second International Conference on Global
Interoperability for Language Resources

City University of Hong Kong

Hong Kong SAR, China

18 =96 20 January 2010

http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons,
knowledge bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the development of
language processing applications that are increasingly important to
the global society. Substantial effort has been devoted to the
creation of such resources for the world=92s major languages over the
past decades, and new projects are developing similar resources for
less widely-used languages. Some standards and best practices have
emerged for representing and linking language corpora and annotations.
Efforts such as the =93Global WordNet=94 and the development of framenets
in multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical and
semantic resources across languages, and there are efforts to
integrate such resources into general-purpose ontologies such as SUMO.

As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is
increasingly important to develop resources in the world=92s languages
that can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with common
software, and that contain linguistic information for the same or
comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a
=93global web=94 of language resources, wherein, for example,
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are inter-
linked via the use of common categories, or categories that are mapped
to one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked
not only to versions in different languages, but also to each other;
and common representations enable analysis and use of resources in
different languages and of different types within available systems.
Interoperability also fosters universal access to language resources,
enabling researchers who have fewer resources for performing costly
and time-consuming transductions to have the same capabilities as
others.

The Second International Conference on Global Interoperability for
Language Resources will bring together designers, developers, and
users of language resources, tools, frameworks, and infrastructures
from across the globe, in order to:

=B7 assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for resource
  representation, annotation, processing, interlinkage, and access;

=B7 consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be used to
  enable resource accessibility, interoperability and inter- linkage;

=B7 consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) full
  interoperability, especially with regard to multi-lingual and multi-
  modal data;

=B7 consider the requirements for achieving interoperability among
  multi-lingual resources of different types, including corpora,
  lexicons, knowledge bases, ontologies, etc., as well as the systems
  and frameworks that enable their creation and exploitation;

=B7 work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and standards
  for language resource representation, annotation, and use that will
  enable interoperability;

=B7 consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in order
  to better enable cross-lingual studies;

=B7 provide direction for developers of resources for less widely used
  languages;

=B7 promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of language
  resources and tools across the globe;

=B7 consider ways to provide central or distributed access to language
  resources developed throughout the world.

This year=92s conference will include a special focus on the use of web-
based technologies for interoperability and open access to language
resources.

  Topics

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following
topics:

=B7 web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-
  linkage, and access;

=B7 multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus on
  the mechanisms enabling interoperability;

=B7 support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in systems/
  frameworks for resource creation, annotation, use, and access;

=B7 existing and proposed standards for language resources, including
  standards for linguistic annotations at any and all linguistics
  levels;

=B7 systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the development
  and use of interoperable language resources;

=B7 evaluation of existing resources, systems and frameworks, and/ or
  standards in terms of support for interoperability;

=B7 harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language resources,
  including corpora, wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;

=B7 ontologies for language resources, especially for support of
  multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and multi-modality.

Proceedings

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings. A
selection of outstanding conference presentations will be published in
a special issue of the journal Language Resources and Evaluation.

bibliography and any appendices. Author instructions will be posted on
