Meeting Description:

SICOGG 9 - The 9th Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar
Dongguk University, Seoul
August 8(Wed) - 11(Sat), 2007
Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Dongguk University, Seoul

Theme of General Session: Locality and Minimalism

2007 Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar will be held at
Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea, on August 8-11, organized by the Korean
Generative Grammar Circle.  

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the general
session specified above, equal consideration will be give to papers from all
areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the
general session, the two additional workshops, and a series of lectures from the
invited speaker. The themes of the two additional workshops are syntax-phonology
interface and light verbs and verbal nouns.

Workshop 1: Syntax-Phonology Interface  

Recent developments in minimalism have stimulated vigorous debates on the
division of labor between syntax and phonology. The focus of research has been
put on a number of issues (although it is not limited to): (i) how much and what
types of syntactic information are accessible to the phonology, (ii) what
principles govern the linear organization of syntactic constituents, (iii)
isomorphism (or non-isomorphism) between syntactic and prosodic
boundaries/islands, (iv) constraints on chain pronunciation and ellipsis, (v)
possibilities of PF-movement and the relevant conditions, and (vi) relations
between focus and phrasal stress/information structure, etc. In many areas
related to such issues, however, it is still quite controversial whether a
particular linguistic phenomenon is an effect of narrow-syntactic computation or
an effect of PF mechanisms or a consequence of the interaction of manifold
syntactic and phonological peculiarities. Also, even among the accounts of a
phenomenon in terms of PF properties, controversies remain to be resolved over
the workings of the PF interface system itself. Given that properties of
interface systems have far-reaching consequences for our view of UG, a broad
array of issues and problems that have been raised in recent years from an
interdisciplinary point of view bear some scrutiny and assessment at the current
course of theoretical developments. 

Among the overall interface issues, this workshop aims to discuss issues on the
interaction between syntax and phonology, particularly the issues connected to
the ones mentioned above; but we also hope to extend the range of possible
topics to experimental findings on the syntax-phonology interface issues in the
applied linguistics field.  

Workshop 2: Light Verbs and Verbal Nouns

We invite papers on theoretical and cross-linguistic approaches to the nature of
light verbs and/or verbal nouns. Light verb refers to a thematically incomplete
category which usually forms a complex predicate with theta-assigning
categories: in Korean and Japanese (and many other languages), verbal nouns
usually co-occur with the light verbs.  

The workshop may raise some of the following questions:

(A) On the status of light verbs: (i) Is light vs. heavy distinction necessary
across languages? (ii) Is a light verb lexical or functional? (iii) What is the
role of light verb in connection to verbal nouns? 

(B) On the nature of verbal nouns: (i) What is the categorial status of VNs: V,
N, or un(der)specified X? (ii) Are VNs or internal structures of VNs derived
from V or N roots? (iii) In what ways do VNs differ from regular Ns? 

We also welcome diverse perspectives on these issues in relation to recent
developments in minimalist program: for example, the role of v and VP-shell,
copula, relators/linkers, gerunds, derived nominals, to list a few.
