  	    Stylistics for Text Retrieval in Practice
  		       SIGIR 2006 Workshop
  		     Seattle, August 10, 2006

  			style2006@sics.se

  Recent years have seen an increased attention to various aspects
  of automatic analysis and extraction of stylistic aspects of
  natural language texts.

  Style may be roughly defined as the 'manner' in which something is
  expressed, as opposed to the 'content' of a message. Modelling,
  representing, explaining, and utilizing variation in the manner of
  expression is the business of stylistic analysis.

  This workshop follows four previous successful exploratory events
  on stylistic analysis and will focus on the practical craft of
  stylistic analysis in natural language texts.

                      THIS YEAR: BRING A DEMO!

  Potentially useful applications of stylistic analysis abound,
  including systems for genre-based information retrieval,
  authorship attribution, plagiarism detection, context-sensitive
  text or speech generation systems, organizing and retrieving
  documents based on their writing style, attitude, or sentiment,
  quality or appropriateness filters for messaging systems,
  detecting abusive or threatening language, and more. This year,
  participants are expected to bring with them a method for applying
  stylistic analysis to information access tasks.

  Before lunch, methods are discussed in session; after lunch,
  demonstrated in practice.

                        DISCUSSION QUESTION

  Participants should address the following key challenge question
  in their participation proposals:

  * WHAT IS A MEANINGFUL "KILLER APP" FOR STYLISTIC TEXT ANALYSIS? *

  and consider the following questions for discussion in session:

  1. How does style relate to other forms of non-topical textual variation?
  2. What features are best for different style analysis tasks?
  3. Is cross-lingual or 'universal' style analysis possible, and if so, how?
  4. How might we develop useful shared resources for moving style research forward?

                         SUBMISSION FORMAT

  Send us a statement (in PDF) of up to five pages describing your
  research or application with a short description (and screenshots
  if possible) of the demonstration you plan to show. At the
  workshop we will discuss and decide on an appropriate forum for a
  more permanent record of the proceedings. If you would like a
  speaking slot in the discussion session, you should indicate this
  in your statement of interest.
