September 21-25, 2009, Bangalore, India

Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC), IEEE C=
omputer Society

2009 International Conference on Cloud Computing is the identified hot-topi=
c conference of the IEEE 2009 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2009). C=
LOUD-II 2009 will be co-located with the 6th IEEE International Conference =
on Services Computing (SCC 2009).
The theme of the 2009 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD-II=
 2009) is "Change We Can Lead".

Cloud Computing has become a scalable services delivery platform in the fie=
ld of Services Computing. The technical foundations of Cloud Computing incl=
ude Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Virtualizations of hardware and=
 software. The goal of Cloud Computing is to share resources among the clou=
d service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value c=
hain. The resource sharing at various levels results in various cloud offer=
ings such as infrastructure cloud (e.g. hardware, IT infrastructure managem=
ent), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware as a service, or tra=
ditional CRM as a service), application cloud (e.g. Application as a Servic=
e, UML modeling tools as a service, social network as a service), and busin=
ess cloud (e.g. business process as a service).

In the fast growing Services Computing community, we have launched a series=
 of events to promote and grow Cloud Computing in the past years. In 2002, =
we promoted Business Grid to share business processes and applications. In =
early 2008, The IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC) has adopted C=
loud Computing to be included in the taxonomy as a body of knowledge area o=
f Services Computing. In July 2008, the IEEE International Conference on Se=
rvices Computing (SCC 2008) has delivered a keynote panel "Business Cloud: =
Bridging The Power of SOA and Cloud Computing" and a keynote "Cloud Computi=
ng".  In September 2008, the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Web Serv=
ices (ICWS 2008) has delivered a keynote "Web Services: Software-as-a-Servi=
ce (SaaS), Communication, and Beyond" and a panel "Cloud Computing and IT a=
s a Service: Opportunities and Challenges" to further motivate the communit=
y members to define Cloud Computing in various areas.=20

Based on the technology foundations and industry driving forces, the 2009 I=
nternational Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2009) is created to provi=
de a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practition=
ers to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and=
 practice of Cloud Computing, identify emerging research topics, and define=
 the future of Cloud Computing.

CLOUD 2009 is the HOT-TOPIC conference highlighted in the 2009 World Congre=
ss on Services (SERVICES 2009), which is jointly sponsored by IEEE Computer=
 Society Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC) and Services So=
ciety. CLOUD-II 2009 will be co-located with the 6th IEEE International Con=
ference on Services Computing (SCC 2009).

To discuss this emerging enabling technology of the modern services industr=
y, CLOUD-II 2009 invites you to join the seventh year's gathering that expl=
ores "Services" Science and Technology in the field of Services Computing, =
which was formally promoted by IEEE Computer Society since 2003. From techn=
ology foundation perspective, Services Computing has become the default dis=
cipline in the modern services industry.

CLOUD-II 2009 tries to attract researchers, practitioners, and industry bus=
iness leaders in all the following areas to help define and shape cloud com=
puting, and its related modernization strategy and directions of the servic=
es industry.  You are invited to submit research, engineering, and business=
 innovation papers to the following areas:
- Infrastructure Cloud=20
- Software Cloud=20
- Application Cloud=20
- Business Cloud=20
- Service-Oriented Architecture in Cloud Computing=20
- Vituralization of Hardware Resources=20
- Virtualization of Software Resources=20
- Cloud Computing Consulting Methods=20
- Design Tool for  Cloud Computing=20
- Maintenance and Management of Cloud Computing=20
- Cloud Computing Architecture=20
- Cloud Applications in Vertical Industries=20

In addition, CLOUD-II 2009 organizes cloud computing related keynote sessio=
ns, panel discussions, paper presentations, paper posters, innovation show =
cases, Services University (Fall School), workshops, and tutorials.

CLOUD-II 2009 also invites you to submit papers to participate the followin=
g key events:


Tutorial Proposal Submission for CLOUD-II 2009 and SERVICES 2009 (Part II)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Proposal Submission Deadline: June 1, 2009
Maximum Length: 2 pages - abstract and speaker short bio(s) in one PDF file


Panel, Innovation Show Case, Job Fair Booth Reservation or Event Proposal

CLOUD-II 2009 Innovation Show Case complement the technical program and fea=
ture industry leaders. This Innovation Show Case is one you will not want t=
o miss!

Final Proposal Submission Deadline: June 1, 2009=20
Maximum Length: 2 pages=20


Paper Submission and Review Process
-----------------------------------
Please use the submission page (http://www.thecloudcomputing.org/2009/2/sub=
mission.html) to find the right tracks and events to submit your papers.

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 to 3 program =
committee members. Please note that the same paper should NOT be submitted =
to other conferences or events simultaneously. Such duplicate submissions w=
ill be rejected from all conferences without review.

Accepted papers will be organized into a dedicated section for the IEEE 200=
9 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD-II 2009) and appear in=
 the CD-ROM version and online version of the proceedings of the 2009 IEEE =
Congress on Services (SERVICES-II 2009) , which will be published by the IE=
EE Computer Society Press. Extended versions of selected best papers publis=
hed in the SERVICES-II 2009 will be invited for potential publication in th=
e International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR), the International =
Journal of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM), and IEEE T=
ransactions on Services Computing (TSC). Both the SERVICES Proceedings and =
JWSR are included in EI Compendex. JWSR is also indexed in SCI-E.=20

Submitted manuscripts will be limited to 8 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages a=
nd required to be formatted using the IEEE Proceedings template. Electronic=
 submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required. Detailed in=
structions for electronic paper preparation and submission, panel proposals=
, tutorial proposals, and review process can be found from this web site. A=
t least one author of each accepted paper is required to register to the co=
nference and present the paper.=20


Paper Review Policy=20
-------------------
CLOUD-II 2009's Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat =
the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be dis=
closed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access=
 to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special kno=
wledge, which that access providers. Contents of abstracts submitted to con=
ference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and ha=
ndled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure th=
at referees adhere to this practice.
