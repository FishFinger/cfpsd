Meeting Description:

Stated broadly, the Lavender Languages and Linguistics Conference examines language use in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer life. Linguistic inquiry is broadly defined here, to include studies of: pronunciation, vocabulary and meaning, conversational structures and styles, life stories and other narratives, fiction, and poetry, the "language" of scientific and historic documents and print media, meanings encoded in spatial practices, sign language, non-verbal communication, and communication through photography, cinema and other visual arts. While presentations usually focus on local linguistic practices, they do not neglect the global spread of North Atlantic 'gayspeak' and the growing tensions between (homo)sexuality and citizenship worldwide, and they acknowledge the need to position site-specific practices within broader contexts of social, cultural and linguistic theory. 

Call for Papers:

Panel: Sexual identities and boundary management in discourse and language

Although performative theories of identity have encouraged academics to dispense with essentialist notions of sexuality, research 'on the ground' continues to suggest the prevalence and importance of shared self-definition amongst LGBTQ groups or communities of practice. Discourse - category terms; metaphor; evaluation; interaction and so on - is the primary means by which we can set out who 'we' are, who 'they' are, and evaluate the properties of those groups and members of them. 

This session invites papers dealing with the linguistic/discursive production of 'us' and 'them', such as the construction and/or management of boundaries, the positioning of (in)authentic identities, the creation of context-specific, legitimate roles, and so on. We welcome research from a variety of disciplines and locations (based on (face-to-face or virtual) interaction, media, public or other discourses) which engages with these processes in relation to LGBTQ identities.

The session is being organised by Lucy Jones (Edge Hill University, UK lucy.jones@edgehill.ac.uk) and Georgina Turner (Loughborough University, UK g.turner2@lboro.ac.uk). Abstracts (up to 250 words) should be submitted via email to both addresses by October 31st 2009.

The language of conference presentation is English, but the languages explored in presentations have been as varied as Navajo and Japanese, Ukrainian and Hindi, Nicaraguan vernacular Spanish or Kechuan. Presentations from established scholars and from those just beginning to explore lavender language issues are welcomed.
