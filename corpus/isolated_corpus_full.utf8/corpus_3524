The paper which you cite may well focus explicitly on this area in a =

useful way, but of course anyone who uses corpus data always uses  both =

intuition and corpus data. Or has anyone worked out how to turn their =

intuition off? (I guess you could try to do corpus linguistics on a =

language that you don't know, but I don't imagine you'd get very far.) =

The point is surely that a corpus linguist doesn't rely on intuition =

only, but checks intuitions against corpus data.

And thus, (to be a bit more provocative) by constantly testing, refining =

and sometimes refuting one's intuitions, the corpus linguist can become =

better at knowing when and when not to trust introspection, and can =

become a much better armchair linguist than the armchair-bound linguist.
