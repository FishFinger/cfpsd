Meeting Description

Topicality, Workshop at the 30th annual meeting of the Deutsche
Gesellschaft fuer Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS), Bamberg, 27-29 February 2008.

Organized by Cornelia Endriss (Universitaet Osnabrueck, Institut fuer
Kognitionswissenschaft), Stefan Hinterwimmer (Humboldt Universitaet Berlin,
Institut fuer deutsche Sprache und Linguistik) and Sophie Repp (Humboldt
Universitaet Berlin, Institut fuer deutsche Sprache und Linguistik). 

Topicality

Workshop at the 30th meeting of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS), Bamberg,
Germany 
February 27-29, 2008

This workshop investigates interpretative and formal aspects of topicality in
individual languages as well as cross-linguistically. Its goal is both a more
precise and a more comprehensive understanding of the notion of topicality. 
According to the probably most current view, topics are what a sentence is about
(= aboutness). However, the notion of topic is many-facetted and topics have
been suggested to have other interpretative functions as well. For instance,
they are thought to serve as discourse addresses. Furthermore, they often have
been associated with discourse givenness but since indefinites in many languages
can also occur in topic positions this latter view must be questioned. In
addition to the aspects just mentioned there are interpretative functions which
have been associated with topicality that are not directly topical in the sense
of aboutness such as frame setting or the structuring of contrastive discourses.
On top of that, it has been argued that topicality can have truth-conditional
effects, e.g. in the interpretation of indefinites and quantificational adverbs.
Topics are marked with different means in different languages: syntactically,
prosodically, with morphological markers. Topic markers and topic marking
constructions have also been observed to serve uses other than topic marking.
The Japanese marker wa, for instance, or the Korean marker nun can also mark
contrastiveness. Left dislocation in German shares this characteristic.
Furthermore, in many languages - e.g. Tagalog, Vietnamese, Turkish - a topic
marker is used to mark the antecedent of conditionals, which suggests that this
antecedent might be topical. Finally, topic markers cannot only occur in matrix
clauses but also in embedded clauses. Since this is unexpected from the point of
view of discourse organisation the precise interpretation of such
''topic-marked'' structures calls for closer inspection. 

Building on these observations, the workshop aims at exploring the various
ingredients in the interpretation of topicality. Part of this is an
investigation of the means of topic marking and the relation between topicality
and other functions of topic markers, which cannot be interpreted as (directly)
topical, such as the mentioned contrastiveness.

Abstracts should be anonymous, max. two pages, examples and references included,
12pt, pdf format. The talks will be 20 minutes (30 minute slots). Name(s),
affiliation(s), and title of the abstract should be included in the body of the
email.

Monika Bednarek, University of Sydney & University of Ausburg
Anne Burns, Macquarie University
Jim Martin, University of Sydney
Alastair Pennycook, University of Technology Sydney (UTS)

Authors are invited to submit abstracts for papers, colloquia, poster
presentations, or hot topics. 

- Colloquia (abstract max of 250 words): Colloquia will be 90 minutes in length.
Their internal structure is up to their organizers, but sufficient time for
discussion is encouraged.

- Single papers (abstract max of 250 words): Papers will be 40 minutes in
length, with 30 minutes for presentation, 10 minutes for questions/discussion.

- Hot topics (abstract max of 250 words): Hot topic talks will be 20 minutes in
length, with 10 minutes for the talk and 10 minutes for Q&A/discussion. We
especially welcome proposals in this category from young researchers/students
with new and challenging ideas.

- Poster presentations (abstract max of 250 words): Poster presentations will be
given in groups with a 30-minute allotment per session. This format may suit
