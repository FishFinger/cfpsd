** NEWS: a one-hour beginners tutorial on UIMA will be held prior to  =

the workshop at the same day **


For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering  =

standards
causing a limited degree of re-usability of code and interoperability  =

of different
modules within larger NLP systems. While this did not really hamper  =

success
in limited task areas (such as implementing a parser), it caused serious
problems for the emerging field of language technology where the  =

focus is on
building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information  =

extraction
or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to  =

duplicated software
development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions  =

of)
programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules
developed at different sites.

In recent years, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture  =

(UIMA)
framework has been proposed as a middleware platform which offers  =

integration by
design through common type systems and standardized communication  =

methods for
components analysing streams of unstructured information, such as  =

natural
language. The UIMA framework offers a solid processing infrastructure  =

that
allows developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual  =

analytics
components. An increasing number of members of the NLP community thus  =

have
adopted UIMA as a platform facilitating the creation of reusable NLP  =

components
that can be assembled to address different NLP tasks depending on  =

their order,
combination and configuration.

This workshop aims at bringing together members of the NLP community  =

that are
users, developers or providers of either UIMA components or UIMA- =

related tools
in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in  =

using UIMA
as a platform for modern, well-engineered NLP. In the context of an  =

emerging
NLP-oriented UIMA community, the challenge to create not only  =

reusable, but also
interoperable components raises particular interest. From a  =

methodological
perspective, interoperability relies largely on UIMA type systems.  =

Technically,
it includes issues related to the packaging and distribution of UIMA  =

components.
Also, tools are important, for example to assemble complex processing  =

work
flows, to manage the bodies of data that are to be analysed and to  =

visualize,
explore, and further deploy the analysis results. Finally,  =

interoperability is
also affected by legal issues, such as potentially incompatible  =

licenses of
components and tools.

The availability of ready-to-use components plays a major role in  =

choosing UIMA
over other alternatives. To accentuate this, the workshop puts a  =

focus on
UIMA-based components and tools that are freely available for research.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Participants are invited to present applications realized using UIMA,  =

general
experiences using UIMA as a platform for natural language processing,  =

as well as
technical papers on particular aspects of the UIMA framework.  =

Alternatives to
and comparisons of other frameworks - e.g. GATE, LingPipe, etc. -   =

with UIMA
are of interest, too. More specifically, workshop topics include, but  =

are not limited to:

     * UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type- =

system
       independence
     * repositories of ready-to-use UIMA-based components
     * (generic) type systems for UIMA
     * distribution of UIMA components: documentation, licensing and  =

packaging
     * sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing  =

pipelines
     * experience reports combining UIMA-based components from  =

different sources,
       as well as solutions to interoperability issues
     * processing of very large data collections: scale-out,  =

parallelization, and
       performance optimization
     * analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and
       statistical analysis
     * developing for UIMA: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing,  =

and
       limitations of UIMA

Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We invite submissions of full papers, limited to 8 pages of text, and  =

position
papers or papers describing ongoing work as short papers, limited to  =

4 pages.
Both kinds of papers will be orally presented. Double submissions  =

(whether
verbatim or in essence) should indicate this fact and name the  =

workshop or
conference event also addressed. Reviewing will not be anonymous but  =

authors
wishing to keep their anonymity may hide their identity on demand.

All submissions must be in English and follow the Springer LNCS style  =

[1] and
should be created using LaTeX. Submissions must be sent in PDF format to
uima.gscl2009@googlemail.com no later than July, 9th.

Accepted submissions will appear in the GSCL conference proceedings.
