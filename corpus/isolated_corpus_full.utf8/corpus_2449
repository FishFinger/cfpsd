Meeting Description

Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instruments and Instrumentals.

Organisers: Mark Donohue and Cathryn Donohue

Within theories of argument structure and morphological case the position of
instruments is particularly interesting. As noted by Jackendoff, (some)
instruments can be perceived as 'intermediary agents', and be accorded
privileges not normally found with non-core arguments (non-terms). They can also
be incorporated in the lexicalisation of an event, leading to highly specific
morphemes (such as the Siouxan instrumental prefixes, denoting the kind of
instrument or force that enables an action) or lexical classes (such as
Austronesian verbs of carrying, which vary according to body part involved).

The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of instruments and
instrumentals, the insights that such studies provide, and how they inform
theoretical models. We would be particularly interested in papers that
investigate the impact of studies of instrumentals on theories of syntax and
case marking.

As the workshop is centered on empirical phenomena, no specialized background
will be required. The workshop will be open to all interested. 

Call for Papers

Morphosyntactic Aspects of Instruments and Instrumentals.

The phenomena we will discuss include, but are not restricted to:

- syncretisms involving the coding of instruments; this might involve
syncretisms with structural or other semantic cases, or syncretisms with other
functions entirely;
- overlaps in syntactic behaviour between instruments and subjects, or
instruments and objects;
- discussion of the termhood of instruments cross-linguistically or in
language-specific settings.

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (20 minute presentations + 10  minute
question-and-answer period) relevant to the workshop theme. All material is to
be submitted in .pdf format. Non-standard fonts should be avoided wherever
possible, and if necessary should be embedded in the .pdf document. Applicants
are limited to one singly-authored and one jointly-authored abstract.

Abstracts should be anonymous and should not exceed one A4 page with a 2.5cm
margin on each side and in at least 12 pt. Times font. A second page (in a
separate file) should be submitted with the title of your paper and names,
affiliations, and preferred contact details of the authors.

Abstracts are to be submitted via email to the conference address
(instruments08@gmail.com). Only abstracts received before the final deadline and
only those following the guidelines specified above will be accepted. 

Submission Deadline: April 1, 2008. Notifications of acceptance will be
circulated by April 15, 2008 

This workshop will be held in conjunction with a group of linguistics events
being held at the University of Sydney in July under the general name of
LingFest2008 <http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/>. Other events include
AFLA15, ALI 2008, ALS  2008, LFG 2008 and ALAA 2008. The exact date is yet to be
finalised by the LingFest2008 committee, but is hoped to be around July 4.

Meeting Description

The aim of SEPLN is to provide a forum for discussion and communication where
the latest research works, developments and innovation activities in the field
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be presented by scientific and business
communities. In this conference, new possibilities of real applications of NLP
and I+D projects in this field are exposed.
Moreover, as in previous editions of this conference, there is the intention of
identifying future guidelines or paths for basic research and foreseen software
applications, in order to compare them against the market needs.
Finally, the conference intends to be an appropriate forum in helping new
professionals to become active members in this field.
