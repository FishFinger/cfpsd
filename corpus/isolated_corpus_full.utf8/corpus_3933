Messaging (IM), text messaging, bulletin boards, listservs, blogs, wikis,
podcasts, online conferencing, and so forth. The Handbook of Research on

contemporary issues and trends in discourse behavior and language
structures in social interactions in the different forms of communication
through the new media.
