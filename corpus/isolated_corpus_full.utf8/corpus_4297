Foundation for Endangered Languages
in association with the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan and
The Institute of Humanities, Khorog

Conference: Endangered Languages and History


Place: Institute of Humanities,
Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan,
Khorog
Tajikistan

Dates: 24-26, September, 2009

Call for Abstracts: FEL XIII

Endangered languages are often the remnants of old nations and
civilizations. Many of these languages have been widely used in vast
territories for centuries before giving way to more powerful and
influential languages over a period of time for various social,
economic, literary, political, and natural reasons. It is often
precisely in the endangered languages of minorities and indigenous
peoples that scholars seek answers to the historical developments of
nations, their values and ethics, agricultural activities, habitat, way
of life, migration patterns, arts and crafts,  religious traditions,
archaeological findings, etc. Endangered languages can serve to
legitimise the sovereignty of the dominant nations, or to reaffirm their
identity and authority over the territory, often at the expense of other
languages. In the process, the endangered languages themselves may be
strengthened or weakened as the past of the nation becomes a bone of
contention. History also has value in the life of a community and can
foster and promote a sense of identity among its members, thus perhaps
playing a crucial role in the preservation or revitalisation of the
endangered languages.

The conference will discuss the complex interaction of Endangered
Languages and History and how the study of history can encourage the
preservation and promote the revitalisation of endangered languages. The
following are some of the aspects of this interface which could be
discussed at the conference, certainly not an exclusive list:

-	The role of endangered languages in the writing of history. Endangered
languages as a medium for history writing, a source of historical data,
and a basis for the buttressing of the historiography of a nation,
region, empire, etc.

-	Methods and tools used to relate history to endangered languages,
including the effects of imperialism and nationalism on their perceived
status. The impact of conquest, political annexation, economic
ascendency or cultural dominance on languages and their resulting
endangerment; conversely, the contributions of endangered languages to
the evolution of the language of empire.

-	Use of endangered languages in the study of literary sources and
archaeological findings. Oral history, myth and oral literature as
instruments of decipherment of sources.

-	The use of endangered languages in strengthening historic community
identities, at any level from family to nation.   Endangered languages
as a symbol of homogeneity, an instrument of unity and a vehicle of
identity.

-	What history tells us about the causes and trends of language
attrition, including the role of language contact as a result of trade,
war, conquest and missionary religion.

-	How historical studies can contribute to the revitalisation of
endangered languages.

-	A historical perspective on the developing study of language
endangerment and endangered languages. Historiography and epistemology
of language endangerment.

The languages of the conference: English, Russian and Tajik. Abstract
and papers will be accepted in any of these languages.
