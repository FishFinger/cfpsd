CALL FOR PAPERS



Software engineering, testing, and quality assurance for natural  
language processing

An ACL 2008 workshop

Columbus, OH

June 19 or 20, 2008 (awaiting determination by ACL organizers)

http://alias-i.com/acl-08-software-workshop/



Natural language, as an input type, has unique characteristics that  
present special problems for software testing, quality assurance, and  
even requirements specification.  This workshop is intended to  
stimulate research in all areas of software engineering for natural  
language processing.  The goals of the workshop include raising  
awareness of the need for good software engineering practices in NLP,  
stimulating research on same, and disseminating the results of current  
work in this area.



The target audience is researchers interested in natural language  
processing software, including testing and standardization.



Submissions of full papers and poster abstracts are solicited in all  
areas of software engineering, testing and quality assurance as they  
relate to natural language processing.  Some suggested areas are:



* Patterns for design, coding, refactoring, and unit testing of  
language processing systems

* Test suite design and generation

* Special issues in metrology for natural language processing

* Grammar/rule engineering

* Usability

* Standardization of tools and/or resources

* Design for and evaluation of reliability and robustness

* Scalability issues in training and deployment

* Reusability and toolkit design

* Concurrency and multithreading for NLP

* Theoretical issues in software engineering for NLP



IMPORTANT DATES



Submissions due: Friday, March 21, 2008, 11:59 PM East Coast time

Notification of acceptance: Sunday, April 20, 2008

Camera-ready copy due: Saturday, April 26, 2008



SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS



Full papers: Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, including  
references.  These are intended to be reports of original and mature  
research.



Poster abstracts: Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages.   
Accepted abstracts will be published in a separate section of the  
workshop proceedings.  Appropriate poster topics include preliminary  
results, application notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.



Submission format: Submissions must be in PDF and should follow the  
two-column format of the ACL proceedings.  Ensure that you are *not*  
in A4 format.  Please see the conference website for detailed  
typesetting specifications.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use  
the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting  
website at http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html.



Submit your paper or abstract via the workshop web site at https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS04/ 
  by 11:59 PM on Friday, March 21, East Coast time.  Submissions need  
not be anonymous.  Authors who cannot submit a PDF file electronically  
should contact the workshop organizers well in advance of the  
submission deadline.



Papers may not be submitted to the software engineering, testing, and  
quality assurance workshop if they are or will be concurrently  
submitted to another meeting or publication and that other meeting or  
publication prohibits dual submissions.  If your paper is or will be  
concurrently under consideration by another meeting or publication,  
please notify us of that fact in a footnote on the first page.
