Meeting Description:

Adaptation of Language Resources and Technology to New Domains
RANLP 2009 Workshop 

Call for Papers

Workshop motivation and aims:
It is widely acknowledged that despite the great advances in Computational
Linguistics nowadays, the creation of new Language Resources (LR) and Language
Technology (LT) for a new domain or task is still quite expensive and
time-consuming. At the same time there are already a lot of varieties of LR and
LT, developed for various languages and purposes. What happens when new tasks
come? Do we have to develop new resources and technology from the beginning, or
can we re-use or adapt the existent ones? Last, but not least alternative is to
combine both strategies depending on the task. 

The first option seems reasonable when richer and larger data is needed for the
new applications. The second option is justified only if such a resource or
technology does not exist at all, or some new approach is applied. The third one
is the ever 'compromising', but also very realistic option. As the machine
learning techniques have matured enough to successfully support real
applications within various domains, a new bottleneck became the requirement for
large and adequate training data for input. Thus, the NLP community faced the
question of the relevant LR and LT adaptation. It concerns the operability
between general domain NLP toolkits and specific domain tasks with respect to
terminology, language, structure, steps of preprocessing etc. Thus, the Workshop
is devoted to various methods for transferring the linguistic knowledge and
supportive technology from the existing language resources in one domain into a
different one.

Topics:
- parameters of adaptivity and re-usability of LR and LT
- methods for adaptation of existing NLP resources to specific tasks
- domain specific requirements to the LR and LT
- general domain vs. specific domain processing
- profiling LR
- extrapolation of richer annotations to large data
- evaluation of adapted LR and LT

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
