Location: Prague, Czech Republic

Meeting Description:

Student Research Workshop at ACL 2007. 

June 25th-27th, 2007
Prague, Czech Republic
Submission deadline: January 23, 2007

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the general audience and from selected panelists - experienced researchers who prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop. As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress. Original and unpublished research is therefore invited on all aspects of computational linguistics including, but not limited to, the following topic areas:

--pragmatics and discourse;
--semantics and lexicons;
--syntax and grammars;
--phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
--linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
--information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering;
--summarization and paraphrasing;
--speech recognition and speech synthesis;
--corpus-based language modeling;
--multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids;
--spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
--multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems;
--narrative understanding systems.

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos. More information on these can be found at the main ACL-07 page, http://www.acl2007.org/.

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is to provide beginner researchers with the opportunity of presenting their work in a formal setting. Submission will therefore normally be open only to students who have settled on their thesis direction but who still have significant research left to do; those students in the final stages of their thesis and those who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop should submit to the main conference instead.

The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers should clearly indicate directions for future research wherever appropriate. The papers may have more than one author; however, all authors MUST be students (graduate or undergraduate). Papers submitted are eligible only if they have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the submission page.

3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's conference. These will be available from the web pages of ACL-07. A description of the format is also available in case you are unable to use these style files directly. Submission must be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. More details regarding the submission procedure will be posted on the workshop website.

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance decision will be based on the results of the review.

Note that reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make sure your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should likewise not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed previously (Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001) previously showed ...''.

5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US Eastern time January 23, 2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Late submissions will be automatically disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed soon after receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by e-mail) on March 23, 2007. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance notice.

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: January 23, 2007
Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007
Camera ready papers due: April 27, 2007
Conference date: June 25-27, 2007

6. Travel Grants

Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to the Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel grants, please contact the Co-Chairs of the Student Research Workshop.

7. Contact Information

Special one-day topic: Morphology and Dialectal Variation:

Variation constitutes an important property of human language in time, as well as in geographical and social space. Dialectal variation is fundamental for all branches of linguistics, and more particularly for morphology, where theoretical hypotheses can be tested on dialectal data, which deviate from standard linguistic forms. The exploitation of such data may present new challenges to the formulation of theoretical proposals, help to develop efficient theoretical tools, and enhance more sophisticated analyses.   

The aim of this session is to bring together morphologists working with dialects of various languages in order to promote research in dialectal morphology, and improve our understanding of variation in human language. We encourage abstract submission dealing with dialectal data of all language types, all word-formation domains, i.e. derivation, compounding and inflection, and with analyses of synchronic or diachronic interest. 
 
Ithaca (Ithaki): a few words 

Ithaca, the small and beautiful island of Ulysses is in the middle of the Ionian sea, at 52 miles from Patras. It is mountainous, but also full of vegetation, and the climate is mild with no strong winds. Its population counts about 2.500 people, and most of them live in the capital Vathy.  

The island has several picturesque villages (Perachori, Stavros, Exogi, Kioni, etc.), and beaches (Filiatro, Afales, Kurvulia, etc.). The caves of Eumaeus and Nymphes, the Aretousa spring, and the monastery of Kathara are some of the most exciting places to visit.

Ithaca can be reached by boat from Patras* (12 Euros), or from the close by island of Kefalonia (2-3 Euros), where is the nearest airport. Everyday boats from Patras leave at 8.30, and 16.00, and the trip is about 4 hours, while the trip from Kefalonia is only 10-15 minutes.
