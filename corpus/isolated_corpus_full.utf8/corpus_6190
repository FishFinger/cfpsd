Final Call for Papers

CUNY Phonology Forum 
Conference on the Word in Phonology

Final Reminder of Submission Deadline

We invite oral and poster presentations from any subdivision of cognitive
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics,
poetics, philosophy, psychology, etc. We also encourage diversity in methods, so
we welcome both formal and experimental approaches to the topic of the word in
phonology.

By 'word' in phonology we refer to any structural entity larger than and/or
distinct from morphemes, or to representations that have been proposed to
capture phonological or morphological generalizations larger than the syllable
or foot. The conference organizers especially want to encourage proposals from a
variety of theoretical frameworks.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to open the field of discussion to all matters related
to the nature of the word in phonology and/or phonetics.

- Is the word a valid concept?
- Is the word the same entity as the phonological word?
- Is the word hierarchically superordinate to feet and/or syllables?
- What is the internal structure of the word?
- What principles determine word structure?
- What aspects of the word are relevant to rhyme and meter?
- How do psycholinguistic processes interact with the linguist's word?
- How do morphological and phonological rules/constraints refer to the word?
- Does the word exist at different levels of phonology and phonetics?

Invited Speakers:
Nigel Fabb, University of Strathclyde
"The linguistics of surprise"
Alec Marantz, New York University
"Deconstructing Words"
Adam Ussishkin, University of Arizona
"Words and Roots in Semitic:psycholinguistic evidence for multiple factors in
lexical access"

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts for oral or poster presentations should consist of a one page
description (12pt font) with a second page for references, data and/or
illustrations. Please specify whether it is a proposal for a poster or an oral
presentation, or potentially either. Although we will make every effort to honor
authors' requests, the criterion for assigning a proposal to either the oral or
the poster format is simply whether the subject matter is better suited for one
or the other mode of presentation. 

Abstracts should be emailed as an attachment (PDF format) to
word@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, October 18, 2009. Authors
should include title of the proposal, name of the author(s) and affiliation in
the body of the email.

Important Dates:
October 18, 2009 deadline for abstracts submission
November 20, 2009 notification of acceptance
January 14-16, 2010 Conference on the word in phonology
