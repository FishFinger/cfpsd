Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Meeting Description: 

At the beginning of the 7th Framework Program, recently launched by the European
Commission, Human Language Technologies continue to be a challenge for computer
science, linguistics and related fields as these technologies become an ever
more essential element of our everyday technological environment. Since
Ajdukiewicz, Tarski, Turing and Chomsky (i.e. since the very beginning of the
Computer Age) these fields have influenced and stimulated each other.
Technological, social and cultural globalization has created a favouable climate
for the intensive exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across
initially distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange
and we invite you to join us at LTC'07 in October, 2007. 

Conference Topics

The conference program will include (without being limited to) the following topics:

electronic language resources and tools
formalisation of natural languages
parsing and other forms of NL processing
computer modelling of language competence
NL user modelling
NL understanding by computers
knowledge representation
man-machine NL interfaces
Logic Programming in Natural Language Processing
speech processing
NL applications in robotics
text-based information retrieval and extraction
question answering
tools and methodologies for developing multilingual systems
translation enhancement tools
methodological issues in HLT
prototype presentations
language-specific computational challenges for HLTs (especially for languages
other than English)
     
HLT standards
HLT support  for foreign language teaching
communicative intelligence
legal problems connected with HLTs (problems and challenges) contribution of
HLTs to the homeland security problems (applications and legal aspects)
     
vision papers in the field of HLT
HLT related policies

You will have noted that we intend to continue traditional HLT interest areas
(cf. L&TC'05 topics). You may also have observed that we have included a new
dimension at the frontier between HLTs and the Homeland Security field. We
invite authors working in this domain to contribute either on theoretical issues
(e.g. legal aspects of development and exploitation of HLTs) or technical
developments (applications, software, language infrastructure and tools).
Political and mature vision papers in this field are also welcome. 

This list is by no means closed and we are open to further proposals. The
Program Committee is also open to suggestions concerning accompanying events
(workshops, exhibits, panels, etc). Suggestions, ideas and observations may be
addressed directly to the LTC Chair by email (vetulani@amu.edu.pl).
