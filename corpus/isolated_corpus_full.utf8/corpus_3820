   			System Demonstrations
at the 12th Meeting of the European Chapter of the Association for
                       Computational Linguistics

                          March 30 - April 3, 2009
                             Athens, Greece

                         http://www.eacl2009.gr

           * * * Submission deadline: December 5, 2008 * * *

The European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics =

invites the submission of proposals for system demonstrations for its =

12th meeting. The areas of interest are the same as those mentioned in =

the call for full papers (see =

http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/callforpapers) and cover all aspects =

of theoretical and applied computational linguistics. Among others, =

submissions may address systems of the following kinds:

- systems that support, verify or evaluate core theoretical research
- applications that demonstrate innovative transformations of =

theoretical findings
- development tools that ease application creation

We would like to strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems =

as long as they prove technologically innovative given the current state =

of the art of theory and applied research in computational linguistics.

Each demo will be complemented by a poster at the conference and will be =

allocated 4 pages in a companion volume in the conference proceedings.

Developers should outline the design of their system and provide =

sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and =

relevance to computational linguistics. Pointers to web sites running a =

demo preview will also be helpful.

Demo submissions should also clearly indicate if any computer equipment =

is expected to be provided by the local organizer. If so, please specify =

desired hardware platform, hard disk and memory capacity, operating =

system and other software needed in order to run the demo. If you are =

bringing your own laptop, you should instead request a video projector =

if you need one, providing details about PC type, screen resolution, etc.


Reviewing
*********
The reviewing of the submissions will be blind. It will be conducted by =

an international panel of experts. Final decisions on the program will =

be made by the demo chair.


Submission Information
**********************
Submissions should follow the guidelines for authors of the main =

conference track, which can be found here: =

http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

As reviewing will be blind, the submission should not include the =

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that =

reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) =

...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith =

previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions that do not conform to =

these requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission will be electronic using the submission software to be made =

available at  https://www.softconf.com/eacl09/demo/submit.html. The =

submissions must be submitted no later than 11:59pm (23:59) GMT December =

5, 2008. Submissions submitted after that time will not be reviewed.

student participants of the EACL 2009 main conference, the EACL 2009 =

demo session and/or the EACL 2009 student research workshop.

Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more generally, to =

students from countries with hard currency problems (within the =

geographical area covered by EACL).

A request for student sponsorship for EACL 2009 should include the =

following information:

     * Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of =

the candidate
     * Source and amount of yearly income
     * Letter of motivation
     * Proof of student status
     * Copy of acceptance letter from programme chair / student workshop =

chair or demo chair
