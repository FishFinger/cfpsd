Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

THE SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE BOOK    
The Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, USA    
25-27 October 2008    
http://www.Book-Conference.com

In the context of today's rapid developments in information technologies, the book is indeed an old medium of expression. Do the new media (the internet, multimedia texts and new delivery formats) represent a threat or an opportunity? What is the book's future as a creature of and conduit for human creativity?    

This Conference will address the provocative suggestion that, rather than being eclipsed by the new media, the book will thrive as a cultural and commercial artifact. More than this, the information architecture of the book, embodying as it does thousands of years' experience with recorded knowledge, may well prove critical to the success of the new media.     

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of the Book. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Proposals are reviewed within four weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.Book-Conference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposals and hope you will be able to join us in Washington, DC in October.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Michael Peters    
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA    
For: The Advisory Board, International Conference on the Book
