	       Building and Using Comparable Corpora

CONTEXT AND FOCUS

  Research in comparable corpora is motivated by the scarcity of
  parallel corpora. Parallel corpora are a key resource to mine
  translations for statistical machine translation or for building
  or extending bilingual lexicons and terminologies. However, beyond
  a few language pairs such as English-French or English-Chinese and
  a few contexts such as parliamentary debates or legal texts, they
  remain a scarce resource, despite the creation of automated
  methods to collect parallel corpora from the Web. A more
  fundamental limitation is that translated texts, whatever the
  skills of translators, are generally influenced by the very
  translation process and by the language of source texts, so that
  they may not be fully adequate for the task at hand.

  This has motivated research into the use of comparable corpora:
  pairs of monolingual corpora selected according to the same set of
  criteria, but in different languages or language
  varieties. Comparable corpora overcome the two limitations of
  parallel corpora, since sources for original, monolingual texts
  are much more abundant than translated texts. However, because of
  their nature, mining translations in comparable corpora is much
  more challenging than in parallel corpora. What constitutes a good
  comparable corpus, for a given task or per se, also requires
  specific attention: while the definition of a parallel corpus is
  fairly straightforward, building a comparable corpus requires
  control over the selection of source texts in both languages.


TOPICS

  This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the
  constitution and use of comparable corpora. Contributions are
  solicited on the constitution and application of comparable
  corpora, including the following topics:

  Applications of comparable corpora:

    tools for translators;
    tools for language learning;
    cross-language information retrieval;
    cross-language document categorization;
    machine translation;
    monolingual comparable corpora for writing assistance;
    extraction of parallel segments in comparable corpora.

  Units aligned in comparable corpora:

    single words and multi-word expressions;
    proper names;
    alignment across different scripts.

  Constitution of comparable corpora:

    criteria of comparability;
    degree of comparability;
    methods for mining comparable corpora.
