Introduction:
SPIRE 2009 is the 16th International Symposium on String Processing and
Information Retrieval. The first four editions of the conference focused
primarily on string processing and were held in South America under the title
WSP (South American Workshop on String Processing). WSP was transformed into
SPIRE in 1998, when the scope of the conference was broadened to include
information retrieval. This was motivated by the increasing relevance of
information retrieval and its close inter- relationship with string processing.
The last three SPIRE conference sites have been Glasgow, Scotland (2006),
Santiago, Chile (2007) and Melbourne, Australia (2008). The conference
proceedings have been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series since 2002. This tradition continues also in 2009.

Location:
SPIRE 2009 will be organized by the Department of Computer Sciences of
University of Tampere, Finland. The conference will take place in the village of
Saariselka, which is located in northern Finland ("Lapland"), some 250 km north
of the polar circle. The surrounding nature and lack of big city noise and other
such distractions will provide a peaceful setting for the conference. Despite
its population of merely around 350 people, Saariselka is a popular travel
destination with good services. The conference hotel has hosted even
minister-level meetings of the European Union. Saariselka offers good
opportunitied for enjoying beautiful unspoilt nature e.g. by hiking, biking, or
canoeing. In addition to the magnificent landscape dominated by numerous fells,
popular nearby attractions include e.g. active gold panning sites along river
Lemmenjoki, the 3rd largest lake in Finland (Lake Inari), reindeer farms, and
cultural sites related to the indigenous Sami people. See
http://www.saariselka.fi for more information.

Topics:
SPIRE 2009 covers research in all aspects of string processing, information
retrieval, computational biology, pattern matching, semi-structured data, and
related applications. Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- String Processing: dictionary algorithms, text searching, pattern matching,
text and sequence compression, text mining, natural language processing, and
automata based string processing.
- Information Retrieval (IR): IR modeling, evaluation, indexing, ranking and
filtering, interface design, visualization, cross-lingual IR systems, multimedia
IR, digital libraries, collaborative retrieval, and Web related applications.
- Interaction of biology and computation: DNA sequencing and applications in
molecular biology, evolution and phylogenetics, recognition of genes and
regulatory elements, and sequence driven protein structure prediction.
- Information Retrieval languages and applications: XML, semi-structured data
retrieval, language models (both structural and semantic), knowledge
representation, text mining, and generation of structured data from text.

Workshops:
We plan to host workshops on topics in both string processing and information
retrieval. The workshops will take place after the main conference, on 28 August
2009. More details will be posted on the conference website.

Submissions:
SPIRE 2009 will invite submissions in two categories: long papers (12 pages) and
short papers (6 pages). Submissions should be anonymous and formatted using LNCS
style. At least three reviewers will evaluate each paper based on its
originality, quality and significance of theoretical and/or practical
contribution, the validity and robustness of the used methodology, and the
overall contribution to our understanding of the context of the work. More
detailed submission instructions will be posted on the conference website.

Program Committee Co-chairs:
- Jorma Tarhio, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland
- Jussi Karlgren, Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden

Program Committee:
Information will appear soon on the conference website.

Meeting Description:

We invite you to submit an abstract to the fourth meeting of the Slavic
Linguistics Society, to be held on the campus of the University of Zadar, in
Zadar, Croatia. 

Call for Papers

Keynote Speakers:
- Greville Corbett (The University of Surrey)
- Laura Janda (The University of Tromsoe)
- Milan Mihaljevic (Staroslavenski institut, Zagreb)

The purpose of SLS is to create a community of students and scholars interested
in Slavic linguistics, that is, the systematic and scholarly study of the Slavic
languages. The Society aspires to be as open and inclusive as possible; no
school, framework, approach, or theory is presupposed, nor is there any
restriction in terms of geography, academic affiliation or status.

Papers dealing with any aspect of Slavic linguistics and within any framework
are appropriate, as well as those that represent cross-disciplinary approaches
(sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, language acquisition, etc.). The
only restriction is that all papers should address an issue pertaining to Slavic
linguistics. All talks will be for 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for discussion.
We encourage everyone to participate and ask you to share this announcement with
as many colleagues and students as possible.

All abstracts will be refereed and participants should be notified by mid June 2009.
