Conference Blurb:
Issues in cross-cultural communication have exercised the minds of thousands of
scholars world-wide and will no doubt continue to do so in the foreseeable
future. Cross-cultural communication is often relatively unproblematic (as
relatively unproblematic, that is, as communication within cultures), but it is
a well-known fact that problems do develop from time to time and warrant the
attention of linguists and applied linguists alike. Cross-cultural pragmatic
failure, as it has been called, occurs because of insufficient knowledge, either
of the formal rules of the language in which an interaction takes place (rules
that relate to its lexicon, its phonetics, its syntax), or of more elusive
aspects related to implicit cultural norms and values, often not adequately
taught in foreign language classrooms. In the absence of appropriate
cross-cultural savoir-faire, it can have disastrous repercussions for
interpersonal relationships and lead to unhelpful stereotyping. 

Call for Papers

Like its predecessor, the July 2007 Montpellier conference on which it seeks to
build,  the present gathering is part of an ongoing cooperative agreement
between our two institutions and will bring together a number of scholars
interested in gaining a better understanding, through the study of actual
communicative behaviour or otherwise, of the various linguistic and pragmatic
aspects of cross-cultural competence which are required for communication across
cultural boundaries to be successful. Presenters wishing to analyze actual
communicative behaviour may choose among the following approaches:
1) A "comparative" approach which entails side-by-side observation of native
speakers using their respective native languages in similar contexts or
interactions. The comparative approach allows similarities and differences in
usage and expectations in pre-defined communicative contexts to be brought into
focus, and thus paves the way towards formulating hypotheses on potentially
sensitive points in cross-cultural situations.

2) A "cross-cultural" approach which entails analysis of contact situations in
which speakers belonging to different cultural backgrounds interact with one
another. The cross-cultural approach allows identification of presumed obstacles
in cross-cultural communication which appear to generate misunderstanding or
interpersonal clashes, and thus paves the way towards the identification of
underlying cultural values which are relevant for one or more of the speakers
but not for all.

3) A "pedagogical" approach which relies on observation of interlanguage
behaviour among peers, comparing it to native performance in similar contexts or
interactions. The pedagogical approach relies on simulations and allows L1
interferences on L2 to be brought into focus and thus complements findings
achieved within a cross-cultural approach.

Regardless of the approach selected for a particular investigation, presenters
must make sure always to examine how the linguistic and cultural aspects of
verbal behaviour are intertwined. In addition, they are asked, whenever
possible, to go beyond a purely descriptive approach and to envisage the
theoretical and/or pedagogical implications their data may provide. 

Presentations not based on concrete communicative behaviour (i.e. the analysis
of linguistic interaction using one of the approaches mentioned above) are also
invited, and will be especially welcome if they seek to engage with a newly
developed ethnolinguistic pathways model, preferably honouring its requirement
to use the natural semantic metalanguage developed by Anna Wierzbicka and Cliff
Goddard. The aim of the model is to facilitate the study of cultural values
through language, and provides researchers and advanced students alike with
strategies to gain a better knowledge of values using linguistic data. It seeks
to illustrate how and to what extent the detailed study of communicative
behaviour (ethnopragmatics), phrases (ethnophraseology), key words (ethnosemantics)
and productive syntactic patterns (ethnosyntax) can lead to the discovery of
putative cultural values which are then to become the subject of further
investigation leading to either the confirmation or the rejection of their
assumed status; and also how and to what extent, through a detailed study of
communicative behaviour, phrases, key words and productive syntactic patterns,
cultural values typically associated with a particular linguistic community can
be further corroborated (ethnoaxiology). More information on the ethnolinguistic
pathways model is available on

Deadline for Submission of Abstracts
Single-spaced abstracts written in Times New Roman 12 and not exceeding one page
(excluding bibliographical references), with 1 inch margins on all sides, should
be e-mailed to Bert Peeters (Bert.Peeters@humn.mq.edu.au) by 15 November 2008.
They will be anonymously assessed by two or three members of the scientific
committee. Acceptances, either conditional or final, will be communicated by the
end of January 2009, and a provisional conference program will be released by
the end of February. Although the main conference language will be English,
abstracts and presentations in French will be considered.

Meeting Description:

30 June - 2 July 2009
Linguistic Impoliteness and Rudeness II (LIAR II): 
The 2009 International Conference of the Linguistic Politeness Research Group
Lancaster, United Kingdom 

Call for Papers

Building on the success of the first impoliteness conference (LIAR) at the
University of Huddersfield in 2006, this three-day conference focuses on
language and communication that might be described as 'impolite', 'rude',
'aggressive', 'face-attacking', 'conflictive', 'confrontational',
'linguistically aggressive', 'verbal bullying', 'discursive antagonism', etc.
However, we also warmly welcome any papers that are related to politeness
theory, application or practice in any form. Researchers and postgraduates
working in fields such as linguistics, sociology, psychology, communication
studies, business studies, organizational studies, conflict resolution studies,
literature and philosophy are particularly welcomed, though the conference is
open to all interested parties. The abstract deadline for both papers and
posters is 30th January 2009. (Please contact the organizers regarding any
proposals for panels before this date).
