Location: Klagenfurt, Austria 
Contact Person: Leo Wanner
Meeting Email: leo.wanner@upf.edu
Web Site: http://www.mtt.upf.edu/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

After MTT '03 in Paris and MTT '05 in Moscow, MTT '07 is the third 
in a series of conferences which aims at bringing together researchers working 
on MTT, other dependency-based linguistic theories and computational 
applications that draw upon dependency theories. The special goal of this 
conference is to open MTT more to researchers working in related frameworks. 

The Meaning-Text Theory is a holistic linguistic dependency-based theory 
characterized in particular by the central position of the lexicon, the primacy of semantics, and the importance of the communicative structure. MTT has been extensively developed over the last four decades with respect to its coverage of linguistic phenomena and application in a variety of research fields - among them natural language processing (in particular text generation) and second language learning and teaching. 

After MTT '03 in Paris and MTT '05 in Moscow, this conference is the third 
in a series of conferences which aims at bringing together researchers working 
on MTT, other dependency-based linguistic theories and computational 
applications that draw upon dependency theories. The special goal of this 
conference is to open MTT more to researchers working in related frameworks.

A social program will be offered before the main conference. After the main 
conference, a tutorial on natural language generation in the framework 
of MTT is planned. 

Submissions:

We invite submissions on all topics related to MTT and other grammatical and 
lexical frameworks that share with MTT the fundamental principles such as 
dependency, the primacy of the lexicon, stratificational nature of the 
linguistic model, etc.

Submission Format:

Submissions must be in English. They may not exceed 10 pages in length (including all figures, data, notes, and bibliography) using a 12 point font, printed in one column).  Style files for Word and LaTeX will be available on the web site of the conference soon. The submission format must be pdf. 

The electronic submission web site will be made known shortly. No hardcopy or email submissions addressed to the conference organizers will be accepted.

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: February, 15th 2007
Notification of acceptance: March, 15th 2007
Final version due: April, 16th 2007
Main conference: May, 21st - 24th 2007

Bilingualism for All Students through Two-Way Immersion
Saturday, February 10, Time TBA, Bate 1031
 
This presentation provides an overview of two-way immersion, synthesized from research conducted by the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL), including extensive information collected from programs around the country. Two-way immersion education is a challenging model to implement well because it involves providing instruction in two languages to integrated groups of students. Among the issues to be examined are goals of two-way immersion, key components of effective programs, and issues in design and implementation. Findings from a national research project will be presented, along with information about resources that are currently available.  
 
Pre-conference talk sponsored by The Department of Foreign Languages & Literatures.
 
Charting a Path to Bilingualism for Our Students
Friday, February 9, 3-4:30pm, Bate 1026 
 
In the United States, two language-related issues receive substantial popular attention. On the one hand, the U.S. lacks the language resources (in languages other than English) to meet its diplomatic, economic, security, and social goals. On the other, students in U.S. schools are increasingly diverse, and their home languages are not usually viewed as resources to be developed. A unified response to their issues can be found in creating pathways for individual students to follow through the educational system that lead them to bilingualism. In this presentation, the characteristics of such paths are discussed, along with policies and practices that support their creation
 
Proposals/Pre-registration:

Graduate students and teachers in a variety of fields are invited to submit presentation proposals that contribute to the understanding of teaching and learning language. Proposals can be submitted online at our conference website at http://core.ecu.edu/engl/talgs, no later than January 5, 2007.
 
Conference participants can pre-register online at: http://core.ecu.edu/engl/talgs/conference/registration.htm.
Pre-registration ends February 4, 2007.
