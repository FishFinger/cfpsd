Meeting Description

The three-day seminar is proposes to assess the present status of Malayalam
language in the Knowledge Era from different perspectives. The language of
Kerala has undergone vast changes for the last fifty years from its scripts to
semantics and usage. 

The Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala is organising an
International Seminar on Malayalam Language in the Golden Jubilee year. This
seminar is a part of Suvarna Keralam - the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the
formation of Kerala on the basis of Language. 
The three-day seminar proposes to assess the present status of Malayalam
language in the Knowledge Era from different perspectives. The language of
Kerala has undergone vast changes for the last fifty years from its scripts to
semantics and usage. Malayalam scripts have undergone changes three times, in
70's as per the recommendations of Dr. N. V. Krishnavarier, and latest by G.
Govindapilla Committee. Very many words have come to Malayalam from different
languages and the dictionaries and lexicons have to be enriched and updated at
regular intervals. The syntactic patterns and semantic extensions have taken
place because of the continuous contact with many foreign languages. Usages,
proverbs, concepts, etc. have also got so many changes. Malayalam Language
teaching in schools and other institutions is adopting many methodological
changes. The language in print, electronic and cyber media are different in many
ways. At the same time new concepts and usages are being introduced day by day.
Foreign language influences on Malayalam are very vivid today.
Malayalam in literary and non literary fields got some noticeable changes.
Scientific and technical documents show different patterns because of foreign
influences. Translation from and to Malayalam is taking place very much and the
language in the translation is somewhat different. Migration of large number of
Malayalees to different parts of the world has made a state that Malayalam got
the official status in some countries. Second and third generation of
Malayaliees can only speak the language and they don't know reading and writing
of Malayalam. A large number of Malayalam news papers, magazines, books are
being printed at many parts of the world. Cyber Malayalam is another version and
Malayalam in Internet, chatting and SMS is in a gist state. Malayalam language
computing is another area and to assess the latest position of Malayalam
language software and products is also to be attempted. Many agencies are
involved in developing software and systems and the seminar will give a chance
to display and discuss the products and demonstrate how much each one has
achieved in their efforts. Malayalam is processed for many application like
machine translation, computer aided language teaching, text processing,
information retrieval, spell and grammar checking, etc. Software for word
processing, DTP, data entry, web publishing, developing operating systems in
Malayalam language, etc. also have to be considered. Lexical and grammatical
resource making, corpora building, speech and text processing, semantics and
word sense disambiguation, etc. are the areas to be covered, for the Govt. of
India is funding in many ways. To know, discuss and exhibit all the above the
proposed programme is aimed proposed for.

Academicians, Language experts, Media/ Press persons, Linguists, software/ Net
experts, Researchers, Language Teachers, Translators, Policy makers, etc. are
