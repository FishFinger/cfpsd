The 13th IEEE Pacific Rim International
Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC'07) December 17-19, 2007 Melbourne, Victoria,
AUSTRALIA

http://www.deakin.edu.au/conferences/prdc2007

--CALL FOR PAPERS--

PRDC 2007 is the thirteenth in this series of symposia started in 1989 that are devoted
to dependable and fault tolerant computing. PRDC is now recognized as the main regular
event of the Pacific area that is covering the many dimensions of dependability and
fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental
projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems
have permeated in every aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing system
has become increasingly critical.
This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas
of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.

This symposia will be returning to Melbourne, Australia in 2007, after hosting .....

  MilCIS Conference-November 2007
  michael.frater@milcis.com.au

Military communications and information systems have become increasingly important in
recent years as networks and the network dimension become essential to military concepts
such as information operations, information warfare, and network centric warfare. As
modern defence forces become more network enabled and the pace of technological
innovation quickens, it is increasingly difficult to maintain currency with the vast
array of technologies associated with information-age warfare.

MilCIS is an annual conference aimed at attendees from military and government
organisations, academia, and defence industry, who contribute to key decisions in
investments in communications and information systems.

Papers are sought for oral presentation on all aspects of military communications and
information systems, especially those focusing on the Conference themes. All papers
will be refereed (on the full paper.) Authors will be advised in writing of acceptance
or non acceptance of their paper.

MilCIS2007 will address:

* Operational concepts
* Information management
* Command support systems .....

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS | dg/sum'07

ISSNIP/ISPRS joint international workshop on distributed geoinformatics and sensing, ubiquity, and mobility.
September 19, 2007
Melbourne, Australia

Held in conjunction with COSIT 2007, the International Conference on Spatial Information Theory in Melbourne, Australia, September 19-23, 2007.

Theme

Recent technological advances have led to an abundance of sensor, image, and streaming
information. The ubiquitous availability of mobile processing devices, wireless sensor networks,
and RFID tags in tandem with novel distributed computing architectures will enable a new range
of applications. Most of the information generated by these distributed systems and applications
is spatially referenced. Managing, processing, and using this geospatial information presents
significant new research challenges in distributed information systems, including: .....

CALL FOR PAPER
Workshop on Web Personalization and Recommender Systems (WPRS07)
in conjunction with the 2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence
(WI'07) and Agent Technology (IAT'07)
November 2-5, 2007, Silicon Valley, USA

Workshop Theme
In recent years, interest in recommender systems has dramatically increased, driven
by demand for Internet personalization applications. Many major e-commerce web sites
are currently using recommender systems to provide advice to users about products or
services and help users find the information of their interests quickly. Web-based
recommender systems are the most notable application of the web personalization. With
today's increasing information overload problem on the Web, the area of recommender
systems research becomes more challenging than ever before. There remain difficulties
limiting the full exploitation of ersonalization and recommendation, arising both
from technology and from the "human factor." The goal of this workshop is to bring
together academic and industrial researchers to exchange ideas about past, present
and future trends in Web personalization and recommender systems and discuss the most
innovative approaches to personalization and recommendation making. The themes will
be in algorithms, applications and interfaces.

9th International Conference on Feature Interactions in Software and Communication
Systems (ICFI)

September 3 - 5, 2007
Grenoble, France

http://lig.imag.fr/ICFI2007

The International Conference on Feature Interactions in Software and
Communication Systems (ICFI) has evolved out of the Feature Interaction Workshop,
and is now concerned in all types of software systems. It has been the	leading forum
for researchers, practitioners, and educators in the field, and the most  dedicated
place for discussion and reporting on research in the feature interaction problem in
telecommunications and software systems since 1992. The forum includes invited speakers,
presentation of research papers, short presentations, posters and tool demonstrations.

Feature interaction occurs when one feature modifies or subverts the operation of another
one. This phenomenon can occur in any software system that is subject to changes; it is
becoming a major issue in software product lines. We focus the conference on the topics
listed below. Contributions extending beyond this list and addressing other issues
related to the interaction problem (e.g. classification, taxonomy or benchmarking) .....

CALL FOR PAPERS

Submission Deadline Extended to 14th May, 2007.

Sensor nodes are tiny autonomous devices that combine sensing, computing and wireless communication
capabilities. These nodes are deeply embedded into the physical surroundings, and gather and
process information such as temperature, humidity, light characteristics, seismic activities or
images and sound samples from the physical world. Networked systems of such sensors are expected .....

  CFP: Workshop on Web Personalization and Recommender Systems In conjunction with WI'07
  yue.xu@qut.edu.au

CALL FOR PAPER
Workshop on Web Personalization and Recommender Systems (WPRS07) in conjunction with the 2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence
(WI'07) and Agent Technology (IAT'07)
November 2-5, 2007, Silicon Valley, USA

http://www.wprs07.fit.qut.edu.au/

Workshop Theme
In recent years, interest in recommender systems has dramatically increased, driven by demand
for Internet personalization applications. Many major e-commerce web sites are currently
using recommender systems to provide advice to users about products or services and help users
find the information of their interests quickly. Web-based recommender systems are the most
notable application of the web personalization. With today's increasing information overload
problem on the Web, the area of recommender systems research becomes more challenging than
ever before. There remain difficulties limiting the full exploitation of ersonalization and
recommendation, arising both from technology and from the "human factor." The goal of this
workshop is to bring together academic and industrial researchers to exchange ideas about past,
present and future trends in Web personalization and recommender systems and discuss the most
innovative approaches to personalization and recommendation making. The themes will be in
algorithms, applications and interfaces.
