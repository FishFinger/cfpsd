Call for Papers:

Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing - BSNLP 2009
Second International Workshop
Cracow, Poland
15 June 2009
http://erssab.u-bordeaux3.fr/BSNLP

This year BSNLP is co-located with the IIS 2009 (Intelligent  =

Information Systems) conference.
TOPIC and MOTIVATION

The recent political and economic changes in Central and Eastern  =

Europe and the related on-going enlargement of the European Union  =

brings into focus new cultures and languages. Among them, the  =

languages from the Balto-Slavonic group have an outstanding role  =

because of their rich cultural heritage and the widespread use: over  =

400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP)  =

for the Balto-Slavonic languages. The NLP tasks include, but are not  =

limited to, morphological analysis and generation, tagging,  =

named-entity recognition, information extraction, co-reference  =

resolution, question-answering, information retrieval, text  =

summarisation, machine translation. Research on these topics in the  =

context of Balto-Slavonic languages is still in its early stage and is  =

progressing relatively slowly. Due to specific linguistic phenomena,  =

such as rich inflection and relatively free word order, a construction  =

of language processing tools for these languages is an intriguing and  =

challenging task.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and  =

practitioners working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages. The  =

workshop will give an opportunity to exchange ideas and experience, to  =

discuss hard-to-tackle problems in this field of research, and to make  =

available resources more widely known.

This workshop is a follow-up to the successful first BSNLP 2007  =

workshop held in conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference in Prague.  =

In particular, we would strongly encourage submissions describing  =

systems, resources or solutions that are made available to the wider  =

public, as this would help to promote computational linguistics  =

applications for these languages.
AREAS OF INTEREST
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP in the context of:

     * text segmentation
     * morphological analysis
     * morphology models
     * morpho-syntactic disambiguation
     * named-entity recognition
     * named-entity dissambiguation
     * named-entity lemmatisation
     * name variant recognition and merging
     * term and keyword extraction
     * syntactic parsing and chunking
     * co-reference resolution
     * word sense disambiguation
     * corpus-based knowledge acquisition
     * information extraction
     * question answering
     * machine translation
     * text summarisation
     * text classification
     * information retrieval
     * linguistic processing in search engines

B. Multilingual frameworks applied to these languages

     * tools and resources (freely available for research purposes  =

will be preferred)
     * experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and  =

processing resources
     * comparative evaluation between languages
     * encoding standards and formats

SUBMISSION

We expect two kinds of submissions:

     * full papers
     * short papers

Long papers should describe original unpublished work and should  =

indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In  =

particular, an overlap with previously published work should be  =

clearly mentioned. The authors should indicate in the abstract of  =

their submission if the paper has been submitted elsewhere.

Short papers should describe work in progress and/or interactive  =

software demos.

All submissions, both of long and short papers, will be judged on  =

correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation,  =

usability, and significance/relevance to the workshop. Submissions  =

will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. The  =

reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the  =

authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other  =

references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

The final papers are to be prepared using LaTeX. Please download the  =

zipped archive with files needed to process your document:  =

iis4authors.zip. Both class files and an example of use are contained  =

in the archive. Please follow all the recommendations given in the  =

example.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted  =

papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than March 15,  =

2009 using the submission webpage.

The page limit for long papers is 14 pages, whereas short papers /  =

software demo descriptions are limited to 7 pages.
PUBLICATION

Workshop proceedings in electronic form will be distributed at the  =

workshop. They will be available on-line after the workshop.
Additionnaly, the accepted long papers will be published along with  =

the main IIS 2009 conference papers in a monograph form.
IMPORTANT DATES

     * Paper submissions due: 15.03.2009
     * Notification of acceptance: 13.04.2009
     * Camera-ready versions due: 4.05.2009

VENUE

Krak=F3w (Cracow) is one of the largest and the oldest cities in Poland.  =

Nowadays it is an important center of science, education and business.  =

Thanks to its history, monuments, unique atmosphere of the old town  =

district and excellent restaurants Krak=F3w attracts tourists from all  =

parts of the world.
