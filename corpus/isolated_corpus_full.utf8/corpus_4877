Call Deadline: 08-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Organizing Committee of the Third Workshop on Computational Approaches to
Arabic Script-based Languages invites proposals for presentation at CAASL3,
being held in conjunction with MT Summit XII. 

The first two workshops (2004 and 2007) brought together researchers working on
the computer processing of Arabic script-based languages such as Arabic, Persian
(Farsi and Dari), Pashto and Urdu, among others. The usage of the Arabic script
and the influence of Arabic vocabulary give rise to certain computational issues
that are common to these languages despite their being of distinct language
families, such as right to left direction, encoding variation, absence of
capitalization, complex word structure, and a high degree of ambiguity due to
non-representation of short vowels in the writing system. 

The third workshop (CAASL3), five years after the successful first workshop,
will provide a forum for researchers from academia, industry, and government
developers, practitioners, and users to share their research and experience with
a focus on machine translation.  It also provides an opportunity to assess the
progress that has been made since the first workshop in 2004. 

Call for Papers

Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: May 8, 2009 
Notification of acceptance: June 12, 2009 
Camera ready submissions: July 10, 2009

Workshop Topics 
We welcome submissions in any area of NLP in Arabic script-based languages.
However, preference would be given to papers that focus on Machine Translation
applications of Arabic script-based languages. The main themes of this workshop
include:

- Statistical and rule-based machine translation 
- Translation aids
- Evaluation methods and techniques of machine translation systems
- MT of dialectal and conversational language
- Computer-mediated communication (e.g., blogs, forums, chats)
- Knowledge bases, corpora, and development of resources for MT applications
- Speech-to-speech MT 
- MT combined with other technologies (speech translation, cross-language
information retrieval, multilingual text categorization, multilingual text
summarization, multilingual natural language generation, etc.) 
- Entity extraction
- Tokenization and segmentation 
- Speech synthesis and recognition
- Text to speech systems 
- Semantic analysis

Submission Requirements                                                 
Papers should not have been presented somewhere else or be under consideration
for publication elsewhere, and should not identify the author(s). They should
emphasize completed work rather than intended work. Each paper will be
anonymously reviewed by three members of the program committee.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format to caasl3@arabicscript.org by midnight of
the due date. Submissions should be in English. The papers should be attached to
an email indicating contact information for the author(s) and paper's title.
Papers should not exceed 8 pages including references and tables, and should
follow the formatting guidelines posted at

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
