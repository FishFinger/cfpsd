Meeting Description

The American Translation and Interpreting Studies Association (ATISA)
invites you to attend the fourth ATISA Conference, 'Meeting at the Border:
Profile of the Language Mediator.' The conference will be held at the
University of Texas at El Paso April 3-5, 2008.   

ATISA encourages, supports, and furthers the study of translation and
interpreting studies by disseminating knowledge and research relevant to
all areas of language mediation, specifically translation and interpreting,
regardless of discipline. 'Translation and interpreting studies' here means
the study of all forms of communication between languages, including
translation, interpreting, localization, bilingual text revision,
cross-cultural communication, and the various specializations, tools, and
technologies involved in such activities. Presentations focusing on the act
of communicating between human languages from a wide range of disciplines
and methodologies, including translation studies, interpretation studies,
applied linguistics, cognitive science, cultural studies, ethnology,
sociology, anthropology, education, and other social sciences are welcomed.
Presentations must follow the standards of scholarship of their respective
disciplines, and they must show the connection of their work to translation
and interpreting studies.    

ATISA IV will be held in the world's largest binational, bicultural, and
bilingual metropolitan areas, El Paso-Cd. Ju√°rez. It is an ideal location
for the dissemination of information on intercultural communication. You
will have the opportunity to network with translation and interpreting
scholars and educators from the Borderlands, Texas, and from across the
nation and world. 

ATISA Call for Papers

Translation and interpreting scholars are invited to submit proposals for
papers. The focus of the meeting is the acquisition and development of the
language mediator's skills set. However, presentations on all aspects of
translation and interpreting studies are welcome. Papers will be divided
into strands on 1) translation/interpreting pedagogy (teaching and
learning), 2) translation/interpreting theory, and 3)
translation/interpreting empirical research. Presentations will be 20
minutes in length, followed by discussion. The deadline for receipt of
proposals is October 31, 2007. Include full name, address, phone number,
e-mail, institutional affiliation, and title of paper. Indicate strand, and
include a proposal abstract of 200 words or less.

Submit paper proposals to ATISA2008@gmail.com

Or if you prefer, proposals can also be sent by regular mail to:
