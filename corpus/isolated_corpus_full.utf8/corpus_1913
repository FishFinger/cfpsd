and Applied Linguistics. They are encouraged to submit an abstract of their
original research work in any field of linguistics (phonetics, phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, historical linguistics, discourse
analysis, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics,
lexicology, lexicography, language acquisition, language teaching, etc.).

Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

The International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2007
seeks to provide a renewed opportunity for interaction between language
professionals with different methodological backgrounds. LBM was established in
2005 and the remit of this event remains highly relevant today. The symposium
focuses on the languages that are in active use for biology and medicine. We are
calling for original research papers on, but not limited to the topics listed
below. Papers focusing on application aspects of languages in biology and
medicine are also invited. 

- Natural language: text mining, retrieval and management;

- Ontology language: ontology construction, extension and management;

- Logic language: knowledge representation and induction;

- Sequence language: RNA structure prediction, protein domain prediction;

- Database language: database interface, query language;

- Visualization language: information visualization, molecular visualization. 

Extended deadline September 30th 
2nd International Symposium on

Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2007

6-7 December 2007 @ Biopolis, Singapore

(http://lbm2007.biopathway.org/)

Language is a powerful tool that in its many manifestations is a system, used
for communication, comprising a finite set of arbitrary symbols and a set of
rules (or grammar) by which the manipulation of these symbols is governed. In
biology and medicine, the importance of languages used to represent knowledge,
communicate and query information is immense. Likewise auxiliary tasks such as
translation, summarization and information extraction play important roles
supporting scientific research. The automation of such tasks has significantly
advanced knowledge discovery in biomedicine.

Incumbent technologies that discover, read and process language are continually
stretched by the vigorous demands of bio-medical scientists and there is the
continual need and incentive for language techniques to evolve. Despite this,
the distinct communities involved in language processing rarely borrow from one
another or look over the fence to see what other approaches are in use. And yet
synergistic interactions across methodological disciplines and across different
topics are frequently the harbingers of revolutionary technologies. In this
context, it is imperative that we adopt diversification, more lateral and
creative interaction between language professionals.   

LBM2007 will consist of oral paper and poster presentation, invited speeches and
a panel discussion. In addition to on-line conference proceedings, oral paper
presentations will be published in BMC Bioinformatics and receive a MEDLINE
citation.

The symposium is co-located with the International Conference on Genome
Informatics (GIW), which will be held in Singapore from December 3 to 5, 2007.

Submission of Papers

Submission should follow BMC instructions for authors which could be found at
http://lbm2007.biopathway.org/PaperSubmission and should not exceed 14 pages
including references. Additional pages could be given to figures and tables.

Paper review will be double blind, so papers should not include authors' names
and affiliations. Self-references are to be avoided-instead of ''As we showed in
Smith et al. 1999...'', say ''As Smith et al. 1999 showed....'' Paper submission
software will allow authors to enter full author information separately. The
paper submission site is http://www.easychair.org/LBM2007. Manuscripts must be
submitted no later than September 9, 2007.

Important Dates

Paper submission due: September 30 , 2007
Notification of acceptance: November 1, 2007
Camera ready due: November 30 , 2007
LBM 2007 Conference: December 6-7, 2007
