Meeting Description

University Discourses: Forms, Practices, Transformations 

University Discourses: Forms, Practices, Transformations

International Symposium organised by
the Universities of Brussels (ULB), Liège (ULG) and Louvain (UCL)

Brussels - 24, 25, 26 April 2008

Call for Papers

The University institution is debating with increasing frequency the
characteristics, methods and aims of the discourses it is shaping. It is in
effect experiencing a profound change that will force it to ask again as much
about its missions (scientific, pedagogic, social, economic, political) as about
the strategies it is implementing to accomplish them. Many feel that it is high
time that university analysis of discourse also be used to analyse university
discourses.

The audience of university students has changed: democratisation and vast
increase of higher education studies has led to tensions, ruptures and, in the
best of cases, adaptations that not only relate to the subjects and programmes,
but also to the functions and functioning of the discourses. In the framework of
liberalisation, even of commercialisation of studies and sciences, the
University should take a stand to distinguish itself or draw inspiration from
the models suggested by the public and private sectors in education, research
and economic development; discourses of the university, in the university, and
on the university bear witness to these influences and competitions.

Moreover, internationalisation - in the sense of competitiveness and
collaboration - will from now on be one of the main vehicles in the evolution of
the university: the proliferation of contacts, exchanges, projects, cross-border
planning in education as well as in research have led the university community
to debate linguistic and discursive practices to discover their distinctive
features or, on the contrary, to attempt to reduce them in order to better
participate in this intellectual globalisation. Furthermore, the strictly
educational, scientific, technological, and epistemological evolutions and
revolutions that have had a tendency to speed up over the last few decades in
all fields are not without consequence on discourses both as disseminators and
producers of knowledge.

It is under these circumstances that the intention of the colloquium is to
provide an overview of the university discourses defined previously as 'the
discourses held in the context of a university institution, or more precisely by
its teachers, its researchers and its students in performing their functions'.

In the light of introducing conferences (T. Donahue, K. Fløttum, B. Fraenkel C.
Kerbrat-Orecchinioni, D. Maingueneau) the debates will focus on three parts, and
one day will be devoted to each.

1. University discourses, contextual modalities, pragmatic dimensions,
intellectual technology
It should first be asked if the university discourse(s) indeed exist(s), in
relation in particular to scientific, pedagogic, technical and academic
discourses, and which could be the specificities. The participants will question
the contextual, declarative, pragmatic and material conditions of this or these
discourses: status and roles of the people involved, method and subjectivity,
scenography, topoi and ethos connected to the university/place of work
paralinguistic vehicles, objects and technical or symbolic support (its
intellectual technology), aims displayed, researched and achieved, ideological
issues?In this way one can better define the relationships that maintain logic
described in this way of the university discourse with those that extol the
institution, pedagogy and cognition.
	
2. Forms of University discourses: critical inventory
The contributions that turn on this aspect of the issue will aim at describing,
metacritically, the variety of university discourses (types and sub-types), and
to propose criteria likely to give an account of all their characteristics
(including means of acquisition and dissemination of these discourses: on paper
or virtually, orally or in writing, etc.). These analyses will fall within
linguistic, discursive (quantitative and qualitative), sequential (definitions,
description, explanation, etc.), textual, argumentative, interdiscursive,
interactional, and so forth. It will also be a question of norms, implicit and
explicit, that underlie this diversity or that aim at containing, whether one is
delighted with it or one regrets it.

3. Evolution of University discourses in the new international context
Based on accounts from different disciplinary specialists, to close we will look
at how the discourses are evolving - whether over just one career - the
university discourses, their conditions, their characteristics, whether in the
context of teaching, research or even informal exchanges. Particular attention
will be paid to constraints imposed on scientific publication. Finally, we will
examine linguistic, scientific, epistemological, ideological, linguistic and
human issues of standardisation of scientific discourses serving academic
globalisation.
