           Announcement and First Call for Papers

                          FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
                                                   on
          GLOBAL INTEROPERABILITY FOR LANGUAGE RESOURCES

                               City University of Hong Kong
                                            Hong Kong
                                       9-11 January 2008
                                 http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, =20
knowledge bases and ontologies, grammars, etc. support the =20
development of language processing applications that are increasingly =20
important to the global society. Substantial effort has been devoted =20
to the creation of such resources for the world's major languages =20
over the past decades, and new projects are developing similar =20
resources for less widely-used languages. Some standards and best =20
practices have emerged for representing and linking language corpora =20
and annotations, efforts such as "Global WordNet" and the development =20
of framenets in multiple languages seek to create and link specific =20
lexical and semantic resources across languages, and there are =20
efforts to integrate such resources into general ontologies such as =20
SUMO. As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, =20
it is increasingly important to develop resources in the world's =20
languages that can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with =20
common software, and that contain linguistic information for the same =20
or comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a =20
"global web" of language resources, wherein, for example, =20
linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are inter-=20
linked via the use of common categories, or categories that are =20
mapped to one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are =20
linked not only to versions in different languages, but also to each =20
other; and common representations enable analysis and use of =20
resources in different languages and of different types within =20
available systems.

The first international conference on Global Interoperability for =20
Language Resources will bring together designers, developers, and =20
users of corpora and other language resources from across the globe, =20
in order to:

o  assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for
    resource representation, annotation, interlinkage, and
    access;
o  consider the requirements for (and obstacles to)
    multi-lingual and multi-modal interoperability and
    standardization;
o  consider the requirements for achieving interoperability
    among multi-lingual resources of different types,
    including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases,
    ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks
    that enable their creation and exploitation;
o  consider the ways in which web technologies are and may
    be used to enable resource interoperability and inter-
    linkage;
o  work toward the definition of best practice guidelines
    and standards for language resource representation,
    annotation, and use that will enable interoperability;
o  consider means to map or harmonize linguistic
    information in order to better enable cross-lingual
    studies;
o  provide direction for developers of resources for less
    widely used languages;
o  promote collaboration and cooperation among developers
    of language resources across the globe;
o  consider ways to provide central or distributed access
    to language resources developed throughout the world.

TOPICS

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following =20
topics:

o  multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources,
    with focus on the mechanisms enabling interoperability;
o  support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in
    systems/frameworks for resource creation, annotation,
    use, and access;
o  existing and proposed standards for language resources,
    including standards for linguistic annotations at any
    and all linguistics levels;
o  systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the
    development and exploitation of interoperable language
    resources;
o  evaluation of existing resources, systems and
    frameworks, and/or standards in terms of support for
    interoperability;
o  harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language
    resources, including corpora, wordnets, framenets,
    ontologies, etc.;
o  web-based technologies for resource interoperability,
    inter-linkage, and access;
o  ontologies for language resources, especially for
    support of  multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and
    multi-modality.

PROCEEDINGS

Accepted papers will be included in conference proceedings, to be =20
published by City University Press, Hong Kong. Beijing. A selection =20
of outstanding conference presentations will be published in a =20
special issue of the journal Language Resources and Evaluation.

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in length, including =20
bibliography and any appendices. Author instructions will be posted =20
on the conference web site.
