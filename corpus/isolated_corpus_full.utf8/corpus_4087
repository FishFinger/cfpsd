 Finite-State Methods and Natural Language Processing FSMNLP 2009

              Eight International Workshop
           University of Pretoria=2C South Africa
               http=3A//fsmnlp2009=2Efastar=2Eorg

                    21-24 July 2009

 As in 2008=2C FSMNLP is merged with the FASTAR (Finite Automata
 Systems Theoretical and Applied Research) workshop=2E
----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         SCOPE
                         =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
AIM

The International Workshop Series of Finite State Methods and Natural
Language Processing (FSMNLP)=2C is a forum for researchers and
practitioners working on
 - NLP applications or language (technology) research resources=2C
 - theoretical and implementation aspects=2C or
 - their combinations
having *obvious relevance or an explicitly discussed relation* to
Finite-State Methods in NLP=2E

In the past=2C seven FSMNLP workshops have been organised (Budapest
1996=2C Ankara 1998=2C Helsinki 2001=2C Budapest 2003=2C Helsinki 2005=2C=

Potsdam 2007=2C Ispra 2008)=2E

We invite submissions related to all obvious or traditional FSMNLP
topics=2C see e=2Eg=2E FSMNLP 2008=2E The updated list of topics include=
s
 - all the obvious or traditional topics
 - plus some new topics such as=3A
    * common interfaces=2C portability=2C and shared methods for testing=
/
      benchmarking/evaluation of finite-state tools
    * coping with large alphabets during finite-state compilation and
      in real-word applications
    * fixed parameter tractability and narrowness in streamed NLP
    * conventional/parallel algorithms using/manipulating
      conventional/stochastic finite-state automata/paths
    * applications of rational kernels to active/statistical machine
      learning of finite-state models=2E


SPECIAL THEME

In recognition of its location on the African continent=2C this year=27s=

FSMNLP has Finite-State Methods for Under-Resourced Languages as a
special theme=2E The theme is relevant to finite-state methods

 - applied to practical tasks such as language survey=2C elicitation=2C
   data collection=2C computer-aided annotation=2C morphological
   description=2C modelling and normalization=2C
 - considering demanding conditions such as linguistic complexity
   and diversity=2C scarce resources=2C research infrastructures=2C real=
-
   time grammar updates=2C
 - in language processing fields such as comparative linguistics=2C
   field linguistics=2C applied linguistics=2C language teaching=2C and
   computer-aided translation=2E

The special theme does not restrict the scope but attempts to draw the
attention of contributors to the challenges of computational
linguistics in Africa=2E We hope that the theme teases out promising and=

useful applications of Finite-State Methods in this context=2E



                         SPECIAL SESSIONS
                         =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=


RELATED EVENTS

Our plan is to catalyze discussion and subworkshopping under some
intense topics by providing tutorials=2C competitions (shared tasks)=2C
and sessions/submissions suited for e=2Eg=2E researcher training=2E Our
special effort to catalyze discussion and joint subworkshopping
includes the following topic areas that have been selected considering
the opportunities provided by the location of this year=27s event=3A

1=2E =22Finite-State Methods for African and Other Under-Resourced/
  Low-Density Languages=22
    including knowledge and data-driven methods and their combinations

2=2E =22Practical Aspects and Experience of FS Methods and Systems=22
    including exchange formats=2C performance=2C tool demos=2C compressi=
on

3=2E =22Tree Automata and Transducers=22
    including all applications of formal tree language theory in NLP=2E

Each such program is organized by international experts related to the
topics=2E The organizers are also represented in the main event Program
Committee=2E


TUTORIALS AND INVITED TALKS

We expect to have tutorials on the following tentative topics=3A

 - =22Developing Computational Morphology for Low/Middle-Density Languag=
es=22
     by Kemal Oflazer
 - =22Machine Learning with Automata=22
     by Colin de la Higuera

The INVITED SPEAKERS will be announced later=2E


COMPETITIONS

We hope to be able to include small competitions / shared tasks=3A
 - machine learning of morphology
 - compression of dictionaries


BUSINESS MEETING

We wish to provide a slot for a business meeting of a special interest
group on finite-state methods and models provided that the necessary
initial actions for getting such a SIG in Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL) have been carried out successfully
before the FSMNLP 2009=2E


                         SUBMISSION
                         =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

PAPER CATEGORIES AND FORMATS

We initially invite submissions of full papers i=2Ee=2E scientific
contributions presenting new theoretical or experimental
results=2E Papers should present original=2C unpublished research result=
s
and should not be submitted elsewhere simultaneously=2E

At a later stage=2C submission of extended abstracts on on-going
research=2C systems=2C interactive software demos=2C and joint projects =
will
likely be invited for each of the subworkshopping areas=2E (Note that
the early acceptance notification date for full papers may help to
keep travel costs for international participants reasonably low=2E) If
you come from far away and have only an extended abstract=2C the
abstract can be submitted earlier as if it were a full paper=2E

The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted
papers since the review process wil be double blind (submissions by
ordinary PC members are such as well)=2E Submissions are electronic and
in PDF format via a web-based submission server=2E

Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNCS style (Proceedings and
Other Multiauthor Volumes) for LaTeX in producing the PDF
document=2E For graph visualization=2C Vaucanson-G LaTeX style=2C
Graphviz/dot and XFig are recommended=2E If you use a non-roman script
or Microsoft Word=2C it is advisable to warn the organizers as early as
possible=2E The page limit is 12 pages for full papers=2E


PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE

The on-site proceedings will be on CD=2E

The actual proceedings with revised regular papers will be published
after the conference in a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence as a part of the LNCS Series by Springer-Verlag=2E  LNCS
banner

In addition=2C a special journal issue on Finite-State Methods and
Models in NLP is being planned=2E Extended versions of the papers and
abstracts may be submitted to this special issue (the publication
involves a second review/selection cycle)=2E


                         IMPORTANT DATES
                         =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
