Special Issue Enculturating Human Computer Interaction, Journal of AI &

Deadline for submissions: 30 September 2008


----- Please feel free to distribute this call -----

We are living in a globalized world but local or cultural identities strongly
influence our patterns of behavior and our interpretation of behavior in
others by estblishing norms and values. Nevertheless, current interfaces
seldom reflect such cultural heuristics. Thus, users are forced to adapt their
way of interaction and interpretation to a given (most of the time western)
perspective. Instead it would be much more reasonable to allow e.g. for
culturally tailored presentation of information. Although there is no
principled approach yet to challenge the importance of cultural patterns in
human-computer interaction, there are a number of promising results from a
variety of research projects around the world that have started to integrate
cultural aspects in the interaction. These range from artistic work over web
design to CSCW support tools and training applications with conversational
virtual characters. Bringing together the leading reseachers from these
emerging research streams in this special issue will further discussions and
contribute to establishing a new research area.

The special issue will be centered around three main research challenges: 1.
Models and Theory: Cultural norms and values penetrate all our interactions by
giving us heuristics how to behave and how to interpret verbal and nonverbal
behaviors. To make such a notion like culture available for computation, we
need theories of culture that precisely describe its effects on interaction
allowing for building parametrized models.
2. Empirical data on cultural/cross-cultural interaction: To realize technical
systems that take cultural influences on behavior and perception into account,
precise data analysis on how this influence manifests itself is necessary.
Because this information is often scattered throughout the literature, it is
necessary to provide (meta-)analyses of specific behaviors. Additionally,
there is a need for large databases of comparable multimodal corpora from
different cultures to assess variations in a principled way. From a developers
point of view, data on cultural differences in interacting with interfaces and
devices is necessary.
3. Systems and Applications: Having identified cultural influences on
verbal/nonverbal interaction behaviors, it remains to be shown how this can be
applied to the development of human-computer interfaces, for instance in
dynamically tailoring web designs to the user's cultural preferences for
information presentation, or in ASR systems taking the user's culture-specific
verbal behavior into account, or in virtual characters in games and training
applications reflecting the users' culturally determined nonverbal behavior
patterns. Moreover, the effect of systems taking cultural variables into
account has to be evaluated to provide a sound empirical foundation for
further developments.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Models and theories of enculturated interfaces
- Design guidelines for enculturated interfaces
- Field studies of intercultural interaction
- Standardization issues on resources and tools for enculturated HCI such as
multilingual/multi-cultural comparative corpus, verbal/nonverbal behaviors
annotation scheme
- Language processing for enculturated interfaces/multilingual NLP -
Multimodal processing for enculturated interfaces
- Culture adaptive interaction techniques focuing e.g. on conversational,
mobile, pervasive, or web-based interactions
- Computer supported intercultural collaboration
- Web technologies for enculturated HCI
- Ambient technologies for enculturated HCI
- Prototypes of enculturated systems
- Evaluation case studies/Evaluation guidelines for enculturated systems

Submission
Submissions will be blind reviewed by at least two members of the reviewing
committee (see below). Thus, please anonymize your contribution for the
review. Please send all submissions as pdf to rehm AT

additional title page with the following information: name(s) of the
author(s), concise and informative title, affiliation(s) and address(es) of
the author(s), e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers of the corresponding
author and an abstract of 100 to 150 words. Formatting instructions are found
at the above mentioned website, which also provides a Word template and a
LaTeX macro package.
