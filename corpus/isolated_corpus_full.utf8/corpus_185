CALL FOR PAPERS



Theme: Text analysis using corpora - methodological issues.



Date: Friday April 28th 2006



Place: The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK. (for travel directions =
see http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/locations.aspx).



Time and Room: 10am - 5pm, Central Meeting Room 15, Christodolou =
Building.



Organisers: Dr Kieran O'Halloran, Dr Caroline Coffin (Centre for =
Language and Communications, The Open University) and Lia Blaj =
(Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University).



Guest speakers: =20

Professor Guy Cook, The Open University.

Professor Susan Hunston, University of Birmingham.



Text analysis using corpora - methodological issues

More and more applied linguists (broadly defined) are drawing on corpus =
resources to increase the power and rigour of their text analyses. This =
is becoming prevalent in areas such as Argument Studies, Academic =
Literacies, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, Critical Discourse Analysis, =
Educational Linguistics, Forensic Linguistics, Literary Stylistics, =
Systemic Functional Linguistics and Translation Studies (to name but a =
few). But for each benefit a corpus-informed text analysis offers, a =
host of prickly but fascinating methodological issues may be thrown up, =
which in turn create problems for what can be claimed in analysis and =
interpretation. Alongside these newer issues and problems are some now =
well-known reflections on the limits of what can be claimed from corpus =
analysis (e.g. by Guy Cook and Henry Widdowson).

The BAAL Corpus Linguistics SIG meeting on Friday 28th April 2006 is =
devoted to providing a stimulating and supportive environment for =
pooling individual tussles with such problems so as to lead to better =
informed reflection on combining text-based and corpus-informed methods =
of analysis. In turn, we hope in this sort of environment that ways can =
be suggested for increasing the rigour as well as the clarity of what =
scholars can claim for such a combinatory approach. Given the nature of =
the forum, it will be of benefit to not only established academics but =
also postgraduate students who may be dealing with such issues.

We welcome abstracts (up to 400 words) on areas mentioned above (or =
others) for 30 minute slots (with at least 10 mins devoted to =
discussion) which openly address the above issues. Presenters may wish =
to provide accounts of work-in-progress, focus on associated problems in =
doing this kind of research or look at potential solutions. They may =
also wish to present their investigations 'workshop style' whereby other =
participants have the opportunity to explore their data in detail.



Address for abstracts

If you wish to be considered for a paper presentation, please send =
abstracts (email or hardcopy) to:

Lia Blaj ( L.L.Blaj@open.ac.uk <mailto:L.L.Blaj@open.ac.uk>  )

Room 199, Geoffrey Crowther Building,
