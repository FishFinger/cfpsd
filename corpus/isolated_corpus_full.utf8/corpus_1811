Full Title: CIL workshop of Interface Conditions 

Date: 21-Jul-2008 - 26-Jul-2008
Location: Seoul, Korea, South 
Contact Person: Anna Maria Di Sciullo
Meeting Email: di_sciullo.anne-marie@uqam.ca
Web Site: http://www.interfaceasymmetry.uqam.ca 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

A workshop on interface conditions, in the memory of Tanya Reinhart, will be
held in conjunction with the 18th International Congress of Linguists (CIL 18). 

Invited speakers: Tecumseh Fitch, Sandiway Fong, Jim Higginbotham, 
Norbert Hornstein, Eric Reuland, Mark Steedman, Charles Yang

Works in Minimalism aim at reducing interface conditions, including the Binding
theory and theta-theory, to deeper properties of the grammar (e.g., Hornstein
2002, Kayne 2002), thereby approaching explanation of linguistic phenomena.
Works on the properties of interfaces bring to fore the role of computational
efficiency and processing considerations in sentence production and
comprehension (e.g., Reinhart 2006, Yang 2005). The purpose of this workshop is
to discuss the interactions of grammar specific properties and
computational/processing properties, and their effects at the interfaces. The
workshop, more broadly, aims at exploring further the three factors that
according to Chomsky (2006) enter into to growth of language in the individual,
and in particular the independent principle of efficient computation (Hauser,
Chomsky & Fitch 2002; Fitch & Hauser 2004). 

We invite submissions for thirty-minute talks (20 minutes for presentation plus
10 minutes for questions) on research focusing on the role of computational
efficiency and human processing restrictions in language growth. Papers focusing
on how language independent principles can explain key properties of language
are encouraged to apply. A representative, but not exhaustive, list of topics
for potential papers includes the following:   
   
The manifestation of language independent principles at the interfaces. 
Language and language independent principles determining language growth. 
The architectural constraints that determine and limit possible attainable
languages. 

Important Dates:
 
August 31, 2007: Deadline for submitting the abstract.
November 31, 2007: Notification of acceptance.
February 15, 2008: Deadline for submitting the final version of the accepted
abstract for publication in the proceedings of CIL18. 
September 30, 2008: Deadline for submitting the final version of the presented
paper to be published in CD.
 
Form and submission of abstracts:
 
An abstract(.pdf or .doc file) should be up to 3-pages long, including data and
references. The abstract should start with the title of the paper, followed by
the text of the abstract. Please do not include the author's name in the
abstract. On a separate page, please give the author's name, affiliation, e-mail
address, telephone number, mailing address, the paper title and the session
number (title).
 
Please send the abstract and the author's information to both cil18@cil18.org
and di_sciullo.anne-marie@uqam.ca.
