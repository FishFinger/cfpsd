General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants will
have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience as well
as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers who will
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to the
workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask for
suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by an
international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop will
be on work in progress. The research being presented can come from any
topic area within computational linguistics including, but not limited
to, the following topic areas:

    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
    * phonetics, phonology and morphology
    * linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
    * information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
    * summarization and paraphrasing
    * language generation
    * speech recognition, speech synthesis
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
    * spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
    * multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
    * message and narrative understanding system

Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished research.
The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who have
settled on their thesis direction but still have significant research
left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange
ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for further
development of the work, papers should clearly indicate directions for
future research wherever appropriate. All authors of multi-author papers
MUST be students. Papers submitted for this workshop are eligible only
if they have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly
available published proceedings. Students who have already presented at
an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research Workshop may not submit to this
workshop. They should submit their papers to the main conference
instead. It must be indicated if a paper has been submitted to another
conference or workshop.

Submission Format

Paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL 2010
proceedings without exceeding six (6) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
style files tailored for this year's conference. These files will be
available soon from this page. Submissions must conform to the official
ACL 2010 style guidelines and they must be electronic in PDF. Please use
the submission system to submit your paper.

Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Research Workshop will be
managed by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team
of reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance decision
will be based on the results of the review. As the reviewing will be
blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers
that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Important Dates:

  Paper submission deadline: February 15, 2010
  Notification of acceptance: April 12, 2010
  Camera-ready submission deadline: May 10, 2010
  Conference dates: July 11-16, 2010 (The workshop will be held during
the main conference)

Funding for Travel

There will be funding to assist student participants with travel and
conference expenses. This information will be available soon from the
workshop webpage.
