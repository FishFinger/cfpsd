Meeting Description:

The 17th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics 
(NODALIDA 2009)
May 14-16, 2009
Odense, Denmark 

Call for Papers

The Program Committee of the 17th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics
(NODALIDA 2009) invites papers on substantial, original, and unpublished
research on all aspects of language technology, including, but not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology and morphology;
- speech recognition and speech synthesis;
- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;
- syntax, semantics and grammars;
- pragmatics, discourse and dialogue;
- the lexicon and ontologies;
- parsing and grammatical formalisms;
- generation, text planning and summarization;
- language modeling, spoken language recognition and synthesis;
- linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, text categorization, question answering and 
  information extraction;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- machine learning for natural language;
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;
- multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- language-oriented applications, tools and resources;
- evaluation methodology.

Requirements-
Regular papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of
completion of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation
results should be included. Papers reporting on-going work or system
demonstrations should be submitted as short papers. All submissions will be
judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. 

Submissions presented at NODALIDA should mostly contain new material that has
not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. 
Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops 
must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain significant 
overlap with previously published work.

Reviewing
Reviewing will be managed by the Program Committee and associated reviewers. The
reviewing process will be blind and each submission will receive three
independent reviews.

Categories of Papers
Papers can be submitted to one of three categories: regular paper, short paper,
and student paper. Authors must designate one of these categories at submission
time. The three categories have different requirements on authors, submission
format and publication format:

Regular papers are submitted as full papers (max 8 pages). If accepted, a
regular paper can be presented either as a single talk during one of the
parallel paper sessions at the conference or as a poster in one of the poster
sessions. The authors can state their preference at submission time. In both
cases, the paper is published as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the conference
proceedings.

Short papers are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). They can
describe work in progress or system demonstrations. If accepted, a short paper
is presented at one of the poster or demo sessions at the conference and is
published as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) in the conference proceedings.

Student papers can be submitted as full papers (max 8 pages) or as short papers
(extended abstracts, max 4 pages). All authors of a student paper must be
students (undergraduate or graduate). If accepted, a full student paper can be
presented as a single talk or as a poster in one of the parallel student paper
sessions at the conference, and a short paper as a poster. Student papers are
published either as a full paper (max 8 pages) or as an extended abstract (max 4
pages) in the conference proceedings according to the authors' own choice.

Submission Information
Submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL proceedings and 
must use either the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template 
that will be made available on the conference web site, courtesy of the 
Association for Computational Linguistics. Regular paper submissions should not
exceed eight (8) pages, including references; student paper and short paper
submissions should not exceed four (4) pages. We reserve the right to reject
submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size
restrictions. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)
...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without
review. 

Submission will be electronic and must be made through the conference website.
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. 
Regular and student papers must be submitted no later than January 12, 2009;
short papers must be submitted no later than February 18, 2009. 
Papers submitted after the deadlines will not be reviewed. 

Important Dates
Submission regular and student papers: January 12, 2009
Submission short papers: February 18, 2009
Notification of acceptance (all paper types): March 23, 2009
Submission camera-ready papers: April 14, 2009
