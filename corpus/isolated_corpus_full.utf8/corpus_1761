Language Policy Research in Israel: the state of the art

The Language Policy Research Center was established at Bar-Ilan University in
order to conduct research in all aspects of language policy and related fields
relevant to the development of language policy, including sociolinguistics,
applied linguistics, translation, interpreting, language planning and language
teaching and assessment. Its areas of concern comprise both those aspects of
language policy that are determined by official rulings and those that evolve
over time, gaining ground as social norms. In particular, the Center aims at
studying issues in language policy in Israel and promoting research in these
areas. Towards this end, the LPRC will hold a conference dedicated to examining
current directions in language policy in Israel. 
 
Date: April 30, 2008
Venue: Feldman Auditorium, Bar Ilan University
Abstracts (maximum of 400 words) should be sent by February 10, 2008 to:
