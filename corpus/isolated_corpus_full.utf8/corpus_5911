What is AI and Second Language Learning [AI & SSL]? Second language

or any computational device) facilitates or otherwise affects that
learning.


Who might be interested? Second language curriculum developers,
materials developers, language schools, ITS creators, language
teachers, commercial word processing developers, and language learners

What kind of studies will be of interest? Papers and contributions and
encourages for any work that relates to second language learning,
ESL/EFL/ESP, or related subjects to AI. Topics of interest may include
(but are in no way limited to)

1. ITS Shells for ESP [English for Specific Purposes] Needs

2. Using AI for L2 Reading, Speaking, Writing, Listening, or
Grammaring

3. AI and CBI [Content Based Instruction] in Language Learning

4. Diagnostics, Assessment, and AI

5. Moving beyond the Moodle: CMS for Language Learning

6. Corpus Linguistics, AI, and Global English

7. Intercultural Simulations with Avatars

8. Games that Teach and Learn



Leading papers will also be considered for publication as chapters in
the forthcoming book: Applied Natural Language Processing and Content
Analysis: Advances in Identification, Investigation, and Resolution
