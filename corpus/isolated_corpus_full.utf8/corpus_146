Meeting Description:

Culture Lines: Emerging Research on Ethno-Racial Boundaries
November 4-5, 2005

An Interdisciplinary Graduate Student Conference Sponsored by the   Committ=
ee
for Ethnic Studies
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA

This national conference will bring together graduate students from   the s=
ocial
sciences and the humanities who research ethnic, racial,   and cultural
boundaries. Sessions will be organized thematically to   allow comparisons =
of
boundaries from diverse regions and historical   periods, as well as differ=
ent
disciplinary approaches. With this   conference, we aim to shift attention
toward the dynamics of   boundaries: how they are created, imposed, defende=
d,
bridged,   subverted, and transformed.

Possible themes might include:

-Properties of boundaries: permeability, permanence, salience, etc.
-Boundary processes: exclusion, bridging, imposition, etc.
-Historical research on racial and ethnic formations over time.
-Ethnographic findings on how boundaries are negotiated in everyday life.
-Boundaries in cultural production and reception: contesting authenticity,
dynamics of collaboration and competition, etc.
-Imagery of boundaries in cultural artifacts and performance
-How boundaries operate in the expression of collective identity, =20
through cultural and linguistic practices.

Keynote Speaker: Fredrik Barth, Department of Anthropology, University of O=
slo
Faculty Sponsor: Mich=E8le Lamont, Department of Sociology, Harvard   Unive=

All graduate students in accredited AM or PhD programs are invited to   sub=
mit
titled abstracts of no more than 300 words to   <xbounds@fas.harvard.edu> n=
o
later than August 1. Abstracts should   describe the argument of the paper =
and
the text/material/evidence on   which it draws. Students selected for
presentation will be notified   by September 1. They will be asked to submi=
t a
completed paper by   October 14. Please note that conference attendees will=
 be
responsible   for finding support for their travel and accommodation expens=

Subject: OBITUARY MARY BRENNAN (died 23-06-05)  
 

We were very sad to learn of Mary Brennan's death in Edinburgh at the
relatively young age of 61 years.

Mary had been in sign linguistics for thirty years. Her first article
"Can Deaf children acquire language" in 1976 raised questions that
were very new in Europe at the time. This she wrote while working at
Moray House College of Education in Scotland. She always championed
the rights of deaf people and worked hard towards creating respect in
the linguistics world for the investigation of sign languages. She
started the work on British Sign Language in Edinburgh in the early
eighties.  In 1987 she moved to Durham to start the Deaf Studies
program within the Deaf Studies Research Unit, as part of the
Department of Education at Durham University.  Here she established
with her colleagues diverse courses in interpreting, Deaf studies and
sign linguistics thereby making clear that these fields have an
academic status. In the same period she was also president of the
International Sign Language Association that, just as the SLLS now,
worked for the scientific acceptance of sign language linguistics and
for a high level of exchange at international meetings. Her Ph.D. was
awarded by Stockholm University in 1990 for a thesis on productive
morphology, a work that is well cited in the field. She had a strong
view on iconicity in terms of linguistic analysis but also in terms of
its usefulness for deaf children. She wrote: "I wish to claim that BSL
does not just exploit visuality, it also enables us to 'see' the
meaning that is being expressed through visual imagery, particularly
metaphor". It was typical of Mary to have been so busy with her work
for the deaf community that she didn't get round to completing her
Ph.D. thesis until 1990. At Durham in 1991 an international meeting on
word order took place that resulted also in a significant
publication. In 1998 she returned to Moray House and had been involved
with courses for teachers of the deaf and the development of
multi-media approaches to teaching sign languages. Her curriculum
vitae is on the ADPS website where you can see her also signing the
content http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/adps/who/.

The field and her colleagues will miss her greatly, not only for her
great contribution but also her warmth, humanity and good sense of
humour.

Abstract:

Volume 1 of A Grammar and Dictionary of Indus Kohistani contains around
8.000 lemmata, many of which are supplemented with parallels from adjacent
dialects, from other Dardic, from Nuristani, Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Dravidian
and Munda languages, and from Burushaski. The lemmata have been, wherever
possible, provided with information about their origin, and they are
connected by numerous cross-references. Since Indus Kohistani is a pitch
accent language with complicated rules governing the behaviour of the two
pitch accents in compounding, derivation, and inflexion, the lemmata are
not only marked with their appropriate pitch accents, but the behaviour of
the accents (change of value, shift) is illustrated with a large number of
inflected forms and cross-references. And since Indus Kohistani has a rich
(and frequently irregular) inner and outer conjugation, most verbs are
provided with many finite and participle forms. In addition, the dictionary
contains two indexes (English - Indus Kohistani and Old Indo-Aryan - Indus
Kohistani), and lists with place and clan names, names of the months, etc.

Abstract:

This book is a comparative study of the polysemy patterns displayed by
percussion/impact ('hitting') verbs in English and Warlpiri (Pama-Nyungan,
Central Australia).

The opening chapters develop a novel theoretical orientation for the study
of polysemy via a close examination of two theoretical traditions under the
broader cognitivist umbrella: Langackerian and Lakovian Cognitive Semantics
and Wierzbickian Natural Semantic Meta-language. Arguments are offered
which problematize attempts in these traditions to ground the analysis of
meaning either in cognitive or neurological reality, or in the existence of
universal synonymy relations within the lexicon. Instead, an interpretative
rather than a scientific construal of linguistic theorizing is sketched, in
the context of a close examination of certain key issues in the
contemporary study of polysemy such as sense individuation, the role of
reference in linguistic categorization, and the demarcation between
metaphor and metonymy.

The later chapters present a detailed typology of the polysemous senses of
English and Warlpiri percussion/impact (or P/I) verbs based on a
diachronically deep corpus of dictionary citations from Middle to
contemporary English, and on a large corpus of Warlpiri citations. Limited
to the operations of metaphor and of three categories of metonymy, this
typology posits just four types of basic relation between extended and core
meanings. As a result, the phenomenon of polysemy and semantic extension
emerges as amenable to strikingly concise description.=20

Subject: Tukano Color Terms 
 

I am wondering whether, in the various Tukano languages of South 
America, there is an irreducible base color term for the category 
of 'blue'.  In particular, I am interested in the Desana language and 
other languages of the Vaupes region.  From various books and 
articles by Reichel-Dolmatoff, I have seen terms 
for 'black', 'white', 'red', 'green', and 'yellow', but not 'blue', yet 'blue' is 
basic to the color symbolism of Desana and other Tukano 
cosmologies.

With apologies about the somewhat frivolous nature of the request, a 
former student of mine has asked me to identify the language in which 
this song, sang by her father in the nineteenseventies, is sung. 
Unfortunately, the recording is only nine seconds long. The father's 
origin is Italian, Piedmontese, to be more precise, but the song doesn't 
seem to be in any Italian dialect I am aware of. 

The sound clip can be downloaded at the following address.

student. Thank you.

Regarding query: http://linguistlist.org/issues/16/16-1851.html#1

Colleagues,

A few weeks ago, I posted to the list asking whether anyone knew the=20
grounds on which Elizabeth Kolbert claimed in her recent piece in the=20
New Yorker (6 June 2005, 'Last Words: A Language Dies,') that a=20
large number of languages had gone extinct when the Neolithic=20
revolution occurred.  This was the first time I heard such an assertion,=20
and I was surprised at it.  I received very informative and somewhat=20
varied replies from:

Mikael Parkvall
David  Drewelow
Joseph F. Foster
Martin Paviour-Smith
Claire Bowern
Harald Hammarstr=F6m
Scott DeLancey
Robert Orr

for which I am very grateful.  I've summarized those replies here. =20

A number of people pointed me to a recent book by Daniel Nettle and=20
Suzanne Romaine 'Vanishing Voices,' published by Oxford University=20
Press in 2000.  (Nettle has another, only slightly less recent=20
book 'Linguistic Diversity,' 1999, Oxford University Press that=20
apparently makes the same point.)  David Crystal's recent=20
book 'Language Death' (2000, Cambridge University Press) was also=20
mentioned, as well as  John McWhorter's 'The Power of Babel,' (2002,=20
W.H. Freeman, pp 258ff). =20

A number of people also referred to Renfrew's proposal that the=20
spread of Indo-European languages by the Neolithic Revolution=20
caused the nearly complete extinction of languages spoken previously=20
in Europe - Basque being the sole survivor.  Peter Bellwood's work=20
was also cited as arguing that language families have expanded with=20
the development of agriculture and animal husbandry by their=20
speakers. =20

One respondent disputed the claim that it is the spread of=20
horticulturists and pastoralists that causes languages to go extinct=20
and  attributed language extinction instead to the expansion of=20
theocratic and/or military chiefdoms, citing the case of the Zulu in=20
South Africa.

Thank you very much again to all the respondents.

Abstract:

The study of speech errors, or "slips of the tongue," is a time-honored
methodology which serves as a window to the representation and processing
of language and has proven to be the most reliable source of data for
building theories of speech production planning. However, until "Kids'
Slips", there has never been a corpus of such errors from children with
which to work. This is the first developmental linguistics research volume
to document how online processing is revealed in young children, ages 18
months through 5 years, through their slips of the tongue. Thus, this text
provides a new methodology and data source, which will greatly expand our
ability to uncover the details of early language development. Professor
Jaeger's groundbreaking book incorporates both details of her methodology
and findings with implications for different aspects of language
development, including phonetics and phonology, the lexicon, semantics,
morphology, and syntax. While all the child data is included in the book, a
Web site hosted by the author provides readers with the adult data as
well. "Kids' Slips" targets those who study language development in
linguistics, developmental psychology, and speech and hearing, as well as
those who study language representation and processing more generally 
in the same disciplines.

Title: Reinventing Curriculum 
Subtitle: A Complex-Perspective on Literacy and Writing 
Publication Year: 2005 
Publisher: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates

Author: Linda Laidlaw, University of Alberta, Canada

Hardback: ISBN: 0805850422 Pages: 240 Price: U.S. $ 69.95
Paperback: ISBN: 0805850430 Pages: 240 Price: U.S. $ 24.50


Abstract:

In this book, Linda Laidlaw explores the questions: What happens when
children begin to write? Why is it that the teaching and practice of
writing seems at times to be difficult in schools? How might teachers work
differently to create more inviting spaces for developing literacy? The   
premise is that written texts and literacy processes are developed within a
complex "weave" of particular contexts, or ecologies, and the unique
particularity of the learner's experiences, histories, memories and
interpretations. Laidlaw offers new information about writing and literacy   
pedagogy linked to current research in the complexity sciences and
cognition, and considers the possibilities that might emerge for pedagogy
when alternative metaphors, images, and structures are considered for
writing and curriculum. The volume includes qualitative and narrative
description of writing and literacy situations, events, and pedagogy, and
elaborates the historical, theoretical, and curricular background in which
such instruction exists within contemporary schooling.

The uses of the French imperfect have undergone a vast extension throughout
the history of the French language. It has become prototypical in contexts
such as description where old French used simple past. The prototypical
uses have resulted in a large number of stylistic uses: hypothesis, free
indirect speech, and the so-called 'forain', 'hypocoristique', 'ludique'
and 'narratif'. The wide range of uses raises the question of the
semantic unity of that form in synchrony as well as in diachrony.=20
Here are gathered for the first time discussions of emergent uses of the
imperfect, that are tackled through a variety of approaches (Damourette and
Pichon's, Wilmet's or Guillaume's systems, logic semantics or relevance
theory).=20

The book presents a selection of papers on syntactic variation from
different theoretical and methodological points of view. As such, it
contributes to a process of reflection on the dialectical relationship
between theoretical explanation and empirical description. In the first
part, the authors discuss the use of corpora in syntactic variation
studies. The rest of the book presents some new approaches to a number of
controversial topics. Part Two concentrates on word order, information
structure, and its phonological realization, while Part Three enlarges on
variations in the encoding of syntactic relations.=20

Abstract:

The aim of this study is to discover basic principles underlying linguistic
figurativeness and to develop a theory that is capable of capturing
conventional figurative language (referred to as CFLT, i.e. Conventional
Figurative Language Theory). The rich empirical data analysed for this
publication include, among other things, idioms, proverbs, lexicalised
metaphors, and figurative compounds, drawn from ten standard languages with
widely different genetic relationships and/or cultural backgrounds
(English, German, Dutch, Swedish, French, Russian, Lithuanian, Greek,
Finnish, Japanese) and one Low German dialect.=20
The main topic of this work is the relationship between the figurative
meaning of a lexical unit and the mental images that form its conceptual
basis. Using a cognitive approach, the study deals with the central
question of what types of knowledge are involved in creating motivating
links between these two conceptual levels of figurative units. Of all the
possible types of knowledge relevant to conventional figurative language,
so-called "cultural knowledge" can be shown to be crucial. As a
consequence, CFLT has to include elements of cultural semiotics and other
culture-related disciplines.=20

Abstract:

This text makes available in a concise format the chapters comprising the
research methodology section of the "Handbook of Research on Teaching the
English Language Arts, Second Edition". An introduction, designed to give
K-12 teachers an understanding of the basic categories and functions of
research in teaching, is followed by chapters addressing teacher
professionalism and the rise of "multiple literacies"; empirical research;
longitudinal studies; case studies; ethnography; teacher research; teacher
inquiry into literacy, social justice, and power; synthesis research;
fictive representation; and contemporary methodological issues and future
direction in research on the teaching of English. "Methods of Research on
Teaching the English Language Arts" is well-suited for use in upper-level
undergraduate and graduate-level literacy research methods courses.

Dissertation Abstract:

This dissertation deals with one of the central concerns of syntactic
theory since Ross 1967: How local is syntax and what are the measures of
syntactic locality?  On an empirical level, it presents the results of
three independent strands of research on German: (i) the study of reduced
infinitive constructions, in particular, Bech's (1955/57) classic work on
COHERENCE versus NON-COHERENCE in German, (ii) the POSSESSOR DATIVE
CONSTRUCTION (PDC), with a dative nominal playing the role of both
possessor and affectee, and (iii) BINDING, the conditions under which
reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns may occur.

Both the PDC and binding are phenomena involving relations between two
structural positions, and both are sensitive to the internal complexity of
intervening material.  Exploiting this sensitivity, I propose that
possessor datives and binding can serve as probes for infinitival clause
size.  Building on Wurmbrand 2001, I provide new evidence for a distinction
between infinitival complements that is more fine-grained than, and thus
goes beyond, the traditionally assumed binary distinction between coherence
and non-coherence.

These results provide the foundation for addressing two larger theoretical
issues: the typology of clause size and what makes a given phrase-type
transparent (constructed coherently) or opaque (constructed non-coherently)
to grammatical interactions with elements beyond its boundaries.

Examining various clausal and sub-clausal phrase-types, in particular
ACCUSATIVUS CUM INFINITIVO (AcI)-constructions, in connection with the PDC
and binding, I ultimately propose Chomsky's (2000, 2001) notion of PHASE as
the single determinant of locality which unifies all three of the syntactic
phenomena at issue here.  Just as Chomsky's (1973) SPECIFIED SUBJECT
CONDITION (SSC) constrained both movement configurations and coreference
possibilities, in the system I develop, phases impose the crucial locality
restriction on both PD-raising and binding.  However, while the
opacity-inducing presence of an intervening specified subject does play an
important role in my accounts of the PDC and binding, I argue that
appealing to phasehood covers more ground.  It captures the opacity effects
triggered not only by verbal and nominal (vP and DP) domains but also by
clausal and prepositional (CP and PP) domains.

Language Evolution: Formal Modelling Meets Empirical Data=20

Language is a defining characteristic of the human species.  Research into =
the origins and evolution of this capacity has the potential to inform a wi=
de range of disciplines, particularly those concerned with human culture an=
d cognition and the evolutionary forces which act to shape them.  Regrettab=
ly, theories of the evolution of language have often been speculative in na=
ture.  Recently, however, historical and developmental linguists, biologist=
s and comparative psychologists, among others, have begun to test the consi=
stency of such theories with empirical data.  Simultaneously, modelling tec=
hniques from mathematical biology and computer science have allowed the int=
ernal coherence of theories to be more rigorously tested.

''Language Evolution: Formal Modelling Meets Empirical Data'' will highligh=
t and build on these recent and promising developments in evolutionary ling=
uistics, bringing together researchers from linguistics, psychology, biolog=
y and computer science, in order to develop novel, synthetic and ultimately=
 testable theories of the evolution of this uniquely human trait.

The workshop will take place on September 2-3 2005, at the University of Am=
sterdam, and will be organised into four sessions, each lasting half a day.=
  Each session will address a specific theme: (1) the evolution of speech; =
(2) interactions between learning and evolution; (3) social learning and co=
nventional meaning; (4) the evolution of syntax.  Each session will consist=
 of 4 to 6 talks, with a total of 21 invited speakers.
