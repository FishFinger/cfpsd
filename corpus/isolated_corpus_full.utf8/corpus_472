International Symposium on the Languages of Java

With this symposium, we offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect
of Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese to come together and share their findings. 

First Call for Abstracts

The First ISLOJ

International Symposium on the Languages of Java

15-17 August 2007
Semarang, Java, Indonesia

Java is home to several major languages.  Javanese, spoken mainly in Central and
East Java, is the world's 10th or 11th largest language in number of native
speakers; java has one of the oldest and fullest recorded histories of any
Austronesian language; java also has the most fully articulated phenomenon of
speech levels of any language. Sundanese, spoken in West Java, has over 27
million speakers, and Madurese, spoken on the neighboring island of Madura and
throughout parts of East Java, has over 13 million speakers.  Each of these
languages display a range of dialects, isolects, continua, and contact varieties
and yet, they have received relatively little attention from linguists.  

Abstracts are invited for papers to be presented on any linguistic topic dealing
with the languages of Java: Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese.  Papers on the
related languages of Balinese and Sasak will also be considered.  Papers on
other languages will be judged according to their relevance to the symposium
topic.  Papers are welcome from any subfield of linguistics and from any
approach or theoretical background.  Studies of non-standard(ized) versions,
dialects, and isolects, including contact varieties, are particularly welcome. 
All papers are to be presented in English.

Persons wishing to present papers at the symposium are invited to submit a
one-page abstract in electronic from (PDF or MSWord) to Thomas Conners at the
following address:

oranghutan@cbn.net.id

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2007

Please note that the 11th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian
Linguistics (ISMIL 11) will be held the week before ISLOJ, in Manokwari,
Indonesia.  For more info, see: ISMIL: http://www.eva.mpg.de/~gil/ismil.
