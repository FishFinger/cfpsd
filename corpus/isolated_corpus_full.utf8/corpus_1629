2007 (which will be published in the AIP (American Institute of Physics) 
Conference Proceedings: http://scitation.aip.org/proceedings/

2. The full papers will be considered for publication (as letters of ~ 
7-8 A4 pages length)  in Computing Letters (CoLe - see 
http://www.brill.nl/cole). We mention that VSP/Brill has already applied 
for the inclusion of this journal in SCI).

3. Every participant with his/her registration will receive: (a) The 
Proceedings of IeCCS 2007 and (b) Free subscription for CoLe.
