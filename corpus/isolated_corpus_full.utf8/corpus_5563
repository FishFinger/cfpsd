Meeting Description:

This conference proposes to unite insights from a number of research areas =
such as linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, psychology and philosophy. =
Spatial language and cognition has generated fervent debates in linguistics=
 recently, in particular since the revival of Whorfian ideas regarding the =
dynamics between languages and cultures. Namely, the domain of space has be=
come a prolific source of evidence of both language-specific and universal =
features reflected in human thinking and speaking. In some languages speake=
rs speak and think of space using absolute coordinates of east vs. west and=
 north vs. south on a daily basis while other communities use the notions o=
f left vs. right for spatial orientation and communication. Similarly, in s=
ome cultures the time scale is vertical, future is upwards and past is down=
wards, while closer to home, time seems to be a horizontal line, with futur=
e in front of us and the past behind. More formal approaches in syntax and =
semantics provide yet another perspective for representing time in language=
.

However, space and time are also universal categories, the representation o=
f which is embedded in both language and cognition. Recent anthropological =
evidence also speaks volumes about the complexity of spatial orientation in=
 language and cognition. Archaeologists have been active in piecing togethe=
r the puzzle of how our distant ancestors thought about the immediate space=
 and time they lived in as well as how they communicated thoughts and exper=
iences with space and time via material artefacts and customs in different =
environmental and social surroundings. Recent experimental psychology resea=
rch has also tackled the subject from the angle of spatial and temporal fea=
tures relevant in event perception, their linguistic expression and memory.=
 Finally, physical sciences offer a backdrop for an all-encompassing view o=
f the origins of space and time and their interrelatedness. Reconciling the=
 concept of time and the notion of real time is still one of the challenges=
 for all disciplines.

This is an opportunity to highlight the particular aspects of the different=
 research agendas related to space and time as well as share experiences re=
garding practical matters, such as research strategies and methodology. Tim=
e and space are topics of general interest which are actively pursued in ma=
ny different disciplines and this conference proposes to foster interdiscip=
linary collaboration and further enhance progress in these diverse but rela=
ted research areas.
