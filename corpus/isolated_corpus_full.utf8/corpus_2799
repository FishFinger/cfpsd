Call for Papers

English and Asia: First International Conference 2008 in Language and Linguistics 

Dates: November 24 - 28, 2008
Place: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  (IIUM & The Crown Princess Hotel)
Organiser: Department of English Language and Literature, International Islamic University Malaysia

Overview:
English has become the main language in many countries in Asia as a result of centuries of British colonialisation, resulting in what appears at times to be a tug of war of roles between English and the vernaculars in the development of the countries in the region, and (re)constructions of cultures, identities and ideologies, while preserving old ones. Today, the relationship between English and Asia remains equally ambiguous and changing in all sphereseconomical, technological, academic, social, political. The language unites and divides populations depending on the role that it carries within a country. This and other issues could be interesting 'food for thought' in a conference that would bring together not just professionals and students in language and linguistics, but also researchers from other disciplines and interested parties from industry. We invite papers from all parties interested in the issue, which may be theoretical, experimental or reflective.
