CL-HCI2007 in conjunction with and as a part of International Conference on Computational Science 2007

Processing natural language -- arguably the most complex and higher level human-specific aspect -- is a very challenging topic in Computational Science. For a more advanced and evolved next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI) system, it is indispensable to integrate with it natural language processing (NLP) interface. To interpret and understand a user's intended command from his/her speech signal, a series of processes such as speech recognition, parsing, semantic analysis, word sense disambiguation, etc. need to be performed. The proposed workshop focuses on such research topics common in Computational Linguistics and HCI. The workshop will provide also an opportunity for discussing and sharing participants' research experiences and outcomes.

Important dates for CL-HCI2007:
   Full papers submission	December 31, 2006
   Notification of acceptance of papers February 3, 2007
   Camera ready papers        February 19, 2007

Topics of interest:
    Speech Recognition
    Syntax / Grammars
    Parsing
    Lexical Semantics / Word Sense Disambiguation
    Corpus Linguistics
    Psychological and Mathematical Models of Language 

Please submit your paper to ''http://www.iccs-meeting.org/'' - Click ''Paper Submission - ''Select our workshop ''Computational Linguistics in Human-Computer Interaction''.

Papers should be of up to 8 single-spaced pages (about 4500 words maximum without figures) written in English, and must comply with the Springer-Verlag format described at http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2007/papers.html.

All accepted papers will be printed in the conference proceedings published by Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (SCIE). Selected papers will also be published as special issues of appropriate journals.
