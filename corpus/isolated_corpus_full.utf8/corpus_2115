Special Issue on New Directions in Type-theoretic Grammars
Guest Editor: Reinhard Muskens

In 1961 Haskell Curry published his by now famous paper on 'Some Logical
Aspects of Grammatical Structure'. In this paper he makes a distinction
between the 'tectogrammatics' and 'phenogrammatics' of language (a
distinction similar to that between abstract syntax and concrete syntax in
compiler theory). The tectogrammatics of an expression reflects the way in
which the expression is /built/, while the phenogrammatics is the way it
/appears/. On the basis of this distinction Curry argues against
directionality in the type system used for language description. In 1953
Bar-Hillel had introduced a distinction between categories seeking material
to their right and categories seeking material to the left, a distinction
that was taken over in Lambek's (1956) pivotal work on categorical grammar,
but in Curry's architecture phenogrammatic structure can take care of word
order, making directionality unnecessary.

While Curry's insights never quite made it into the mainstream of
type-theoretic grammar, they have for a long time formed an important
undercurrent. Recently this undercurrent has surfaced and  since the turn
of the century there has been a heightened activity within a series of
type-theoretical formalisms that could be called 'Curryesque'. These
formalisms, which bear a family resemblance to each other, adopt the
pheno/tecto distinction and undirectedness in one way or another and claim
various descriptive and formal advantages over more traditional approaches.

Such Curryesque approaches to type-theoretic grammar were the topic of a
recent interdisciplinary workshop held in Dublin as part of the European
Summer School on Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) 2007 (see
http://let.uvt.nl/general/people/rmuskens/ndttg/ for more information). In
the wake of this workshop there will be a special issue of the Journal of
Logic, Language, and Information on new directions in type-theoretic
grammars. We invite papers on all logical, linguistic, and computational
aspects of type-theoretic grammars in which the pheno/tecto distinction
plays a prominent role. Papers combining linguistic considerations with
more formal ones are especially welcome.


Submission Format

Contributions should be submitted electronically to Reinhard Muskens.
Authors are strongly encouraged to prepare their contribution with the help
of LaTeX, making use of the Journal's style file. Papers should not exceed
20 pages and can be excluded if they do. However, good papers for which
there is no room in the special issue will be recommended to the Managing
Editor for publication in other issues.


Important Dates

Submission deadline: 1 February 2008
Referee reports due: 1 April 2008
Final version due:   1 June 2008
Publication date:    Autumn 2008
