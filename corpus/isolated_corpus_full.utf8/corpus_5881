  SECOND  CALL  FOR  PAPERS
-------------------

Mining User-Generated Content for Security - MINUCS 2009

9 December 2009, Venice, Italy
=20=20=20
web: http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs

email: minucs [ad] cs [dot] helsinki [dot] fi=20=20

This event is co-located with the First International Conference on
User Centric Media - UCMedia 2009 (http://www.usercentricmedia.org) in
Venice, 9-11 December 2009

---------------
 AIM AND SCOPE
---------------

The vast and growing amount of user-generated textual content,
including online news streams, blogs, electronic encyclopedias (e.g.,
the Wikipedia), and other openly accessible and dynamically changing
data readily available on the Web has led to the emergence of new
approaches to extracting valuable, structured, and previously unknown
information from such data. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together researchers from academia and industry who develop
technologies for mining open-source user-generated textual data on the
Web, as well as end-users interested in exploiting such technologies
for knowledge discovery. The emphasis is placed on large-scale text
mining systems and application-oriented approaches to processing
on-line textual content in the context of security-related
applications.  Examples of such applications include:

 * global medical and epidemic surveillance,
 * conflict early warning,
 * early detection of man-made or environmental hazards,
 * risk assessment,
 * border surveillance,
 * cross-border crime detection,
 * terrorism counterintelligence,
 * other applications relevant for security, law enforcement, and
   public health institutions=20

Due to a multitude of challenges of diverse and complex nature that
are related to automating the process of mining user-generated content
on the Web, we believe that this workshop will serve as a forum to
bring together researchers from different areas, including data
mining, language technology, computational linguistics, information
sciences, information retrieval and Web mining, for sharing ideas and
discussion. In particular, we believe that there is an important gap
to be filled, since the aforementioned research communities have had
limited interaction previously in the context of the topic of the
Workshop. The second major goal is to engage governmental and
inter-state user communities, and to bring them together with
scientists and funding agencies.

--------------------
 TOPICS OF INTEREST
--------------------

 * Mining from news streams, blogs, document repositories, and other
   openly accessible and dynamically changing data, including Web 2.0
   content, for the purpose of identifying threats to security or
   public health,

 * Emphasis on multilingual approaches, and work on languages other
   than English,

 * Applications, such as information extraction, classification,
   summarization, sentiment detection, event detection, event
   forecasting, trend detection, information fusion, and more,

 * Contributions in the form of applications (working systems and
   prototypes) as well as theoretical results are welcome,

 * Application domains include crisis-related event reporting,
   political and environmental analysis, and medical intelligence,
   under the general umbrella of the security intelligence domain,

 * Methods including machine learning, rule-based, and hybrid
   approaches.

NB: Please note, this Workshop welcomes all work on computational
approaches to the analysis of textual data for gathering information
from openly accessible sources only. Submissions that focus on legal
questions stemming from snooping, spying, privacy infringement or
violation, etc., will not be considered relevant to the Theme of the
Workshop, and the Committee will not be able to review them.


------------
 SUBMISSION
------------

We invite papers addressing primarily the language technology, natural
language processing, data mining and information retrieval
communities, as well as the relevant end-user groups.  Submissions are
invited in two categories:

 * regular: research papers presenting novel approaches and solutions,
   and
 * short (posters): system demonstrations, descriptions, and work in
   progress

Submissions are electronic and in PDF format via a web-based
submission server.
Authors are encouraged to use Springer LNICST style for LaTeX in
producing the PDF document.
More information on this style can be found at:
http://www.springer.com/computer?SGWID=3D0-146-6-564009-0

The page limit for regular papers is 6 pages, whereas short papers are
limited to 4 pages.
The information about the author(s) should be omitted in the submitted
papers since the review process wil be blind.

More detailed information about submission is available on:
http://www.usercentricmedia.org/workshops/minucs/authors.shtml

Each submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Program
Committee.
Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to
produce camera-ready versions.

-------------
 PUBLICATION
-------------

All workshop papers will be published in the official proceedings,
Springer Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences,
Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering - LNICST, of the
main conference.

Selected workshop papers will be published in "ACM Springer Mobile
Networks and Applications (MONET) Journal Special Issue on Mobility
and User-Centric Media".

All workshop papers will be also published on the UCMedia2009 Website.
