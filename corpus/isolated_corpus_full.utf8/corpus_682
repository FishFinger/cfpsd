Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 19-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 16th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2007) is held in Tartu, Estonia, 25-26 May 2007, preceded by one day of workshops. 

NODALIDA 2007

The 16th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics

First Call for Papers:

The Program Committee of the 16th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics (NODALIDA 2007), to be held in Tartu, Estonia, May 25-26, 2007. invites papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of language technology, including, but not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
- speech recognition and speech synthesis;
- word segmentation, tagging, and chunking;
- syntax, semantics, and grammars;
- pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue;
- the lexicon and ontologies;
- parsing and grammatical formalisms;
- generation, text planning, and summarization;
- language modeling, spoken language recognition, and understanding;
- linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, text categorization, question answering, and information extraction;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- machine learning for natural language;
- multilingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids;
- multimodal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- language-oriented applications, tools, and resources;
- evaluation methodology.

Requirements:

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality,
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest
to the attendees. Submissions presented at NODALIDA should mostly contain new material that has not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with previously published work.

Reviewing:

Reviewing will be managed by the Program Committee and associated reviewers. The reviewing process will be double-blind and each submission will receive three independent reviews.

Categories of Papers:

Papers can be submitted to one of three categories: Regular Paper, Student Paper, and Poster. Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time.

The three categories have different requirements on authors, submission format
and publication format:

Regular Papers are submitted as full papers (max 8 pages). If accepted, a
regular paper is presented a single time during one of the parallel paper
sessions at the conference and is published as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the
conference proceedings.

Student Papers are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). All authors of a student paper must be students (undergraduate or graduate). If accepted, a student paper is presented a single time during one of the parallel student paper sessions at the conference and is published either as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) or as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the conference proceedings according to the authors' own choice.

Posters are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). If accepted, a poster is presented repeatedly to small groups of people at one of the conference poster sessions and is published either as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) or as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the conference proceedings according to the authors' own choice.

Submission Information:

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and must use either the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template that will be made available on the conference web site, courtesy of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Regular paper submissions should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references; student paper and poster submissions should not exceed four (4) pages. We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith (1991) previously showed ...''. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is A!
 dobe PDF. Regular papers must be submitted no later than January 19, 2006; student papers and posters must be submitted no later than February 9, 2006. Papers submitted after the deadlines will not be reviewed. Questions regarding the submission procedure should be directed to the Program Chair (nivre@msi.vxu.se).
