Meeting Description:

This is a two-day workshop at the University of Bergen open to papers on
diachronic syntax, most specifically, the reconstruction of case alignment systems. 

Call for Papers 

Extended Deadline: January 20th!

Workshop:  Reconstructing Alignment Systems
14-15 May, 2009
University of Bergen, Norway

Invited Speakers:
Alice Harris (Stony Brook University)
Geoffrey Haig (University of Kiel)

Abstract Submission Deadline: 20 January, 2009

Workshop URL: http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP/Workshop3.htm

The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers working on alignment systems
in a historical perspective, in order to brainstorm on how alignment systems can
be reconstructed for earlier stages of a language or a language family. We
welcome abstracts on well-studied language families like Indo-European,
abstracts on oral languages without a recorded history, and everything in
between, aiming to highlight different kinds of reconstruction problems. We also
welcome papers on changes in alignment systems, papers addressing the issue of
how different theoretical frameworks can contribute to reconstruction, as well
as papers concerned with the more general implications of alignment changes for
diachronic typology.

Please send a one page abstract in pdf format to Thomas
Smitherman(Thomas.Smitherman@uib.no) no later than January 20th.
Notification of acceptance will be sent out very soon thereafter.

The workshop is hosted by the University of Bergen and the research team of the
project, Indo-European Case and Argument Structure from a Typological
Perspective (IECASTP): http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP

Location: University of Bergen

Full Title: Studying Communication 

Date: 16-Apr-2009 - 18-Apr-2009
Location: Lodz, Poland 
Contact Person: Alina Kwiatkowska
Meeting Email: akwiat@uni.lodz.pl

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 20-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

We hope that this conference will provide a discussion forum which will make
more clear the status of communication research and education within the
programs of modern language studies. 

Call for Ppaers

We are a group of linguists, mostly specializing in cognitive linguistics, at
the Institute of English Studies in Lodz (the second biggest city in Poland),
who have recently begun to offer to our students an opportunity to specialize in
the study of communication (alongside the other specialties offered here, such
as translation, issues in linguistics, methodology of foreign language teaching,
the study of English-language literature, etc.) at both B.A. and M.A. levels. We
are looking for ideas that would help us define the new specialty within this
institutional environment. We realize that we should be drawing on
multidisciplinary foundations, and would very much like to go beyond the narrow
confines of the study of speech communication; but on the other hand, we cannot
adopt an exclusively sociological and psychological approach to communication,
as ours is essentially a philological institute (and our individual research to
date has had to do with linguistic analysis). Obviously, we would like to strike
a balance between the two kinds of approaches, trying to incorporate the best
elements of both.    

If you have experience in the teaching and researching of communication, or if
you are coming to it, like us, from other backgrounds, and are just beginning to
work out the design of your courses incorporating some elements of communication
analysis,  you are cordially invited to come to Lodz and share your ideas and
observations with us and the other interested participants. 

We hope that this conference will provide a discussion forum which will help us
position the study of communication within the boundaries (or rather at the
cross-roads) of traditional academic disciplines, and will also make more clear
the status of communication research and education within the programs of modern
language studies. 

We invite both linguists and academics from related disciplines with papers
concerning the teaching and research of interpersonal and mass communication,
traditional and new-media communication, the interaction between verbal and
non-verbal elements of the communication process, and the social, cultural, and
intercultural contexts of communication. Other possible topics might include:
communication and creativity, indirect communication, barriers to communication,
cross-gender communication, humor and communication, ..etc.
The language of the Conference will be basically English, with a possible
additional Polish session. The length of the presentation will be limited to 30
minutes.
The conference proceedings are going to be published by the Lodz University Press. 

The conference fee will be approximately 70 EURO. Detailed information about the
costs of accommodation will follow in the next circular. 

The deadline for the initial statement of interest and a general outline of the
paper is  20 February 2009.
