Chris Welty - The Evolving Role of Rules and Ontologies in the  
Semantic Web

As the semantic web evolves with new standards (like OWL-2 and RIF),
and more data (like Linked Open Data), the role of ontologies and
rules in semantic web applications is evolving as well. In this talk I
will briefly present highlights of the new standards and discuss where
the technology and data seem to be taking us, and what role they will
play as the web of data continues to evolve. (Bio)

Doug Lenat - Mistakes Were Made

Douglas Lenat founded and has run the Cyc project since 1984, leading
a team building a large and broad ontology, knowledge base, and
inference engine. This talk will describe some of the lessons learned
along the way, ranging from representation of knowledge, to choice of
what knowledge to represent, to knowledge acquisition methodologies,
to reasoning strategies and tactics. It will showcase some of the
applications that forced Cyc to grapple with large amounts of data,
multiple sources, contradictory information, and so on, which have
largely come from the intelligence community and (perhaps
surprisingly, to this audience) from the clinical research
community. Dr. Lenat's work in machine learning won the Computers and
Thought Award; he helped establish the AAAI, and is a Fellow of the
AAAI and of the AAAS. Prior to Cyc, Dr. Lenat was a computer science
faculty member at Stanford and CMU, and he will briefly touch on a few
"learning experiences" he had back then, that laid the foundation for
his being able to make the mistakes of the last 25 years.
