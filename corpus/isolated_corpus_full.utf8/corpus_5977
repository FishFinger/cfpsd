Meeting Description:

Typology of Periphrasis 
Conference hosted by the Surrey Morphology Group
University of Surrey, April 22-23, 2010

The Surrey Morphology Group will be hosting 'Typology of Periphrasis', a two-day conference on periphrasis, the situation where a grammatical function normally realised by a single word is expressed by more than one word. The dual nature of periphrasis (morphological function performed by means of syntax) presents interesting problems for linguistic theory. These have not yet been resolved, in part because the theoretical devices available have been inadequate and partly because the range of data considered has been rather narrow. Little is known about the extent of typological variation of periphrastic constructions, their interaction with the morphology and syntax of the languages they are found in, the way they adapt to morphological structure, and the changes they undergo over time on the way from being a free syntactic phrase to being a part of the inflectional paradigm. 

The conference arises from an ESRC funded project on periphrasis, within the Surrey Morphology Group, involving Greville Corbett, Dunstan Brown and Marina Chumakina. We invite linguists working on different languages of the world and linguists working within different theoretical approaches: synchronic and diachronic.
