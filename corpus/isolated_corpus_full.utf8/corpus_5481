Full Title: Information Structure in Language Acquisition (32 DGfS)=20

Date: 24-Feb-2010 - 26-Feb-2010
Location: Berlin, Germany=20

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition=20

Call Deadline: 15-Aug-2009=20

Meeting Description:

The form in which some content, once selected by the speaker, is encoded in
a sentence depends not only on the lexicon and the morpho-syntax of the
particular language but also on the way in which the sentence is integrated
into the information flow in on-going discourse. Are such form-function
linkages a very early means - perhaps the first - that language learners
have available for structuring their utterances? Are first and second
language acquisition same or different in this regard?

This workshop aims at bringing together studies on the linguistic
expression of information structure and its acquisition by first and second
language learners of different languages. It focuses on the development of
the relationship between information structure related functions (e.g.
topic, focus, givenness, contrast) and the corresponding formal devices.=20

The workshop is part of the annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f=
=FCr
Sprachwissenschaft (German Linguistic Society, DGfS) in Berlin from
February 24-26, 2010.

Call for Papers:

Questions to be addressed in the workshop include:=20

1. Do language learners express the same kinds of information structure
relations as adult native speakers using the same devices (e.g. word order,
referential devices, intonation, particles)?

2. How do children and adult L2 learners use such devices in real-time
spoken language comprehension?

3. In which respects are L1 and L2 learners similar or different in the
production and comprehension of devices that mark information structure?

4. How are production and comprehension temporally related in development,
e.g.,in first and second language learners' use of intonation or scope
particles? We invite contributions investigating monolingual, bilingual,
and impaired language development, and we explicitly welcome research
comparing different modalities and different populations.

Anonymous abstracts no longer than 500 words (not including references and
figures) should be sent as a pdf-file by e-mail to Christine Dimroth
(christine.dimroth@mpi.nl). Include the abstract title, the author's
name(s) and affiliation(s) in the body of the message.
