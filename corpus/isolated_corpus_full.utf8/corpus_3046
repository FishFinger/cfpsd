Future Challenges in Expertise Retrieval
SIGIR 2008 Workshop, 24 July 2008, Singapore
http://ilps.science.uva.nl/fCHER/
**********************************************

MOTIVATION

At the TREC Enterprise Track in 2005 the need to study and understand
expertise retrieval (ER) was recognized through the introduction of an
Expert Finding task (as opposed to mere document retrieval). The task
has generated a lot of interest in the IR community, and rapid progress
has been made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation over the
past 3 years. In fact, expertise retrieval has reached the point where
it is appropriate to assess progress, bring people from different
research communities together, and define a research agenda for the next
years. This workshop aims to determine what we have accomplished and
where we need to go from here in expertise retrieval.


AREAS OF INTEREST

The main theme of the workshop concerns future challenges in Expertise
Retrieval. Instead of focusing on core algorithmic aspects of a specific
expert finding scenario (as is the case for the TREC Expert Finding
task), our aim is to broaden the topic area and to seek for potential
connections with other related fields. We expect submissions from the
following areas:

     * Information Retrieval
     * Knowledge Management
     * Organization Information Systems
     * Social Network Analysis
     * Social Web
     * Virtual Communities
     * User Modeling
     * Human-Computer Interaction


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

This venue accepts submissions of research papers (up to 8 pages),
position papers (up to 4 pages), and demo descriptions (up to 2 pages).
Submissions must be in English, and must contain original work. All
papers, independent of being a research, position, or demo paper, must
be able to generate discussion during the workshop, and consequently the
PC will favor original and controversial ideas.


IMPORTANT DATES (revised)

     * 23 May Paper submission deadline (extended)
     * 13 Jun Notification of acceptance
     * 23 Jun Camera-ready papers due
     * 24 Jul Workshop


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop is aimed to facilitate discussion and interaction among
participants. The workshop will feature regular contributed paper
presentations (20 min/each), demo presentations (5 min/each) and include
discussion between presenters and the audience (10 min/each). The
workshop will also feature an invited speaker, as well as a panel to
wrap up the event.
