Location: Ottawa, Ontario, Canada 
Contact Person: Karine Megerdoomian

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 29-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Organizing Committee of the Third Workshop on Computational Approaches to
Arabic Script-based Languages invites proposals for presentation at CAASL3, being held in conjunction with MT Summit XII. 

The first two workshops (2004 and 2007) brought together researchers working on the computer processing of Arabic script-based languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi and Dari), Pashto and Urdu, among others. The usage of the Arabic script and the influence of Arabic vocabulary give rise to certain computational issues that are common to these languages despite their being of distinct language families, such as right to left direction, encoding variation, absence of capitalization, complex word structure, and a high degree of ambiguity due to non-representation of short vowels in the writing system. 

The third workshop (CAASL3), five years after the successful first workshop, will provide a forum for researchers from academia, industry, and government developers, practitioners, and users to share their research and experience with a focus on machine translation.  It also provides an opportunity to assess the progress that has been made since the first workshop in 2004. 

Second Call for Papers
Deadlines Extended

The call for papers as well as future information on the workshop can be found
at http://www.arabicscript.org.

Important Dates

Paper submission deadline: May 29, 2009
Notification of acceptance: June 29, 2009
Camera ready submissions: July 27, 2009

Workshop Topics

We welcome submissions in any area of NLP in Arabic script-based languages. However, preference would be given to papers that focus on Machine Translation applications of Arabic script-based languages. The main themes of this workshop include:

- Statistical and rule-based machine translation
- Translation aids
- Evaluation methods and techniques of  machine translation systems
- MT of dialectal and conversational language
- Computer-mediated communication (e.g., blogs, forums, chats)
- Knowledge bases, corpora, and development of resources for MT applications
- Speech-to-speech MT
- MT combined with other technologies (speech translation, cross-language information retrieval, multilingual text categorization, multilingual text summarization, multilingual natural language generation, etc.)
- Entity extraction
- Tokenization and segmentation
- Speech synthesis and recognition
- Text to speech systems
- Semantic analysis

Submission Requirements

Papers should not have been presented somewhere else or be under consideration for publication elsewhere, and should not identify the author(s). They should emphasize completed work rather than intended work. Each paper will be anonymously reviewed by three members of the program committee.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format to
caasl3@arabicscript.org<mailto:caasl3@arabicscript.org> by midnight of the due date.

Submissions should be in English. The papers should not include any author information; they should be attached to an email indicating contact information for the author(s) and paper's title. Papers should not exceed 8 pages including references and tables, and should follow the formatting guidelines posted at :
http://summitxii.amtaweb.org/
