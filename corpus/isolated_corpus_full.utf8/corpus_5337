Call for Submissions and Participation
 =

Description
 =

A great deal of research supports the belief that social interactions affec=
t =

people=92s health in various ways. Online communities have added a relative=
ly =

new dimension to the lives of many people. This workshop aims to bring toge=
ther =

a group of researchers and practitioners from medical, social and informati=
on =

technology communities to understand how social technologies might be used =
to =

support health and health initiatives: e.g. supporting people, their famili=
es =

and their communities in managing health; building and supporting communiti=
es =

of health workers and medical practitioners for improved communication and =

information sharing; allowing communities of health stakeholders (policy ma=
kers, =

practitioners, the public) to develop effective health-related policies and =

initiatives.
 =

We intend this workshop to be a place to foster communication across the =

relevant disciplines in order to design and develop effective tools and use=
r =

experience  to support online health communities.
 =

This workshop will be held close (in time) to CollabTech 2009 (The Fifth =

International Conference on Collaboration Technologies 2009), which is bein=
g =

held in Sydney, August 12-14, 2009 (http://www.collabtech.org/).   This wil=
l =

provide opportunities for participants (especially from overseas) to attend =

both events to exchange ideas and experiences.  =

Audience
We hope to attract a multidisciplinary range of researchers and practitione=
rs =

from the medical, social and information technology communities working in =

areas such as health, social science, and online communities related to hea=
lth.
 =

Issues of interest may include:
* support for patients vs. support for carers
* tools for developing online communities
* designing effective user experience for online patient communities
* strategies for building online health communities and developing long-ter=
m =

engagement
* motivating information-sharing, content development, and contribution to =
policy
* health education and policy development: developing trusted content
* tailoring health information
* methods/techniques to provide motivational support
* trust, ethics, and related issues in online health-related communities
 =

Event Format
 =

The workshop will be held over two days, on Thursday August 20th and =

Friday August 21st, 2009, in the Melbourne area (precise location to be det=
ermined).
The workshop will include invited speakers (including a HCSNet-supported =

international presenter), presentations from participants and interested pa=
rties, =

workshopping and development of ideas, and plenty of time for discussion.  =

Submission instructions are given below.
 =

Event Outcomes
 =

We hope the workshop will help the community to build a collective =

understanding about online health and medical communities: from the health =

perspective, what support can a social network provide; from the social =

network community, how can they provide that support; overall, how can =

such systems be deployed, evaluated and adopted. We also hope that the =

workshop will build bridges across the communities (health and social =

networks), and even generate a sustained interest and community around this =

area. We envisage this workshop to be the first of a series.
 =

Interested participants are invited to submit a position statements =

(about 300 words) describing their interest in the area of health/medical =

online communities, along with a short biography.
