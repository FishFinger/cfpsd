eHealth, to be held in conjunction with the 12th conference on Artificial 
Intelligence in Medicine (AIME-09) on 19 July 2009, Verona, Italy.

Full call for papers and submission information at:
http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~floriana/Pers4eHealth09/

* Important Dates:

   Deadline for submission: 4th May 2009
   Notification to authors: 8th June 2009
   Camera-ready version: 24th June 2009

* Issues of Interest:
   A non exhaustive list of issues of interest is:
           + adaptive and personalised e-Health information systems (including
             adaptive content, search and interface)
           + tailored health education and advice (written and online)
           + promoting trust and compliance to health advice
           + personalised assistance, including for special citizens (e.g.
             disabled, elderly)
           + personalisation in chronic care (e.g. asthma or diabetes
             management) as opposed to acute care (e.g. ICU setting)
           + privacy issues for health related user models
           + personalisation based both on biometric or genomic factors and
             clinical information
           + tailored decision support (for patients and practitioners)
           + supporting the implementation of guidelines and protocols in
             healthcare
           + models of user learning, knowledge, attitude and behaviour change
             (including compliance)
           + patient/citizen models
           + business models (personalisation to various stakeholders)
           + ontologies for user models for tailored health care delivery
           + user of ubiquitous and mobile applications for the personalisation
             of eHealth
           + methods for evaluating user satisfaction with ehealth systems
             (weblog analysis, tracking users, quantitative and qualitative
             methods)
           + reports on evaluation studies of personalised eHealth systems.
        The workshop welcomes contributions from diverse perspectives, such
        as knowledge engineering, multi agent systems, natural language
        processing, cognitive modelling, human factors, mobile computing, as
        well as public health and medical informatics. Contributions may
        describe applications, approaches, and evaluation studies.
