Meeting Description

Towards Enhanced Interoperability for Large HLT Systems: UIMA for NLP
Full-day workshop held in conjunction with LREC 2008

In this workshop we want to bring representatives from various NLP research
sites together who have gained experience in working with UIMA specifications in
the framework of complex NLP systems. As there are already several large HLT
systems that have been integrated with UIMA, we also encourage papers at the
workshop which are in the form of case studies on those systems. We also aim at
joining the results of their work to discuss and possibly elaborate on emerging
UIMA standards for NLP systems. 

Call for Papers

Towards Enhanced Interoperability for Large HLT Systems:
                      UIMA for NLP

Full-day workshop held in conjunction with LREC 2008
May 31, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco

Submission Deadline: 29 February 2008

The development and incremental modification of large and complex HLT systems
has long been an art rather than a workflow guided by software engineering
practices and principles. The interoperability of system components was hard to
achieve, exchange of different modules a pain-staking task due to the low level
of abstraction of specifications which described interfaces to connect with each
other, and data and control flow interdependencies between various modules.

UIMA, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture, is an
open-platform middleware structure for dealing with unstructured information
(text, speech, audio, video data), originally launched by IBM. In the meantime,
the Apache Software Foundation has established an incubator project for
developing UIMA-based software (http://incubator.apache.org/uima/).  The
Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) has
established a Technical Committee to standardize the UIMA specification.
Accordingly, an increasing number of NLP research institutes as well as HLT
companies all over the world are basing their system development efforts on UIMA
specifications to adhere to emerging standards.

As far as NLP proper is concerned, Carnegie Mellon University's Language
Technology Institute is hosting an UIMA Component Repository web site
(http://uima.lti.cs.cmu.edu), where developers can post information about their
analytics components and anyone can find out more about free and commercially
available UIMA-compliant analytics. Additionally, free analytic tools that can
work with UIMA include those from the General Architecture for Text Engineering
(GATE - http://gate.ac.uk/) and OpenNLP (http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/)
communities, as well as Jena University's Language & Information Engineering
(JULIE) (http://www.julielab.de) Lab. Commercial analytics are available from
IBM, as well as from other software vendors such as Attensity, ClearForest,
Temis and Nstein.

In this workshop we want to bring representatives from various NLP research
sites together who have gained experience in working with UIMA
specifications in the framework of complex NLP systems. As there are already
several large HLT systems that have been integrated with UIMA, we also encourage
papers at the workshop which are in the form of case studies on those systems.
We also aim at joining the results of their work to discuss and possibly
elaborate on emerging UIMA standards for NLP systems.

Paper Submissions

We seek high-quality papers which report on experience using UIMA for the design
and implementation of complex NLP systems. However, papers reporting on
experience using other middleware frameworks and software engineering practices
in this context are also welcome. Both papers from academia as well as industry
are solicited. The size of long paper should not exceed 8 pages, the size of
short papers and demo descriptions should not exceed 4 pages (using the LREC
formatting style). For details, please consult the submission section on the
workshop website.

Important Dates

February 29, 2008 - Deadline for workshop papers
March 26, 2008 - Notification of acceptance
April 4, 2008 - Camera-ready papers due
May 31, 2008 - Workshop in Marrakech

Meeting Description

One-Day National Conference
on
Advanced Concepts in the Cognizance
of 
English Language
ACCEL '08

About the Institution

Velammal Engineering College (VEC) was founded by Shri. M. V. Muthuramalingam, a
Professional Engineer. Located in the northern bank of Puzhal lake, this college
is one among the few Engineering Colleges located very near the city. The
Department of English focuses its attention on the needs of future engineers by
imparting Technical English, Business English and Communicative English. Apart
from this, the Department trains students for Business English Certificate
Examination (BEC) conducted by British Council and Certificates are awarded by
Cambridge University, London. The Department is well equipped with State-of-the
Art language Laboratory, which is unique in feature.
This lab plays a vital role in improving students' communicative skills like
listening, speaking and pronunciation.

About the Conference

English fever is prevailing around the globe. Mastery of the language has become
a crucial step in enhancing international competitiveness and socio economic
status. Although there are numerous web sources for self-access learning,
classroom instruction and assessment still remain significant in facilitating
learning process and improving learning performance. Since late 1970's, theories
of communicative language teaching, constructive learning, socio-cultural
interaction, and formative/performance assessment have made a great impact on
discussions of language teaching and provide guidelines for teachers to change
their practices and integrate different interaction modes into the classrooms.
With the help of computer technology, classrooms have expanded beyond the four
walls and into cyberspace. While we are facing assorted language learning
theories and educational policies, we take a new look at the role and function
of classroom instruction and assessment, examine whether theories can inform and
inspire our classroom practices. Only by changing from within can we make a
difference in teaching and learning.
This is a conference that focuses on different methods involved in English
teaching and learning. It aims to provide a brand new forum to discuss classroom
instruction and assessment by integrating the community of English teachers and
researchers.
It is hoped that in the conference, our sharing observations and dialectic
conversations can instill new energy into the classroom and bring out more
efforts to enact change.

Major Topics

for questions and comments). Topics should be related to the following:
