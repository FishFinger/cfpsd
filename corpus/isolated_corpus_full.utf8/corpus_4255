Meeting Description:

NORMS Workshop on Determination, University of Tromsø, 18-19 March, 2009.
Invited speakers: Tom Leu and Tarald Taraldsen. 

Call for Papers 

Invited Speakers:
Tom Leu, Yale University
Tarald Taraldsen, University of Tromsø

Hosted by CASTL and organized by the NORMS thematic group on The Syntax of Noun
Phrases.

Description

The Scandinavian noun phrase displays a wide range of variation, both across the
standard varieties and even more so across dialects. Microcomparative
considerations have therefore been an important and natural integral part of
theoretical studies of the Scandinavian noun phrase for quite some time (see for
instance Holmberg 1992, Delsing 1993, Vangsnes 1999, Vangsnes et. al. 2003,
Julien 2005). The variation pertains to several issues in nominal syntax such as
(in)definiteness marking and syntax, placement and types of possessors, the
interaction between possessors and definiteness marking, adjectival syntax etc.
See http://norms.uit.no/index.php?page=1 for some examples.  

The field of study is by no means exhaustively studied, neither theoretically
nor empirically. At this workshop we will seek to push the investigations of
nominal syntax further with a focus on determination, i.e. issues concerning
(in)definiteness. One area which until recently has not been researched much,
concerns wh-nominals: preliminary investigations show that there is extensive
microcomparative variation across the Scandinavian dialect continuum also in
this subfield of nominal syntax, variation which interact with issues concerning
(in)definiteness.

Tom Leu defended his doctoral dissertation The Internal Syntax of Determiners in
2008 at New York University. His thesis discusses various aspects of
determination and related issues in Germanic, with an emphasis on Swiss German.
Tarald Taraldsen is one of the (fore)fathers of comparative Scandinavian syntax,
with a publication record dating back to the seventies. His 1990-paper on
'D-projections in Norwegian' is widely quoted, and nominal syntax has since been
one of his many research interests. 

In addition to presentations by Leu and Taraldsen, there will be contributions
by the members of the NORMS network at the workshop, and there are also slots
open for paper presentations by scholars outside of the NORMS network. Priority
will be given to papers that address the issue of determination on the basis of
Scandinavian (North Germanic) in either a macro- or microcomparative
perspective. Microcomparative papers on other languages are also welcome, in
particular papers on other languages of the Nordic countries (the Saami
languages, Finnish, Greenlandic). Interested parties are invited to submit a one
page abstract as soon as possible and no later than February 15 to Øystein A.
Vangsnes (oystein.vangsnes@hum.uit.no). A program will be announced shortly
after. Questions concerning the workshop may be sent to the same address.
