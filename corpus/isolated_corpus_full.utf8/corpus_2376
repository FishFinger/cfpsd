*** Just a reminder the poster/demo submissions are due Jan 6th. ***


As the space evolves, researcher and industrial practitioners find
themselves at a key point for collaborating on research, implementation
and deployment of a wide range of analyses and applications. The
International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media invites researchers
in the broad field of social media analysis to submit posters and demos
for its second meeting. Following in the tradition of earlier workshops
and the first meeting in Boulder, USA in 2007, we anticipate an
exciting, high quality event which will bring together academic and
industrial practitioners to present and to discuss new research,
applications, thoughts and ideas that are shaping the future of social
media analysis.
