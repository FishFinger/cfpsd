===============================================================================

                CONSTRAINT GRAMMAR WORKSHOP - CALL FOR PAPERS

             CG workshop: New developments in Constraint Grammar
      in conjunction with NoDaLiDa 2007, Tartu, Estonia, May 24th 2007

                      http://giellatekno.uit.no/cg/ee07/

===============================================================================

Within full-scale parsing applications, constraint grammar is the 
dominant framework for parsing Nordic languages. It is used in the 
industry (e.g. Microsoft/Lingsoft, Connexor), and it also constitutes 
the fundament for several academic projects aiming at corpus tagging, 
treebanks and pedagogical programs (e.g. Odense, Oslo, Tromsø).

The workshop is part of The 16th Nordic Conference of Computational 
Linguistics, May 24-26 2007 in Tartu, Estonia.

TOPICS

All topics related to constraint grammar are of interest. We will 
especially be interested in the following themes:

   * Rule evaluation
   * Technical performance
   * Linguistic performance (precision, recall) and evaluation
   * CG and corpus annotation
   * CGs for "new" (i.e. not previously CG-treated) languages
   * Semantic layers in CG
   * CG-based applications


FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP

The workshop will consist of three parts.
- a tutorial on open-source constraint grammar formalisms.
- a main section with ordinary talks, resulting from an open call.
- an open roundtable discussion
A preliminary conference program will be published at the workshop www 
pages.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

We invite extended abstracts (approximately 1500 words) describing 
existing research connected to the topics of the workshop. Submissions 
are non-anonymous and should include: title; author(s); affiliation(s); 
and contact author's e-mail address, postal address, telephone and fax 
numbers.

Abstracts should be sent to the mail address available on the workshop 
www pages.

The presentation at the workshop will be 30 minutes long (20 minutes for 
presentation and 10 minutes for questions and discussion). The final 
version of the accepted papers may not exceed 12 A4 pages.
