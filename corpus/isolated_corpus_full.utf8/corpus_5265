Hi, Adam,

Well, I think and believe, so to speak, that that may depend on just how
large the numbers are: if we're talking about *the* most frequent words
(pun
intended) (eg, so-called 'stop words'), we can be fairly sure of finding
at
least similar frequencies. I'll grant you some exceptions for, say, that
book written so as not to have any e's. If that's your corpus (and other
similar texts), then 'the' won't appear, and so won't be the commonest
word.
For any other non-artificial corpus, it would be surprising indeed if
'the'
weren't the most, or at worst second-most, common word (of course,
talking
about English corpora). On the other hand, we would *expect* a decent
amount
of variation in place of, say, the twentieth word, and not be surprised
if
in another biggish corpus it came in 15th or 25th. If it came in, say,
1000th in a second corpus, we could be damned sure that it's a very
'bursty'
sort of word, and we just got unlucky (?or lucky?) in our first corpus.
Likewise, the further down the list we go, the bigger we would expect
the
variation to be.

I'm not disputing, really, what you say. It's partly a question of
focus,
perhaps, and the question of  'burstiness' is obviously very important
in,
say, dividing up subcorpora by the field they belong to. I'm just
saying, I
guess, that linguists may very well study, in depth, 'stop words', while
corpus linguists are most unlikely to study them, since they usually
look
for other things in their corpora.

But what's the point in extrapolating?  It's scientifically unsound,
as you basically invent things of which you don't know how they're
going to be distributed.  Any claims based on that are extremely shaky
if not outright invalid.

So the right answer should be: "No, you can't, and you should tell
anybody who asks you to do this that this is not appropriate."

Otherwise, why would we ever have needed to build corpora other than
Brown or LOB?  Just extrapolate...

	Evaluation - New Deadline
To: corpora@uib.no

SIGIR 2009 Workshop on the Future of IR Evaluation
July 23, Boston
http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kamps/ireval/

Submissions due: June 15

Call for Papers

Evaluation is at the core of information retrieval: virtually all
progress owes directly or indirectly to test collections built within
the so-called Cranfield paradigm.  However, in recent years, IR
researchers are routinely pursuing tasks outside the traditional
paradigm, by taking a broader view on tasks, users, and context.
There is a fast moving evolution in content from traditional static
text to diverse forms of dynamic, collaborative, and multilingual
information sources.  Also industry is embracing "operational"
evaluation based on the analysis of endless streams of queries and
clicks.

We invite the submission of papers that think outside the box:

- Are you working on an interesting new retrieval task or aspect?  Or
   on its broader task or user context?  Or on a complete system with
   novel interface?  Or on interactive/adaptive search?  Or ...?
   Please explain why this is of interest, and what would be an
   appropriate way of evaluating.

- Do you feel that the current evaluation tools fail to do justice to
   your research?  Is there a crucial aspect missing?  Or are you
   interested in specific, rare, phenomena that have little impact on
   the average scores?  Or ...?  Please explain why this is of
   interest, and what would be an appropriate way of evaluating.

- Do you have concrete ideas how to evaluate such a novel IR task?  Or
   ideas for new types of experimental or operational evaluation?  Or
   new measures or ways of re-using existing data?  Or ...?  Please
   explain why this is of interest, and what would be an appropriate
   way of evaluating.

The workshop brings together all stake-holders ranging from those with
novel evaluation needs, such as a PhD candidate pursuing a new
IR-related problem, to senior IR evaluation experts.  Desired outcomes
are insight into how to make IR evaluation more "realistic," and at
least one concrete idea for a retrieval track or task (at CLEF, INEX,
NTCIR, TREC) that would not have happened otherwise.

Help us shape the future of IR evaluation!

- Submit a short 2-page poster or position paper explaining your key
   wishes or key points,

- and take actively part in the discussion at the Workshop.

The *revised* deadline is Monday June 15, 2009, further submission
details are on http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kamps/ireval/

I've grown increasingly curious over the years, as people have posted  =

frequency queries here, about what applications people are using *any*  =

frequency data for, for which a high level of accuracy is important --  =

and how a degraded level of accuracy would be detectable.

I don't mean to question or deny the whole premise of frequency info.  =

I know frequency can be very useful for all kinds of guessing and  =

deciding and other NLP things. I mean to ask  why, and to whom, it  =

matters whether something shows up as the 10,000th-most-frequent-token  =

in a corpus of a given size, rather than the 15,999th, or the  =

26,000th.  Certainly, the first few tiers matter: top 10, top 100, top  =

1,000, top 10,000;  but it seems to me that the farther you get down  =

the list -- the farther out on this maybe-logarithmic scale --  the  =

less meaningful any degree of accuracy becomes.

Given the arbitraryness of what might be included in any given corpus,  =

any overweening degree of precision seems likely to point to false (or  =

meaningless) conclusions about the "language," and only really be  =

reflective of the composition of the corpus. This gives all the more  =

reason to heed Adam's advice about document frequency over raw whole- =

corpus counts.

Is there a crucial application am I not thinking of?

Yrs,

Orion
