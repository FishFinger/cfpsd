Meeting Description

The Colloquium on Generative Grammar (CGG) is one of the main conferences on
this topic held in Europe. It is the best conference on linguistics organized
yearly in the Iberian Peninsula.

This Colloquium constitutes a crucial point of reference for people working on
linguistics, in particular, on generative grammar, but also on related fields.
The interest raised goes beyond its original geographical area, the Southern
Europe, and attracts researchers from different parts of the world, e.g., from
other regions of Europe, from America and Asia. The set of the participants of
the CGG includes senior linguists, recognized specialists on different domains
of grammar, as well as young linguists, students of Post Graduation programs or
researchers that have obtained their PhD recently and start their professional
career. From a scientific point of view, the works presented at the conference
cover all the components of grammar (syntax, morphology, phonology and
semantics) and pay special attention to the most recent theoretical formulations
within the generative framework. 

The XVIIIth Colloquium on Generative Grammar will be held at the Faculdade de
Letras da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal, from 17th to 19th April, 2008.

Call for Papers

Linguists working in the theoretical framework of Generative Grammar are invited

posters, this should be stated clearly in their e-mail message to the
organizers. Submissions are limited to one singly authored and one jointly
authored abstract per author.

(A4 paper). Font: Times New Roman, 12 point. Line spacing: single. Abstracts may
include an extra page for references and examples. Lay-out: First line - title
of the paper (in bold); second line - author's name and e-mail address; third
line: affiliation.
Abstracts should be sent electronically only, as MsWord or PDF attachments, to
18CGG@fl.ul.pt. PDF format is required if the abstract contains special fonts,
such as phonetic symbols or figures. One copy of the abstract must be sent
anonymously and another one with the author's name, e-mail address, and affiliation.
Deadline for abstract submission: 2nd January 2008.
