Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This two-day workshop is concerned with the general area of paralinguistic speech, and will place special emphasis on attempts to narrow the gap between 'models' (usually built making strong simplifying assumptions) and 'real data' (usually showing a high degree of complexity). 

Papers are invited in a broad range of topics related to paralinguistic
speech. Papers can be submitted for oral or poster presentation; acceptance
for oral presentation is more likely for papers that explicitly address the
general theme of the workshop, i.e. ''bridging'' issues.

There are at least two different versions of bridging: a weak one and a
strong one. The weak, more modest one aims at a better mutual
understanding, the strong one at profiting from each other's work. We do
not know yet whether after these two days, we really will be able to profit
from each other in our own work; however, we do hope that we will have
reached a level of mutual understanding that will make future co-operation
easier.

Workshop Theme:

Research on various aspects of paralinguistic and extralinguistic speech
has gained considerable importance in recent years. On the one hand, models
have been proposed for describing and modifying voice quality and prosody
related to factors such as emotional states or personality. Such models
often start with high-intensity states (e.g., full-blown emotions) in clean
lab speech, and are difficult to generalise to everyday speech. On the
other hand, systems have been built to work with moderate states in
real-world data, e.g. for the recognition of speaker emotion, age, or
gender. Such models often rely on statistical methods, and are not
necessarily based on any theoretical models.

While both research traditions are obviously valid and can be justified by
their different aims, it seems worth asking whether there is anything they
can learn from each other. For example: ''Can models become more robust by
incorporating methods used for dealing with real-world data?''; ''Can
recognition rates be improved by including ideas from theoretical models?'';
''How would a database need to be structured so that it can be used for
both, research on model-based synthesis and research on recognition?'' etc.

While the workshop will be open to any kind of research on paralinguistic
speech, the workshop structure will support the presentation and creation
of cross-links in several ways:

- papers with an explicit contribution to cross-linking issues will 
stand a higher chance to be accepted as oral papers;
- sessions and proceedings will include space for peer comments and 
answers from authors;
- poster sessions will be organised around cross-cutting issues rather 
than traditional research fields, where possible.

We therefore encourage prospective participants to place their research
into a wider perspective. This can happen in many ways; as illustrations,
we outline two possible approaches.

1. In application-oriented research, such as synthesis or recognition, a
guiding principle could be the requirements of the ''ideal'' application: for
example, the recognition of finely graded shades of emotions, for all
speakers in all situations; or fully natural-sounding synthesis with freely
specifiable expressivity; etc. This perspective is likely to highlight the
hard problems of today's state of the art, and a cross-cutting perspective
may lead to innovative approaches yielding concrete steps to reduce the
distance towards the ''ideal''.

2. A second illustration of attaining a wider perspective would be to
attempt to cross-link work in generative modelling (e.g., expressive speech
synthesis) and analysis (e.g., recognition of expressivity from
speech). Researchers on generation are invited to investigate the relevance
of their work for analysis, and vice versa. What methodologies, corpora or
descriptive inventories exist that could be shared between analysis and
generation, or at least mapped onto each other? If certain parameters have
proven to be relevant in one area, to what degree is it possible to
transfer them to the other area? Issues of relevance in this area may
include, among other things, personalisation, speaker dependency
vs. independency, links between voice conversion in synthesis and speaker
calibration in (automatic) recognition or (human) perception, etc.

Topics:

Paper are invited in all areas related to paralinguistic speech, 
including, but not limited, to the following topics:

- prosody of paralinguistic speech 
- voice quality and paralinguistic speech 
- synthesis of paralinguistic speech (model-based, data-driven, ...)
- recognition/classification of paralinguistic properties of speech
- analysis of paralinguistic speech (acoustics, physiology, ...)
- assessment and perception of paralinguistic speech
- typology of paralinguistic speech (emotion, expression, attitude, 
physical states, ...)

While all papers must be related to paralinguistic speech, papers 
making the link with a related area, e.g. investigating the interaction 
of the speech signal with the meaning of the verbal content, are 
explicitly welcome.

Important Dates:
 
1st call for papers: 1 December 2006 
2nd call for papers: 1 February 2007
Deadline for full-paper submission: 15 April (strict deadline!) 
Notification of acceptance: 1 June
Final version of accepted papers: 15 June
Workshop: 2-3 August 2007

Location and Registration Fees:

The workshop will take place at DFKI on the campus of Saarland 
University, Germany; on the same campus, the International Conference 
of Phonetic Sciences will take place during the following week.

Workshop registration fees: To be calculated, but will be around ~150 EUR

Submissions:

The workshop will consist of oral and poster presentations. Submitted
papers will stand a higher chance of being accepted as oral presentations
when the relevance to the workshop theme is evident.
 
Final submissions should be 6 pages long, and must be in English.
Word+Latex+OpenOffice templates will be made available on the workshop
website.

Second Call for Papers

Extended Deadline!

The Georgetown Linguistics Society is pleased to announce 

GLS 2007 
Language and Globalization: Policy, Education and Media 
www.glsconf.com

March 30-April 1, 2007 
Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 

GLS 2007, Language and Globalization: Policy, Education and Media, will explore the interaction between language and the processes of globalization. We invite papers that address the following questions: 

Policy: 
-	How is globalization driving implicit and explicit language policies? 
-	What role does language play in the development and  implementation of migrant/migration policy? 
-	What is the relationship between transnationalism and language policy? 
-	How are countries integrating language and citizenship requirements? 
-	How has language policy influenced and been influenced by immigration and integration? 

Education: 
-	How does globalization affect critical language awareness in education? 
-	What is the relationship between globalization and current trends in language education policy (especially in regards to the teaching of critical languages)? 
-	What is the role of language assessment? What are its advantages and dangers, particularly in light of globalization? 

Media: 
-	How does globalization shape public discourse (and vice versa)? 
-	How has language use in the public sphere (signage, verbal announcements, etc.) been influenced by globalization? 
-	How has globalization impacted language commodification? 

These topics are given as suggestions rather than limitations. Any papers relevant to the policy, education, and media effects of language related to globalization are welcome. 

GLS 2007 is a conference run by the graduate students in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University. The conference will include three days of oral and poster presentations by students as well as invited plenary addresses and panel discussions by established scholars. More information about the conference can be found at http://www.glsconf.com, where updates will also be announced. 

Confirmed Plenary Speakers: 

Dr. David Block 
Dr. Bonnie McElhinny
Dr. Ron Scollon
