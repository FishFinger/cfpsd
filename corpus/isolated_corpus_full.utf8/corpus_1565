Meeting Description:
The Department of English Studies of the University of Verona is proud to
announce GlobEng: International Conference on Global English. 
The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of research
discussing issues related to the role of English as a global language. 

The debate over the status of English as an International language has been
flourishing in the last few decades and is still open to new prospective
developments. 
Starting from the awareness of English undisputedly prominent role as a Lingua
Franca in international communication, the fact that native speakers are
currently a minority, compared to second-language users of the language has been
repeatedly highlighted. 
The changing status of English has led to the emergence of a new linguistic
scenery. On the one hand, the so-called native varieties have become highly
differentiated and acquired greater autonomy, while on the other, the rapid
growth of a community of non-native speakers, thanks to increasing international
exchanges, has triggered reflection on the possible rise of a new International
English, as opposed to the current native varieties.

A wide range of issues are brought to the fore in this connection, especially
focusing on the possible evolution of the current scenario, both in Europe and
in the rest of the world, with a reflection on (and a possible revision of) the
notion of Standard, and the crucial implications that prospective developments
might have on English Language Teaching (ELT).

The programme includes plenary lectures by renowned scholars in the field, such
as David Crystal, Jennifer Jenkins, Adrian Hollyday, Alan Maley, Barbara
Seidlhofer and Simon Sweeney. 

Papers are encouraged which address the following topics:
- Pronunciation Models: new vs. standard
- Implications of new morphosyntactic models
- Semantic and pragmatic implications of globalising English
- Cultures, media and globalisation
- Identities and international communication
- Language policies in the European Community
- English and other languages in the classroom
- The teaching of English as a foreign/second language and as a specialised
language 
- Terminological issues and new taxonomies
