(sociolinguistics, computational and corpus linguistics, language acquisition,
etc.). The only restriction is that all papers should address an issue
pertaining to Slavic linguistics. All talks will be for 20 minutes, plus 10
minutes for discussion. We encourage everyone to participate and ask you to
