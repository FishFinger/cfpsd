Final Call for Papers

ACL 2008
Workshop on Parsing German (PaGe 08)
June 20, 2008
Columbus, Ohio

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/acl08parsinggerman/

Extended Deadline: March 24

German possesses an interesting set of configurational properties on the syntactic level which make it far less flexible with respect to word order than other free word order languages. Analyses of these properties, which have formed a part of the traditional syntax of German since the early 19th century, only re-entered the mainstream of generative linguistics research within the last twenty years or so. In computational linguistics, however, their realization has varied quite widely: ''topological fields'' in HPSG-style analyses, multiple
parse trees, special constraints on liberation in constraint-based dependency-style analyses, various hybrid ''deep/shallow'' approaches, and agnostic parameter estimation over graphs. This variation can also acutely be felt in the annotation of German treebanks. Many corpora have historically elected to annotate only a few of the different senses of the term ''constituent'' inherent to German syntax, resulting in standards that make German appear either more like English or more like Czech.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for theoretical discussion as well as a shared task, based on the TIGER and TueBa-D/Z German treebanks, for these various approaches to make their case on empirical grounds. This combination we believe to be essential to balancing the considerations of what structure merits learning versus the ease with which it can be learned. Both treebanks are annotated collections of German newspaper text on similar topics. They are annotated with POS, morphology, phrase structure, and grammatical functions. TueBa-D/Z additionally uses topological fields to describe fundamental word order restrictions in German clauses. The treebanks differ significantly in their annotation schemes, however: while TIGER relies on crossing branches to describe long distance relationships, TueBa-D/Z uses pure tree structures with designated labels for long distance relationships. Additionally, the annotation is TIGER is flat
on the phrasal level while TueBa-D/Z annotates phrasal structure more hierarchically.

Participation in the shared task is optional.

Topics:
- constituent based approaches to parsing German
- dependency based approaches to parsing German
- treatment of long-distance relationships in German
- comparisons of parsing results for German to other free word order languages

Shared Task:
The workshop will feature a shared task on parsing German. We will
provide the following data sets:
- TIGER in constituent structure
- TIGER in dependency structure
- TueBa-D/Z in constituent structure
- TueBa-D/Z in dependency structure

The task will be to parse both treebanks using one structural encoding. The final ranking of systems will be based on averages computed between both treebanks. The data sets will be made available free of charge for the shared task, but they do require a license. 

In order to take part in the shared task, participants should register their intent to participate by sending an email to skuebler@indiana.edu. More information will be made available to registered participants.

Important Dates:
Workshop Paper Submission deadline: March 24, 2008
Notifications sent to authors: April 4, 2008
Camera ready due: April18, 2008
Workshop Dates: June 20, 2008

Paper Submission Information:
Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages, formatted following the ACL 2008 main session guidelines. In addition, shared task participants will be invited to submit short papers describing their systems and/or their evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled via the START system:

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
