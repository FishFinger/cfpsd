Further to the successful and highly competitive 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and
5th conferences 'Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing'
(RANLP), we are pleased to announce the 6th RANLP conference to be held
in September 2007.

The conference will take the form of addresses from invited keynote
speakers plus presentations of peer-reviewed individual papers. All
accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. In
addition, volumes of RANLP selected papers are traditionally published
by John Benjamins Publishing Company (Amsterdam & Philadelphia). There
will also be an exhibition area for poster and demo sessions.=20

The conference will be preceded by tutorials (23-25 Sep 2007) and
workshops (26 and 30 Sep 2007).

Language Processing (NLP). We encourage the representation of a broad
range of areas including but not limited to: pragmatics, discourse,
semantics, syntax, and the lexicon; phonetics, phonology, and
morphology; mathematical models and complexity; text understanding and
generation; multilingual NLP; machine translation, statistical machine
translation, machine-aided translation, translation memory systems,
translation aids and tools; text data mining; corpus-based language
processing; POS tagging; phrase identification; finite state methods;
efficiency of processing; parsing; grammatical frameworks; electronic
dictionaries; knowledge acquisition; terminology; term recognition; term
extraction; word-sense disambiguation; information retrieval;
cross-language information retrieval; information extraction; named
entity and mention detection; anaphora resolution; coreference; relation
extraction; unsupervised methods; text summarization; text
categorization; language indentification; author identification; gender
prediction; spam filtering; topic detection and tracking; question
answering; ontologies and reasoning; textual entailment; sentiment
analysis; opinion identification; influencer analysis; nlp and graph
