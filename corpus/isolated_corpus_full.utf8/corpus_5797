Poland has a strong tradition of research in cognitive linguistics; particu=
larly in Lodz (the second biggest city in Poland) we have organized a serie=
s of well-attended conferences focusing on the main areas in the field. In =
2003 the University of Lodz awarded an Honorary Doctorate to Ronald Langack=
er.=20
=20
The aim of the present conference is discussing the recent developments in =
Cognitive Poetics and Cognitive Rhetoric. Broadly speaking, Cognitive Poeti=
cs (also called Cognitive Stylistics) applies the insights from cognitive l=
inguistics to the analysis of texts. Both the theoreticians and the practit=
ioners of Cognitive Poetics point out its importance for literary studies, =
where it can become an effective analytical tool; but we firmly believe tha=
t it can also give direction to the study of non-literary texts, especially=
 those in which language has been used in some creative way (as in advertis=
ing, linguistic humour, etc.), as well as the study of visual images or mus=
ic.=20

Call for Papers:

Possible areas of interest include, but are not limited to:=20

-Metaphor and metonymy as basic cognitive mechanisms (the use of novel meta=
phors in both literary texts and a range of non-literary discourses in publ=
ic and interpersonal communication; the literalization of metaphors; synaes=
thetic metaphors; pictorial and multimodal metaphors; corpus-based studies =
of metaphorical patterns in texts);=20
-The mechanism of conceptual and formal blending;=20
-Mental imagery and its reflection in language (the figure/ground distribut=
ion of information, and the reversal of the figure/ground pattern; the mani=
pulation of the point of view);=20
-The use of frames, scripts and mental schemas in conceptualization;=20
-The linguistic construal of text worlds;=20
-The novel linguistic categorization of reality; etc.   =20
-Linguistic devices and strategies used by the authors of literary, politic=
al, or media messages with the aim of affecting the readers'/recipients' co=
nceptualizations, altering their perspective and way of thinking.

Close to this approach to texts is Cognitive Rhetoric, which we see as focu=
sing on the study of linguistic devices and strategies used by the authors =
of literary, political, or media messages with the aim of affecting the rea=
ders'/recipients' conceptualizations. We are therefore also interested in t=
he papers examining readers' responses to texts, and the potential of texts=
 to alter our perspective and way of thinking.

The deadline for outline proposals is 15th November 2009. Please send your =
abstracts of up to 300 words, accompanied by your name and institutional af=
filiation, in the .doc or pdf format, to akwiat@uni.lodz.pl. Notification o=
f acceptance will be sent by 23 November.  =20
