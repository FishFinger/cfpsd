Meeting Description

The 5th International Natural Language Generation Conference (the Biennial
Meeting of the Special Interest Group in Natural Language Generation SIGGEN)
will be held June 12-14, 2008 in Salt Fork, Ohio, USA.

INLG is the leading international conference on research into natural language
generation. It has been held in Sydney, Australia in 2006
(http://www.ict.csiro.au/inlg2006/), at Brockenhurst, UK in 2004
(http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/inlg04/), in Harriman, NY, USA in 2002
(http://inlg02.cs.columbia.edu/), and in Mitzpe Ramon, Israel in 2000
(http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~nlg2000/). Prior to 2000, INLGs were International
Workshops, running every other year since 1984. INLG provides a forum for the
discussion, dissemination and archiving of research topics and results in the
field of text generation. 

INLG 2008 will be held this year immediately prior to ACL:HLT 2008 (June 15-20),
in Salt Fork, OH (about 2 hours from Columbus, OH, the site of ACL:HLT 2008). In
addition to the INLG conference, there will be a special session for the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008). 

INLG invites substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics
related to natural language generation. Active topics of interest include:

- Applications of generation technology
- Architecture of generators
- Affect/emotion generation
- Content planning
- Discourse models (and pragmatic influences)
- Embodied generation
- Evaluation of NLG systems
- Generation and summarization
- Information organization for planning and NLG
- Lexicalization
- Multilingual NLG
- Multimedia or multimodal generation
- NLG for real-world applications
- NLG in linguistically motivated frameworks
- NLG workflows and architectures
- Referring expression generation
- Statistical processing for NLG
- Syntactic realization
- Use of ontologies in NLG

Submission Information

Requirements: A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2008 must not have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Submission
to other conferences should be clearly indicated on the paper.

Category of Papers: The conference will be organized as a 2.5 day workshop,
including sessions to present long papers, a special session for discussing the
Referring Expression Generation Challenge (REG Challenge 2008), and a poster
session for short papers and REG Challenge results.

Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time:

-  Long papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research results
and must not exceed eight (8) pages, including references;

-  Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort
and must not exceed four (4) pages, including references (these will be
presented at posters during the poster session).

Special Session on Referring Expression Generation Challenge 2008 (REG Challenge
2008).

The second Referring Expression Generation Challenge will involve two different
data sets: the TUNA Corpus (with previously unseen test data),
and the GREC Corpus of references to named entities in free text.  The
Challenge will have eight submission tracks, including attribute
selection, realisation and named entity generation tasks, as well as open
category and evaluation methods tracks. Assessment criteria will range from
automatically computed metrics to human evaluation. For the TUNA tasks the
criteria will include minimality, humanlikeness, and
identification/comprehension by human readers; those for the GREC task
will include humanlikeness and the DUC criteria of coherence and
referential clarity. Subject to feasibility, system processing efficiency is
another possible criterion.

The full preliminary announcement can be found here:

http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/REG-Challenge-2008.txt

A separate call for participation in the REG Challenge will be issued. In the
meantime, please contact Anja Belz and Albert Gatt at gre-stec (at)
itri.brighton.ac.uk for further information.

Important Dates

Submission of papers and posters: Mar 14
Notification of acceptance: Apr 25
Submission of camera-ready copy: May 16
INLG 2008 in Salt Fork, OH: Jun 12-14

Paper Submission: Submission will be electronic and the only accepted format for
submitted papers will be Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column
format of ACL proceedings (see the guidelines provided on the ACL:HLT conference
website).  More details on the submission process to follow.

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying the authors within the
paper. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Note that in extreme cases, an author unable to comply with the above submission
procedure should contact the program chairs sufficiently before the submission
deadline so alternative arrangements can be made.

Meeting Description

Conference on Semantics and Modelisation

The goal of the conference is to promote research on the representation of
linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal models. In view of
the development of corpus-based research in semantics and related fields,
proposals proposing the use of corpora and representational problems in
semantics and pragmatics are particularly welcome. 

The GDR Sémantique et Modélisation (CNRS) and the University of Toulouse 3 are
organizing the sixth edition of the Conference on Semantics and Modelisation
(JSM'08). The conference will be held in Toulouse, on April 3-4, 2008. (The
conference will be preceded by a 3 day short school in formal semantics, on
March 31 - April 2nd, with courses given in French.)

Topics

We invite abstracts that address any problem in the modelling of linguistic
meaning and interpretation. This includes but is not limited to the following
topics:

- syntax / semantics interface,
- logical formalization,
- tense and aspect,
- lexical meaning,
- functional words (determiners, pronouns, etc.),
- information structure,
- presuppositions and implicatures,
- speech acts,
- discourse relations in text and dialogue.

Submission Conditions

Abstracts must be anonymous. They should be 2 pages long including references,
examples and figures. They should have a 1 inch margin on
all four sides and use at least a 11 points font. Files may be in plain text,
PDF, RTF or MS Word. Names and affiliations should be indicated in the body of
the message. Proposals should be sent at jsm08{at}free.fr no later than January
8, 2008. Contact jsm08{at}free.fr for information. (Replace {at} with @ in the
