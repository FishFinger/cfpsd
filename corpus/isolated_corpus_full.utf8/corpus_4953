THE 2009 SLAVIC COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS CONFERENCE
(SCLC-2009)
October 15-17, 2009

EXTENDED DEADLINE: APRIL 15, 2009


NOTE TO ICLC PARTICIPANTS: We would like to encourage those of you who =20=

had planned to participate in the ICLC-2009 conference in Berkeley to =20=

consider joining us in Prague in October. Among affiliate =20
organizations of the ICLA, the SCLA is unique in that it is not a =20
national organization of cognitive linguists, but rather an =20
international group of cognitive linguists concerned with research on =20=

Slavic languages. We also accept papers on topics dealing with other =20
languages of Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and =20=

Central Asia. If you would like to submit your ICLC abstract on a =20
topic related to the concerns of the SCLA for our conference, please =20
follow the submission guidelines below and indicate that your abstract =20=

was accepted to the ICLC in your submission email. The SCLC is usually =20=

a small conference of around 30 papers, but we will do our best to =20
accommodate additional presentations this year.

The Slavic Cognitive Linguistics Association (SCLA) announces the =20
final call for papers for the 2009 Slavic Cognitive Linguistics =20
Conference (SCLC-2009), October 15-17, 2009. We are very pleased to =20
hold SCLC-2009 in conjunction with the Department of Czech Language =20
and Theory of Communication of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University =20=

in Prague, Czech Republic. Full information about the conference may =20
be found at the official conference website =
(http://ucjtk.ff.cuni.cz/sclc/sclc_eng.htm=20
).

Papers concerning all aspects of Slavic languages (phonetics, =20
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics, as well as =20=

broadly cultural or literary topics) from the perspective of cognitive =20=

linguistics are welcome. We also accept papers on topics dealing with =20=

other languages of Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet =20
Union, and Central Asia. Abstracts may be submitted up until the =20
extended deadline of April 15, 2009 to Steven Clancy =
<sclancy@uchicago.edu=20
 >. Abstracts should be approximately 500 words, but strict word =20
limits are not required. Notification of acceptance will be provided =20
by May 31, 2009. Please see the official conference website =
(http://ucjtk.ff.cuni.cz/sclc/sclc_eng.htm=20
) for more details.

We hope you will be able to join us in Prague for SCLC-2009. Please =20
forward this call for papers to your colleagues and graduate students =20=

who may be interested in presenting or attending.

All the best,


Steven Clancy
