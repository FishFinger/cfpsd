B. Organization of the abstract

Many abstracts are rejected because they omit crucial information rather than
because of errors in what they include. A suggested outline for abstracts is as
follows: 

1. Choose a title that clearly indicates the topic of the paper and is no more
than one line long. 

2. In the abstract, state the topic clearly. 

3. Make reference to prior work on the topic.

4. When essential to the clarity of the argumentation, present linguistic data
(with glosses). Explain abbreviations at their first occurrence. 

5. . If the paper presents the results of experiments, but collection of results
is not yet complete, present the provisional results in detail. Also indicate
the nature of the experimental design and the specific hypothesis tested. 

6. State the relevance of your hypothesis to past work. Describe the analysis in
as much detail as possible. Avoid vague or unsubstantiated statements. 

7. State the contribution to linguistic research made by the analysis. 

8. Citation of the relevant literature is essential within the abstract.
However, the inclusion of a list of references at the end of the abstract is not
obligatory.
Abstracts will be assessed on the basis of the following three criteria: 

1. The relevance and significance of the proposed topic and/or the originality
of the study.

2. The argumentation (including the clarity of the argument and the
results/conclusions).

3. Knowledge of the relevant research literature and theory.
