Dear all,

Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis Across Disciplines (CADAAD) is
an ongoing project which aims to foster and promote cross-disciplinary
communication in critical discourse research. Following the success of
the project?s first international conference hosted at the University of
East Anglia in 2006, we are pleased to announce the second international
conference CADAAD?08, to be hosted at the University of Hertfordshire,
10-11 July 2008.

In line with the general aims of the project, we welcome papers both
from CDA and neighbouring disciplines such as communication studies,
media studies, narrative studies, sociology, philosophy and political
science. Abstracts are invited which assess the state of the art and
offer new directions for critical discourse research. By new directions
we mean i) theoretical/methodological development and/or ii) analysis of
contemporary discourses.

Theoretical/methodological frameworks sourced from all areas of the
social and cognitive sciences are welcome. Papers exploring the
following frameworks in linguistics are particularly welcome:

Cognitive Linguistics (Blending, Construction Grammars, Framing, Metaphor)
Corpus Linguistics (Corpus Construction, Data Extraction, Semantic Prosody)
Pragmatics (Presupposition, Relevance Theory, Speech Acts)
Systemic Functional Linguistics (Cohesion and Coherence, Grammatical
Metaphor)

Analyses of all contemporary discourses are welcome, including those
within applied and professional areas such as education, environmental
policy, health, and law. Papers applying critical analysis to discourses
used in the construction of 'minority' vs. 'normality' and other
dichotomies are especially welcome. Areas of particular interest include:

Discourse on gender
Discourse of International Law
Discourse on immigration
Discourse of the war on terror
European Union discourse
United Nations and foreign aid discourse

Reflecting our commitment to multiplicity in critical approaches to
discourse analysis, the following plenary speakers have confirmed their
participation:

Professor Piotr Cap (University of ?=F3dz', Poland)
Professor Jonathan Charteris-Black (University of West England, UK)
Professor Teun van Dijk (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain)
Professor Ruth Wodak (Lancaster University, UK)

Abstracts of no longer than 400 words should be submitted as MS Word
attachment to discourse@cadaad.org by 30 November 2007. Authors should
include their name, affiliation and email address. Successful authors
will be notified via email by 15 February 2008. Papers will be allocated
twenty minutes plus ten minutes for questions.

We also invite proposals for theme sessions and satellite events. A
theme session should consist of four or five thematically related
papers. Satellite events, such as workshops and tutorials, may take
place on 9 July 2008. Please send proposals to discourse@cadaad.org by 1
October 2007.

Selected proceedings will be published. Selected papers from CADAAD'06
were published in the inaugural issue of the journal Critical Approaches
to Discourse Analysis across Disciplines
(http://www.cadaad.org/ejournal) and additional papers from the
Cognitive Linguistics theme session were published by Cambridge Scholars
Press as ''Cognitive Linguistics in Critical Discourse Analysis:
Application and Theory'' (Hart & Lukes, eds., 2007).

Please visit http://cadaad.org/cadaad08 for further conference details.

Kind regards,
Christopher Hart and Dominik Lukes
