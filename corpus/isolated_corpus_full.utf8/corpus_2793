CALL FOR PAPERS
  Workshop on Symmetric calculi and Ludics for the semantic 
interpretation (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~quatrini/ESSLLI2008.html)
August 4-8, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008 (http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 4-15
August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany



Workshop Organizers:

Alain Lecomte (SFL - Paris 8),  Alain.Lecomte@upmf-grenoble.fr
Myriam Quatrini (IML Marseille), quatrini@iml.univ-mrs.fr

Workshop Purpose and topics:

  In recent years there have been some important new developments of
methods of dealing with semantic and pragmatic phenomena in
Linguistics, inspired by developments in Logic and Theoretical
Computer Science. Among these developments, Continuation Theory,
Symmetric calculi and Ludics play an important role. Continuation
theory dates back from the early seventies (cf. Reynolds, 93) and was
at the heart of Programming Languages like Scheme. More recently, a
logical account was given to it, by extending the Curry-Howard
homomorphism (Griffin, 1990),. This led to several calculi like such
as Parigot's lambda-mu-calculus, Curien-Herbelin's
lambda-mu-mu-tilde-calculus, Wadler's dual calculus and so on. These
calculi are based on the core idea that programs and contexts are dual
entities and this is reflected in the symmetry of the "classical"
sequents. These systems were prefigured by the so called
Lambek-Grishin calculus (Grishin, 83), a calculus extending the Lambek
calculus by taking classical sequents into account. Following
Curien-Herbelin (Bernardi and Moortgat, 2007) focuses on the
connection between Lambek-Grishin calculus with
lambda-mu-tilde-calculus and hence with continuation semantics.
Classical linear logic (Girard, 87, 95) gives another viewpoint, where
the co-product is realized by an authentic parallelisation connective.
Linguistic applications have been given since around 2000,
particularly by C. Barker (Barker, 2002), K. Chung-chieh Shan
(Chung-chieh Shan, 2002) and P. de Groote (de Groote, 2001) who
exploited the advantages of these systems in the task of giving
several readings of an ambiguous sentence. De Groote (de Groote, 2007)
also shows that we gain a new dynamical logic which enables us to
elegantly treat phenomena of discourse like anaphora
resolution. M. Moortgat and R. Bernardi (Moortgat & Bernardi, 2007)
shows how moving to a symmetric categorial grammar, namely Lambek
Grishin calculus, helps accounting for discontinous phenomena that are
not captured by the asymmetric Lambek calculus. Independently, linear
logic was intensively studied in particular by Girard himself who
invented "Ludics" as a new conception of logic, where the dualism
between syntax and semantics is abolished : the meaning of rules is in
the rules themselves. This conception has some similarities with more
traditional "Game Semantics" (Lorenz, Lorenzen, Hintikka...) but it is
dynamic, in the sense that "strategies" are replaced by interacting
processes. Moreover, a new step in abstraction is provided, which
consists in stating rule schemata which are only expressed in terms of
loci (that we may see as memory cells).  The two approaches in this
workshop are connected, basically because of their common root :
explorations in the meaning of Logics and in particular reflections on
one of the symmetrical systems, namely linear logic. Linguistic
applications of Ludics remain very embryonic, but some authors have
already emphasized that it is suitable for giving a framework in which
it is possible to study speech acts and dialogue (Livet, 2007,
Troncon, 2006). Other authors have pointed out similarities of the
Ludics' philosophy with Wittgenstein's views on language games
(Pietarinen, 2006). This workshop will provide an opportunity to study
these questions. It will accept several kinds of contributions :
theoretical works on continuation theory, symmetric calculi and
ludics, applied works of these theory concerning linguistic topics
(semantics, pragmatics) and philosophical investigations.


Submission Details:
  Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract.
Submissions should not exceed 7 pages, including references.
Submissions should be in PDF format. Please send your submission
electronically using the interface EasyChair with cc to
