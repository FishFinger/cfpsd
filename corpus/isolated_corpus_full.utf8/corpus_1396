CALL for PAPERS
*** Deadline extended to 4/30/07 ***


GRAMMAR ENGINEERING ACROSS FRAMEWORKS
   July 13-15, 2007
      Stanford, California, USA
   http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF07.html

This workshop is part of the 2007 LSA Summer Institute.  (But note
that workshop attendees do not have to register for the Institute.)

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to
support robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in
real-world domains and applications. The demands of these types of
tasks have resulted in significant advances in areas such as parser
efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic approaches to disambiguation,
and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons.  The effective
development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a central
issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic
grammars forces these processes to be tackled in ways that have much
in common with software engineering.  This workshop aims to bring
together grammar engineers from different frameworks to compare their
research and methodologies.


PANEL DISCUSSION ON EVALUATION: How can we develop evaluation
methodologies and metrics which can capture the added benefits of deep
linguistic analysis?

    Mary Dalrymple, Oxford University (moderator)
    Roger Levy, University of California, San Diego
    Stephan Oepen, University of Oslo
    Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder


PAPER TOPICS:
The workshop is soliciting submissions for papers on the following
themes:

 1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and =
metrics
 which can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; =
evaluation
 techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages

 2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can
 most easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses =
of
 separate linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and =
the
 role of frameworks on promoting or inhibiting modularity

 3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and =
multideveloper
 maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of =
maintainability
 on choices of linguistic analysis

 4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections =
on
 how to present grammar engineering work to other research communities.

 5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes;  methodologies
 and techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in=20
 day-to-day progress on grammars=20

SPECIAL DEMO SESSION

In addition to the panel and papers, there will be a demo session.  If
you wish to give a demonstration of a system relevant to the "Grammar
Engineering Across Frameworks" theme, please submit a title of the
demo and a one-paragraph description through Easy Chair, by June 1,
2007.  You do not have to have a paper in the workshop in order to
give a demo.


PROCEEDINGS

We plan to publish the proceedings (full papers) as an online volume
through CSLI publications after the workshop.
