FORMAT OF THE CONFERENCE

The conference program will include presentation of invited papers, oral
presentations, and poster/demonstration sessions. Papers will be presented
in plenary or topic oriented sessions. A preliminary conference program
will be published at the conference www pages. One day of the conference 
will be dedicated for tutorials and workshops.

Social events including a trip in the vicinity of Plzen will allow for
additional informal interactions.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages formatted
in the LNCS style (see below). Those accepted will be presented either
orally or as posters. The decision about the presentation format will be
based on the recommendation of three reviewers. The authors are asked to
submit their papers using the on-line form accessible from the conference
website.

Papers submitted to TSD 2009 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should 
be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed 
(Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the requirements above 
are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX or LaTeX
formats. These formats are necessary for the final versions of the papers
that will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes. Authors using a WORD
compatible software for the final version must use the LNCS template for
WORD and within the submit process ask the Proceedings Editors to convert
the paper to LaTeX format.  For this service a service-and-license fee of
CZK 1500 will be levied automatically.

The paper format for review has to be either PDF or PostScript file with 
all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance, presenters 
will receive further information on submitting their camera-ready and 
electronic sources (for detailed instructions on the final paper format 
see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings.)

Authors are also invited to present actual projects, developed software or
interesting material relevant to the topics of the conference.  The
presenters of the demonstration should provide the abstract not exceeding
one page. The demonstration abstracts will not appear in the conference
proceedings.


LOCATION

Plzen (Pilsen) is located in Western Bohemia on the confluence of four
rivers. With 170 thousand inhabitants it is the fourth largest city in the
Czech Republic and an important industrial, commercial, cultural, and
administrative center.

Plzen is well known for its brewing tradition. The trademark Pilsner-Urquell
penetrated all over the world thanks to the traditional recipe, high quality
hops and good wells. Beer lovers will also appreciate a visit to the brewery
museum or the Brewery itself.

Apart from its famous beer, Plzen has a lot of hidden treasures in its core.
Plzen can pride itself on the second largest synagogue in Europe. The old
city center is dominated by a 13th-century Gothic church which features the
highest tower in Bohemia (102.34 m). It is possible to go up the stairs and
admire the panorama. Not far from the church is a splendid Renaissance Town
Hall from 1558 and plenty of pleasant cafes and pubs.

Plzen has also a beautiful historical underground - under the city center
there are 25 km of tunnels. Visitors can pass through the most beautiful
part of this labyrinth.

It is also recommended to visit the Zoo having the second largest space for
bears in Europe and keeping the Komodo dragons - large lizards existing in
only a few Zoos in the world..

In the neighborhood of the city there are castle Radynì and hunting-seat
Kozel. St. Peter's Rotunda in Starý Plzenec was built in the 10th century.

The University of West Bohemia in Plzen provides a variety of courses for
both Czech and international students. It is the only institution of 
higher education in this part of the country which prepares students for 
careers in engineering (electrical and mechanical), science (computer 
science, applied mathematics, physics, and mechanics), education (both 
primary and secondary), economics, philosophy, politology, archaeology, 
anthropology, foreign languages, law and public administration, art and 
design.


GETTING THERE

The city has an access from the D5 highway connecting Prague (Praha) with
Germany. Plzen has a very good bus and train connections with the capital
Prague (takes about 1 - 1.5 hour). From the international airport Prague -
Ruzyne you can reach Plzen by frequent public transport in 1.5 - 2 hours.
