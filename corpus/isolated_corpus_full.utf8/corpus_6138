communications. The applications of advanced information 
technology to such domains as astronomy, biology, education, 
geosciences, security and health care are among topics of 
relevance to ITNG. High Performance Computing, Computer 
Architectures, and Innovative methods of Computing are 
examples of the related topics.Visionary ideas, theoretical 
and experimental results, as well as prototypes, designs, and
