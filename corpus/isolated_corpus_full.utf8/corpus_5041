Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Following the success of the first annual conference in Ethnography Language and
Communication, we are now inviting abstracts for papers and posters for 2009. We
welcome abstracts that explore the possibilities and problems of employing
ethnographically sensitive approaches to language and communication research
across a wide range of disciplines and topics (including health, education,
social and political processes, culture and identity). 

The second annual event has a focus on data and methodology. The selection
process will therefore give particular consideration to those abstracts (a)
oriented towards the concepts and methods of ethnography and (b) providing a
clear focus on how these methods can be applied to the collection and analysis
of language data. 

Call for Papers

The conference is run as a one-day event. Oral presentations will be 30 minutes
in length, followed by 15 minutes for discussion. Dedicated time and space will
also be allocated for poster presentations. Plenary speakers are Professor Jan
Blommaert (Department of Languages, University of Jyvaskyla) and Professor
Martyn Hammersley (The Open University).

Abstracts (up to 300 words) should be submitted by e-mail attachment (Word
files) to explorations09@googlemail.com. Please submit two files, one containing
the abstract and details of the author(s) (name(s), affiliation, email address)
and one containing an anonymous abstract. Under the title for the abstract,
please give four keywords which summarise the paper/poster. In the body of your
email please specify whether the abstract is for a poster or paper presentation.

An optional data-focused workshop will be available to conference registrants on
the afternoon of Thursday 10th September. Participants are invited to submit
data from their own research projects. Those wishing to submit data for analysis
should send a brief (no more than one page) description of the data (background,
participants, method of collection etc.), the aims of the research project and
the questions they would like to explore. Submissions should be made by e-mail
attachment to explorations09@googlemail.com. 

Please specify in the title and body of your email that this proposal is for the
data-focused workshop. Workshop facilitators include Professor Ben Rampton and
Professor Celia Roberts (King's College London), Dr Adam Lefstein, Dr Jeff
Bezemer and Dr Carey Jewitt (Institute of Education University of London). 

The deadline for submission of papers, posters and data analysis proposals is
Friday 1st May 2009. Registration for the conference will open in June 2009. The
one-day conference fee is £35, including a buffet lunch, tea and coffee, with a
reduced rate of £15 for students. There will be a charge of £10 for the optional
data-focused workshop. Places for the data workshop will be limited so early
registration is advised.  

The conference is organised by Dr. Fiona Copland (School of Languages and Social
Sciences, Aston University), Dr. Julia Snell (Institute of Education University
of London) and Dr. Sara Shaw (Department of Primary Care and Population Health,
University College London / The Nuffield Trust).

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
