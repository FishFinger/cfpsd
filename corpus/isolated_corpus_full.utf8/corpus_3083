                     The Third International Workshop on
                            ONTOLOGY MATCHING
                                     (OM-2008)
                    http://om2008.ontologymatching.org/

October 26 or 27, 2008, ISWC'08 Workshop Program, Karlsruhe, Germany


BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler for the Semantic Web,
since it takes the ontologies as input and determines as output an 
alignment,
that is, a set of correspondences between the semantically related entities
of those ontologies. These correspondences can be used for various tasks,
such as ontology merging, query answering, data translation, or for 
navigation
on the Semantic Web. Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and
data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate.


The workshop has two goals:

1. To bring together academic and industry leaders dealing with ontology
matching in order to assess how academic advances are addressing
real-world requirements. The workshop will strive to improve academic
awareness of industrial needs, and therefore, direct research towards
those needs. Simultaneously, the workshop will serve to inform industry
representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their
business needs.

2. To conduct an extensive evaluation of ontology matching
approaches through the OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative)
2008 campaign. The particular focus of this year's OAEI campaign is on
real-world matching tasks from specific domains, e.g., medicine.
Therefore, the ontology matching evaluation initiative itself will provide
a solid ground for discussion of how well the current approaches are
meeting business needs.


TOPICS of interest include, but are not limited to:
    Requirements to ontology matching from specific domains;
    Application of ontology matching techniques in real-world scenarios;
    Social and collaborative ontology matching;
    Interactive ontology matching;
    Alignment management;
    Background knowledge in ontology matching;
    Reasoning for ontology matching;
    Uncertainty in ontology matching;
    Formal foundations and frameworks for ontology matching;
    Performance of ontology-matching techniques;
    Ontology matching evaluation methodology;
    Ontology matching for information integration;
    Ontology matching for query answering;
    Ontology matching for dynamic environments;
    Systems and infrastructures.


FORMAT AND SUBMISSIONS
The schedule assumes one day workshop. The workshop will consist of the
following components: technical presentations, OAEI'08 results
presentations, posters, workshop on consensus building (of reference
alignments) and wrap-up discussion.

Contributions to the workshop can be made in terms of
(i) technical papers addressing different issues of ontology matching as
well as (ii) participating in the OAEI 2008 campaign. Technical papers 
should
be not longerthan 12 pages using the LNCS Style. For complete style details,
see Springer's Author Instructions
http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-164-2-72376-0,00.html
These should be prepared in PDF format and should be submitted
(no later than July 25, 2008) through the workshop submission site at:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=om2008

Technical papers will be refereed by the Program Committee.
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.
Contributors to OAEI 2008 have to follow the campaign's conditions at:

http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2008/
