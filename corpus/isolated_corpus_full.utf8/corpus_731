Meeting Description:

PALC will celebrate its 10th anniversary next year. Over the years the
conference attracted over 400 attendees from 32 countries and its impact has
reverberated significantly across a variety of fields where information
technology and language description converge. Given the special nature of PALC
2007, we are working towards an occasion that will reflect on the current status
of corpus studies and computational linguistics but will also set research
directions for at least another ten years. 

Abstracts of papers should be up to 500 words long and forwarded (by e-mail) to
the organisers. Deadline for submission is 31 January 2007. We have also
activated online registration forms as an alternative way of submitting abstracts.

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, the following:

    - Contrastive Studies and Language Corpora;
    - Discourse and Language Corpora;
    - ESP and Language Corpora;
    - Expert, Retrieval and Analytical Systems in Corpora;
    - FLA/SLA and Language Corpora;
    - Language Teaching Materials and Language Corpora;
    - Language Teaching and Learner Corpora;
    - Lexicography and Language Corpora;
    - Lexicology and Language Corpora;
    - Literature and Language Corpora;
    - Phonetics/Phonology and Language Corpora;
    - Translation and Language Corpora;
    - Cognition, Computers and Language.
