ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing=20
Special Issue on
Recent Advances in Asian Language Spoken Document Retrieval
(http://chinese.csie.ncku.edu.tw/CallForPaper/)

With the rapid expansion of audio media sources such as radio, TV, =
lectures, and telephony recordings,=20
there is an increasing demand for automatic indexing and retrieval of =
spoken documents. =20
Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) is essentially the task of retrieving =
excerpts from a large collection=20
of spoken documents based on a user=A1=A6s request. Over the past =
several years,=20
SDR has emerged as an interdisciplinary field combining automatic speech =
recognition,=20
natural language processing, and information retrieval. SDR has =
benefited from advances in speech=20
and language processing as well as from the availability of large spoken =
databases.=20
With its focus on fundamental research in natural spoken language =
processing,=20
SDR is key to applications such as voice search, voice surveillance, =
voice data mining and call center automation.
We invite papers on recent advances in Asian language SDR research.=20
Submissions must not have been previously published, with the exception =
that substantial extensions of conference papers=20
will be considered. Of particular interest are studies that directly =
address problems in Asian spoken languages,=20
but new and general methods in SDR tested on Asian languages are also =
welcome. Topics of interest include:  =20

=A1ESpeech recognition and adaptation algorithms
=A1ENatural language processing for SDR
=A1ETopic detection and tracking, routing=20
=A1EClustering and classification
=A1EIndexing and retrieval=20
=A1ESummarization and information extraction=20
=A1EUnderstanding, organization and visualization=20
=A1ECross-language and multilingual SDR
=A1EQuery-by-example SDR
=A1ESpoken dialogue systems for accessing spoken archives=20
=A1ESpoken document corpora=20
=A1EPerformance, compression, scalability, architectures, efficiency=20
=A1EVoice data mining and machine learning for SDR
=A1ESDR in creative applications

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:=20
Papers should be formatted following the style guidelines for the ACM =
