Meeting Description:

Personal Identity through a Language Lens
20 - 22 May 2010
University of ?=F3d?, Poland
Institute of English Studies
Chair of Semantics and Linguistic Semiotics

Reflecting upon their identity, people are faced with a paradox of staying =
the
same by continuously changing. To resolve this paradox they need to look at
identity from two seemingly contrastive, yet compatible and complementary
perspectives. Firstly, many philosophers, since John Locke, have sought the
basis of personal identity in the mind: in our psychological continuity ove=
r
time, mediated by memory. However, more recently, some scholars, philosophe=
rs
and psychologists alike, have emphasised the role played by the physical
continuity of the body. While each approach captures some aspects of identi=
ty,
neither gets to the heart of the matter. What is more, the role of language=
 in
the process of identity creation remains at best a secondary concern, not a
focused goal of the field. In accordance with this research focus, the
conference will aim at exploring identity as constituted in and represented=
 by
linguistic interaction. The need for such an approach has become apparent i=
n
recent years; as linguistic research on identity has become increasingly ce=
ntral
within sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, discourse analysis, and s=
ocial
psychology the concomitant development of linguistic approaches to identity=
 has
been neglected.=20

The aim of the conference is to bring together scholars of varied disciplin=
es to
explore the issue from a range of perspectives. By applying a variety of
analytical tools and concepts, contributors will hopefully show how people
construct images of themselves through language, how they shape, perform an=
d
re-shape their personal identities within and across local and dominant
discourses and finally how language resources are selected and used to perf=
orm
desirable versions of identities.

The following keynote speakers have already confirmed their participation:

Mike Baynham (University of Leeds, UK)
Alexandra Georgakopoulou-Nunes (King's College, London, UK)=20
Piotr Ole? (Catholic University of Lublin, Poland)=20

dy of
abstract.

Please use plain text (Times Roman 12) and abstain from using footnotes and=
 any
special formatting, characters or emphasis (such as bold, italics or underl=
ine).
We acknowledge receipt and reply to all paper proposals submitted. If you d=
o not
receive a reply from us in a week you should assume we did not receive your
proposal; it might be lost in cyberspace! In that case, we suggest either,
looking for an alternative electronic route or resending. Abstracts should =
be
sent to the organising chair: Kamila Ciepiela, kciepiela@wp.pl. They will b=
e
blind peer reviewed. The authors will be notified of the acceptance or reje=
ction
of the paper by February 12, 2010.

The length of the presentation will be limited to 30 minutes with a 30 minu=
te
discussion following every three presentations. Selected conference papers =
will
be eligible (subject to conditions) for publication with Lodz University Pr=
ess.=20

The language of the Conference will be English, with a possible additional
Polish session.

The conference fee will be approximately =80100. This includes:

Conference registration=20
Conference materials
Booklet of abstracts
Coffee breaks with coffee, tea, juice and biscuits

The conference will be held at the University of Lodz Conference Center in =
Lodz.
Detailed information about the costs of accommodation will follow in the ne=
xt
circular.=20

The organizers place a strong emphasis on dialogue with the issues raised b=
y the
conference as a whole and engagement with the people attending the conferen=
ce.
These two elements are essential to the inter- and multi disciplinary natur=
e of
the event. We believe that the success of our project should rest on the
continual interaction between participants for the duration of the conferen=
ce
and beyond. We feel it is essential that delegates should be present for th=
e
duration of the conference so as to facilitate the exchange of perspectives=
 for
which the conference strives, and which any publication should clearly
demonstrate. Failure to attend for the duration of the meeting will
automatically exclude eligibility for inclusion in any of the project publi=
cations.
