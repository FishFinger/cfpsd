Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Aug-2009 

Meeting Description:

TLS XII, the 12th annual meeting of the Texas Linguistics Society, will take place November 13-15, 2009 at the University of Texas at Austin. The meeting will consist of a general session, one parasession described below, and The 5th Workshop on Discourse Structure in honor of Carlota S. Smith. 

General Session:

The General Session will cover all areas of linguistic interest. We encourage proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks and also welcome papers on language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology, cognitive science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology.

Keynote Speaker: 

Colin Bannard, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology/University of Texas at Austin

Parasession:

'Approaches to Semantics and Pragmatics Based on Naturally Occurring Data,
Elicitation, and Experimentation'

In all scientific disciplines, theory requires data for validation (or refutation) of hypotheses, and data requires theory for interpretation. In linguistics, 'data' has often been synonymous with `intuitions' or 'introspections.' Yet, there is much to gain by joining forces between theoretical fields of research and the tools of experimental psycholinguistics. 

Keynote Speaker: 

Elsi Kaiser, University of Southern California
    
The 5th Workshop on Discourse Structure in honor of Carlota S. Smith:  

This workshop continues in the tradition of the previous workshops organized by Professor Smith, and will focus on two areas of research in which she did much pioneering work: the semantics of temporal location, tense, and aspect, and research into modes of discourse. Work from diverse methodological and theoretical perspectives which addresses syntactic, semantic, interface, pragmatic and discourse-level issues relating to temporal location, tense, aspectual categories, Aktionsart and other related areas in natural language will be featured. Talks for this workshop are by invitation, but abstracts dealing with this conference theme are welcome for the general session. 

Call for Papers:

Abstracts for the General Session are welcome for papers in any major area of linguistics.  

The present parasession especially invites papers exploring classic issues in theoretical semantics and pragmatics based on psycholinguistic experiments and on methods such as questionnaires, elicitation tests, corpus studies, follow-up studies, and interviews. Submissions that introduce new data from understudied languages are also welcome.

Submissions:

Deadline for submissions is August 15, 2009. Submit your abstract via the
LinguistList's EasyAbstracts utility at: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/customhome.cfm?emeetingid=0602J844585E464A408040441&CFID=26864945 CFTOKEN=95281120 beginning on Tue., June 9, 2009.

Please use the following guidelines in submitting your abstract:

Limit abstracts to two pages with one page of text and one additional page for data and references.

Abstracts must be submitted in .PDF format.

Please ensure that your abstract to be uploaded is anonymous and contains no identifying information concerning the author(s). Check the 'File: Document Properties' in Acrobat to ensure that no document properties were automatically inserted that identify the author(s).

Side and top and bottom margins should be one inch (2.5 cm) and typed in at least 11-point font.

Please limit submissions to two papers with at most one single-authored paper.

Applicants will be notified as to acceptance by September 15, 2009.
