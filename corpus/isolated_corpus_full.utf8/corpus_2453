3rd Quantitative Investigations in Theoretical Linguistics (QITL-3)
                        2-4 June 2008
                      Helsinki, Finland

General and background:

The Linguistic Association of Finland (SKY) in association with the
Department of General Linguistics at the University of Helsinki will
be co-hosting the Third Workshop on Quantitative Investigations in
Theoretical Linguistics (QITL-3), to be held on Mon-Wed, 2-4 June,
2008, in Helsinki, Finland. The official website of the workshop is to
be found at:

http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/sky/tapahtumat/qitl/

This workshop is both a continuation of the two previous QITL events
held in Osnabr=FCck, Germany
(http://www.cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~qitl/), and the latest in the
sequence of summer symposia arranged by SKY
(http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/sky/tapahtumia.shtml).

Call for Papers:

Since the turn of the millenium, the application of quantitative
methods on empirical data, with increasing sophistication and
complexity, has become widely accepted as central in the development
and testing of theoretical hypotheses concerning the nature of natural
language and its processing by human beings. However, it is also
increasingly recognized that quantitative investigations should be
theoretically motivated and anchored, in addition to that linguistic
theories and models should be modified or even fundamentally revised,
if not also sometimes altogether refuted, to properly reflect the
reality of quantitative results. Simply put, quantitative methods and
theoretical developments should mutually feed and influence each
other.

As with the previous two QITL meetings, we invite researchers from all
linguistic frameworks engaged in quantitative investigations of
theoretical linguistic questions to submit abstracts for 30 minute
talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion). The preferred focus is on how
one has been able to address a theoretically motivated linguistic
question with some quantitative method(s); computational and
exploratory approaches may also be of interest if they lead to or shed
light on theoretical issues. Furthermore, we welcome studies
concerning all media of language use, whether spoken, written or
electronic in form. Relevant topics include (but are not by any means
limited to) models of lexical, syntactic or pragmatic/prosodic
preferences, the nature of linguistic rules/regularities and the
lexicon (e.g. morphological productivity), the relationship between
language use, linguistic judgements and/or indirect data on language
processing, cross-linguistic typological tendencies, first and second
language acquisition, diachronic language development, and so
forth. Our goal is to continue the workshoppy and conversational form
as well as the theoretically and methodologically pluralistic
atmosphere of the previous QITL events.

Abstracts should be at the maximum 3 pages long (A4, with 12 point
Times New Roman or equivalent font and single spacing), including all
tables, figures and references (corresponding to approximately
1000-1500 words). Electronic submission (in either PDF, PostScript or
RTF format) by e-mail to "qitl-3 at helsinki.fi" is strongly
preferred. Each submission will be peer-reviewed by (at least) two
members of the program committee.

The deadline for submissions is Monday, 11 February 2008.
