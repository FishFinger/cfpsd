Call for SIGIR Workshop Proposals

***SIGIR Workshop Proposals are due EARLIER this year than in the past! 
Please pay attention to the submission deadline: February 02, 2009 and 
notification date: March 09, 2009.***

Proposals are solicited for one-day workshops to be held as part of the 
SIGIR Conference on July 23, 2009 (http://www.sigir2009.org/). Topics 
should match those identified in the SIGIR general call for participation 
(http://sigir2009.org/Calls).

SIGIR workshops provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less 
formal and possibly more focused way than the conference itself. The 
format of each workshop is to be determined by the organizers, but it is 
expected that workshops will contain ample time for general discussion and 
engagement by all participants - not just those presenting papers. 
Workshops that foster collaboration, discussion, and group problem-solving 
are encouraged. Workshops that only involve the presentation of papers are 
discouraged.

Researchers and practitioners from all segments of the information 
retrieval community are invited to submit proposals for review. The 
organizers of approved workshops are expected to define the workshop's 
focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon final program 
content. Organizers (including co-organizers) are expected to attend their 
entire workshop and to provide an article for the SIGIR Forum summarizing 
the event.

Submission Guidelines

Submissions describing proposed workshops should include (1) the theme and 
purpose of the workshop; (2) motivation for the workshop and 
appropriateness to SIGIR; (3) planned activities and a tentative schedule 
of events; (4) selection process for participants and/or presenters and 
maximum number of participants (if limited); and (5) names of potential 
program committee members (if a program committee will be formed).

If the workshop has been held previously at SIGIR or another conference, 
then the organizers should indicate this and describe briefly past 
attendance and outcomes, and why another workshop is needed.

The submission should also include a short biographical sketch for each 
organizer, describing relevant qualifications and experience.

Proposals should be in pdf format and not exceed 1000 words. Proposals 
should be emailed to the 2009 SIGIR Workshop Chair, Diane Kelly (dianek 
[at] email.unc.edu).
