Meeting Description

The Northwest Linguistics Conference (NWLC) brings together research on
theoretical and applied linguistics by graduate students from across the world.
This year, the Department of Linguistics at the University of Washington,
Seattle is honored to host the 24th NWLC on May 3 - 4, 2008. 

We invite abstracts from or related to all areas of theoretical and applied
linguistics (including, but not limited to, first and second language
acquisition, historical linguistics, psycho/neurolinguistics, syntax, semantics,
phonetics, phonology and other areas of formal language theory) for 20-minute
talks (plus 10 minutes for questions). Proceedings from this conference will be
published in a special edition of UW Working Papers in Linguistics. 

Abstracts must be sent electronically to uwnwlc@u.washington.edu. We only accept
files in PDF format.
Abstracts should be one page in length, single spaced, in a 12-point font with
one-inch margins, with examples, figures, and references included on a second
page.  Abstracts must not contain the name of the author(s) (either in the PDF
or in the file name) in order to guarantee anonymity during the review process. 
Include name(s) of author(s), affiliation, title of talk, and contact
information in the text of the email. 
Because questions and discussion are an important part of these conferences,
surrogate readers are generally deemed inappropriate, and at least one author of
every paper is required to attend the conference to deliver the paper.
Exceptions may be made (e.g., authors outside of North America who cannot
feasibly travel to Seattle), but in such cases author(s) are required to locate
a surrogate who is thoroughly familiar with the paper (and any languages
discussed therein) to deliver the paper and field questions. In such cases, the
author(s) should include the name and contact information for the surrogate
along with his or her submission.  

The deadline of submission is 5:00pm PST, February 15, 2008. Notification of
acceptance will be sent out in the first week of March, 2008.  Send questions to
uwnwlc@u.washington.edu
