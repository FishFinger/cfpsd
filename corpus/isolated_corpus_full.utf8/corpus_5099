Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation, Disambiguation  =

and Applications (MWE 2009)
Workshop at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference (Singapore), 06 August 2009

Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

Description

       Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) are an indispensable part of  =

natural languages and appear steadily on a daily basis, both new and  =

already existing but paraphrased. Thus, the automated processing of  =

MWEs is important for many natural language applications. The meaning  =

of MWEs can be either motivated or arbitrary. Native speakers master  =

most MWEs, while learners of a foreign language have to learn MWEs by  =

heart. The interpretation of MWEs poses a major challenge for  =

automated analysis helping both groups easily master MWEs.

       The growing interest in MWEs in the NLP community has led to  =

many specialized workshops held every year since 2001 in conjunction  =

with ACL, EACL and LREC; there have been also two recent special  =

issues on MWEs published by leading journals: the International  =

Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation, and the Journal of  =

Computer Speech and Language.

       As a result of the overall progress in the field, the time has  =

come to move from basic preliminary research to actual applications in  =

real-world NLP tasks. Following this trend, the LREC-MWE'08 focused on  =

gathering resources and creating a common repository in order to rank  =

MWE candidates and facilitate further research.

Call for papers

       In MWE'09 we are interested in the overall process of dealing  =

with MWEs, asking for original research related (but not limited) to  =

the following four fundamental topics.

       Workshop topics
             (1) Identification. Identification is a major problem for  =

MWEs. The MWE identification task is to determine whether a MWE is  =

used non-compositionally (figuratively) or compositionally (literally)  =

in a particular context. The identification of MWEs by automated means  =

is a difficult task, as it does not suffice to store the MWE into a  =

dictionary database. Rule-based (morphosyntactic rules) and/or  =

statistical approaches may be needed to identify MWEs in context.

             (2) Interpretation. Semantic interpretation of MWEs,  =

particularly noun compounds and determinerless prepositional phrases,  =

is the task of determining the implicit semantic relation holding  =

between the MWE's sub-components. This specific area is inviting  =

research on (linguistically) identifying the semantic relations (SRs)  =

and automatic SR interpretation in MWEs. The relation inventories used  =

can be of different granularity and dependent on the particular type  =

of MWE construction. In some cases, MWE's semantics can be also  =

specified in terms of a suitable paraphrase.

             (3) Disambiguation. Disambiguation (Semantic  =

classification) is the task of specifying the semantics of MWEs based  =

on an inventory of semantic relations. It tends to presuppose the  =

ability to classify the (degree of) compositionality of MWEs and  =

applies only to compositional MWEs. The aim is to specify the  =

semantics of MWEs in terms of predefined semantic categories, e.g., in  =

WordNet.

             (4) Applications. Identifying MWEs in context and  =

understanding their syntax and semantics is important for many natural  =

language applications, including but not limited to question  =

answering, machine translation, information retrieval, information  =

extraction, and textual entailment. Still, despite the growing  =

research interest, there are not enough successful applications in  =

real NLP problems, which we believe is the key for the advancement of  =

the field.

       Submission information
             Submissions must describe substantial, original, and  =

unpublished work. Submissions will be judged on correctness,  =

originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the  =

conference, and interest to the attendees. Full papers may consist of  =

up to eight (8) pages in total (references icluded) and will be  =

presented orally. The deadline for paper submission is at 24:00 GMT on  =

May 4 2009.
             The official style files for ACL/IJCNLP 2009 are available at:
             http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/.
             The workshop submissions should use the same formatting  =

guidelines. As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include  =

the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that  =

reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,  =

1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith  =

previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to  =

these requirements will be rejected without review.
             Submission is electronic using paper submission software at:
             https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/papers

Length and Format of Workshop

       The desirable duration of the workshop is one full day. Each  =

session will consist of three slots for original papers; the  =

presentations will be categorized in one of the three sessions  =

according to their topic. Each speaker will be given 20 minutes for  =

the presentation and 5 minutes for questions. Each session will  =

conclude with a 15 minute discussion on important issues brought up by  =

the presentations or concerning the session's theme.

       At the end of the workshop, we will have one hour of general  =

discussion and closing remarks. In this hour, the participants will  =

have the opportunity to elaborate on general questions related both to  =

the topics of the workshop's sessions, the current state of research  =

on MWEs and future prospects.
