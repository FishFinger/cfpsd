Meeting Description:

Conference on Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory: 75 years of
Linguistics at SOAS, 5 years of the Endangered Languages Project

This conference commemorates both the 75 year tradition of linguistics within
SOAS and the 5th anniversary of the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project by
investigating the relationship between language documentation and linguistic
theory. 

Call for Papers:

In 2007 the Department of Linguistics at School of Oriental and African Studies
celebrates its 75th anniversary. Founded in 1932 as the first department of
general linguistics in Britain, the research carried out by linguistics within
the department has made a significant and lasting impact on the fields of
language documentation and description and linguistic theory.

This conference commemorates both the 75 year tradition of linguistics within
the School and the 5th anniversary of the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages
Project, comprising the Endangered Languages Academic Programme (ELAP), the
Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR), and the Endangered Languages Documentation
Programme (ELDP).

The conference aims to bring together researchers working on linguistic theory
and language documentation and description, with a particular focus on
innovative work on underdescribed or endangered languages, especially those of
Asia and Africa. Our goal is to provide a forum to discuss the ways that
linguists and others, especially community members, can respond to the current
challenges to linguistic diversity and build on experiences of the past.

Themes:

1. implications of language documentation and description for linguistic theory
2. implications of linguistic theory for language documentation and description
3. experiences of language documentation and description and linguistic theory
at SOAS
4. new techniques and opportunities for documenting and describing languages
5. community-oriented outcomes of endangered languages research

Abstracts:

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion) on any
of the themes identified above. Submissions are limited to one individual and
one joint abstract per author.

Abstracts should take the form of a PDF document, submitted by email and limited

references, and a further one page of examples and data. Any non-standard fonts
should be embedded in the PDF document. Authors should submit two versions of
their abstract, one with their name and affiliation included and a second
