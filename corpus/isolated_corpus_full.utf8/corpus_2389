Meeting Description:
A conference on theoretical and experimental issues in prosody. This conference
brings together researchers working on prosody from different fields, including
phonetics, phonology, language processing, neurolinguistics, and computational
linguistics. 

This is the final call for the conference on Experimental and Theoretical
Advances in Prosody, to be held at Cornell University, April 11-13 2008.

Recent developments in language research have increasingly put the spotlight on
prosody, e.g. the intonational, rhythmic, and phrasing of natural language. An
improved understanding of prosody and parsing of natural speech is important not
only for a better understanding of human speech processing but also for
automatic speech recognition and synthesis. Leading research questions include:
What type of information about syntax, semantics, and context is reflected in
prosody? How much of that information can a listener retrieve from the signal?
How does this information facilitate language processing in online
conversations? What do disfluencies and pauses in production reveal about the
cognitive processes involved in planning and producing prosodic structure? How
incremental is the planning and production of prosody, and what does it reveal
about incremental speech production more generally?

This conference is intended as a venue for exchanging ideas and methodologies,
for learning about different perspectives, and most importantly, for stimulating
discussion and inspiring new ideas, projects, and collaborations beyond the
trodden paths. The conference will consist of spoken paper presentations and a
poster session, both of which will cover experimental and theoretical topics in
prosody. Papers and posters will be selected from submitted abstracts, and
additional presentations will be made by invited speakers. The results of the
conference will be published in a special issue of the journal Language and
Cognitive Processes.

Student Travel Stipends:
There will be 20 travel stipends for student participants for up to $300.
Preference will be given to presenters. Information about how to apply for a
travel stipend will be posted on the conference website.

Invited Speakers:
Katy Carlson, Jennifer Cole, Laura Dilley, Dan Jurafsky, Janet Fodor, Shari
Speer, Mark Steedman, Karsten Steinhauer, Sun-Ah Jun, Mats Rooth, and Elisabeth
Selkirk

Submission Deadline: Friday, January 18, 2008
Submissions for all presentations must be submitted by this date. Notifications
regarding acceptance/rejection will be made in late February.

Abstract Guidelines:
Submissions for both posters and presentations must be made as abstracts.
Abstracts must not exceed 500 words. Fifteen lines, which are not included in
the word count, may be used to present examples and references. Abstracts must
be submitted via the conference website: http://phonetics.cornell.edu/prosody08

The conference is co-organized by Michael Wagner (Cornell University), Duane
Watson (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) and Ted Gibson
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Questions can be directed at
prosody08@gmail.com or directly at the conference organizers.

Conference Support:
Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Prosody is supported by National
Science Foundation Grant No. 0642660, by the Cognitive Science program at
Cornell University, and by the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this
material are those of the organizers and do not necessarily reflect the views of
