Full Title: Current Issues in Language Planning 


Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 25-Oct-2009 

CILP is announcing a Call for Papers for a forthcoming issue on 'Language
Planning from Below'.

In standard accounts of language policy and language planning, language
users are too often viewed as the passive receivers of linguistic decisions
taken at the highest levels of state organisation. In this context we shall
explore the concept subalternity which involves, rather than excludes,
agency. Through their everyday language practices and their discursive
perceptions and interpretations of linguistic realities, those who are
supposed to live the language policies never submissively implement them,
but, appropriating them, steer them in novel, unforeseen directions. It is
these dialectic processes of interaction between what is designed from
above and how it is responded to from below which give shape to societies'
overall patterns of multilingualism. 

We invite papers which aim at shedding light on these dialectical
processes, or on component aspects of it, from a large variety of
perspectives and without restrictions as to areal scope. Some key questions
related to the theme include but are not restricted to: 

-	How are language policies experienced by language users? 
-	How are they responded and reacted to? 
-	How and why do certain language policies work whilst others don't? 
-	How do top-down language policy processes measure up to changing
sociolinguistic realities?
-	How useful are language policies in empowering people and improving their
lives? 
-	How do language users' actions produce and reproduce, from the bottom up,
larger sociolinguistic structures and patterns of multilingualism, both in
time and in space? 

The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 25 October 2009.
The deadline for receipt of final papers is 15 January 2010.

Please send abstracts (approx. 250-300 words) to Dr Gabrielle Hogan-Brun
G.Hogan-Brun@bristol.ac.uk
