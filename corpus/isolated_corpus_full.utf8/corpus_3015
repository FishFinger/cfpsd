Full Title: Workshop on Transitivity 
Short Title: WS transitivity 

Date: 14-Nov-2008 - 15-Nov-2008
Location: Cologne, Germany 
Contact Person: Marco García García
Meeting Email: zsm-trans@uni-koeln.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

The center Sprachenvielfalt und Mehrsprachigkeit ('Language Diversity and
Multilingualism') at the University of Cologne organizes a Workhop on
Transitivity on November 14th - 15th. 

Second Call for Papers

The concept of 'transitivity' appears to be as central to the description of
natural language phenomena as it is elusive.
 
Traditionally, transitive structures have been conceived of as asymmetric
relations between distinguished participants. Accordingly, factors that would
seem relevant for the description of transitivity phenomena are limited prima
facie to (a) the nature of the expressed relation and/or (b) the individuating
properties of the participants that are related. Emphasizing the relational
level (a), the line of research instigated in Dowty (1991) seeks to derive the
distinction between agent and patient as well as their canonical grammatical
encoding from the relative prominence of the individuals at different levels of
predicate decomposition (causality, volitionality, movement etc.). 
 
Emphasizing the individual level (b), the tradition following Comrie (1979,
1989) seeks to derive transitivity effects like (differential) case marking from
the individuating properties (animacy, definiteness) of the participants that
stand in a primitive opposition between agent and patient. Heterogenous
approaches in the tradition of Hopper and Thompson (1980) postulate factors at
the individuating level (animacy, definiteness, countability) as well as the
relational level (kinesis, gradual affectedness, agentivity) in order to explain
transitivity phenomena, and furthermore rely on factors at the sentence and the
discourse level (mood and aspect, fore-/backgrounding). 
Workshop presentations should focus on complexes like the following: 

- New or neglected observations concerning correlations between the syntax and
semantics/pragmatics of (in)transitive structures 
- The identification of factors that are relevant for transitivity effects and
their independence of or dependence on each other (e.g., dative and/or
differential case marking) 
- The conditions for, and the effects of 'detransitivizing' grammatical
processes ((anti-)passive, middle, argument incorporation)
- Evidence for/against the 'prototransitivity' of allegedly intransitive
structures (cf. Hale and Keyser 1993) 
- Generalizations related to transitivity that lie outside the verbal domain, as
well as, more generally, the status of transitivity in the grammar 

Contributions addressing the differing expressions of transitivity across
languages or taking an otherwise crosslinguistic perspective are particularly
welcome. Talks can be given in German or English; we schedule an hour for each
contribution, including discussion. We will seek to partially reimburse younger
researchers.  

Please send an anonymous abstract with the subject line 'WS transitivity' to
zsm-trans@uni-koeln.de. The abstract should be maximally one page, pdf-format.
Please include your name(s) and affiliation(s) in the text body of the email. 

The deadline for abstract submission is June 15th. Notification of acceptance by
July 15th.

Confirmed Speakers: 
Werner Abraham,

Contact Person: Roberval Teixeira e Silva
Meeting Email: robts@umac.mo

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Subject Language(s): Portuguese (por)

Call Deadline: 09-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

SLP5 - Português LE/L2 para Estudantes Asiáticos: Aspectos Formais e Pragmáticos
/ Portuguese as L2 for Asian Students: Formal and Pragmatic Aspects 

SLP5 - Português LE/L2 para Estudantes Asiáticos: Aspectos Formais e Pragmáticos
Coordenador: Roberval Teixeira e Silva (Universidade de Macau) - robts@umac.mo
Vice-coordenadores: Custódio Cavaco Martins (Universidade de Macau) -
fshcm@umac.mo   
Ana Paula Cleto Godinho (Universidade de Macau) - paulacletogodinho@gmail.com 


O simpósio tem por objetivo levantar e discutir aspectos pertinentes ao processo
de aprendizagem/aquisição da língua portuguesa como segunda língua/língua
estrangeira por estudantes asiáticos. A distância entre a língua e cultura
lusófonas de muitas línguas e culturas asiáticas coloca uma série de questões
interessantes para lingüistas dedicados à pesquisa do processo de aprendizagem
de aspectos formais e pragmáticos em PLE/PL2. Nesse sentido, propomos abrir um
espaço para investigações que focalizem tanto a fonologia, a morfossintaxe e o
léxico quanto as relações entre língua, cultura e interação em sala de aula.


The Symposium aims at discussing relevant issues for the learning/acquisition
process of Portuguese as L2 by Asian students in the following areas: culture
and interaction in the classroom, phonology, morphosyntax or the lexicon in a
multiple theoretical framework.
