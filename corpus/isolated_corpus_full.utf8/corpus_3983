Corpus Linguistics Conference 2009

University of Liverpool, UK 

 

http://liv.ac.uk/english/CL2009/index.htm

Second Call for Papers 

Following the success of CL2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007, the Fifth Corpus
Linguistics Conference will take place from 20 July - 23 July 2009.

It will be organised by the Universities of Liverpool, Birmingham and
Lancaster and will be hosted by the School of English, University of
Liverpool.

We are looking forward to an interesting programme and invite
abstracts for papers, posters, work-in-progress reports, as well as
workshops and colloquia covering any aspect of corpus linguistics. The
conference begins with a workshop and colloquium day on Monday 20
July; the main conference runs from Tuesday 21 to Thursday 23 July,
with the conference dinner on Wednesday 22 July.

Plenary Speakers: 

Svenja Adolphs (University of Nottingham) 

Douglas Biber (Northern Arizona University) 

Michael Hoey (University of Liverpool) 

Joybrato Mukherjee (University of Giessen) 

Mike Scott (University of Liverpool) 

We invite 5 categories of abstracts:  

PAPERS will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for
questions. Paper abstracts should be between 300 and 500 words
(excluding word count for references).

WORK-IN-PROGRESS REPORTS will be 10 minutes plus 5 minutes for
questions. Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words (excluding
word count for references).

POSTER abstracts should be no more than 200 words (excluding word
count for references).

COLLOQUIA usually take the form of between 4 and 8 papers, with time
for audience discussion. We will accommodate short colloquia (2 hours,
about 4 speakers) and longer colloquia (4 hours, about 8
speakers). Proposals should be no more than 1000 words (for colloquia
of 2 hours) or 2000 words (for colloquia of 4 hours). The proposal
should include a rationale for the colloquium, an indication of how
much of the time will be allocated to audience discussion, and an
abstract for each of the proposed papers.

WORKSHOPS usually include one or two short presentations and
substantial audience participation. Workshops can take 1 or 2
hours. Proposals should be no more than 500 words (for a 1-hour
workshop) or 750 words (for a 2-hour workshop) and should describe the
organisation of the workshop and the nature of the audience
participation. Additionally, information on technical requirements
should be provided.

For colloquia and workshops we would encourage you to contact us ahead
of the deadline if you have any questions.

The language of the conference is English. All abstracts should be in
English, though we encourage proposals for colloquia to be given in
languages other than English.
