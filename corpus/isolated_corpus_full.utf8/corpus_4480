http://www.servicescongress.org
July 6-10, 2009, Los Angeles, California, USA

Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC), IEEE C=
omputer Society and Services Society (approval pending)


The theme of the 2009 IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2009) is "moderni=
zation of the services industry". SERVICES 2009 supports and further explor=
es the science and technology of modernizing services industries using late=
st methods and technologies such as Services Computing, which has been form=
ally promoted by IEEE Computer Society since 2003. From a technology perspe=
ctive, Services Computing has become the foundational discipline for modern=
izing the services industry.

The first Joint Conference on SERVICES includes the 2005 International Conf=
erence on Web Services (ICWS 2005) and the 2005 International Conference on=
 Services Computing (SCC 2005), which were held in July 2005 in Orlando, Fl=
orida, USA. The second Joint Conference on SERVICES includes the 2006 Inter=
national Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2006) and the 2006 International =
Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2006), which were held in September 2=
006 in Chicago, IL, USA.

In 2007, the joint conference on Services formally became the 2007 IEEE Con=
gress on Services (SERVICES 2007), which was held in July 2007 in Salt Lake=
 City, Utah, USA. The 2008 IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2008) was co=
-located with the 2008 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC =
2008) in July 2008 in Hololulu, Hawaii, USA. The Third Congress on Services=
 (SERVICES 2008 Part II) was co-located with the 2008 IEEE International Co=
nference on Web Services (ICWS 2008) in September 2009 in Beijing, China.

In 2009, The Fourth IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2009) goes beyond t=
he IT community. SERVICES 2009 tries to attract researchers, practitioners,=
 and industry business leaders in all the following services sectors to hel=
p define and shape the modernization strategy and directions of the service=
s industry.  You are invited to submit research, engineering, and business =
innovation papers to the following services sub-sectors:

Paper Review Policy
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
SERVICES 2009's Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat =
the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be dis=
closed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access=
 to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special kno=
wledge, which that access providers. Contents of abstracts submitted to con=
ference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and ha=
ndled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure th=
at referees adhere to this practice.
