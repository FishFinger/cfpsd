*LREC 2010 - 7th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation*

*FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS*

MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE CENTRE, VALLETTA - MALTA

MAIN CONFERENCE: 19-20-21 MAY 2010
WORKSHOPS and TUTORIALS: 17-18 MAY and 22-23 MAY 2010

Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2010/


The seventh international conference on Language Resources and
Evaluation (LREC) will be organised in 2010 by ELRA in cooperation
with a wide range of international associations and organisations.


*CONFERENCE AIMS*

In 12 years -- the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 -- LREC has
become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for
Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an
overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and
emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their
applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned
activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the
e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and
organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding
agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and
opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for
international cooperation, in support to investigations in language
sciences, progress in language technologies and development of
corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.


*Special Highlight: Contribute to building the LREC2010 Map!*

LREC2010 recognises that time is ripe to launch an important
initiative, the *LREC2010 Map of Language Resources, Technologies and
Evaluation*.  The Map will be a collective enterprise of the LREC
community, as a first step towards the creation of a very broad,
community-built, Open Resource Infrastructure. As first in a series,
it will become an essential instrument to monitor the field and to
identify shifts in the production, use and evaluation of LRs and LTs
over the years.

When submitting a paper, from the START page you will be asked to fill
in a very simple template to provide essential information about
resources (in a broad sense that includes technologies, standards,
evaluation kits, etc.) that either have been used for the work
described in the paper or are a new result of your research.

The Map will be disclosed at LREC, where some event(s) will be
organised around this initiative.


*CONFERENCE TOPICS*

*Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources
(LRs): text, speech, other associated media and modalities*

. Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices
  for LRs

. Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation

. Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of
  knowledge

. Ontologies and knowledge representation

. Terminology

. Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web
  technologies

. Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content
  markup

. Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs

*Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications *

. For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech
  dictation, mobile communication, machine translation, summarisation,
  semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.

. In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems,
  natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice
  activated services, cognitive systems, etc.

. Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g.
  e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile
  applications, etc.

. Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

*Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation*

. HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures

. Benchmarking of systems and products

. Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces (speech-based, 

  text-based, multimodal-based, etc.), interactions and dialogue
  systems

. Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

*General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation*

. National and international activities and projects

. Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international
  policies for LRs

. Open architectures

. Organisational, economical and legal issues


*PROGRAMME*

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral
presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels.
There is no difference in quality between oral and poster
presentations.  Only the appropriateness of the type of communication
(more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be
considered.


*SUBMISSIONS AND DATES*

Submitted abstracts of papers for oral and poster or demo
presentations should consist of about 1500-2000 words.

. Submission of proposals for oral and poster/demo papers: 31 October
  2009

Proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials will be reviewed by the
Programme Committee.

. Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: 31
  October 2009


*PROCEEDINGS*

The Proceedings on CD will include both oral and poster papers, in the
same format. They will be added to the ELRA web archives before the
conference.
A Book of Abstracts will be printed.
