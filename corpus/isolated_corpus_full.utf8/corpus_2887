Call for Papers

Umlaut in West Germanic Dialects

We welcome papers on all aspects of this phenomenon, but we are particularly interested in those aspects that have a bearing on theoretical issues, be it in the domain of either phonology, morphology or syntax, such as:  
- what is the representation of umlaut, feature-wise and process-wise?
- what is the trigger of the process of umlaut?
- how does umlaut interfere with prosodic structure?
- how does umlaut interfere with segmental structure?
- how can umlaut as a morphological process be accounted for? 
- how does umlaut interact with morphosyntax? 
These issues can be discussed from a historical and/or a synchronic dialectological perspective.
The presentations will be allotted 30 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion.

Call for Papers

English and Asia: First International Conference 2008 on Language and Linguistics 

Dates: November 24 - 28, 2008
Place: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  (IIUM & The Crown Princess Hotel)
Organiser: Department of English Language and Literature International Islamic University Malaysia

Overview
English has become the main language of study and communication in many countries in Asia as a result of centuries of British colonialism leading to what appears at times to be a tug of war of roles between English and the vernaculars in the educational, cultural, and economic development of the countries in the region, and the (re)constructions of their identities and ideologies, while preserving the old ones. Even today, the relationship between English and Asia remains equally problematic and ambiguous and is changing in all spheres--economical, technological, academic, social, political. Language unites and divides populations depending on the role it carries within a country. This and other issues deserve to be discussed and explored in a conference that would bring together not just professionals and students in language and linguistics, but also researchers from other disciplines and interested parties from business and industry. 
Papers are invited from all those interested on the major theme of the conference, which may be theoretical, experimental or reflective. 

Topics may cover all areas of linguistics and others such as the following:

Varieties of Asian Englishes			
English and Asian cultures
History of English in Asia		            
Asian Literatures in English 
English as a Second Language		
English in the Asian Classroom

Dr. Mahathir Mohamad (VIP Speaker)
Prof. Richard Young (USA)
