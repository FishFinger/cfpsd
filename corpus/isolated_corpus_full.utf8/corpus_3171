First International Symposium on
 Multimedia =96 Applications and Processing, MMAP 2008,
www.mmap.imcsit.org
 Organized by:

Software Engineering Department, Faculty of Automation, Computers and
Electronics, University of Craiova, Romania
 "Multimedia Applications Development" Research Centre
 Contact: burdescu_dumitru@software.ucv.ro

within the framework

International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technolog=
y
in Wisla, Poland, 20 =96 22 October

2008


* CONFERENCE BACKGROUND AND GOALS

Recent advances in pervasive computers, networks, telecommunications, and
information technology, along with the proliferation of multimedia mobile
devices - such as laptops, iPods, personal digital assistants (PDA), and
cellular telephones - have stimulated the development of intelligent
pervasive multimedia applications. These key technologies are creating a
multimedia revolution that will have significant impact across a wide
spectrum of consumer, business, healthcare, and governmental domains. Yet
many challenges remain, especially when it comes to efficiently indexing,
mining, querying, searching, and retrieving multimedia data.
The Multimedia - Processing and Applications 2008 (MMAP 2008) Symposium
addresses several themes related to theory and practice within multimedia
domain. The enormous interest in multimedia from many activity areas
(medicine,
entertainment, education) led researchers and industry to make a continuous
effort to create new, innovative multimedia algorithms and application.
As a result the conference goal is to bring together researchers, engineers
and practitioners in order to communicate their newest and original
contributions on topics that have been identified (see below). We are also
interested in looking at service architectures, protocols, and standards
for multimedia communications - including middleware - along with the
related
security issues, such as secure multimedia information sharing. Finally, we
encourage submissions describing work on novel applications that exploit th=
e

unique set of advantages offered by multimedia computing techniques,
including
home-networked entertainment and games. However, innovative contributions
that
don't fit into these areas will also be considered because they might be of
benefit to conference attendees.

* CALL FOR PAPERS

MMAP 2008 is a major forum for researchers and practitioners from academia,
industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that
address
real-world problems with real-world solutions.
The MMAP 2008 Symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning
all
aspects of multimedia domain ranging from concepts and theoretical
developments
to advanced technologies and innovative applications. MMAP 2008 invites
original
previously unpublished contributions that are not submitted concurrently to
a
journal or another conference.
Papers acceptance and publication will be judged based on their relevance t=
o

the symposium theme, clarity of presentation, originality and accuracy of
results and proposed solutions.


* TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest are related to Multimedia Processing and Applications
including, but are not limited to the following areas:

Image and Video Processing
Speech, Audio and Music Processing
3D and Stereo Imaging
Distributed Multimedia Systems
Multimedia Databases, Indexing, Recognition and Retrieval
Data Mining
Multimedia in E-Learning, E-Commerce and E-Society Applications
Multimedia in Medical Applications
Multimedia Authentication and Watermarking
Entertainment and games
Multimedia Interfaces

* PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
=95 Papers will be refereed and accepted on the basis of their scientific
merit and relevance to the symposium. All submissions are subject to a blin=
d

refereeing process.
=95 Accepted and Presented papers will be published as paper in the Confere=
nce

Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore(R) database.
=95 Extended versions of selected best papers will be published in a specia=
l
issue of JDIM: Journal of Digital Information Management   ISSN 0972-7272.
=95 Authors should submit draft papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).
=95 The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style). IEE=
E
style templates are available.

* IMPORTANT DATES

 30.06.2008 - Full paper submission

 28.07.2008 - Notification of acceptance

 01.09.2008 - Camera-ready version of the accepted paper

 Symposium: October 20 - 22, 2008
