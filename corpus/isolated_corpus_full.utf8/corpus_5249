SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
***EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: May 15, 2009***

PRODUCTION OF REFERRING EXPRESSIONS (PRE-CogSci 2009):
Bridging the gap between computational and empirical approaches to referenc=
e
(29 July 2009, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)

http://pre2009.uvt.nl/

Extended deadline for abstract submission: May 15, 2009

PRE-CogSci 2009 is organized as part of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive=
 Science Society (CogSci 2009 <http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conferenc=
e2009/>)

Invited speakers are:

- Deb Roy (MIT, USA)
- William S. Horton (Northwestern University, USA)

There is a long research tradition of work on the production of referring e=
xpressions, in the area of computational linguistics as well as in psycholi=
nguistics and cognitive science. This encompasses work on definite descript=
ions, deictic expressions, anaphora, and many other topics. Both research t=
raditions have resulted in many interesting findings, but so far the intera=
ction between these two traditions has been very limited. We believe that m=
uch is to be gained from more interaction, for both research traditions inv=
olved.

This workshop aims to bring together --for the first time-- psycholinguists=
 with an interest in computational modeling and computational linguists wit=
h an interest in human speech production. In addition, the workshop is expe=
cted to be of interest to theoretical linguists whose work borders on other=
 areas of cognitive science, particularly those with an interest in discour=
se structure, and those interested in models of human language that are gro=
unded in cognitive principles.

The workshop will open with a short introductory talk about the production =
or referring expressions, to make the workshop broadly accessible. The rest=
 of the day will consist of a mixture of regular 20 minute talks, poster pr=
esentations and two invited talks by renowned experts in the field.

We received financial support from The Netherlands Organization for Scienti=
fic Research (NWO), via the Vici project "Bridging the gap between computat=
ional linguistics and psycholinguistics: The case of referring expressions"=
 (Krahmer; 277-70-007), which is gratefully acknowledged.

We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!

CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics =
related to the production of referring expressions. Contributions may focus=
 on computational or experimental approaches to reference, with combination=
s of the two especially appreciated. Note that we particularly welcome new =
results, but given the purpose of the workshop, papers that present an orig=
inal overview of previously published work tailored to this workshop may al=
so be acceptable.

Topics of interest include computational and/or experimental approaches to:
- different kinds of referring expressions; when are which types of referen=
ce (pronouns, descriptions, etc.) most appropriate?
- plural and quantified references
- vagueness: the use of vague (e.g. gradable) predicates in referring expre=
ssions
- referential overspecification: why and how do speakers overspecify?
- referential underspecification: production of descriptions which do not u=
niquely identify a referent
- referring expressions in interactive settings; audience design, adaptatio=
n and alignment
- ambiguity avoidance in references
- common ground, cooperativeness and shared/private information in referenc=
e
- realization of referring expressions (including speech and gesture)
- visual scene perception and its influence on the production of referring =
expressions
- social and contextual factors in reference
- data-collection and experimental evaluation methods

Extended abstract submission:
Paper selection will be based on extended abstracts (max 2000 words). The o=
nly accepted format for submitted abstracts is Adobe PDF. Abstracts should =
be sent to k.vdeemter@abdn.ac.uk.

Final submission:
Upon acceptance, authors are invited to prepare a 4-6 page paper using the =
COGSCI author kit (http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference2009/submis=
sions.html). Final versions need to be submitted as pdf. Papers will be pub=
lished in on line proceedings, and the authors retain the copyrights. Final=
 versions of accepted papers should be sent to k.vdeemter@abdn.ac.uk.

Special Issue
We hope to edit a special issue based on the workshop results. More informa=
tion about this will follow.

If authors have any questions, they should contact the workshop organizers.
