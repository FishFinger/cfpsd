*LREC 2008 -  6th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference*

* SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS*

 

Palais des Congr√®s Mansour Eddahbi, MARRAKECH - MOROCCO

MAIN CONFERENCE: 28-29-30 MAY 2008

WORKSHOPS and TUTORIALS: 26-27 MAY and 31 MAY- 1 JUNE 2008
Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/  

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and
Evaluation (LREC) will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation
with a wide range of international associations and organisations,
including AAMT, AMTA, ACL, ALTA, COCOSDA and Oriental COCOSDA, EACL,
EAMT, ELSNET, EURALEX, GWA, IAMT, KnowledgeWeb, LDC, NEMLAR Network,
SIGLEX, TEI, Technolangue French Program, WRITE and with major
national and international organisations including the European
Commission - Information Society and Media, Unit E.2 "Content and
Knowledge".

 

*CONFERENCE AIMS*

In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has
become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for
Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an
overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and
emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their
applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned
activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the
e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and
organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding
agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and
opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for
international cooperation, in support to investigations in language
sciences, progress in language technologies and development of
corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

 
*CONFERENCE TOPICS*

 Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources
(LRs): text, speech, multimodality

 
- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for
  LRs

- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation

- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of
  knowledge

- Ontologies and knowledge representation

- Terminology

- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web
  technologies

- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content
  markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications

 

- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech
dictation, mobile communication, machine translation, summarisation,
web services, semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning,
etc.

- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems,
natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice
activated services, etc.

- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g.
e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile
applications, etc.

- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

 

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation

- HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures

- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs

- Benchmarking of systems and products

- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and
dialogue systems

- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

 

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

- National and international activities and projects

- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international
policies for LRs

- Open architectures

- Organisational, economical and legal issues

 

*_Special Highlights_*

 
LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken,
written, and other modalities - and of the respective communities. To
this end, LREC encourages submissions covering issues which are common
to different types of LRs and language technologies.

 
LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of
applications and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass
all those data that interact with language resources in an attempt to
model more complex human processes and develop more complex systems,
and encourages submissions on topics such as:

- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces,
Human-Human interactions, and content processing

- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes,
including emotions

- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for
robotic systems

 

 *PROGRAMME*

 
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral
presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels.
*There is no difference in quality between oral and poster
presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication
(more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be
considered.*

 

*ABSTRACT SUBMISSION*

 

On-line submission form for abstracts is now available: please go to
the "Abstract submission" section on the LREC2008 web site

procedure instructions.

Submitted abstracts of papers for oral and poster or demo
presentations *must* consist of about 1500-2000 words.
