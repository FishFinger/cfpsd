PuFIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
 
Interspeech-09 Satellite Workshop

âComputational Models of Language Evolution, Acquisition and Processingâ

Brighton, 11 September 2009
 
SCOPE:
The workshop aims to bring together researchers from all disciplines
involved in computational modeling of language evolution, acquisition
and processing. The basic idea is that adult language processing cannot
be understood in full, and that methods for automatic processing will
not reach human-like performance, unless we understand how infants
acquire language and communication skills and how language is
represented in the brain. In turn, we may not be able to understand
language acquisition if we do not understand how the language faculty in
man came about in the first place.
 
ORGANISATION:
The workshop will take a full day, and feature two keynote
presentations, plus submitted papers, which will be presented in oral
lectures or posters.
The first keynote speaker will be Friedemann Pulvermuller, MRC Cognition
and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge.
The second keynote speaker will present the Future and Emerging
Technologies project ACORNS (http://www.acorns-project.org)
 
TOPICS:
The workshop focuses on
 
1.    Computational models of language evolution and acquisition
2.    Behavioral studies of language acquisition
3.    Models and algorithms for discovering structure in auditory and
visual input
4.    Models and algorithms for unsupervised learning
5.    Representations of speech in the auditory system and auditory cortex
 
PAPER SUBMISSION:
The format of the papers will be identical to the Interspeech-2009 format.
 
All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed in a process that will be
coordinated with the Interspeech-2009 organisation.
Accepted papers will be included in Workshop Proceedings, and will be
made available after the Workshop through the ISCA Archive.
Details about the Paper submission procedure will be published in due time.
 
IMPORTANT DATES:
 
Paper submission deadline:                April 20, 2009
Acceptance notification date:             June 15, 2009
Camera-ready due:                           July 31, 2009
Workshop date:                                September 11, 2009
