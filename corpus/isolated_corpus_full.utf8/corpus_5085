Call for Papers
?Usability Aspects of Hypermedia Systems?
Workshop of the GSCL Working Group on Hypermedia

Date: October 1st, 2009, 13:30-17:00h
Location: University of Potsdam/Germany
Registration: Attendees of the workshop must only register for the  =

main conference.
Keynote speaker: tba.

The workshop is organized as part of this year?s Conference of the  =

German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology  =

(GSCL), hosted by the Applied Computational Linguistics group in the  =

Department of Linguistics at Potsdam University. The GLDV Working  =

Group on Hypermedia is offering a one-day workshop dedicated to  =

usability aspects for hypermedia systems and applications in the  =

E-Humanities (corpus retrieval frontends, web information systems,  =

community grids etc.).

Suggested topics include but are not limited to:
-	Web design and usability in the E-Humanities: Context,  =

productivity/performance, and acceptance
-	(Multimodal) reception research: Methods and test procedures
-	Visualization, navigation, and orientation in complex information systems
-	Interactive and collaborative aspects of hypermedia systems
-	Standards and guidelines on software ergonomics, user-oriented  =

design, and accessibility

Since Jakob Nielsen pointed out the main criteria for user-friendly  =

hypermedia systems - Easy to learn, efficient to use, easy to  =

remember, few errors, pleasant to use ? in the mid-nineties, usability  =

research is engaged in the statistical investigation and empiric  =

validation of ranking methods. One goal is the improvement of  =

usability on the internet, currently focusing on up-to-date topics  =

like Web 2.0 and multimodal interfaces.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum for researchers and  =

practitioners interested in hypermedia systems in the context of  =

natural language processing. By offering paper presentations (30 min.)  =

and discussion panels, we hope to stimulate and facilitate an active  =

exchange on unique and interdisciplinary ideas, practices, and methods.

The workshop features English or German paper presentations and  =

extended demos. Authors are invited to send abstracts which may not  =

exceed two pages of text. All submissions will be  peer-reviewed  =

(please place author?s name and affiliation on a separate page for  =

anonymous review). The final papers are limited to 12 pages, including  =

figures and literature. They will appear in a special issue of ?SDV ?  =

Sprache und Datenverarbeitung/International Journal for Language Data  =

Processing?.

Important dates:
-	Submission of abstracts: June 30th, 2009
-	Notification of acceptance: July 31st, 2009
-	Final paper submission: September 4th, 2009
