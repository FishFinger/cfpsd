Descriptions
---------------
Semantic Web Technologies provide concepts, architectures, and tools
for interconnected vocabularies and applications. One of the declared
goals of Semantic Web research is to enable intelligent software
agents to reason about information and knowledge which is pervaded on
the Web. To achieve this goal, a challenging and important problem is
to represent commonsense knowledge on the Web and to reason with it.
Indeed, commonsense reasoning is a central part of human behaviour,
and how to endow computers with common sense capabilities is one of
the major long-term goals of Artificial Intelligence research and is
therefore also relevant to the realization of the ambitious Semantic
Web vision. At the same time, the forthcoming Semantic Web constitutes
an ideal application scenario for formal logic and traditional
commonsense reasoning approaches. In recent years, there is a
substantially increasing interest in applying theoretical approaches
of commonsense reasoning to deal with practical application problems
in the Semantic Web. It is indeed widely accepted that extensions of
commonsense reasoning to the Semantic Web will have to be provided in
the near future. In this special issue we intend to publish articles
discussing commonsense reasoning aspects on the Web. Submissions
describing original and solid theoretical contributions to commonsense
reasoning with application to the Semantic web are especially
encouraged.

Topics of Interest
------------------
We encourage original and high quality work on all topics related to
commonsense reasoning for the Semantic Web. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:
-reasoning about change and dynamics of ontologies, including ontology
integration, ontology evolution, revision and update of ontologies in
the Semantic Web

-nonmonotonic extensions of ontology languages, including
circumscriptive, default,  defeasible logic, diagnosis, and
autoepistemic approaches
-temporal and spatial extensions of ontology languages
-planning and action in the Semantic Web and Semantic Web services
-combining modal logics and description logics
-commonsense knowledge acquisition from the (Semantic) Web
-integration of logic programming and description logics
-abductive reasoning in the Semantic Web
-extensions of ontology languages to enable uncertainty reasoning,
including fuzzy, probabilistic and possibilistic approaches
-contextualized, distributed, and modular ontology languages
-non-standard reasoning in description logics, such as computing least
common subsumer and matching.
-paraconsistent extension of ontology languages
-computational models of argumentation in the Semantic Web
-approximate reasoning and compilation in description logics
-scalability issues
-other mathematical tools for using commonsense reasoning on the Semantic W=
eb
