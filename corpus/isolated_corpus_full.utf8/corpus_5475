Meeting Description:

The graduate students of the Department of Childhood Studies at Rutgers
University, Camden invite submissions for papers and poster presentations
for their first formal graduate student conference on April 9, 2010.=20
Graduate students from all disciplines who are engaged in research relating
to children and childhood are encouraged to submit proposals.

The field of childhood studies engages in both theoretical and empirical
study of children and childhood within historical, contemporary,
interdisciplinary, multi-cultural, state, national, and global contexts.
Each combination of perspectives provides new insights into the lives of
children and the families, cultures, and societies in which they are
embedded. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is one of its greatest
strengths and the core of its remarkable potential for scholarly
advancement, but also leaves the field open for exploration and
interrogation, and its borders difficult, if not impossible, to define.=20

In an attempt to define this emerging and diverse field, the Exploring
Childhood Studies conference proposes defining Childhood Studies by "doing"
childhood studies; the conference will explore the field by offering
explorations within it. We seek papers from all disciplines that keep the
child, children, and childhood as their central focus, providing critical
thought and insight while locating them in different contexts, fields, and
ideologies.=20

In keeping with what we believe is the essential interdisciplinary nature
of Childhood Studies, this conference seeks to be interdisciplinary itself.
We seek proposals from all disciplines=97education, literature, economics,
psychology, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, law, political science,
history, criminology, philosophy, medicine, religion, film studies, and
cultural studies=97as well as interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary
scholarly work.=20

Home to the Department of Childhood Studies and The Center for Children and
Childhood Studies, Rutgers-Camden is a leader in the national and
international discourse on the state of children and childhood. We are very
proud of the fact that Rutgers-Camden is the first and only PhD-granting
Department of Childhood Studies in the nation, which has now entered its
third year. We look forward to introducing the larger academic community to
our fellow students, exemplary faculty and unique program, and to engaging
in vigorous and stimulating discussions with our peers throughout academia.

Call for Papers:

The range of open topics within this field is as broad as the contexts of
the experiences of children and childhood: war, health, rights, gender,
poverty, wealth, policy, ethics, popular culture, globalization, school,
family, home, sexuality, community, and representations in all modes of
fiction. The field of Childhood Studies itself is open to interrogation.=20

Selected papers will be grouped into panels that may be based around
discipline, theme, or perspective, but will demonstrate the common
grounding of the papers in their mutual exploration of children and
childhood studies.=20

Paper presentations should be limited to 20 minutes in length. Please send
250-word abstract for paper or poster presentation (specify which) and
cover letter with name, current level of graduate study, affiliated
university, and email address to m_modica@vfcc.edu.  Include the words
"conference abstract" in subject line, and include name on the cover letter
only.

For further information, contact: Patrick Cox at ptcox@camden.rutgers.edu
or Anandini Dar at anandini@camden.rutgers.edu.=20

Deadline for submission is October 31, 2009. Accepted presenters will
receive e-mail notification by January 10, 2010.
