DECALOG -- The 2007 Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue

         Università di Trento (Italy), May 30 -- June 1, 2007

          http://www.cimec.unitn.it/events/decalog/index.htm



      Deadline for receipt of papers for review: 18 February 2007



                         in conjunction with

   Inaugural Workshop of the Language, Interaction and Computation Lab,
                  Center For Mind / Brain Sciences (CiMeC)

                             May 29, 2007

Description

   The SEMDIAL series of workshops aim to bring together researchers
   working on the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such
   as artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, formal
   semantics/pragmatics, philosophy, psychology, and neural
   science. In 2007 we will celebrate ten years of the SEMDIAL series
   with the DECALOG workshop, organized at the Center for Mind/Brain
   Sciences, CIMeC (Centro Interdipartimentale Mente/Cervello), of the
   University of Trento in Rovereto. The SemDial workshops are always
   stimulating and fun, and Rovereto is a great place to visit.

   DECALOG will be held on May 30 -- June 1, 2007, in conjunction with
   the Inaugural Workshop of the Language, Interaction and Computation
   Lab of CIMeC on May 29. This one-day workshop will feature invited
   presentations by some of the leaders of the computational
   linguistics and human language technology community.

Invited Speakers

   For DECALOG 2007 (May 30 -- June 1)

      Bruno Bara (University of Torino)
      Paul Piwek (Open University)
      Ipke Wachsmuth (University of Bielefeld)
      Possibly one more speaker to be confirmed

   For the Inaugural Workshop (May 29)

      Harald Baayen (Radboud University Nijmegen & Max Planck Institute
         for Psycholinguistics)
      Justine Cassell (Northwestern University)
      Terry Regier (University of Chicago)
      Steffen Staab (University of Koblenz-Landau)
      Mark Steedman (University of Edinburgh & University of Pennsylvania)
      Possibly one more speaker to be confirmed

Scope

   We invite papers on all topics related to the semantics and
   pragmatics of dialogues, including, but not limited to:

     - models of common ground/mutual belief in communication
     - modelling agents' information states and how they get updated
     - multi-agent models and turn-taking
     - goals, intentions and commitments in communication
     - semantic interpretation in dialogues
     - reference in dialogues
     - ellipsis resolution in dialogues
     - dialogue and discourse structure
     - interpretation of questions and answers
     - nonlinguistic interaction in communication
     - natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue
       systems
     - multimodal dialogue systems
     - dialogue management in practical implementations
     - categorisation of dialogue moves or speech acts in corpora
     - designing and evaluating dialogue systems

Submission

   Deadline for receipt of papers is 18 February 2007, 23:59 UTC.
   (Since we have to close the system manually, submissions will
   probably be accepted for a few hours after the deadline, but we're
   not making any promises.) Submit your paper via the web at

     http://www.easychair.org/DECALOG2007/

   Before submitting you must register with the website and receive a
   password by email; please do this well ahead of your submission,
   since email is sometimes unreliable. You will also need to fill out
   a web form with the author details and type in (or paste) a
   plain-text version of your abstract (200 words), in addition to
   uploading your paper.

   The actual paper should be an anonymous PDF file, 6 pages long
   (including data, tables, figures, and references), A4 paper size,
   11pt Times font, 2.5 cm (1 inch) margins, 2-column format. Include
   a one-paragraph abstract of the entire work (about 200 words). You
   may find it convenient to use the style files provided by
   COLING/ACL 2006.

   Multiple submissions by the same author or group of authors are
   allowed, but each person may only give one oral presentation at the
   workshop.

   We will have a separate submission of late-breaking system
   demonstrations and ongoing project descriptions, to be presented in
   a poster session during the workshop. Late-breaking submissions
   will be two pages long; they will not be refereed, but evaluated
   for relevance only by the program committee chairs. Submission of
   late-breaking abstracts will be allowed only after review of the
   main session papers has concluded. The deadline for late-breaking
   submissions is 15 April 2007.

Proceedings

   Final, 8-page versions of the accepted papers, together with the
   2-page accepted late breaking abstracts, will be distributed in a
   proceedings volume at the workshop.
