In Association with
6th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
LREC2008 http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/

Main conference 28-29-30 May 2008


The integration of ontologies and lexical resources can be seen as a new
route across which hybrid agents negotiate contents and exchange linguistic
and ontological aspects of knowledge in shared environments. In this
workshop we aim at investigating the role of ontolex resources across
developing ideas and practice of Web 3.0, the connection of Web 2.0 (the
=91social web=92) with the Semantic Web infrastructure of ontology-based
standards and technologies. =


The workshop will address the following specific topics of interest:
=95 Integrating multimedia into ontolex resources
=95 Cooperative construction of ontolex resources
=95 Linguistic interfaces for Semantic Web applications
=95 Exploiting ontolex resources in social networking =

=95 Web-Corpus linguistics for OntoLex Resource building

As well as the following general topics: =

=95 Ontology-driven meta-models for multilingual lexica
=95 Evaluation of ontolex resources in NLP tasks
=95 Evaluation of ontologies for building ontolex resources
=95 Ontology-driven annotation of corpora for ontology learning
=95 Design principles for the integrated representation of lexical and
ontological knowledge
=95 Open-source platforms for ontolex resources

Reasons of interest


The workshop is addressed to researchers and practitioners from a variety of
backgrounds =96 Semantic Web, AI, Machine Learning, NLP, Information Retrie=
val
=96 that are concerned with the representation and use of lexical knowledge=
 in
semantic annotation, ontology-based approaches to information extraction,
ontology learning, ontology matching, etc. Originating in 2000 from a
visionary initiative of Kiryakov and Simov, and =93historically=94 hosted by
LREC (2002-2004-2006), OntoLex has recently turned into a yearly workshop
(IJCNLP 2005, ISWC 2007) for a growing interdisciplinary community of
lexicographers, ontologists and computational linguists who recognize it de
facto as their common =91meeting room=92. This year=92s edition aims at rai=
sing
the issue of ontolex resources in Web 3.0 to foster the discussion about
next-generation ontolex tools, on the basis of state-of-the-art technologies
and ongoing projects within the LREC community.
