Meeting Description:

Morphological Variation and Change in Languages of the Caucasus 
Workshop at the 13th International Morphology Meeting
February 2008, Vienna, Austria
http://www.let.uu.nl/~nino.amiridze/personal/organization/mvclc.html 

Second Call for Abstracts: 

A great diversity of languages is spoken in the Caucasus, most of
which have rich inflectional systems, on the noun (e.g. North-East
Caucasian), on the verb (e.g. North-West Caucasian), or both (e.g.
South Caucasian).

The Caucasus offers rich material for studying genetically diverse
languages being in close contact for centuries, e.g. Georgian (South
Caucasian) with Abkhaz (North-West Caucasian); Ossetian
(Indo-European) and Batsbi (North-East Caucasian); Armenian
(Indo-European) with Azeri (Turkic); or Kumyk (Turkic) with major
North-East Caucasian languages of Daghestan; or, for a much shorter
period, the languages indigenous to the region being in contact with
the unrelated Russian and Turkish. While much is known about the
contemporary grammar of individual languages of the Caucasus, much
less can be said with regard to the various contact situations and
their impact on the morphosyntax of individual languages. Our
workshop aims to broaden the knowledge on this subject.

We invite researchers working on morphological variation and change
in the languages spoken in the Caucasus to submit abstracts for
participation in the workshop, planned to be held at the 13th
International Morphology Meeting. We would like to invite
contributions dealing with contact-induced morphological changes in
any language of the Caucasus region. This includes investigations of
changes driven by influence from any other language of the region,
irrespective of the genetic affiliation of the languages in contact.
Of great interest are not only inter-family, but also somewhat more
subtle intra-family contacts, such as contacts between various
North-East Caucasian languages spoken in adjacent areas or
neighboring villages. Contributions exploring morphological
variation and language-internal morphological changes are also
welcome.

Invited Speakers

    - Alice C. Harris. SUNY Stony Brook.
    - Johanna Nichols. University of California, Berkeley.
    - Vladimir Plungian. Russian Academy of Sciences.
