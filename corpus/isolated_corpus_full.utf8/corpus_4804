Call for Papers

CHINOSAT 2
Workshop on Chinese Grammar in Contrast: Syntax and Acquisition

Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway
1st - 2nd October 2009 

Invited Speakers:
Roger Hawkins, University of Essex
Thomas Hun-Tak Lee, Chinese University of Hong Kong
Joanna U.-S. Sio, Hong Kong Baptist University
Rint Sybesma, University of Leiden

This workshop is a forum to discuss aspects of Chinese grammar as they impinge
on the study of UG and contrastive grammar (especially Chinese-English and
Chinese-Scandinavian contrasts), and on language acquisition theory (especially
L2 and L3 acquisition). 

We seek contributions on 
- any aspect of the syntax of Chinese within a UG-based framework
(principles-and-parameters, minimalism etc) 
- comparison between Chinese and English or a Scandinavian (or other European)
language
- Chinese first language acquisition studies
- second & third language acquisition studies involving Chinese 

We are particularly interested in Mandarin Chinese but also welcome
contributions dealing with other Chinese languages (Cantonese, Hakka, etc).

Abstracts (1 page + extra page for data if required) should be sent to Chris Wilder 
email: christopher.wilder AT hf.ntnu.no
to arrive by Monday 15th June 2009. Those accepted will be notified by 31st July.

The workshop is partially funded by a grant from NTNU's strategic research area
"Globalization". It is organised as part of the CHINOSAT project ('Comparative
Chinese - Norwegian Syntax, including Acquisition Topics') at NTNU. The first
CHINOSAT workshop was held in April 2007.

The CHINOSAT project is concerned with comparative grammar (Mandarin Chinese vs.
Norwegian). It seeks to develop understanding of differences between the two
languages within a UG-based framework, thereby contributing both to typological
linguistic research and the theoretical investigation of UG. It also aims to
deploy this understanding in the study of acquisition, in particular to
penetrate problems of second and third language acquisition involving the two
languages as well as English as the global lingua franca.
