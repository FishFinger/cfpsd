Contact Person: Douglas H. Whalen
Meeting Email: ultrafest@haskins.yale.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics 

Call Deadline: 10-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Ultrafest meetings bring together researchers from around the world working on the use of ultrasound imaging to understand the complexity of tongue motion in speech production. Building on the success of the previous 4 meetings, this conference, at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, will address several themes:

1. Results on linguistic patterning of tongue motion
2. Methods of quantification of tongue shape and motion
3. Comparison of tongue images from ultrasound and MRI
4. Computational physical models of tongue motion
5. Tongue motion developments through the life span and in various dysfluencies

Two days will be devoted to presentations. A half-day session (19 March 2010) prior to the main meeting will be a hands-on introduction to several systems for ultrasound imaging of the tongue, allowing a direct comparison for those considering a new system or for those interested in evaluating their current system. 

Call for Papers:

This is a reminder that the deadline for submission of abstracts for Ultrafest V is Sept. 10th, 2009.

Abstracts should be 500 words or less and submitted in PDF format. You can only be first author on one submission. Please email abstracts to: ultrafest@haskins.yale.edu

Notifications will be made by Oct. 9th.

Also, if you would like to demonstrate your system in Friday's hands-on session, please let us know what the system is and how much space you would require.
