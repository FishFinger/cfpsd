Meeting Description:=20

The Institute of Linguistics in collaboration with the Department of Maltes=
e of the University of Malta is pleased to announce a call for participatio=
n in the International Programme in Maltese Linguistics to be held in Malta=
 from 22-31 March 2010. The programme was offered for the first time in the=
 summer of 2009, and, like the Summer School in Maltese Linguistics that ra=
n in June 2009, it is being organised through the Foundation for Internatio=
nal Studies ltd at the Old University in Valletta.  The programme comprises=
 lectures and seminars, as well as a number of visits to historical sites, =
some with linguistic interest, around Malta and Gozo. It will provide parti=
cipants with a unique opportunity to become acquainted with different aspec=
ts of the linguistic structure of Maltese. It is aimed primarily at linguis=
ts and students of linguistics but should also appeal to practitioners work=
ing with Maltese, such as translators and language teachers, particularly t=
eachers of Maltese to adults/foreigners. A parallel course in Maltese invol=
ving input from lecturers of the University of Malta's Skola tal-Malti will=
 also be offered if enough interest is expressed.

Comments from June 2009 participants:

'As an Arabist and a historical linguist, I found the programme extremely i=
nteresting, stimulating and beneficial. I think it would be useful to stude=
nts and researchers in Arabic dialectology, historical linguistics, contact=
 linguistics, varieties of English and linguistic typology.' --C.L., Cambri=
dge.

'It was an excellent experience. The very thorough programme on Maltese Lin=
guistics is suitable even for students who only have limited knowledge abou=
t Maltese. For me as a student who has been dealing with Maltese for some t=
ime, this programme was the ideal place not only to revise and deepen my kn=
owledge of the language structure but also to get an update on current issu=
es in Maltese linguistics.' --J.J., Osnabr=FCck.=20

Topics to be discussed will include:

-The segmental phonetics and phonology of Maltese=20
-Maltese prosody
-The historical phonology and morphology of Maltese
-Word formation processes in Maltese: derivation, inflection, compounding
-Verbless sentences
-Topicalisation
-Tense and aspect in Maltese
-Reflections on aspects of Maltese vocabulary
-Maltese and other languages: A linguistic history of Malta
-Language use in the Maltese context
-Computer technologies and Maltese
-Maltese in the media
-Language planning in the Maltese context
-Literature in Maltese
-Maltese in the EU context
-Maltese Sign Language
