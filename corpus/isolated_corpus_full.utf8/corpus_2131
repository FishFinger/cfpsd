Meeting Description

We are pleased to announce our forthcoming panel Historical (Im)Politeness
Research, which will be organised in the frame of the 4th International
Symposium on Politeness 'East Meets West', Budapest, 2008. This groundbreaking
panel will be an open forum where experts can meet, form new acquaintances and
interdisciplinary working groups, and raise and discuss both methodological and
theoretical issues. 

Title

Historical (Im)Politeness Research

Organisers

Jonathan Culpeper (Lancaster University) and Dániel Z. Kádár (Research Institute
for Linguistics, H.A.S.)

Description of the Forthcoming Panel

In recent years much research has been undertaken on both linguistic politeness
and historical pragmatics. A regrettable fact is, however, that few forums have
been created where politeness theorists and experts in historical pragmatics can
exchange views on the possible application of politeness 'theories' to
historical data. Moreover, not only has historical data rarely been the focus of
politeness analyses and discussions, but its potential for shaping our
understanding of politeness has not been fully appreciated. The merging of
politeness research and historical pragmatics can benefit both sides: historical
pragmatic research can benefit from moving away from more 'traditional'
politeness theories when analysing historical data; politeness research can
benefit from a diachronic perspective. With this in mind, we are pleased to
announce our forthcoming panel Historical (Im)Politeness Research, which will be
organised in the frame of the 4th International Symposium on Politeness 'East
Meets West', Budapest, 2008. This groundbreaking panel will be an open forum
where experts can meet, form new acquaintances and interdisciplinary working
groups, and raise and discuss both methodological and theoretical issues. It
should be emphasised that ours is an open panel, that is, we cordially invite
and encourage every colleague who is interested in the topic of the panel to
submit her/his abstracts to us.

Abstract Submission

The selection of abstracts will be made on the basis of quality and relatedness
to the topic and objectives of the panel. We ask for 'long' abstracts, that is,
the submitted abstracts should be up to 800 words long, and the authors of the
abstracts are expected to provide an overview of the goal, methodology, and data
of their research. Abstracts can be submitted to us from early September; the
deadline for abstract submission will be November 15, 2007. Notifications of
acceptance will be sent out by January 2008 or earlier. 
Abstracts should be sent to both of the organisers to the following e-mail
addresses:
Jonathan Culpeper - j.culpeper@lancaster.ac.uk 
Dániel Kádár - danielkadar@yahoo.co.uk 

Publication

The organisers will publish a volume containing a selection of papers presented
at the panel. This edited collection of papers is going to be published in early
2009 at the Linguistic Insights Series of the Swiss publisher Peter Lang, Berne.
It should be emphasised that the volume will not be a proceedings: whilst every
panel participant will be invited to submit a paper version of her/his
presentation to us, the submitted papers will go through a blind peer-review
process and hence will be subject of acceptance/refusal. The deadline for
submitting ready papers is October 15, 2008. More information about the volume
will be circulated amongst the panel participants soon after the notification of
acceptance.

Inquires

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact with the
organisers at the aforementioned e-mail addresses. Please also check the
conference website www.nytud.hu/lprg for updates.

Meeting Description

The research group 'Intercultural Pragmatic Studies (English-Spanish): Pragmatic
and Discourse Aspects' of the University Pablo de Olavide of Seville (Spain) is
pleased to announce its Third Symposium on Intercultural, Cognitive and Social
Pragmatics (EPICS III -  Encuentros de Pragmática Intercultural, Cognitiva y
Social), to be held in February 20-22, 2008. 

The third edition of the symposium will be devoted to 'Intercultural Pragmatics
and Language Teaching'. Dr. Helen Spencer-Oatey, Director of the Centre for
English Language Teacher Education, Warwick University, (U.K.) and Dr. Victoria
Escandell-Vidal, Professor of Linguistics at the U.N.E.D. (Spain), have
confirmed their presence as the symposium's keynote speakers. 

The Symposium will serve as a forum where applied linguists and practitioners of
Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis can meet, share experiences, discuss common
problems, and present papers on their latest research in the field. EPICS III
also wishes to create awareness among graduating students of the growing
interest in this area of linguistic expertise. 

Submissions

We welcome original papers, written in English or Spanish (20 minutes in length,
the last 5 minutes will be devoted to questions and discussion) on any topic
relevant to the mission of ''Intercultural Pragmatics and Language Teaching''. 
The symposium is especially interested in papers about: 

- implications of pragmatics research for theoretical developments,
- implications of pragmatics research for applications in L2 acquisition and
intercultural communication,
- language use in intercultural interaction,
- findings from the perspective of bi- or multilingual development, 
- interaction of bilinguals, multilinguals and language learners,
- the effect of bilingualism and multilingualism on the acquisiton, development
and use of pragmatics skills,
- the teachability and learnability of pragmatic skills.

 Participants should submit one-page abstract (500 words) accompanied by a
step-by-step outline of the presentation and the following information: 

1. Author's name(s) and affiliation
2. Title of paper
3. Audio-visual equipment required (VHS video, OHP, cassette)
4. E-mail address(es)
5. Postal address(es)

Electronic submissions as e-mail attachments (RTF, ASCII, HTML) are highly
encouraged. Proposals may be sent to: 

Reyes Gomez (rgommor@upo.es)
Manuel Padilla (mpadillacruz@us.es) 
Mariola Hernández (mariolahl@upo.es).

Submissions by fax will not be accepted. Those without e-mail access can send 2
printed copies of your abstract, outline and accompanying information to:

Lucía Fernández Amaya

Dpto. Filología y Traducción (Área de Filología Inglesa)
Universidad Pablo de Olavide 
Carretera de Utrera, km. 1 
41013 Sevilla

Dates

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is November 15, 2007. Notification of
acceptance will be sent by November 26, 2007. The committee will plan the
programme as soon as it has selected the successful abstracts, so please
indicate on the abstracts if you cannot present your paper on any day of the
conference (February 20-22). It is very difficult to reschedule papers after the
programme has been planned.

EPICS III participants are welcome to submit their papers to be considered for
publication. The final text of the presentation can be submitted (Word or RTF
