====================================================================
                      FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
        6th Workshop on "Methods for Modalities" (M4M-6)
                    http://m4m.loria.fr/M4M6
                      Copenhagen, Denmark
                      November 12-14, 2009
====================================================================

Scope
-----
The workshop "Methods for Modalities" (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term "modal logics" is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature
a number of invited talks by leading scientists, research
presentations aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions
of system demonstrations.

We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers,
especially for experimental and prototypical software tools which are
related to modal logics.

More information about the previous editions can be found at

                       http://m4m.loria.fr/

M4M-6 will be preceded by a two-day mini-course aimed at preparing
PhD students and other researchers for participation in the workshop.
The mini-course is associated with the FIRST research school
(http://first.dk).

Paper Submissions
------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers in the following three categories.

- Regular papers up to 15 pages, describing original research.

- System descriptions of up to 12 pages, describing new systems or
significant upgrades of existing ones.

- Presentation-only papers, describing work recently published or
submitted (no page limit). These will not be included in the
proceedings, but pre-prints or post-prints can be made available to
participants.

Submissions should be made via EasyChair at the following address:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=m4m6

Final versions of accepted papers will be published online in a volume
of Elsevier Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).
A preliminary version of the proceedings will also be available at the
workshop.
