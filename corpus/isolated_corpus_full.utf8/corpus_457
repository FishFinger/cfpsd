Workshop on Presupposition Accommodation: Poster Session

At: The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio USA
Workshop dates:  October 13 - 15, 2006
website:  http://www.pragmatics.osu.edu

Deadline for Poster submissions:  Submit an abstract by July 31, 2006.
Acceptance will be notified by August 21, 2006.

Workshop
========

Presupposition accommodation is at the intersection of central issues in 
semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and philosophy
of language.  When an utterance presupposes information which the addressee
doesn't already know (e.g. "I'm on my way to my daughter's graduation"
presupposes that the speaker has a daughter), the addressee may sometimes
cooperatively accommodate that information, behaving as though he already knew
it to be true, and go on to respond to the assertion ("Congratulations!").
Accommodation has broad implications for the theory of linguistic interpretation
because it involves many of the same processes and constraints as in the
recognition of contextual effects generally.  In addition to its ramifications
for theories of meaning in linguistics and for philosophical discussions of the
nature of meaning, presupposition accommodation bears on psycholinguistic
theories of human linguistic competence, illustrating the interaction between
linguistic and non-linguistic (general cognitive) processes.  And an
appreciation of how it functions is important for the creation of software that
aims to systematically interpret or produce language in context.

With support from the Ohio State University Colleges of the Arts and Humanities
and the National Science Foundation, we are offering a workshop on
presupposition accommodation, with invited participants from across several
fields in cognitive science.

Invited participants:
Barbara Abbott, Michigan State University, Linguistics

Gregory Carlson, University of Rochester, Linguistics
Joshua Dever, University of Texas at Austin, Philosophy
Kai Von Fintel, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Linguistics
Lyn Frazier, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Psycholinguistics
Bart Geurts, University of Nijmegen, Philosophy
Anthony Gillies, University of Michigan, Philosophy
Jerry Hobbs, University of Southern California, Computer Science

Poster Session
==============

We invite submissions for a poster session on the second day of the workshop,
Saturday, October 14, 2006. Authors of accepted posters are automatically 
registered to attend the entire workshop. Posters are welcome on any topics 
relevant for presupposition accommodation, including (but not limited to) 
theoretical and applied work on:

    the nature of presupposition and of particular presupposition triggers,
    the role of abductive reasoning in calculating intended meaning, and
    the character of pragmatic repair.

Work on computational models, both interpretation and generation, and on human
acquisition and processing are particularly solicited.

The abstract should be no more than 500 words (not including figures and
references) and should include a header which provides contact information for
the primary contact author. Send this information to the organizers, at
prag-conf(a)ling.ohio-state.edu (replacing (a) in the email address with the
at sign).

Deadline for abstract submissions:  Midnight (US) EST, July 31, 2006.
Acceptance will be notified by August 21, 2006.
Poster session date:  October 14, 2006.
