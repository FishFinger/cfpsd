Call for Papers

Focus Marking Strategies and Focus Interpretation
 
The necessity of a strict distinction between focus as a category of information
structure related to the presence of alternatives in the interpretation context
and focus marking as the grammati-cal coding of focus is widely discussed in the
literature (Krifka 2007). Different focus marking strategies may, however, have
different effects on the interpretation of focus. A well-known example is
Hungarian, in which in-situ and ex-situ focus differ with regard to exhaustivity
and contrast (É.Kiss 1998). Similar findings have been reported on Finnish,
Turk-ish etc. Such findings support the hypothesis that focus interpretation
depends on the marking strategy in languages with several strategies of focus
marking at their disposal. However, re-search on other languages suggests that
this hypothesis may not hold universally. In Hausa (Chadic), for instance, any
interpretation available for ex-situ focus is also available for in-situ focus
(Hartmann & Zimmermann 2007). Moreover, even for Hungarian it has been argued
that the semantic difference between in-situ and ex-situ focus is related to a
specific syntactic posi-tion in the left periphery that may actually be
independent of focus (Horváth 2007). 

These observations give rise to the following questions:
(i.) Can a general notion of focus as an underspecified information structural
category (often associated with prosodic prominence) with a unified semantic
interpretation mechanism in terms of alternatives  (e.g. Rooth 1992) be
maintained? I.e., can we derive the differ-ences in meaning that are observable
with different strategies of focus marking from the different grammatical
structure of the respective sentences plus pragmatic principles?
or
(ii.) Do we need more fine-grained notions of information structure, such as
e.g. contrast, exhaustivity, newness, that divide the more general notion of
focus into subclasses, such that languages would use different marking
strategies for expressing them?

The workshop invites syntactic, semantic and typological work on different
strategies of focus marking and focus interpretation. In addition, we would also
encourage the presentation of diachronic data related to the evolution of
different strategies of focus marking. The work-shop is of interest for
researchers working on linguistic interfaces. We are looking forward to
applications that provide data on and analyses of the effects of structural
encoding on the se-mantic and/or pragmatic interpretation.

Meeting Description:

One of the main aims of this conference is to shed some light on the question of
what is similar and what is different in the structure of the noun phrase of the
various Romance and Germanic languages and dialects, and what causes this
similarity or difference. 

Call for Papers

Variation and change in the structure of the noun phrase in Germanic and
Romance: autonomous developments or result of language contact?

28 January - 30 January, 2009
Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam (ACLC)

One of the recurrent questions in historical linguistics is to what extent
languages can borrow grammar from other languages. It seems for instance hardly
likely that each ''average European'' language developed a definite article all
by itself, without any influence from neighbouring languages. It is, on the
other hand, by no means clear what exactly was borrowed, since the way in which
definiteness is expressed differs greatly among the various Germanic and Romance
languages and dialects.

Topics to be discussed at the conference might include (but are not limited to)
the following:
- the emergence of the articles and the origin of the category of definiteness
- changes/variation in word order, e.g. in the position of determiners and
adjectives
- changes/variation in the structure and position of possessives
- changes/variation in agreement patterns within the DP/NP
- the rise (and death) of the nominalized infinitive and other nominalizations
- changes/variation in structure and position of (reduced) relative clauses

Invited Speakers:
Norbert Corver (Universiteit Utrecht)
Östen Dahl (Stockholms Universitet)
Giuseppe Longobardi (Università degli Studi di Trieste)

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (20'+10') relevant to the conference
theme. Submissions are limited to one single-authored and one joint-authored
abstract. The abstracts should be sent by e-mail to variation-change-fgw@uva.nl
no later than 1 November 2008.

Abstracts should be anonymous both in the body of the text and the filename and
should not exceed two A4 pages with a 2.5cm margin on each side and in 12 pt
font. A second document (in a separate file) should be submitted with the title
of your paper and name(s), affiliation(s), and preferred contact details of the
author(s). 

Submission Deadline: November 1, 2008. 
Notification of acceptance: December 1, 2008.

Organizing committee: Harry Perridon, Josep Quer, Petra Sleeman & Fred Weerman.
