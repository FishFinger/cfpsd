Meeting Description:

The third annual meeting of the Arizona Linguistics Circle will be held on the campus of the University of Arizona, Oct. 30-Nov 1, 2009.

The theme of this year's conference is 'Interfaces and Interactions in Linguistic Theories,' and as such, talks addressing subject matter at the interfaces between subdisciplines of linguistics are especially welcome. 

This year, we will also hold a special session focusing on the interactions between Cognitive Science and Linguistics.

Invited Speakers:

Harald Baayen (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada)
Andrew Wedel (University of Arizona, Tucson)
Maria Zubizarreta (University of Southern California, Los Angeles) 

Call for Papers:

Abstracts from all areas from linguistics are welcomed but abstracts fitting with either the main theme or the theme of the special session will be given preference.

Abstracts are invited for:

(a) 20-minute talks with a 10 minute question period to follow, and
(b) A poster session.

Submissions are limited to one individual and one joint abstract per author. 

Submission Guidelines:

Abstracts should be anonymous and in PDF form, limited to one page (with 1 inch margins on all sides and 11 point font size) with an optional second page for examples and references. Any non-standard fonts should be embedded in the PDF document. 

Abstracts should include up to five keywords after the title, including subfield and language (family), in order to help us match the abstracts to reviewers familiar with the topics discussed in the abstracts. 

Please indicate your preference for:

(a) Main session,
(b) Special session, or
(c) Poster session

in your abstract submission.

Submissions by graduate students are particularly welcome. 

Abstract submissions should be sent to arizonalinguisticscircle3@gmail.com.
