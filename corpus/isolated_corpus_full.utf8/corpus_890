       Named Entities: Recognition, Classification and Use  
         
         Special Issue of Lingvisticae Investigationes



Special issue website:
http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/SpecialIssueNERLingInv/index.html


This special topic issue of the journal Lingvisticae
Investigationes is scheduled to come out in early 2008 on the
broad topic of Named Entities. 

The aim is to bring out innovative papers on the issues and
advances in Named Entity recognition, classification and use, and
how Named Entities could be handled more effectively in a variety
of NLP applications.


GUEST EDITORS
-------------
The guest editors for this special issue will be (in alphabetical
order):
 
Elisabete Ranchhod 
University of Lisbon
 
Satoshi Sekine 
New York University



BACKGROUND
----------

Since the MUC Conferences about Information Extraction, Named
Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) is a
well-established task in the NLP community and is regarded as a
crucial technology for many NLP applications. 
The definition of what is a Named Entity (NE), however, still
remains an overt question. NEs include classical classes of
proper names (persons, organizations, geographic locations,
geo-political entities) and numeric expressions (time,
currencies, percentages).
However, the correct identification and classification of single
and multiword domain specific expressions (e.g., disease names,
biological agents causing health problems, drugs used in disease
treatment) should be an important issue for a number of NLP
applications (IE, MT, QA, etc.) and dealing with these questions
has become part and parcel of the problems dealt by the NE camp.
Likewise, reference to definite events or entities no longer
referenced as proper names in text, as encompassed by the ACE
program, has long been accepted as part of the NER discipline.


TOPICS
------
The guest editors seek papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of NE recognition, classification, and
use. Special topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

   * Real applications that employ NERC technology 
   * Linguistic properties of proper names 
   * Resources (lexicons, grammars, gazetteers, ontologies) for
NERC 
   * The relevance of NERC as a subtask in NLP applications (e.g.
question-answering (QA), information retrieval (IR),
summarization, machine translation (MT)) 
   * Evaluation of NERC systems and of the import of NERC in
larger applications 
   * Cross-language issues in named entity research 
   * Philosophical and methodological concerns in NERC 
   * NEs in speech and transcribed speech and other media
   * Tools for rapid development of NERC resources
   * Learning of NERC rules
   * Domain adaptability of NERC systems
