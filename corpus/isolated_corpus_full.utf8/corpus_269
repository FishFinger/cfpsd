 TENTH WORKSHOP ON THE SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF DIALOGUE (SEMDIAL)
			  Potsdam (Germany)
			 September 11-13 2006

brandial06 will be the tenth in a series of workshops that aims to
bring together researchers working on the semantics and pragmatics of
dialogues in fields such as artificial intelligence, formal semantics
and pragmatics, computational linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.
The SemDial conferences are always stimulating and fun, and
Potsdam/Berlin is a great place to visit.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

- James Allen       (University of Rochester, USA)
- Elisabeth Andre   (University of Augsburg, Germany)
- Manfred Krifka    (Humboldt University and ZAS, Germany)
- Emanuel Schegloff (University of California LA, USA)

SUBMISSIONS:

We invite papers on all topics related to the semantics and
pragmatics of dialogues, including, but not limited to:

- models of common ground/mutual belief in communication
- modelling agents' information states and how they get updated
- multi-agent models and turn-taking
- goals, intentions and commitments in communication
- semantic interpretation in dialogues
- reference in dialogues
- ellipsis resolution in dialogues
- dialogue and discourse structure
- interpretation of questions and answers
- nonlinguistic interaction in communication
- natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems
- multimodal dialogue systems
- dialogue management in practical implementations
- categorisation of dialogue moves or speech acts in corpora
- designing and evaluating dialogue systems

For the first time, we will have a special session (one afternoon), on
  ** Visual Attention and References to the Visual Situation **
chaired by Massimo Poesio and Hannes Rieser. (Committee: Sarah
Brown-Schmidt (University of Illinois at Urbana), John Kelleher
(Dublin Institute of Technology), Pia Knoeferle (University of the
Saarland), Geert-Jan Kruijff (DFKI).)

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): linguistic and
philosophical studies of deixis; eye-tracking studies of reference
resolution in situated language use; and computational models of
deictic references and reference interpretation. As always, especially
encouraged are interdisciplinary submissions, e.g., providing a sound
theoretical analysis based on solid empirical evidence.

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

Authors should submit an *anonymous* paper of at most 8 pages (for
talks with a duration of 25' plus 10' discussion) via the web-site
(please indicate if you are submitting for the special session).
Please see the website for details on formatting, etc.
(Submissions are now open!)

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submissions due:   May 12th, 2006  ** EXTENDED TO May 17th 2006!! **
Notification:      July 3rd, 2006
Final version due: August 4th, 2006
Conference:        September 11-13, 2006

There will be a later call for short abstracts describing system demonstrations
and/or ongoing projects relevant to the topics of the workshop, with
submission deadline in July.

Cognitive-linguistic approaches: what can we gain by computational
treatment of data?

!!! NEW DEADLINE EXTENSION for abstract submission: 31st May 2006 !!!

Work with empirical data is important, if not essential, to cognitive
linguistics. Electronic corpora of written texts or transcriptions of
speech are increasingly used and sometimes purposefully collected by
linguists in their investigations of phenomena such as metaphor,
metonymy, idioms, and frames. During their work, some linguists also
compile - more or less private - electronic archives of phenomena
studied in cognitive linguistics: searchable lists, classifications,
databases. Moreover, they have to deal with these phenomena - usually
in cooperation with computational linguists and computer scientists -
when building general lexicon resources for the automatic treatment of
language.

Problems that arise when working with corpora are connected to the way
they are prepared for and processed by the corpus tools (concordancers,
corpus managers). For example, in spite of some attempts in
computational linguistics to detect metaphors in running texts, no
corpus manager disposes of a ''Show all metaphors'' function. Rather, in
order to search a corpus for metaphors, linguists will devise their own
methods, be they theory-based or data-driven.

Other problems arise when creating project-specific as well as more
general archives of language usage examples classified by cognitive
linguistic criteria. Here, linguists decide which criteria they use in
their classifications and which features of the archived data they
annotate. These decisions are often made at a project-specific basis
and therefore different classifications might be difficult to compare.

At a larger scale, this also applies to general linguistic resources
developed for Human Language Technology applications. The decisions
taken during linguistic resource-building may then be evaluated - by
the resource developers or others -, based on large quantities of data
encoded in the resources themselves. Evaluations of this kind are at
the same time test-beds for theories put forth in cognitive
linguistics, and their results provide valuable feedback for theory
development.

In this theme session, we would like to discuss methods of exploiting
electronic corpora for any cognitive linguistic research, not
restricted to the phenomena mentioned above, as well as practical
experiences with resource building in cognitive linguistics. We also
invite contributions that evaluate the implications of data encoded in
computational resources, from the viewpoint of cognitive linguistic
theory.

Please send only detailed abstracts (2 pages), in which you make clear
how your study is related to the topics indicated.

The deadline for abstract submission is 31st May 2006. Participants
will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by 15th July 2006.

Please send your abstracts exclusively as email attachments (pdf- or
rtf-files) to:
