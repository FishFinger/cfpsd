EXTENDED DEADLINE

Research Objects, Tools and Concepts 

The ''Rencontres des Jeunes Chercheurs 2008'' conference invites young researchers to discuss their theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches in all fields of linguistics or text studies. 
Different types of study may be proposed: case-studies, comparative or diachronic studies, descriptions of methodological designs, use of a given tool or concept, or historical linguistics. 
The following topics may be explored (the list being non-exhaustive): 
- How does one construct a research object? 
- What are the appropriate (theoretical or methodological) tools for a given object? 
- How does one constitute a corpus as a function of his/hers (one = singular) research object? 
- What are the implications of a multiperspective/multidisciplinary approach for one research object? 
- In which way do the research object and the methodology mutually shape each other? 

A poster session is also proposed for candidates wishing to discuss other topics in linguistics.
