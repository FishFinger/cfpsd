Full Title: Journal of Germanic Linguistics 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics;Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2010 

Special Issue of The Journal of Germanic Linguistics 
Germanic Languages and Migration in North America

Call for contributions

In contrast to most European countries, the United States and Canada have
historically been portrayed as immigrant nations, yet there exists much
current debate on the challenges and benefits of migration and
multilingualism. Taking the socially and spatially situated nature of
language as the point of departure, this special issue seeks to advance
research on the topic of language and migration by unpacking the concepts
of language, migration and place. Contributions focusing on the spoken and
written Germanic language varieties used by people in North America, as
well as the diversity of migration experiences and multiple understandings
of senses of place as they relate to global flows in the past and present,
are invited. Papers that draw on insights from sociolinguistics, social
anthropology and cultural geography are especially welcome, as
interdisciplinary approaches encourage us to reflect on the parameters
influencing how we conduct research on the topic of language and migration. 

The deadline for submitting manuscripts of 8000 words is 15 January 2010.
Papers will be anonymously refereed, in line with JGL policy, and the
special issue is scheduled for publication in March 2011. Please contact
the guest editor, Kristine Horner (University of Leeds) for further
details: k.horner@leeds.ac.uk.
