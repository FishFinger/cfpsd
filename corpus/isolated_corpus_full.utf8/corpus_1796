Meeting Description

ISWC workshop OntoLex07 - From Text to Knowledge: The Lexicon/Ontology Interface
The OntoLex workshop series is concerned with the interface between knowledge
representation in ontologies and the representation and use of linguistic
knowledge as encoded in (multilingual) lexicons. Previous OntoLex workshops were
held in Sozopol (2000), Las Palmas (2002), Lisboa (2004), Jeju (2005), Genoa
(2006). The extraction of ontology elements from textual data is a pre-requisite
for many Semantic Web applications. Hence the interface between ontologies
(describing objects in a domain) and the lexicon (describing the linguistic
features of terms that refer to such objects) is becoming increasingly important. 

Extended deadline August 5th

Call for papers for OntoLex07 - From Text to Knowledge: 
The Lexicon/Ontology Interface

http://olp.dfki.de/OntoLex07/

Workshop at ISWC07, the 6th International Semantic Web Conference
(http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/)
November 11th, 2007
Busan, South Korea

Endorsed by SIGSEM (Association of Computational Linguistics SIG on
Computational Semantics http://www.aclweb.org/sigsem) and the NEON
project (http://www.neon-project.org/)
And in coordination with the ISO Working Group on Language Resource
Management (http://www.tc37sc4.org/)

We invite submission of papers on the following topics in this interdisciplinary
research area:

The lexicon/ontology interface
- Design principles for the integrated representation of lexical and ontological
knowledge
- The lexicon/ontology interface in multilingual and cross-cultural aspects of
ontologies

The lexicon in Semantic Web applications
- The role of (multilingual) lexicons in knowledge markup and ontology
population, i.e. in ontology-based information extraction from text
- Lexical aspects in ontology learning from text, i.e. in (multilingual) term
extraction, relation extraction, etc.
- Lexical approaches to ontology matching, i.e. in the extraction,
representation and use of synonyms for mapping between class/property labels
- Reengineering lexicons as ontologies, e.g. porting wordnets and
framenets to the Semantic Web

Ontologies in knowledge-based Natural Language Processing
- Ontological constraints on lexicon development for knowledge-based NLP
- Ontologies as resources for NLP-based tasks (question answering,
document classification, text mining, expert search, etc.)

Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description

The conference comes as an answer to substantial intensification of
pragmatics-oriented research in the past two decades, and provides forum
for its essential systematization.
We encourage papers representing current state of research in the field of
linguistic pragmatics seen in the broad sense as a functional (i. e.
cognitive, social and cultural) perspective on language and communication.
Participants are invited to prepare 20-minute presentations on one of the
following topics:

- application of linguistic pragmatics in the analysis of real-life
discourse (language of politics and the media; advertising; social
communication; misunderstandings; humor, etc.);
- status of linguistic pragmatics in relation to such disciplines as
sociolinguistics, anthropology, social psychology, cognitive linguistics
and culture studies;
- language and processes of ideological symbolization, including folk
linguistic ideologies, normative use of language and language-based
reproduction of ideologies;
- language of the state, viz. language policies and language planning at
various stages of the information flow, including the art of document
design and press releases;
- societal multilingualism, linguistic pluralism and linguistic minority
policies;
- methodology of pragmatic investigation and parameters of analysis;
- pragmatic aspects of translation and interpreting;
- implementation of pragmatic awareness in foreign language teaching.

NB: The list of topics is not exhaustive

The organizers hope to offer multiple grounds for discussion of a genuinely
cross-disciplinary approach to linguistic pragmatics. 

Dear Colleague,

Next year we will have a pleasure to organize the 4th Lodz Symposium on
linguistic pragmatics. The first, second and third conference were held at
Lodz University in 2002, 2004 and 2006 respectively, bringing together some
three hundred scholars from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. We had
an opportunity to discuss a variety of current topics in pragmatics,
discourse analysis and other relevant areas, as well as to listen to
plenary lectures given by Jef Verschueren, Katarzyna M. Jaszczolt, Roman
Kalisz, Rachel Giora, Mira Ariel, Richard W. Janney, Bruce Fraser, Gunter
Senft, Adam Jaworski, Paul Chilton, Anna Duszak, Neal R. Norrick and Mario
Brdar. Selected papers from the past conferences were published by
international publishers. Below you will find information on the 4th
Symposium. We cordially invite you to participate and will try to make your
stay in Lodz interesting and professionally rewarding.
