Full Title: ESSLLI 2008 Workshop: What Syntax Feeds Semantics 

Date: 11-Aug-2008 - 15-Aug-2008
Location: Hamburg, Germany 
Contact Person: Maribel Romero
Meeting Email: synsem.esslli08@uni-konstanz.de
Web Site: http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/WhatSyntaxFeedsSemantics.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

The purpose of this workshop is to investigate on what kind of syntactic
representation semantic interpretation applies. A dominant trend defends the
existence of a covert level of representation, Logical Form (LF) in Generative
Grammar/Minimalism, mediating between surface syntax and the semantic component.
However, many of the original empirical reasons for LF have been challenged,
and, for many phenomena commonly attributed to LF, alternative accounts exist
that derive the semantics from the surface syntax. Other grammar formalisms
-e.g. TAG, HPSG, LFG, CCG- use different syntactic inputs to arrive at the
desired semantic interpretation. The workshop aims to provide a forum for
researchers (including advanced PhD students) to present and discuss their work
with colleagues working on the same or on different frameworks, in connection
with the broad subject areas represented at ESSLLI. 

Call for Papers

Workshop
What Syntax Feeds Semantics
http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/WhatSyntaxFeedsSemantics.html

Organised as part of ESSLLI 2008
European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information
http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/
11-15 August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany

Organiser:
Maribel Romero, University of Konstanz: maribel.romero@uni-konstanz.de

Workshop Topics:
The workshop is concerned with topics where the debate on the syntax-semantics
mapping has been particularly active or can potentially lead to new results.
Topics include, but are not limited to:
- scope and Noun Phrases (NPS): quantificational NPs, plurals, branching
quantifier readings, etc.
- scope reconstruction
- connectivity effects (reflected in Binding Theory, NPI-licensing, opacity, etc.)
- scope in degree constructions (comparatives, superlatives, etc.)
- ellipsis (VP-ellipsis, gapping, NP-ellipsis, etc.)
- representation and binding of pronouns
- representation and binding of world/situation variables
- representation and binding of temporal variables

Submission Details: 
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous abstract not exceeding 2 pages
(including examples and references), on an 11pt font and with 2cm per margin.
The following formats are accepted: PDF, ASCII text, WSWord. Please send your
submission electronically by March 8, 2008 to the email address:

workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI.

Workshop Format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
