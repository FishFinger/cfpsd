LAST CALL FOR PAPERS:
ESAIR 2009 : Exploiting Semantic Annotations in Information Retrieval
http://barcelona.research.yahoo.net/esair09



ESAIR'2009 is an ACM Workshop held in conjunction with WSDM 2009<http://www=
.wsdm2009.org/> on February 9th, in Barcelona.

After the success of the first ESAIR (ESAIR'08<http://www.yr-bcn.es/esair08=
>), we've decided to organize this workshop one more year. The goal of this=
 workshop is to create a forum for researchers interested in the use of sem=
antic annotations for information retrieval. By semantic annotations we ref=
er to linguistic annotations (such as named entities, semantic classes, etc=
.) as well as user annotations such as microformats, RDF, tags, etc. The ai=
m of this workshop is not semantic annotation itself, but rather the applic=
ations of semantic annotation to information retrieval tasks such as ad-hoc=
 retrieval, classification, browsing, textual mining, summarization, questi=
on answering, etc.

In the recent years there has been a lot of discussion about semantic annot=
ation of documents. There are many forms of annotations and many techniques=
 that identify or extract them. As NLP tagging techniques mature, more and =
more annotations can be automatically extracted from free text. In particul=
ar, techniques have been developed to ground named entities in terms of geo=
-codes, ISO time codes, Gene Ontology ids, etc. Furthermore, the number of =
collections which explicitly identify entities is growing fast with Web 2.0=
 and Semantic Web initiatives.

Despite the growing number and complexity of annotations, and despite the p=
otential impact that these may have in information retrieval tasks, annotat=
ions have not yet made a significant impact in Information Retrieval resear=
ch or applications. Further research is needed before we can unleash the po=
tential of annotations!

Workshop Information

ESAIR09 is an ACM workshop held in conjuction with the Second ACM Internati=
onal Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2009<http://www.wsdm200=
9.org/>). ESAIR will be a one-day workshop held on February 9. It will alte=
rnate short paper presentations, open discussions and demos. Paper and demo=
s presented will be peer-reviewed.

Accepted workshop papers will also be published in the WSDM electronic proc=
eedings, and indexed in the ACM digital library.

The registration site <http://www.regonline.com/WSDM2009> is now open, earl=
y registration ends January 7, 2009.

Submissions

Submissions should be in the PDF format be sent by email to oralonso_at_gma=
il.com and hugoz_at_yahoo-inc.com with the title "ESAIR09 paper/demo submis=
sion". Other than this there are no rules with respect to style or length l=
imit. Submissions do not need to be anonymous. All submissions will be peer=
-reviewed.

Paper submissions: we encourage short paper submissions describing novel wo=
rk which may not be yet fully evaluated (i.e. somewhere between a poster an=
d a conference paper).

Demo submissions: please send a (PDF) description of the demo with many sna=
pshots (or a url if the demo is public).
