Paper Session:

The Lexical Bases of Grammar: Issues on the Lexis-Grammar Interface

Recent Background and Invitation:

At the the 2nd International Conference of the German Cognitive Linguistics Association, Munich, October 5th-7th, 2006, the theme session ''Lexical Bootstrapping in Child Language Acquisition and Child Conceptual Development'' took place as one of the first events dedicated to the discussion on the central role of lexis for the whole of language development. It is planned to continue this discussion in an edited paper collection (Bartsch & Bittner, in prep.) to appear in the Cognitive Linguistics Research series.

After the success of the Lexical Bootstrapping session, we would like now to invite scholars interested in an enlarged discussion on the lexical bases of grammar from the perspectives of language development, evolution, diachrony, synchrony, as well as human and machine processing.

For this discussion, a proposal for a special session to be held at the 2nd International Conference of the Association Française de Linguistique Cognitive (AFLiCo), Lille, May 10th-12th, 2007, is currently under review.

Theoretical Background and Description:

Linguistic research has been for several decades determined by generative axioms about modularity of cognition and of linguistic domains, autonomy and primacy of syntax over lexis and the rather epiphenomenal nature of lexis and semantics.

However, over the last 2-3 decades, empirical research (especially the one done within functionalist-cognitivist frameworks) has provided mounting evidence for the notion that language cannot be properly studied from a 'syntactocentric' perspective (to use a term coined by Jackendoff 1997), i.e., without considering the interplay between linguistic domains, the interplay between lexical semantics and grammar, and the central role lexis plays therein.

For instance, from the developmental perspective, the empirical work of Elizabeth Bates and associates has been crucial for the view on the ''emergence of grammar from the lexicon'' (Bates & Goodman 1999; also see Bates, Bretherton, & Snyder 1987; and, as examples for more recent studies inspired by Bates' work, Kauschke 2000; and Bassano, Laaha, Maillochon, & Dressler 2004). This is also the idea underlying the Lexical Bootstrapping Hypothesis (LBH), i.e., the hypothesis that early lexical development, as mapping of words to referents or their conceptualisations, and even to whole propositions, is not only prior to, but also pre-requisite for the emergence of morpho-syntactic constructions, as well as, in later developmental stages, for the enhancement of other linguistic abilities (Bartsch 2006, Bartsch in prep.).

But LBH can be situated within a language-general lexicalist hypothesis in that it attributes a fundamental role to lexis over grammar (strong version), resp. a continuity or complex interplay of lexis and grammar (weak version), not only in language development, but also in evolution, diachrony, synchrony, as well as human and machine processing. The lexicalist hypothesis is in line with an increasing corpus of empirical findings, theoretical proposals and methodological approaches from the last decades, such as the following:

a) Developmental Perspective:
- lexical bootstrapping (grammar from lexis) (see studies mentioned above);
- syntactic bootstrapping (lexis from grammar) (Landau & Gleitman 1985; Lee & Naigles 2005).

b) Diachronic Perspective:
- lexico-semantic evolution shapes and determines grammaticalisation processes (Lemmens 1999; Bybee 2005);
- grammaticalisation (grammar from lexis) and lexicalisation (lexis from grammar) as complementary bidirectional processes (Brinton & Traugott 2005).

c) Synchronic Perspective:
- lexico-semantic structures constrain constructional possibilities (Lemmens 1998);
- merely methodological/terminological, but by no means ontological, differentiation between lexis and grammar (Köller 2004);
- grammar as an outcome of lexical structure in language use (Hoey 2005);
- grammatical investigation by means of the ''method of lexical exceptions'' (Beedham's 2005).

d) Human Language Processing:
- interplay of ''lexical and structural effects'' in infant speech perception (Höhle, Schmitz, Santelmann, & Weissenborn, 2006 to appear);
- ''lexical and referential influences'' in sentence processing by humans (Kidd & Bavin 2005).

e) Computer Modeling:
- grammar as an outcome of lexical structure in connectionist modeling of language development (Howell & Becker under review);
- ''coevolution of lexicon and syntax'' in connectionist modelling of language evolution (phylogeny) (Gong & Wang 2005).

These and other studies have repeatedly confirmed Jackendoff's view of ''syntactocentrism'' as a ''scientific mistake'' (Jackendoff 2003: 654), as ''just an assumption that itself was partly a product of historical accident'' (Jackendoff 1997: 19), even though Jackendoff's motivations and goals are somewhat different from the ones to be pursued in this theme session.

This special session is intended as a forum for discussion on the general lexicalist theory of language in its strong and weak versions, from the perspectives just mentioned.

The individual contributions should focus on the following general questions (for instance, as discussed in the studies mentioned above):

1) How, concerning which aspects, and to which extent are grammatical categories and structures shaped and determined by lexico-semantic categories and structures (lexicalist view)?

2) How, concerning which aspects, and to which extent are lexico-semantic categories and structures shaped and determined by grammatical categories and structures ('syntactocentric' view)?

3) Are the lexicalist and the 'syntactocentric' view compatible with each other? And if so, how, concerning which aspects, and to which extent?

The session is intended to have at least one contribution focusing on aspects of one of these areas:
- child language development;
- language change;
- language evolution;
- synchrony;
- human language processing;
- machine language processing.

Papers combining one of these areas with computer modeling or neurolinguistic investigations, as well as offering a survey on the research relevant for their respective areas are especially encouraged. The papers might focus on the researcher's original empirical research, on theoretical synthesising reflexions reviewing a corpus of empirical research, as well as on methodologies.

The papers will be 20 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion. In addition, one slot (30 minutes) at the end of the session will be reserved to a general discussion.
