                           Call for Papers

               Natural Language Processing and the Web


http://www.computer.org/portal/pages/intelligent/content/NLPcfp.html


The Web contains more than 10 billion indexable text pages
(www.cs.uiowa.edu/~asignori/web-size), accessible mostly through
keyword-based search engines. This special issue aims to foretell how
natural-language-processing technology will make better use of the Web
in the near future.

The mere use of Web data isnt sufficient to make a paper relevant to
this special issue. Instead, we want papers that focus on innovative
uses of the Web as a (large-scale, distributed, hyperlinked, evolving,
and multilingual) corpus and on building state-of-the-art
natural-language interfaces to search engines. Papers should also go
beyond word counting and get into issues of parsing, semantics,
dialogue, and so on. In addition, papers should integrate information
from multiple genres of Web documents (such as personal pages, news
sites, blogs, Wikipedia articles).

We are soliciting papers on these topics:

*   information extraction from Web pages,

*   corpus studies using the Web,

*   multilingual access to the Web,

*   mining Web sites such as blogs and social networks,

*   subjectivity analysis of Web pages,

*   lexicon and paraphrase acquisition studies using the Web,

*   language modeling using the Web as training data,

*   Web-based question answering, and

*   natural-language interfaces to the Web.


Important Dates

*   Submissions due for review: 5 Mar. 2008

*   Notification of acceptance: 6 June 2008

*   Final version submitted: 20 June 2008

*   Issue publication: Sept. 2008


Submission Guidelines

Submissions should be 3,500 to 7,500 words (counting a standard figure
or table as 200 words) and should follow the magazines style and
presentation guidelines (see
www.computer.org/portal/pages/intelligent/mc/author.html). References
should be limited to 15 citations. To submit a manuscript, access the
IEEE Computer Society Web-based system, Manuscript Central, at
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cs-ieee.
