2nd Call for Papers

Positional effects found cross-linguistically at the edges of prosodic
constituents (e.g. final lengthening, final lowering, strengthening effects=
, or
final devoicing) have increasingly received attention in phonetic-phonologi=
cal
research. Recent empirical investigations of such positional effects and th=
eir
variability pose, however, a great number of questions challenging e.g. the=
 idea
of perceptual invariance. It has been claimed that acoustic variability is =
a
necessary prerequisite for the perceptual system to parse segmental strings=
 into
words, phrases or larger prosodic units.

This workshop will provide a forum for discussing controversies and recent
developments regarding positional phenomena. We invite abstracts bearing on
positional effects from various perspectives. The following questions can b=
e
addressed, but are not limited to:

- What kind of variability is found in the data, and how does such variabil=
ity
need to be accounted for?
- What positional effects are common cross-linguistically and how can they =
be
attributed to perceptual, articulatory or aerodynamic principles?
- How does positional prominence (lexical stress; accent) interact with aco=
ustic
and articulatory realizations of prosodic boundaries?
- What are the positional (a)symmetries in the realizations of boundaries, =
and
what are the mechanisms underlying them?
- How does left- and right-edge phrasal marking interact with the acoustic =
and
articulatory realizations at these prosodic boundaries?
- How are these interpreted in phonetics and in phonology?
- What are the necessary prerequisites for the interpretation of prosodic
constituents? Which auditory cues are essential for the perception of bound=
aries
and positional effects? Are such cues language-specific?
- To what extent do lexical frequency, phonotactic probability, and neighbo=
urhood
density contribute to the production and recognition of prosodic boundaries=
 in
(fluent/spontaneous) speech?
- How are positional characteristics exploited during the process of langua=
ge
acquisition? How are they learned during the process of language acquisitio=
n?
Are positional effects salient enough for L2 learners?
