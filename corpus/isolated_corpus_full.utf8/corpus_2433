Romanitas, lenguas y literaturas romances (RLLR) is a multilingual journal
of Romance Studies published twice a year by the Colectivo Romanitas of the
University of Puerto Rico. 

RLLR is an Open Access journal with an open editorial line. All subjects
directly related to Romance Languages and Literatures are accepted. 

Romance languages emerged through their divergence from shared roots in
Latin. However, comparative analysis of those languages and literatures
also shows convergences that cannot be traced back to Latin. Romanitas is
dedicated to creating synergies that extend beyond simple comparisons.
Articles which explore patterns in two or more Romance languages or
literatures are highly appreciated.

We are now accepting articles for the Volume 2 Number 2 to be published on
April 2008. Manuscripts are accepted in Spanish, French, Italian,
Portuguese or English. Maximum length recommended: 30 pages with
bibliography and end-notes. Articles should be submitted not later than 29
February 2008. All papers submitted to RLLR should be unpublished and not
be currently under evaluation by any other journal. Manuscripts should be
in conformity with the general RLLR guidelines which may be consulted at
the following URLs:

http://humanidades.uprrp.edu/romanitas/francais/protocole.html [French version]
