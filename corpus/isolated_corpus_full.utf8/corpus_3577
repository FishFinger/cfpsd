Meeting Description:

This conference is dedicated to the question about how to make a written
language. Contributions are invited for 30 min presentations (20 min talks and
10 min discussion) to be presented on December 6th and 7th at the Primoz Trubar
Congress in Berlin. 

Call for Papers


Primo? Trubar (1508-1586), church reformer and contemporary of Martin Luther, is
considered to be the father of what is now known as standard Slovenian language.
By his writing (Katechisms) and translatory (Bible) activities he was the first
to systematically encourage its development to a standardized idiom and this
enabled it to become a medium of cultural communication, used up to the present
days. Considering his merits for the Slovenian language and national identity at
his 500th birthday, we are dealing with the idea that work done by single
persons is important and was often decisive for the development of languages in
the history, and would like to widen this aspect of language development to as
many evident cases as possible, concerning all languages and language families
of the world; the topic refers to the general stage as well as to single
phenomena within a language, and can be associated with .
The abstracts for the contributions should be connected with the subject of the
"language parentage" as much as possible and can be written in English, German,
Esperanto or Slovenian; they should not exceed one page (12p) and should be sent
to dvorak@zas.gzw-berlin.de preferably before November 11th.  

The conference will be held at the Slovenian Center in Berlin, Kolonnenstr. 38,
on December 6th and 7th, and is organized by the Slovenian Center
http://www.herbergeberlin.de 
and Bostjan Dvorak, ZAS Berlin http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/.

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

This conference has two foci: 
(1) corpus-based grammar research in Germanic, Romanic, and Slavic languages and
(2) methodologies of corpus-linguistic grammar research. It is organised by the
Institute for the German Language in Mannheim (Marek Konopka, Jacqueline Kubczak
and Ulrich H. Waßner), where a new corpus-based grammar of German focusing on
variation is being prepared, and by the University of Freiburg (Christian Mair).
Conference languages are English and German. 

Call for Papers

Third International Conference Grammar & Corpora - IDS (Institut für Deutsche
Sprache / Institute for the German Language), Mannheim

A look at corpus-based grammar research in German, English or the Romance and
Slavic languages shows that not only are there very different theoretical
stances in these various traditions but also different empirical focal points of
research. The conference organizers feel that this state of affairs should not
be seen as an obstacle but as the starting point for fruitful trans-disciplinary
discussions. The confrontation of philological traditions, empirical
description, theory, computational linguistics and corpus linguistics provides
opportunities to further a critical but constructive dialogue.

The issues involved will be the focus of several invited keynote speeches (see
below) as well as two sections and a poster session, for which we invite
contributions from the corpus-linguistic community. The languages of the
conference are English and German.

For a description of the two sections and further information, see the
conference website at:
http://www.ids-mannheim.de/gac2009.html

Submissions
We invite submissions for section papers and for the poster session.
Presentations of papers in both sections will take 30 minutes plus 10 minutes
time for discussion. Submissions should contain the title of the paper, the name
of the section, and an abstract of between 300 and 500 words.
Poster submissions should contain the title of the poster and an abstract not
exceeding 300 words in length.
Please include also your name and affiliation and submit the abstracts in
English or German to gac2009@ids-mannheim.de.

Important dates
Closing date for submissions:	31 January 2009
Notification of acceptance:	31 March 2009
Conference dates:	22-24 September 2009
Registration details will be announced at the conference website in April 2009.
