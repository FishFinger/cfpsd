The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation 
(PACLIC 23)

3-5 December 2009
City University of Hong Kong
http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk

Final Call for Papers


***** Submission Deadline: 9 Aug 2009 11:59PM  Hong Kong Time (GMT+8) *****

**************************************************************************************
Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit revised manuscripts to
a Special Issue of Language Resources and Evaluation, an SCI-indexed
international journal.
**************************************************************************************


The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation 
(PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong Kong on 3-5 December 
2009.  The PACLIC series of conferences emphasizes the synergy of 
theoretical analysis and processing of language, and provides a forum for 
researchers in different fields of language study in the Pacific-Asia region 
to meet, to inspire and to be inspired.  According to the Computer Science 
Conference Ranking Website, as in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of 701 
conferences in topic area II (AI and Machine Learning), roughly at top 7%. 
(http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/topicsii.html)

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on all 
aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics.  Topics include 
but are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, 
pragmatics, discourse analysis, typology, corpus linguistics, formal grammar 
theory, natural language processing, natural language systems and related 
computer applications.  Papers which showcase the synergistic effects 
offered by multi-disciplinary approaches on the construction of language 
resources and development of language processing applications are 
particularly encouraged.  Different research topics could address the 
following issues in one way or another, to feature the mutual advancement 
among language, information and computation:

* How has formal linguistic analysis informed language technology and how is 
it deployed in advancing the development of language processing 
applications?
* What light has theoretical linguistics shed on the information demand of 
natural language processing, and how has it led to large-scale 
machine-usable language resources?
* How have linguistically-informed language resources improved the 
performance of language processing applications?
* What does the advancement in language technology have to offer theoretical 
linguists with respect to research methodology and analysis framework?
* What is the limit of pure computational methods like machine learning in 
language processing?  What roles do related disciplines such as cognitive 
science and psycholinguistics have to play in bridging the gap between human 
and computer language processing?


Important Dates:

   9 Aug 2009      Paper submission deadline
   21 Sep 2009    Acceptance notification
   19 Oct 2009     Camera-ready paper due
   3-5 Dec 2009   PACLIC 23 conference


Paper Submission:

Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished work. 
Papers should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10) pages, 
including references.  Please follow the formatting instructions and use the 
style files provided on the conference website 
(http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk).  Accepted papers will be presented in 
one of the regular sessions or poster sessions as determined by the program 
committee.  Such decisions will be based on the nature rather than on the 
quality of the work.

The deadline for paper submissions is 11:59PM Aug 9, 2009 Hong Kong time 
(GMT+8).  Submissions should be made via the submission software at:

   https://www.softconf.com/a/PACLIC23/

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, 
significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. 
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee 
members.  As the reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the 
authors' names and affiliations.  Authors should ensure that their 
identities are not revealed in any way in the paper.  Papers that do not 
conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which will 
subsequently be digitally archived and sent to ISI for indexing.  PACLIC 
conference proceedings are indexed in the ISI Web of Science since 2002 and 
authors are encouraged to cite previous PACLIC papers in their work.


For enquiries on paper submission, please contact the program committee 
chair at paclic23@cityu.edu.hk.
