Dear list members,

Having been the Listadm for Corpora since it's beginning in 1992 and with =

reference to the recent discussion on the list, I would like to stress =

that discussion still remains an intrinsic component of the Corpora-List
and that all types of discussion with a bearing on corpora are welcome.

The Corpora-List has more that 2600 members. From time to time it is =

understandable that some members feel that the volume of messages is too =

high or that the topic is outside their main interest. However, through =

the years I have got very few complaints about this.

To make it easier for the readers to select the messages that are of =

interest to them, I would ask the posters to use an informative subject =

line and to add a keyword to the beginning of the line such as:

Conference: CFP / Program / Announcement:
Journal: CFP
Book:
Job:
Query:
Summary:
Software:
Disc:

etc.

Do not change the subject heading of a thread.

I will make a more detailed posting guide on the Corpora web-site:

http://gandalf.aksis.uib.no/corpora/

I will also advise the members to make use of the filtering options in =

most mail reading programs where it is possible to direct mail to =

different folders based on information in the subject line like =

"[Corpora-List]" and the keywords mentioned above.

It is also possible to get a digest version (max. one message a day) by =

visiting the member's options page:

http://mailman.uib.no/options/corpora

It is also possible to read the list without being a member at one of the =

archiving sites listed on the Corpora web site.

The Corpora-List has been run in a member-only mode for posting (where =

the message goes direct to the members on the list), but with an option =

where non-member postings have been forwarded to the Listadm. This =

includes messages from members who have changed their address since they =

signed up for the list. Recently nearly all of these messages have been =

spam. To reduce the work of the Listadm I will turn of this forwarding in =

the near future. The message will then automatically be discarded and the =

posters will receive a message saying that they have to subscribe to the =

list or go to the member's options page to change their address.

To be able to use different mail address when sending messages to the =

list it is possible to be put on a alias list or register with several =

addresses and use the option "nomail".

If you have any comments or suggestions please send them DIRECT TO ME.

With best wishes

Knut Hofland
