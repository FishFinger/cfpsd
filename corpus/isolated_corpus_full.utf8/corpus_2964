NEWS

o The submission deadline has been extended to April 25th


OBJECTIVE

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from different
communities to study the use of semantic technologies in software
maintenance with the goal to increase the productivity and
effectiveness of software engineers.


INTENDED AUDIENCE

Researchers and practitioners that use and develop various semantic
technologies (e.g., ontologies, information retrieval, text mining,
and knowledge integration techniques) for diverse tasks in software
maintenance, such as traceability, reverse engineering, system
comprehension, software artifact analysis, and information
integration.


SCOPE AND RELEVANCE

While software is a technical category designed to perform specific
tasks by using computer hardware, it is also a social category that
nowadays is used in almost every aspect of a human's life. Software is
also a knowledge repository, where knowledge is largely related to the
application domain, and not to software as an entity. Software
engineers and maintainers need to be able to share and interrelate
knowledge stored in software with the knowledge about all relevant
aspects surrounding and influencing software maintenance (e.g., domain
knowledge, new requirements, policies, and the contexts, in which
people use and interact with software) in order to bring software
maintenance to more advanced levels. This "Software Maintenance
2.0" requires the use of semantically rich representations of
knowledge coupled with advanced techniques for knowledge capturing,
processing, and integration.

In this workshop, we especially solicit original contributions that
include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of semantic
technologies:

o Semantic Web technologies and Ontologies
o Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining
o Metamodels
o Web 2.0 approaches (Collaborative computing, =

  Social Networks, Blogs, Wikis, etc.)
o Data Mining
o Information Retrieval
o Knowledge Integration
o Uncertainty, Incompleteness and Inconsistency Management
o Evaluation of semantic approaches (defining tasks, data, =

  metrics, competition proposals, etc.)

The workshop solicits papers focusing on the application of semantic
technologies to software maintenance.  This includes (but is not
limited to) the following topics:

o Traceability Link Recovery
o Reverse Engineering
o System Comprehension
o Processes and Process Modeling  =

o Outsourcing and Off-Shoring
o Software Development and Maintenance Life-cycle =

o Software Artifact analysis and integration (e.g., requirements,
  source code, documents, emails, bug reports)
o Integration of semantic technologies in software maintenance tools


SUBMISSION TYPES

All papers must be formatted by following the two column proceedings
style of IEEE Computer Society.  We solicit the following types of papers:

o FULL PAPERS: These should report a substantial contribution
  supported by an appropriate evaluation. Long papers might be
  accepted as short papers, if the program committee finds the
  contribution or the evaluation not yet mature enough. Full paper
  submissions must not exceed 10 pages.

o SHORT PAPERS: Short paper submissions include the following types:
  research-in-progress, industrial experience, position
  papers. Research-in-progress papers typically discuss exciting new
  work that is not yet matured enough for a long paper and lacks
  evaluation. However, the paper must at least state a strategy
  (tasks, metrics) for an evaluation of the proposed
  approach. Position papers are expected to discuss controversial
  issues in the field or describe interesting or thought-provoking
  ideas that are not yet fully developed. Industrial experience papers
  should report on the experiences in using/deploying state of the art
  research results in industrial setting and identify challenges and
  future requirements.  Short paper submissions must not exceed 4
  pages.

o DEMOS: Interested tool designers should submit a description of
  their tool involving semantic technologies and how it can be used to
  enhance system maintainability and comprehension. Submissions are a
  maximum of 2 pages (proceedings format). Accepted demonstrations
  will be published in the proceedings. Criteria for selection will be
  the maturity of the tool, its innovative aspects, and the relevance
  of the tool to software understanding.

Papers must be submitted as PDF files using EasyChair at =

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dstsm2008


PUBLICATION

o All accepted and presented papers will be published =

  electronically in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings Series, =

  an open Web-based publisher:
  http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/

o A Journal Special Issue (including both revised workshop papers and
  an open call for papers) is currently under negotiation
