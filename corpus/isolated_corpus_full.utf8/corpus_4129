Meeting Description:

Workshop Logical Methods for Social Concepts (LMSC)
20-31 July, 2009 in Bordeaux
workshop organized as part of ESSLLI 2009 (http://esslli2009.labri.fr)
webpage: http://www.irit.fr/~Andreas.Herzig/Esslli09/ 

Call for Papers

Workshop Purpose:
Both computer science and the social sciences are interested in social concepts
such as power, cooperation, responsibility, delegation, trust, reputation,
convention, agreement, commitment, etc. The aim of this workshop is to study
whether logical approaches developed in the multi-agent system (MAS) domain are
adequate to express them in an accurate way. In particular, are existing logical
approaches sufficiently expressive to capture the main features of these social 
concepts? Are the basic assumptions in the existing logics for MAS too strong to
capture the fundamental aspects of social phenomena? Are some concepts relevant
for social theory missing in these logics? The workshop is intended to bring
together logicians and social theorists in order to provide a better
understanding of the potentialities and limitations of logical methods for the
analysis of social reality. Its scope includes not only the technical aspects of
logics for multi-agent systems, but also multidisciplinary aspects from social
sciences (e.g. economics, sociology, social philosophy) and a critical analysis
of the existing logical frameworks for the specification of social concepts.

Workshop Topics:
The following are some examples of topics that are relevant for the 
workshop:
- Logics of individual and collective powers;
- Logical approaches to game theory;
- Dynamic epistemic logics and logics of communication;
- Logics of normative systems and institutions;
- Logical approaches to trust and reputation;
- Logical approaches to organizational concepts (e.g. roles, responsibility,
delegation);
- Logics of social commitment and collective attitudes (e.g. common belief and
common knowledge, collective acceptance, joint intentions);
- Logics for mechanism design.

Workshop Organizers:
Andreas Herzig <http://www.irit.fr/~Andreas.Herzig> and 
Emiliano Lorini <http://www.irit.fr/~Emiliano.Lorini>

Invited speakers:
- Alexandru Baltag, Oxford University
