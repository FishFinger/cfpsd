*What is "AI, Cognitive Semantics and Computational Linguistics : New
Perspectives" ?*
Traditionally, the study of computational linguistics has been
performed by computer scientists, specializing in the application of
computers to the processing of a natural language.
Today, computational linguists often work as members of
interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in
linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in
the languages relevant to a given project), and computer
scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the
involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial
intelligence, mathematicians, logicians, cognitive scientists,
cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and
neuroscientists, among others.
Computational linguistics must become more connected to the cognitive
sciences through the development of cognitive semantic theories.
Computational linguistics is connected to artificial intelligence
through the development of methods and algorithms for all aspects of
language analysis and their computer implementation. We can see
language analysis divided into two parts: theoretical analysis and
application.  The theoretical aspect includes standard areas studied
in linguistics: semantics, syntax, and morphology. Semantic theories
guide the development of syntactic theories and morphology. Semantic
theories can be based on some specific features of computation, but at
the present stage of research, there is a gap between linguistic
analysis and computer applications in two senses: there are many
computer applications without linguistic theoretical support and,
conversely, there are a number of theoretical methods with no computer
implementation. Another epistemological feature of the present stage
of research is that most computational linguistic methods are focused
on statistical approaches. The advantage of these methods is that they
are easy to apply but the drawback is that they distort the
qualitative and genuine cognitive features of language.
The goal of this track is to provide an international forum for
discussing the latest approaches in subfields of computational
linguistics related to cognitive semantics and to artificial
intelligence. Its aim is also to exchange ideas concerning the way of
building efficient systems of language analysis based on cognitive
semantic models.
Its mission is to prove the increase of interaction between modeling
in cognitive semantics and computer implementation: a good system
analysis requires a good semantic model as framework. On the other
hand, the need for semantic models other than those based on
statistical methods has to be proved.

*What is the GOAL of the track?*
This track is intended to present works ranking from logical and
mathematical models in syntax and semantics (logic of objects,
topological theories of time and space etc.) as foundations of the
design and analysis to natural language processing systems.

*Who should be interested?*
Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an
integral part of the conference. They provide researchers in focused
areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a
forum for interaction among the broader community of artificial
intelligence researchers.
Topics of interest are in all areas related to artificial
intelligence.  For example, last year's special tracks included: AI
Education; AI Planning and Scheduling; Applied Natural Language
Processing; Case-Based Reasoning; Data Mining; Design, Evaluation, and
Refinement of Intelligent Systems (DERIS); Games and Entertainment;
Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Semantics, Ontologies, and Computational
Linguistics; and Uncertain Reasoning.

*What kind of studies will be of interest?*
Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to AI,
Cognitive Semantics and Computational Linguistics. Topics of interest
may include (but are in no way limited to)

   1. cognitive semantics,
   2. logics of language,
   3. language modeling,
   4. computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax;
      semantics).



Any paper related to cognitive semantics and computational linguistics
is welcome.


Note: We invite *original* papers (i.e. work not previously submitted,
in submission, or to be submitted to another conference during the
reviewing process).

Other tracks at FLAIRS that may be of interest to those submitting to
this track include *Cognition and AI: Capturing Cognitive Plausibility
and Informing Psychological Processes, Applied Natural Language
Processing (http://tinyurl.com/kwwzs8)* in a total of 14 special
tracks that accompany the main conference.

*Submission Guidelines** for the track*
Interested authors (for the general track or the special topic) should
format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines
http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php. The papers should
be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to
another conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages
(2 pages for a poster) and are due by November 23^rd , 2009. For
FLAIRS-23, the 2010 conference, the reviewing is a double blind
process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on submitted
papers to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be submitted as
PDF through the EasyChair conference system, which can be accessed
through the main conference web site (http://www.FLAIRS-23.info). Note
: do not use a fake name for your EasyChair login - your EasyChair
account information is hidden from reviewers. Authors should indicate
the special track for submissions.  *The proceedings of FLAIRS will
be* *published by the AAAI*. Authors of accepted papers will be
required to sign a form transferring copyright of their contribution
to AAAI. An author of each accepted paper is required to register,
attend, and present the paper at FLAIRS.  Please, check the website
http://www.flairs-23.info/ for further information.

*Conference Proceedings*
Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the
conference proceedings, which will be published by AAAI Press.
