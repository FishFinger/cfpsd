Meeting Description:

WSCLA 14

The Workshop on the Structure & Constituency of the Languages of Americas
will be held the 3rd through the 5th of April, 2009.
Purdue University (in collaboration with Ball State University) 

Call for Papers

Extended Deadline: February 2, 2009
send abstracts to http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/wscla14-2009
Participants whose abstracts are accepted will be eligible for financial support.

The objective of this workshop has traditionally been to encourage linguists who
are engaged in the formal study of the languages of the Americas to exchange
ideas across theories, language families, generations of scholars, and most
importantly, the academic and non-academic communities involved in language
maintenance and revitalization. 

Invited Speakers:
Peggy Speas, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Keren Rice, University of Toronto

We invite the submission of abstracts:
(1) for a general session in the core areas of formal linguistics (phonetics,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) within any formal theoretical
framework, on any of the languages of the Americas.  
(2) for two Special Sessions:
- Session on Modality and Evidentiality
The languages of the Americas present morpho-syntactic devices for Modality and
Evidentiality that transcend the range of devices that are found in Western
languages, thus yielding a higher potential for discovering unforeseen
properties of the human ability for Language.
- Session on New Data: Verbal Classifiers

The goal of this session is to generate new data and ideas about a specific
grammatical phenomenon that is typically under-represented in the literature.
The topic this year refers to morphemes, affixed to the verb, that encode
information about an argument's size, shape or position.
There will also be an invited session devoted to 
- Linguistics beyond Linguistics: Science and Education

Abstracts can be sent for 20-min papers or for a poster session. Please submit:
1 page letter size (a 2nd page for references and examples may be included). 
1" margins throughout	
11pt Time Roman font size (min.) 

Abstracts should be sent to: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/wscla14-2009 
Extended Deadline:  February 2, 2009
Contact info: wscla14@purdue.edu

Participants whose abstracts are accepted will be eligible for financial support.
