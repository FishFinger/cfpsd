4th International Workshop on Constraints and Language Processing
              20-21 August 2007, Roskilde, Denmark

               http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2007.html


Affiliated with CONTEXT07, http://context-07.ruc.dk


DEADLINE for submissions: May 29, 2007 - EXTENDED

The CSLP@Context07 workshop considers the role of constraints in 
the representation of language and the implementation of language
processing. This theme should be interpreted inclusively:
contributions from linguistics, computer science, psycholinguistics
and related areas are welcome, and an interdisciplinary perspective
is of particular interest.

The collocation with the CONTEXT07 conference underlines the
application of constraints for context comprehension and discourse
modelling.

Motivation
----------
Constraints are widely used in linguistics, computer science, and
psychology. How they are used, however, varies widely according to the
research domain: knowledge representation, cognitive modelling,
problem solving mechanisms, etc. These different perspectives are
complementary, each one adding a piece to the puzzle. For example,
linguistics proposes in-depth descriptions implementing constraints
in order to filter out structures by means of description languages,
constraint ranking, etc. The constraint programming paradigm, on the
other hand, shows that constraints have to be taken as a systematic
whole and can thus play a role in building the structures (or can even
replace structures). Finally, psycholinguistics investigates the role
of constraint systems for cognitive processes in comprehension and
production as well as addressing how they can be acquired.

Invited speakers:
-----------------
2 or 3 distinguished researchers will be announced on the workshop
web pages.

Topics
------
The workshop seeks contributions from different areas working with
constraints in relation to language including, but not limited to the
topics

 . Constraints in human language comprehension and production
 . Context modelling and discourse interpretation
 . Acquisition of constraints
 . Constraints and learning
 . Cross-theoretical view of the notion of constraint
 . New advances in constraint-based linguistic theories
 . Constraint satisfaction (CS) technologies for NLP
 . Linguistic analysis and linguistic theories biased towards CS or
   constraint logic programming (CLP)
 . Application of CS or CLP for NLP
 . CS and CLP for other than textual or spoken languages, e.g.,
     sign languages and biological, multimodal human-computer
     interaction, visual languages, 
 . Probabilistic constraint-based reasoning

Submissions
-----------
Authors are invited to submit extended abstract or a full paper of up
to 12 pages. Papers should be prepared as PDF files using the format
for Springer's LNCS/LNAI series,
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Each submission will be commented by two or three reviewers.

Preliminary proceedings are distributed at the workshop and,
depending on number and quality of submissions, a volume of revised
and selected papers are under considerations at an international
publisher.

Please submit papers as PDF files, following the guidelines
at http://control.ruc.dk/CSLP2007.html

---------------
Submission deadline May 29, 2007 - EXTENDED
Notification June 14, 2007
