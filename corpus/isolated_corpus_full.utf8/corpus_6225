Full Title: Evidentiality Across Languages & Linguistic Disciplines=20

Date: 25-Mar-2010 - 26-Mar-2010
Location: Leiden, Netherlands=20
Contact Person: Sonja Gipper
Meeting Email: sonja.gipper@mpi.nl

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Semantics=20

Call Deadline: 01-Jan-2010=20

Meeting Description:

Evidentiality is a linguistic category that is concerned with marking
information sources. Evidentiality is receiving more and more attention in
several subdisciplines of linguistics, like typology and formal semantics.
Furthermore, more and more languages are discovered that have evidentials a=
s a
grammaticalized category. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together
researchers from diverse linguistic disciplines, and researchers working on
diverse languages, to present and discuss their work. We would like researc=
hers
to profit from insights of other disciplines and other languages or languag=
e
areas. Furthermore, the goal of the workshop is to set up a network of peop=
le
working on evidentials and on languages that have evidentials. The workshop
could also serve as an introduction to the topic for researchers who are no=
t
familiar with the topic, so we also invite people who do not work on eviden=
tials
to attend.=20

Call for Papers

Abstracts are invited for presentations from 20 to 45 minutes. Please indic=
ate
on your abstract how long you intend to speak. Any topic related to
evidentiality is welcome. Examples of possible topics are:
- cross-linguistic variation of evidential systems
- formal semantics of evidentials
- grammaticalized evidentials compared to other evidential strategies
- the relation of evidentiality to other knowledge-related categories, such=
 as
epistemic modality
- pragmatic features of evidentials
- the use of evidentials in everyday interaction or narrative discourse
- evidentiality from an anthropological perspective

Please send your abstract to Sonja Gipper: sonja.gipper@mpi.nl. If you have=
 any
further questions, feel free to contact any of the organizers:

Neele M=FCller: n.muller@let.ru.nl
Martine Bruil: m.bruil@hum.leidenuniv.nl
Sonja Gipper: sonja.gipper@mpi.nl

The deadline for abstract submission is 1 January 2010. We hope to be able =
to
accept all abstracts, but in case there are too many, we will let you know =
by 15
January about acceptance.
