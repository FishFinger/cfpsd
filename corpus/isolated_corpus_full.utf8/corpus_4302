~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CALL For Papers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>>> 2nd International Conference on Arabic Resources and Tools <<<

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 22-23 April 2009, Cairo, Egypt <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~http://www.medar.info/conference ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The second international conference on Arabic Language Resources and
Tools is organised by the MEDAR consortium in Cairo, Egypt. MEDAR
(Mediterranean  Arabic  Language  and  Speech  Technology)  is a
follow-up of NEMLAR, and is supported by the European Commission.


>>>>Conference aims <<<<<
Language Resources (LRs) are a central component of the linguistic
infrastructure, necessary for the development of HLT applications and
products, and therefore for industrial development. In this conference
we will focus on Arabic language technology and on the necessary
language resources and tools for both research and commercial
development of language technology for Arabic. Multilingual language
technology is a particular focus, as well as general methodologies.
The other important aspect for the promotion of Arabic language
technology is cooperation: Cooperation is extremely important for the
advancement of the field, be it cooperation between European, Arabic
and American partners, cooperation between Arabic partners,
cooperation between research and industry etc. MEDAR will present its
first proposal for a Cooperation Roadmap, and will seek discussion and
collaboration for its final version. The aim of this conference is to
provide a forum for the discussion of the state-of-the-art for Arabic
resources and tools, in particular for machine translation and
multilingual information retrieval, discuss problems and
opportunities, exchange information regarding LRs and tools, their
applications, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and
needs, requirements coming from the new e-society, both with respect
to policy issues and to technological and organisational ones. The
roadmap discussions will in particular bring in policy issues and
collaboration and organisation issues.
