                        CALL FOR PAPERS
                             for
    The 1st Workshop on Information Credibility on the Web (WICOW)

                      in conjunction with
 The 21st Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for Artificial
Intelligence


          June 18 and/or 19, 2007, Miyazaki, Japan

                   http://kc.nict.go.jp/wicow/

                         Cohosted by
          The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence
                             and
 The National Institute of Information and Communications Technology


<Description>

As computers and computer networks become more sophisticated, a huge
amount of text-based information, such as that found in web documents,
emails, and business related documents has been accumulated and
circulated.  Such information gives people a framework for organizing
their daily life.  Moreover, this information is starting to have a
strong influence on governmental policy, and how businesses are
managed.  A well-functioning society needs technology that can be used
to manage this wealth of text-based information.  This technology
would be able to handle a wide range of tasks: extracting credible
information related to a given topic (particularly when the query has
returned answers from large documents); organizing this information;
clarifying the background, the facts, and the various opinions and the
distribution of them, and so on.  The aim of this workshop is to
provide a forum for discussion on issues related to information
credibility criteria.


<Areas of Interest>

The workshop will focus on how to evaluate the credibility of
information.  In particular, contributions will be solicited
which address, but are not limited to, the following areas of
interest:

  * Information content analysis for credibility evaluation (topic
    extraction, opinion analysis, etc.).
  * Identification and characterization of the sender to enable the
    user to evaluate their credibility.
  * Information credibility evaluation based on superficial
    characteristics of information.
  * Information credibility evaluation based on reputation.
  * Information credibility evaluation for user-generated content
    (blogs, SNSs, etc.).
  * The relationship between information credibility evaluation and
    the concepts of trust and credibility.
  * Sociological aspects of information credibility.
  * Psychological aspects of information credibility.
  * Utilization of social networks for information credibility
    evaluation.
  * Issues concerning credibility of grassroots/citizen journalism.
  * Establishing information dissemination processes that promote the
    dissemination of credible information.

<Invited Speaker>

  Dr. Yunbo Cao (Microsoft Research Asia)

  Title of the talk is forthcoming.
  The topic will be on expert search.
