   FOURTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SCALABLE SEMANTIC WEB KNOWLEDGE BASE
                            SYSTEMS (SSWS2008)

           http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~yug2/ssws08/home.htm

  At the 7th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2008) Karlsruhe,
       Germany, October 26-30, 2008 http://iswc2008.semanticweb.org/

***************************************************************************

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

The  series of  SSWS workshops  aim at  creating a  forum for  discussing a
critical issue for the Semantic Web, that is, scalability.  As the Semantic
Web evolves, scalability becomes increasingly important. This workshop will
focus on addressing  the scalability issue with respect  to the development
and deployment of  knowledge base systems on the  Semantic Web.  Typically,
such systems deal with information described in Semantic Web languages like
OWL and RDF(S),  and provide services such as  storing, reasoning, querying
and debugging.  There are two basic requirements for these systems.  First,
they have  to satisfy the application's semantic  requirements by providing
sufficient reasoning support.  Second, they  must scale well in order to be
of  practical use.   Given the  sheer size  and distributed  nature  of the
Semantic Web, these requirements  impose additional challenges beyond those
addressed by earlier knowledge base systems.  This has been well recognized
by  the community  as demonstrated  by  the excitement  around the  billion
triples challenge.

We expect that the above issue is going to challenge the Semantic Web for a
long period of time and significant effort is needed in order to tackle the
problem.   This  workshop   seeks   to  bring   together  researchers   and
practitioners to  share their recent ideas and  progresses towards building
scalable knowledge base systems for the Semantic Web.

The workshop will be centered on  the discussion of three major aspects: 1)
foundations,   methods   and   technologies   for   pushing   forward   the
state-of-the-art;  2)   performance  evaluation  and   related  principles,
methodologies and  tools; 3) identification of important  issues and future
research directions.  Topics of interest  for the workshop include, but are
not limited to:

  * Semantic Web repositories
  * Reasoning mechanisms, techniques and systems
  * Query evaluation and optimization
  * Performance evaluation and benchmarks
  * Distributed knowledge base systems and P2P systems
  * Large scale knowledge base management
  * Semantic Web-based information integration

We expect that  the outcome of the workshop will  benefit not only Semantic
Web  developers but also  Semantic Web  evaluators and  end users.  We also
welcome   participants  from   related  disciplines   such   as  Artificial
Intelligence, Databases and Information Integration.
