The First International Conference on Spanish and Portuguese Dialogue Studies /
Estudios del Diálogo, is centered on theoretical and practical contributions to
the field of Spanish Discourse Analysis and Pragmatics, with a particular
emphasis on the context of dialogue. The main purpose of the conference is to
present current work in this area by international scholars and to strengthen
ties among the researchers of the Dialogue Studies Group of the Asociación de
Lingüística y Filología de América Latina (ALFAL), thus promoting international
projects.  The conference is jointly sponsored by the University of Texas at
Austin and the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León.

The conference program is organized around plenary sessions and simultaneous
sessions for presenting papers.  Simultaneous sessions will deal with all topics
related to dialogue, with particular interest in: 

- Conversation Analysis 
- Dialogue and Politics
- Discourse and Ideology 
- Dialogue in the Media 
- Second Language Acquisition and Dialogue
- Dialogue and Identity 
- Pragmatics in Dialogue
- Politeness  in Dialogue 
- Dialogue in Literary Texts

Official languages of the conference will be English, Spanish, and Portuguese. 

For the call for papers and submission of abstracts, please see:
Web address:  http://www.utexas.edu/cola/conferences/spds/
All the abstracts will go through a formal evaluation before the papers can be
included in the program of the Conference. We anticipate that selected papers
will be published in a volume subsequent to the conference. Individual papers
will be allotted 20 minutes for the presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.
Only papers presented by the original  authors will be included in the  program.
