Meeting Description

ACL Workshop: Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing 2007 (BSNLP 2007)
with Special Theme: Information Extraction and Enabling Technologies

June 29, 2007 
Prague, Czech Republic
http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007 

Second Call for Papers

Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing 2007 (BSNLP 2007)
with Special Theme: Information Extraction and Enabling Technologies

BSNLP will be held in conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/) and is co-organised by the
European Commission's Joint Research Centre

Topic and Motivation

The recent political and economic changes in Central and Eastern Europe and the
related on-going enlargement of the European Union brings into focus new
cultures and languages.  Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic group
have an outstanding role because of their rich cultural heritage and the
widespread use - over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the
Balto-Slavonic languages, with the focus on Information Extraction (IE) and
enabling technologies for this language family. The task of IE is to identify a 
predefined set of concepts from natural language text. The spectrum of IE tasks
ranges from named-entity recognition, through relation extraction and
co-reference resolution to the identification of complex events and
cross-document entity profile extraction. Although a considerable amount of 
IE-related work exists, most of the studies are concentrated on a few major
languages. Research on this topic, as well as on general-purpose NLP tools in
the context of Balto-Slavonic languages, is still in its early stage and is
progressing relatively slowly. Due to some specific phenomena like the highly
inflectional character and relatively free word order, a construction of IE
systems and other language processing tools (question-answering, text
summarization, machine translation) for these languages is an intriguing and
challenging task.

This workshop can be seen as the follow-up to the successful workshop on
Information Extraction for Slavonic and Other Central and Eastern European
Languages (http://lml.bas.bg/IESL2003) held in conjunction with the 
RANLP 2003 conference. It is also related to the EACL 2003 workshop on
Morphological Processing of Slavic Languages (http://nl.ijs.si/mpsl03). In
particular, we would strongly encourage submissions describing systems,
resources or solutions that are made available to the wider public, as 
these would help to promote computational linguistics applications for these
languages.

Areas of Interest include, but are not limited to

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP, in particular in the context of
IE and enabling technologies

- text segmentation
- morphological analysis
- morphology models
- morpho-syntactic disambiguation
- named-entity recognition 
- named-entity disambiguation (e.g., geo-referencing)
- named-entity lemmatisation
- term and keyword extraction
- name variant recognition and merging
- syntactic parsing and chunking
- co-reference resolution
- word sense disambiguation
- corpus-based knowledge acquisition

B. Multilingual IE frameworks and techniques applied to these languages

- tools and resources (freely available for research purposes will be preferred)
- experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and processing resources
- comparative evaluation between languages

C. IE solutions for these languages

- scenario template filling / event extraction
- relation extraction
- automatic pattern learning
- corpus studies and statistical techniques for IE
- IE from Web sources
- IE-based ontology population
- IE evaluation
- IE techniques for Question/Answering and Answer Extraction
- Utilisation of IE-based techniques in other NLP applications

Intended Audience

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages, in particular on IE and core
technologies supporting IE for these languages. The workshop will give an
opportunity to exchange ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle problems
in this field of research, and to make available resources more widely known.

Submission

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of completion
of the reported results. In particular, an overlap with previously published
work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and 
significance/relevance to the workshop. 

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL 2007 main-conference
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
recommend using either the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word style file,
which can be found at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided. 

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than April 1, 2006 using the
submission webpage http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007/submission 
(or http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS12/submit.html). 

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. Authors of
accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce camera-ready
versions of their papers for inclusion in the ACL workshop proceedings.

Important Dates

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: April 1
Notification of Acceptance: April 25
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.

Location

Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is located in the centre of Europe.
It is one of the most valuable historical city reserves in Europe. The
historical core of the city is listed in the UNESCO World Cultural and Natural
Heritage Register. The workshop itself will take place in the TOP HOTEL Praha,
located in the quiet neighbourhood of the Prague 4 district, only 15-20 minutes
from the historic centre of Prague. 

Prague is easily reachable by car, bus or train from central Europe (only 3-hour
drive from Vienna or Budapest or 4 hours from Berlin or Munich), by cheap
flights from the rest of Europe, and by several direct flights from overseas.
