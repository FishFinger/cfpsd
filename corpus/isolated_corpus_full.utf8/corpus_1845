Meeting Description:

The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories will be
held on December 7-8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway. The Workshop theme will include
relevant innovative work in treebanking, including the relations and links
between, and possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic annotation; furthermore, work on parallel treebanks
and/or cross-language annotation schemas, on the relation between linguistic
theory and the practice of annotation, and on applications of information in
treebanks will be discussed as well.

Final Call For Papers

The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories
will be held on December 7 to 8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway. Submissions
are invited for papers, posters and demonstrations presenting high
quality, previously unpublished research in the topics described
below. Contributions should focus on results from completed as well as
ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods,
ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or
computational. Papers and poster abstracts will be published in paper
as well as online proceedings.

Workshop Motivation and Aims

Treebanks are language resources that include annotations at levels of
linguistic structure beyond the word level. They typically provide
syntactic constituent or dependency structures for sentences and
sometimes functional and predicate-argument structures. Treebanks have
become crucially important for the development of data-driven
approaches to natural language processing, human language
technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in
general. There are a number of ongoing projects aiming at compiling
representative treebanks for specific languages. In addition, there
are projects that develop tools or explore annotation beyond syntactic
structure and beyond a single language.

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown
that there is a relation between formal linguistic theory and the
practice of syntactic annotation. Therefore the connection between
treebank development and linguistic theories and paradigms merits
attention.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. We encourage interested
potential participants to read the proceedings of the previous
workshops (see the webpage for links).

Workshop Topics

The workshop invites submissions that discuss relevant innovative work
in treebanking, including the relations and links between, and
possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic annotation; furthermore, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation
schemas, on the relation between linguistic theory and the practice of
annotation, and on applications of information in treebanks are
encouraged as well.

Invited Speaker

An invited lecture will be presented by Julia Hockenmaier (University
of Pennsylvania).
