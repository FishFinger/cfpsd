Meeting Description:

Special Theme: Diversity, Context, and Structure

on language and communication).

Australian University; linguistic anthropology of aboriginal languages)
- Janet Holmes (Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand; workplace
communication, humor, politeness)
- Kasia Jaszczolt (University of Cambridge, UK; the semantics-pragmatics
interface, the pragmatics of temporality)
- Bruna Franchetto (Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;  syntax,
ergativity, ethnography of speaking, cognitive anthropology, language policy and
idigenous education)
- Yasuhiro Katagiri (Future University - Hakodate, Japan; dialogue structure and
processes, human-computer interaction, AI, crosscultural comparison)
Provisional topics to be announced soon.

Conference Chair: Keith Allan (Monash University)
 
Local Site Committee: The other members of the Local Site Committee are:  Marisa
Cordella (Monash University), Nicholas Evans (University of Melbourne/Australian
National University, Canberra), Zosia Golebiowski (Deakin University), Heinz Leo
Kretzenbacher (University of Melbourne), Randy LaPolla (LaTrobe University),
Anna Margetts (Monash University), Howard Nicholas (LaTrobe University), Gillian

(Odense), Jan-Östman (helsinki), Marina Sbisà (Trieste), Anna-Brita Stenström
(Bergen), Jef Verschueren (Antwerp; ex officio as IPrA Secretary General),
Yorick Wilks (Sheffield), John Wilson (Belfast) 

Call for Papers

Panel Proposals on any topic studied from a pragmatic perspective (including,
but not restricted to the special theme) are invited by 1 September 2008.
However, to give organizers of accepted panel proposals more time to get their
panels organized (as outlined below), proposals received by 15 June 2008 will
already be evaluated before the end of June; this will allow for amendments in
response to the committee's comments, so that re-evaluation after 1 September is
possible for proposals that are not already accepted in June.
  
Contributions to panels (subject to the panel organizer's prior approval - see
below) and individual proposals for lectures and posters, on any topic studied
from a pragmatic perspective (including, but not restricted to the special
topic), are invited by 15 October 2008. 

Registration for early birds is already possible. 

For any unanswered questions:

IPrA Secretariat 
P.O. Box 33 (Antwerp 11) 
B-2018 Antwerp 
Belgium 
ann.verhaert@ipra.be   

- All submission procedures are web-based (i.e., paper copies or faxes will not
be accepted, and e-mail attachments are permissible only if web-based submission
does not work after following the recommendations you find when clicking 'Help'
in the opening screen of the IPrA website http://ipra.ua.ac.be). 
- The submission of proposals presupposes IPrA membership; i.e. the submission
module will not be available to you if you are not recognized as a current
member; membership can be arranged instantly through the website. 
- Panel Proposals (deadlines 15 June 2008 - for early approval - and 1 September
2008; see above) have to consist of a brief outline (max. one average A4 or
Standard-size page, single spacing, Times pt 12; i.e. ca 500 words) of the theme
and purpose of the panel, with a first indication of the people the organizer(s)
anticipate(s) to be involved as speakers. Panel organizers are asked to avoid,
if at all possible, restricting their panels to an in-group; openness and
diversity of perspectives is compatible with topical coherence. Immediately
after the deadline the conference committee will, on the basis of the outline
(weighed against other proposals in relation to the total number of available
time slots), decide (i) whether the proposal is accepted, and (ii) how many
90-minute slots can be made available for the accepted panel. From that moment
onwards, the organizer(s) is/are free to fill the allotted sessions in the way
they see as most suitable to the theme and the purpose of their panel. Not all
panels need to take the same form; some may work with sessions that emphasize
discussion; others may want to fit in more (brief) oral presentations; the
minimum number of presentations planned for one 90-minute session, however,
should be three. Though it is the panel organizer(s) who take(s) active
responsibility for the quality of the contributions to their panel (i.e. they
decide what is accepted), abstracts should, for all panel contributions, be
submitted by the 15 October 2008 deadline that will be handled for individual
submissions (see below). Panel organizers are expected to guide their
participants in this process, so that all formal requirements are duly fulfilled
and the abstracts live up to the expected international standards. This
procedure implies that no-one can submit contributions for panels without the
prior consent of the panel organizer(s). As a list of accepted panels will be
available at the end of June (for early submissions) and in the second half of
September (for later submissions), prospective participants are of course
welcome to seek such prior consent by contacting the organizer(s) of the panel
of their choice. As the number of slots for panels is limited, however, most
participants will have to make an individual submission. 
- Individual proposals for lectures and posters should take the form of a brief
abstract (equivalent to max. one average A4 or Standard-size page, single
spacing, Times pt 12; i.e. ca 500 words); mind the 15 October 2008 deadline. It
is the individual submitter's choice to submit for oral presentation (lecture)
or a poster. For oral presentations, 30-minute slots will be available
(including discussion time). Posters will be up for one whole day; during that
day, there will be a free hour that can be used only for looking at and
discussing posters. IPrA actively encourages the submission of posters;
experience tells us that they often lead to more serious interaction and result
in more lasting and fruitful contacts than oral presentations. 
- Because of heavy competition for slots in the program, no-one can be
considered for more than one contribution of which he or she is the first author
(whether panel contributions, lectures or posters). Anyone may be involved in a
second or even a third paper if someone else is the first author and will be
present at the conference as well. The web-based submission system recognizes as
first author only the one who handles the submission process. While there is a
restriction on the number of contributions of which one may be the first author
(one only!), presenting a paper is always compatible with taking the role of
organizer of a panel or acting as a discussant in a panel. 
- Note that abstracts should not be programmatic; they should be based on
research that is completed or clearly in progress, with a well-formulated
research question, and with a good description of the types of data used (if the
work is empirical) and of the approach. For posters, a clear description of a
research design may be acceptable, as this can lead to useful discussions in the
early stages of a project.
