FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on NLP for Educational Resources

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
September 26, 2007
Borovetz, Bulgaria

Workshop site
http://ixa.si.ehu.es/NLP_ER2007

RANLP 2007 site
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

In this workshop we will discuss how using NLP techniques in the=20
automatic treatment of texts
can support pedagogic goals. There are well over 100 documented projects =

at the use of NLP in
Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) (Heift &=20
Schulze, 2007); however,
there are significantly fewer publications about the use of NLP=20
techniques in educational areas
other than language learning.
This workshop will bring together NLP and ICALL researchers with=20
colleagues who are
investigating NLP treatment for other educational purposes. Our main aim =

is to discuss how we
can use NLP in the automatic treatment of corpora for pedagogical=20
purposes as well as in the
analysis of learner corpora (students free responses).
The contributions of this workshop will share at least two keywords: NLP =

and Education. We
especially seek contributions about the adaptation and integration of=20
NLP techniques in the
following areas:

* Automatic exercise and task generation
* Controlled language
* Error diagnosis and remediation
* Essay assessment
* Fostering language awareness
* Automatic generation of didactic resources
* Analysis of learners' interlanguage
* NLP for processing texts in ICALL environments
* Learner corpora
* Learning of textual analysis (in linguistics, literature, =
anthropology, .)
* Student modelling
* Text production tools (e.g. grammar and spell checkers)
* Translator training
