Meeting Description:

Annual Conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies 2009

The annual conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies (BASEES) will take place at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge
(UK), between 28-30 March 2009. 

Call for Papers

Final call: Deadline for abstracts is 15 September 2008

Abstracts are invited for individual 20-minute papers or for entire panels (3
papers) in any area of Slavonic linguistics and philology, including applied
linguistics and translation studies. We are particularly keen to receive
proposals for complete panels but we are also happy to receive paper proposals
that the organizing committee will try to put together into panels. The working
languages of the conference are English and Russian.

At this year's conference we had around thirty papers in theoretical
linguistics, historical linguistics, applied linguistics, language teaching, and
translation studies presented by academics and graduate students from
institutions in the UK and abroad. The annual convention as a whole brings
together scholars from a wide range of disciplines including literary studies,
linguistics, cultural studies, history, economics, politics, sociology, film and
media studies as they pertain to Central and Eastern Europe and to the former
Soviet Union.

To propose a panel or a paper you will need to fill in a proposal form,
available from the BASEES website at http://www.basees.org.uk/conference.shtml
There are separate forms for panels and papers and each is in .rtf format. You
should download the appropriate form and fill it in electronically, and send it
electronically to the stream organiser for linguistics (David
Willis,dwew2@cam.ac.uk) And to the conference email address
(basees.conference@lbss.gla.ac.uk).

We are particularly keen to hear from postgraduate students. Postgraduate
members of BASEES who present papers are eligible to apply for financial
support towards their conference costs. All enquiries regarding membership
should be addressed to the membership secretary, Dr Jenny Mathers
(zzk@aber.ac.uk). The application procedure is described on the website.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is 15 September 2008.

Further details are available on the website at www.basees.org.uk.

Apologies for cross-posting of this notice.

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Language Acquisition; Semantics;

Call Deadline: 19-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

In recent years, organizations have used multiple methods and approaches to
design their strategic and action plans. In this context, knowledge-based
systems have received increased attention as being instrumental to strategy
formulation. The synergy of these approaches with knowledge management
initiatives is intuitive and their use in a common framework is discussed in
this workshop to show the importance of methods and instruments to mapping and
assessing the knowledge assets of an organization.

This workshop will focus on the theoreticians and practitioners concerned with
developing methods and systems that assist the knowledge management process and
assessing the suitability of such methods. Thus, the workshop includes all
aspects of acquiring, modeling and managing knowledge, and their role in the
construction of knowledge-based systems. Knowledge acquisition still remains the
bottleneck for building a knowledge based system. Reuse and sharing of knowledge
bases are major issues and no satisfactory solutions have been agreed upon yet.
There is a wide range of research. Much of the work in this field has been
knowledge acquisition. The advent of the age of digital information has brought
the problem of knowledge reuse and knowledge evaluation. Our ability to analyze,
evaluate and assist user in reusing knowledge present a great challenge of the
next years. A new generation of computational techniques and tools is required
to support the acquisition, the reuse and the evaluation of useful knowledge
from the rapidly growing volume of information. All of these are to be discussed
in this workshop. 

Call for Papers

A non-exhaustive list of topics for the workshop includes the following: 

Tools and techniques for knowledge acquisition, knowledge update and knowledge
validation
Web-based approaches for knowledge management
CSCW and cooperative approaches for knowledge management
Agent-based approaches for knowledge management
Evaluation of knowledge acquisition techniques
Knowledge acquisition, machine learning and knowledge discovery
Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modeling
Ontology-based approaches for knowledge management
Integration of knowledge acquisition techniques with decision support systems
Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge
Knowledge-based approaches for knowledge management
Corporate Semantic Webs for knowledge management
Peer-to-peer approaches for knowledge management

Submission
You are invited to submit full length papers, not exceeding 4-6 pages (3000-4000
words) in length, in two-column format including diagrams and references,
following IEEE publication guidelines. Papers that do not follow these
guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits. 

Papers must be submitted electronically to the contact point in PDF format. All
workshops will be published by IEEE in a single total conference volume and
fully indexed by IEEE Xplore.
Selected papers after extension will be published in the following journals:
- International Journal of Computer Aided Engineering (ICAE)
- Journal of Digital Information Management (JDIM) (ISSN 0972-7272)
- International Journal of Computational Intelligence Research (ISSN 0973-1873)
All papers will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members on the
basis of technical quality, originality, clarity, and relevance to the track
topics listed below. Accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings. At least one author of each paper must attend the workshop to
present the paper.

Send your paper in pdf format to davy.monticolo@utbm.fr
