Meeting Description:

GLS 2007, Language and Globalization: Policy, Education and Media, will explore the interaction between language and the processes of globalization. 

The Georgetown Linguistics Society is pleased to announce

GLS 2007
Language and Globalization: Policy, Education and Media

March 30-April 1, 2007     
Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.

GLS 2007, Language and Globalization: Policy, Education and Media, will explore the interaction between language and the processes of globalization. We invite papers that address the following questions: 
 
Policy:
-	How is globalization driving implicit and explicit language policies?
-	What role does language play in the development and implementation of migrant/migration policy? 
-	What is the relationship between transnationalism and language policy? 
-	How are countries integrating language and citizenship requirements?
-	How has language policy influenced and been influenced by immigration and integration?
 
Education:
-	How does globalization affect critical language awareness in education?
-	What is the relationship between globalization and current trends in language education policy (especially in regards to the teaching of critical languages)? 
-	What is the role of language assessment? What are its advantages and dangers, particularly in light of globalization?
 
Media:
-	How does globalization shape public discourse (and vice versa)?
-	How has language use in the public sphere (signage, verbal announcements, etc.) been influenced by globalization? 
-	How has globalization impacted language commodification?  

These topics are given as suggestions rather than limitations. Any papers relevant to the policy, education, and media effects of language related to globalization are welcome.
 
GLS 2007 is a conference run by the graduate students in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University. The conference will include three days of oral and poster presentations by students as well as invited plenary addresses and panel discussions by established scholars. The following website will be launched by the beginning of October: http://www.glsconf.com.

Confirmed Plenary Speakers:

Dr. David Block
