Meeting Description

Academic written discourse has become a central topic of research in recent
years, inasmuch as competent written academic communication is recognised as
essential for success in the academic world. Interpersonality (in academic
discourse) has been analysed from several perspectives, which have proved very
fruitful not only to understand but also to problematise the writer-reader
relationship and the role of relevant issues such as culture, discipline,
individual style, (non)native use of the language, the role of English as a
lingua franca, among others. 

The aim of this conference is to provide a multiperspective arena for both
theoretical and experimental approaches which can contribute to and stimulate
the current debate on the issues mentioned above.
http://www.unizar.es/interlae/conference08.html 

We would like to remind you of the InterLAE International Conference 
on Interpersonality in Written Academic Discourse, which will he held 
at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) from 11-13 December 2008. 

We would also like to bring to your attention that the deadline for the
submission of proposals is 14 March 2008.
