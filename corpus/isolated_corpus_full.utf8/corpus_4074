ESWC 2009 CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS

DEADLINE APPROACHING: January 7, 2009

http://www.eswc2009.org/calls/tutorials

6th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2009)
31 May - 4 June 2009, Heraklion, Greece
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The 6th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2009) will  
present the latest results in research and applications of Semantic  
Web technologies. In addition to the regular research and workshop  
programme, ESWC2009 invites tutorials on relevant topics of interest  
(see below). A tutorial should present the state of the art of a  
Semantic Web area, enabling attendees to fully appreciate the current  
issues, main schools of thought and possible application areas.

ESWC2009 tutorials may be either for a full day or for a half day.  
Unless there is a clear rationale we will give preference to half day  
tutorials over full day tutorials.

Tutorials proposed for ESWC2009 should cover one topic in appropriate  
depth and present it in a appropriate manner which enables attendees  
to fully comprehend and apply emerging Semantic Web technologies.  
Although tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects, we  
encourage hands-on sessions where appropriate.


SUBMISSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages and should contain the  
following information:

* abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC2009 website)
* tutorial description (aims, target audience, presentation method,  
  technical requirements)
* justification for the tutorial, including timeliness and relevance  
  to ESWC2009
* outline of the tutorial content and schedule
* information on presenters (name, affiliation, expertise, experiences  
  in teaching and in tutorial presentation)

Tutorial proposals are to be submitted as single pdf files using the  
ESWC2009 Tutorials submission system at

http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=eswc2009tutorials

Submitted proposals that follow the above guidelines will be reviewed  
by the ESWC2009 organizing committee with respect to relevance of the  
topic, content and presentation method, and presenters expertise.


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Proposal Submissions: January 7, 2009 (11:59 pm Hawaii time)
* Notification: January 21, 2009

For accepted tutorials, the presenters will need to submit the  
material for hand-outs (the slide sets and / or additional  
information; software installation and usage guides for practical  
hands-on sessions) to the organization committee for preprinting and  
placement on the ESWC2009 website.
For each accepted tutorial, we offer one 50% discount of the Early- 
Bird registration fee.


TUTORIAL CHAIRS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Philippe Cudre-Mauroux (MIT, US)
Chiara Ghidini (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, IT)
