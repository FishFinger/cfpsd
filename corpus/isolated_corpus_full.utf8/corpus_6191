Meeting Description:

The theme for the 2010 Poetics and Linguistics Association conference is The 
Language of Landscapes.

'Landscapes' may, of course, be interpreted both literally and metaphorically.
At a literal level, locations such as Genoa and Liguria, to remain within the
confines of the conference venue, offer spectacular landscapes that have
inspired artists in the past. However, other geographical areas may also be
treated, and borders may be crossed over, into, for instance, the relationship
between the visual arts and visual techniques in writing. Turning to the
non-literal level, landscapes may be interpreted on two broad levels. 

First, the term may be applied to the depiction of individuals or of social
contexts. Themes in this domain my differ widely, and include individual and
collective identities, otherness, context and its influence on the individual
and/or social landscape, multiculturality, the sense of community and
individuality in urban and non-urban settings, landscapes and language variety,
space as symbolic in linguistic terms, landscapes and technological change,
urbanization, centers and margins, semiotic and/or cultural systems, artistic
movements and periods. Individual works, authors or movements may also be
analysed. Second, the term may also refer to all the methodological tools
deployed by stylisticians. Notwithstanding these horizons, proposals are
welcomed on other subjects within the remit of PALA. 

Call for Papers 

Abstracts for papers should be of approximately 300 words in length, with
keywords, and should also include (1) a title, (2) the name, status and
affiliation of the speaker(s), (3) a contact email address, and (4) a postal
address. An abstract should also clearly state what the research question is and
also describe the chosen methodology and the text(s)/data that will be discussed. 

Please also let us know if you require any special equipment. All conference 
rooms have a computer, data projector, and screen. Papers will be a maximum of
20 minutes in length, with a maximum of 10 minutes for questions. 

Special interest groups workshops (SIGs)

Proposals for official PALA special interest group (SIG) workshops are also 
welcomed. Abstracts should be of approximately 300 words in length and should 
include the names, status, affiliations, email addresses, and postal addresses 
of all participants. Workshops will be scheduled for Wednesday, July 21st, 2009,
for periods ranging from 2 to 4 hours depending on number of contributors
presenting. Other proposals for workshops that are not official PALA SIGs will 
be submitted to both the conference organization committee and the PALA board 
for approval.

The deadline for abstracts is January 15th, 2010
Abstracts for the conference must be sent to both the following e-mail 
addresses:
j.douthw@virgilio.it
j.douthw@gmail.com

- The deadline for proposing SIGs to the conference organization committee is 
October 15th, 2009.
- The conference organization committee will communicate acceptance of SIGs to 
the SIG convenors by October 30th, and post the titles of the accepted SIGs on 
the conference website.
- The organization of each SIG will be the responsibility of the convenor(s) of
that SIG, so all proposals for contributions to a SIG must be addressed to the
convenor(s) of that SIG by January 15th. The Convenor's e-mail will be posted 
on the website together with the announcement of the inclusion of the SIG in the
conference programme.
- All contributors, whether to the individual papers section of the conference
or to a panel, will be informed of acceptance by February 28th.
