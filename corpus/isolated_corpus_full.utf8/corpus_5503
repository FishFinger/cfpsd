Pragmatics: quarterly publication of the International Pragmatics
Association (Ipra) - Call for Papers - Special issue on 'The pragmatic
study of language and the challenge of poststructuralism'

Go to http://www.analysedudiscours.net/wiki.php?wiki=3Dspecialissue for the
online submission form and for details concerning the selection procedure.

The fields of study labelled under the headers of post-structuralism and
pragmatics are hard to distinguish from each other in disciplinary terms.
The poststructuralist insights from theorists such as Michel Foucault,
Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler, Ernesto
Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, have proliferated throughout the humanities in
fields as diverse as linguistics, anthropology, geography, sociology, and
political philosophy. The same can be said of a variety of approaches which
fall under the category of pragmatics. These stem from a number of
formative traditions which include the Wittgensteinian programme that
resonates in speech act theory (e.g. John Austin, John Searle), in works on
the logic of conversation (e.g. Grice), in ethnomethodology and
conversation analysis, in psycholinguistics, in the French school of
enunciation theory and in social theory (Harold Garfinkel, Erving Goffman,
J=FCrgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann). Both pragmatics and poststructuralist
thought consider meaning as the unstable product of social and discursive
practices. Yet, there is a great deal of discussion on what these
perspectives mean and on what kind of theoretical and methodological
practices are indexed by them. As with any over-coded, over-determined, and
politicized signifier, it is highly unlikely that one definition will
provide a definitive answer or hegemony that fixes any one meaning once for
all. Given that both pragmatics and post-structuralism stress the
reflexivity, heterogeneity and contingence of meaning production, we want
to explore the common ground for a dialogue between the traditions under
investigation. It is the aim of this special issue to provide a platform
for the historical, theoretical, methodological, empirical and political
points of exchange. While all of the contributions to this special issue of
Pragmatics focus on the historical, the theoretical, the methodological
and/or the empirical implications of a (re)articulation of pragmatic and
poststructuralist authors and perspectives, we would especially welcome
contributions which apply theoretical insights to empirical objects.=20
