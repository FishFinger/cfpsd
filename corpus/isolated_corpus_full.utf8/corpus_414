Meeting Description:

This workshop, co-organized by Janet Grijzenhout and Baris Kabak
(University of Konstanz), will investigate the nature of
morphosyntax-phonology mapping and the principles that govern the
prosodization of morphological elements, with special attention to
cross-linguistic variation. It will take place at the University of Siegen,
Germany as part of the 29th Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics
Society (DGfS).

Workshop description:

Systematic phonological alternations often seem to be bound to a particular
phonological domain. The theory of Prosodic Phonology (e.g. Selkirk 1980,
1986; Nespor & Vogel 1986; Hayes 1989) holds that speech is hierarchically
organized into constituents that are not necessarily isomorphic to
syntactic constituents. Previous literature has largely dealt with how
morphological elements can be organized into the prosodic structure. It has
been reported that within individual languages as well as
cross-linguistically, there can be systematic differences in the
prosodization of function words. For instance, Selkirk (1984) states that
the principles of syntax-phonology mapping are blind to the presence of
functional categories. Closer examination reveals that not only function
words, but also various other morphological elements - e.g. suffixes and
clitics - may vary with respect to the way they are prosodized. Moreover,
within one syntactic category, elements may belong to different prosodic
categories (e.g. the German preposition statt 'instead of' seems to
function as a prosodic word, whereas in 'in' does not form a prosodic word
of its own). Furthermore, morphological elements may behave as part of a
prosodic domain x with respect to a (set of) phonological process(es) while
they may seem to belong to another domain in the context of other processes
(e.g., Turkish instrumental suffix -lA, which undergoes vowel harmony but
fails to receive word-level right-most default stress). Also, the rules
posited for morphology-phonology mapping seem to be based on circular
logic: a syntactic category may determine the onset of a particular
prosodic domain in which, for example, stress assignment takes place, but
at the same time presence or absence of primary stress suggests the
inclusion or exclusion of a particular element from that very same domain.
Apart from various issues concerning phrasing algorithms and
syntax-phonology mapping, the precise nature of the prosodic hierarchy and
its various components have also been controversial. While, for instance,
several researchers questioned the necessity of the Clitic Group (e.g., Zec
1988; Booij 1988; Peperkamp 1997), others argue that the theory predicts
even less structure than is attested across the languages of the world
(e.g., recent work by Balthasar Bickel and colleagues at the University of
Leipzig). 

In this workshop, we are specifically interested in the nature of the
morphosyntax-phonology mapping and the principles that govern the
prosodization of morphological elements, with special attention to
cross-linguistic variation. In this respect, the following issues will be
addressed: (i) how much of mapping rules is given by universal grammar
versus language-specific principles?, (ii) do morphological elements bear
any (lexical) information with respect to their morphophonological
categorization (cf. Inkelas 1989) and how should that information be
represented?, (iii) is there a set of universal prosodic domains and are
all of the domains suggested in the literature necessary?

We invite linguists who work on prosodic phonology and
phonology-morphosyntax interface from all perspectives and methodologies
including those working in the fields of typology, historical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and language modeling. General theoretical discussions
and analyses of language-specific issues are equally welcome.

Talks will be 20 minutes each, with 10 minutes of discussion.
 
Abstract submission procedure: 
Please send an anonymous abstract of max. 500 words, as a text file or Word

Meeting Description:

The Department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto is pleased to
invite abstracts for submission to the International Conference on East
Asian Linguistics to be held at the University of Toronto, November 10-12,
