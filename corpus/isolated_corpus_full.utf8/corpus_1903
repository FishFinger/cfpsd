Meeting Description:

Research in ESP: Distance and Proximity 

GERAS - Groupe d'Étude et de Recherche en Anglais de Spécialité - is the
French national research association in English for Specific Purposes. For
the past 30 years its activities have covered a wide range of fields (the
specialised discourses of law, economics, science and medicine,
politics...) and approaches (discourse analysis, professional cultures,
lexicology and terminology, cross-linguistic studies, EAP and ESP teaching
and learning,...), in four main research strands: linguistics, culture,
didactics and new technologies.

The theme chosen for the 29th annual Conference is ''Research in ESP:
Distance and Proximity''. We welcome contributions that examine the
phenomena of distance and proximity from various angles along all four
research strands:

- Applied linguistics, discourse analysis: proximity and distance between
oral/non-verbal communication and writing in specialised discourses,
reader- and writer-in-the-text,...; intratextual distance (anaphora,
cohesion, collocational networks,...); similarities and differences between
popularized and esoteric discourses,...

- Culture: proximity and distance between and within various academic and
professional cultures; proxemics; peripheral participation of novices or
NNS in their discourse/professional communities; distance and proximity
between ESP linguists and specialists of other disciplines, between ESP/EAP
training courses and professional practices and needs,...

- Didactics: distance learning; proximity and distance between learners
during tasks, between the didactic approaches of different LSPs (English,
French, Spanish,...); strategies to help learners distance themselves from
the learning process and metacognition,...

- Technology: use of computational linguistics to analyse similarities and
divergences in various specialised discourses; technological tools for ESP
(distance) learning environments...

The conference also aims to provide an opportunity for researchers working
in these diverse areas, which at first sight may appear rather remote from
each other, to come closer together and bridge the distance between their
different interests, approaches and objects of research. A Round Table will
enable the collective discussion and synthesis of the various workshop
presentations, while a Research Forum will give participants the
opportunity to exchange on, and share, their research programmes and
publications.

From a more long-term perspective, the 29th GERAS Conference is the first
in a series of annual conferences which will address the broader topic of
'Multiplicity and Unity in ESP', chosen by the steering committee of GERAS
as the overarching theme for forthcoming meetings. This common theme aims
to explore both the rich diversity, and also the fundamental unity of ESP
studies, and thereby contribute to enhancing the specificity and
epistemological legitimacy of the domain.

Proposals for papers must be submitted by December 15, 2007. They should be
sent by e-mail to Dr. Elizabeth Rowley-Jolivet <elizajo@wanadoo.fr> using
the paper submission form that will be available on the conference website
<http://www.geras2008.fr> from 1st October 2007.

Meeting Description:

Workshop: Current Methods in Historical Semantics 

We invite abstracts or suggestions for papers for a one-day workshop on Friday
29th August, which will be held as part of ICEHL 2008. 

The overall aim of the workshop is to focus on how historical semantics has
changed and developed as a discipline, and to examine current perspectives on
the changing lexicon of English. More specifically, the workshop will provide an
opportunity to review research techniques that are currently used in diachronic
semantics. Discussions of fundamental methodological aspects have been seriously
neglected in historical meaning studies and we feel there is a scope for
revisiting and reviving this issue in the proposed session. For that reason,
this workshop will aim to gather papers which use innovative, interdisciplinary,
and data driven methods that provide more rigorous and systematic evidence for
description and explanation of diachronic semantic processes.

Full details of the session (including the full abstract) are available via the
workshops link at http://www.icehl.de/

Organisers: Kathryn Allan (University of Salford, UK) & Justyna Robinson
(University of Sheffield, UK)
