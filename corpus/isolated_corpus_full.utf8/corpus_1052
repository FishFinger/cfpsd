Coordinator/General Chair:

   H. R. Arabnia, PhD
   Professor, Computer Science
   Editor-in-Chief, The Journal of Supercomputing (Springer)
   The University of Georgia
   Department of Computer Science
   415 Graduate Studies Research Center
   Athens, Georgia 30602-7404, USA
   email: hra@cs.uga.edu

Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft/full paper
   (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 20, 2007 (hra@cs.uga.edu). E-mail submissions
   in MS Doc or PDF formats are preferable (postal mail submissions
   are also fine.) All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable
   (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a
   particular typesetting format to prepare their papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to
   7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously published
   or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The first page of
   the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,
   postal address, email address, and telephone number for each author.
   The first page should also identify the name of the author who will
   be presenting the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical
   keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally,
   the name of the conference that the paper is being submitted to must be
   stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, impact,
   and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts in the field
   who are independent of the conference program committee.  The referees'
   evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of the program
   committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
   the paper has been submitted to.  The track chair will make the final
   decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one
   member of the program committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy
   of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing; artificial
   intelligence; imaging science; databases; simulation; software
   engineering; embedded systems; internet and web technologies;
   communications; computer security; and bioinformatics.) Many members
   of the program committee for individual conferences include renowned
   leaders, scholars, researchers, scientists and practitioners of the
   highest ranks; many are directors of large research laboratories,
   IEEE Fellows, heads/chairs of departments, deans and provosts.
   Each committee also includes two Student Members (in their final stages
   of their PhD programs) who are identified as such.  Refer to the
   conference web sites for the list of members of program committee.

Co-Sponsors (a partial list):

   Academic Co-Sponsors of WORLDCOMP'07 include:
     - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Laboratory,
       MIT (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
     - Statistical Genomics and Computational Biology Laboratory,
       Department of Statistics, Harvard University (Cambridge,
       Massachusetts)
     - Texas Advanced Computing Center, The University of Texas at
       Austin (Austin, Texas)
     - Statistical and Computational Intelligence Laboratory of
       Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana)
     - University of Iowa's Medical Imaging HPC Lab (Iowa City, Iowa)
     - Institute for Informatics Problems of the Russian Academy of
       Sciences, Moscow, Russia);
   Other Co-sponsors include:

     - GRIDtoday
     - STEM Education Society
     - HPCSoft, HPC Software Inc.
     - International Technology Institute (ITI)
     - H2cM - Hodges' Health, UK

Location of Conferences:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort hotel, Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA.  This is a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities
   and over 3,000 rooms.  The hotel is minutes from the airport with
   24-hour shuttle service to and from the airport.  This hotel has many
   recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools, sunning
   decks, Easy River water ride, wave pool, lighted tennis courts,
   health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool, sauna, ...),
   nightly shows, snack bars, many restaurants, shopping area, bars, ...
   Many of these attractions are open 24 hours a day and most are suitable
   for families and children.  The negotiated room rate for conference
   attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within walking distance
   from most other attractions (major shopping areas, night clubs, free
   street shows, Golf courses, ...).

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the 25 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
   fields.  Most of these conferences have been evaluated and determined
   to be top tier research conferences
   (see http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/index.html for an example).
   We anticipate to have 2000 or more attendees from over 75 countries
   participating in the 2007 joint conferences.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
   among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
   inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
   outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
   applications) will be covered during the conferences.

Important Dates:

   Feb.  20, 2007:    Submission of full/draft papers (about 5 to 8 pages)
   March 20, 2007:    Notification of acceptance
   April 20, 2007:    Camera-Ready papers and Registration due
   June 25-28, 2007:  The 2007 World Congress in Computer Science,
                      Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
                      (WORLDCOMP'07 - 25 joint conferences)
