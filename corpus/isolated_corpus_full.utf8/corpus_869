=========================================================

The conference is organized by the Institute of Formal and Applied
Linguistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in
Prague ("Univerzita Karlova v Praze"), Czech Republic, the oldest
University in Europe north of the Alps (founded in 1348).

The conference will take place in the TOP HOTEL Praha, located in the
quiet neighborhood of the Prague 4 district, only 15-20 minutes from the
historic center of Prague. The hotel can accommodate up to 1000
participants on-site (with a small number of dormitory rooms available
nearby). The hotel offers one auditorium, three large lecture rooms,
number of smaller rooms for tutorials and workshops, several restaurants
and cafes and lot of open air space for walks and informal discussions.
The conference banquet and a conference concert will take place in the
historic buildings in the city center -- one in the Municipal Hall
(built in the Art-nouveau style of the early 20th century) and the other
in the 14th century main University Hall.

=========================================================
:: 4. Mentoring Service
=========================================================

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from regions
of the world where English is not the language of scientific exchange.
Many authors from these regions, although able to read the scientific
literature in English, have little or no experience in writing papers in
English for conferences such as the ACL meetings. The service will be
arranged as follows. A set of potential mentors will be identified by
Florence Reeder (Mitre, USA), who has agreed to organize this service
for ACL-07. If you would like to take advantage of the service, email a
draft of your paper in pdf, ps or doc format to:

    freeder @ mitre.org (Florence Reeder).

The paper should arrive before December 15, 2006. An appropriate mentor
will be assigned to your paper and the mentor will get back to you by
January 15, 2007, at least seven days before the deadline for the
submission to ACL-07 program committee. Please note that this service is
for the benefit of the authors as described above. It is not a general
mentoring service for authors to improve their papers.

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send a
message to Florence Reeder.

    Joakim Nivre (Växjö University and Uppsala University, Sweden)

Important Dates:

    Submission deadline for tutorial proposals:  December 15, 2006

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for the
Tutorial Program for the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL-07), to be held in Prague, Czech
Republic.

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of computational linguistics and
its applications are sought. Especially encouraged are
cross-disciplinary tutorials that educate the community about recent
technical advancements in neighboring disciplines that are of interest
to computational linguistics, or introduce relevant algorithms and
theory that may be "old hat" to specialists in these areas but are still
unfamiliar to part of the natural language processing community.

site:

:: 7. Student Research Workshop Call for Papers
=========================================================

Student Research Workshop Co-Chairs: 

    Violeta Seretan (University of Geneva, Switzerland)
    Chris Biemann (University of Leipzig, Germany)
    Ellen Riloff, Faculty Advisor (University of Utah, USA)

Important Dates:

    Paper submissions deadline:  January 23, 2007
    Notification of acceptance:  March 23, 2007
    Camera ready papers due:     April 27, 2007


The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the
general audience and from selected panelists -- experienced researchers
who prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop.
As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis is
on work in progress.

and submission details, see the conference web site:
