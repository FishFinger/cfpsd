There is a growing interest in the theme "law, language & discourse" in the
academic field, government policy formulation and legal requirements. The
appeal of this book will show the actionable knowledge it could bring to
this field of research and practice. This book will explore the various
disciplines of law and linguistics - both oral and written. 

The book will reflect the interdisciplinary nature of language and
discourse study in legal settings. The themes include:
-	Theories and conceptualization of legal discourse
-	Legislation, Language, and Discourse,
-	Linguistic issues in courtroom,
-	Language issues in legal settings,
-	Semiotic analysis of legal phenomena including legal terms, legal genres.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
