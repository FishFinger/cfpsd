DE@CAiSE'09: Workshop on Domain Engineering

In Conjunction with CAiSE'09, June 9th, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
http://www.bgu.ac.il/~sturm/DE@CAiSE09/

 

Domain Engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with building
reusable assets, such as specification sets, patterns, and components, in
specific domains. A domain in this context can be defined as an area of
knowledge that uses common concepts for describing phenomena, requirements,
problems, capabilities, and solutions. 
The purpose of domain engineering is to identify, model, construct, catalog,
and disseminate artifacts that represent the commonalities and differences
within a domain. Although applicable to different engineering disciplines,
domain engineering methods has been recently receiving special attention in
the information systems era. Some of the reasons for this interest are the
increasing variability of applications, the need to obtain and share
expertise in different, evolving domains, and the trend towards reusing IS
artifacts and knowledge about them.

Domain engineering addresses two main layers: the domain layer, which deals
with the representation of domain elements, and the application layer, which
deals with information systems artifacts related to the domain. 
More specifically, information systems applications, their components, and
their descriptions are included in the application layer,whereas their
common and variable characteristics, as can be described, for example, by
ontologies or emerging standards, are generalized and presented in the
domain layer. 

Similarly to information systems engineering, domain engineering includes
three main activities: domain analysis, domain design, and domain
implementation, which are carried out in the domain layer. However, domain
engineering also supports inter-layer activities, namely interactions that
exist between the domain and application layers. Specifically, domain layer
artifacts may be used for creation and validation of the specifications of
application layer artifacts, while applications may be generalized into
domain artifacts in a process of knowledge elicitation. 

Domain engineering as a discipline has practical significance as it deals
with methods and techniques that may help reduce time-to-market, product
cost, and projects risks on one hand, and improve product quality and
performance on the other hand. 

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners in the area of domain engineering in order to define the
topic, identify possible points of synergy, common problems and solutions,
and discuss visions for the future of the area. In particular, the workshop
will focus on the interaction between information systems engineering and
domain engineering.

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

.Conceptual foundations of domain engineering .Methods and techniques to
support domain engineering .Ontology engineering .Development and management
of domain assets .Domain-driven requirements engineering .Application
derivation (i.e., how to use domain artifacts in the application layer)
.Variability management .Domain engineering techniques in support of reuse,
validation,
  and knowledge management
.Theoretical and empirical evaluation of domain engineering methods
  and techniques
.Case studies and practice reports related to domain engineering 


Submission Guidelines

Prospective workshop participants are invited to submit a paper related to
the purpose of the workshop. The workshop will accept three types of
submissions:

1.Completed Research - this type of papers should include evidence to
support the  contribution (e.g. in the form of data analysis, proof of
concept, or case studies) and  discussion on research findings and their
theoretical and practical significance. 
 The paper should not exceed 5,000 words (excluding references and
appendices).
 Accepted completed research papers will be allocated 30 minutes for
presentation  (including questions & answers) during the workshop.  

2.Research-In-Progress - this type of papers can report on research that is
under way  with preliminary results available at the time of the conference.
The paper should not exceed 2,500 words (excluding references and
appendices). 
Accepted research-in-progress papers will be allocated 15 minutes for
presentation (including questions & answers) during the workshop.

3. Position papers - this type of papers can include lucid and
well-supported statements  and suggestions on domain engineering, e.g.,
directions for the discipline, open questions,  criticism on the
state-of-the-art, and novel approaches. 
Accepted position papers will be allocated 15 minutes for presentation
(including questions & answers) during the workshop.

All three types of papers may refer to theoretical and/or practical issues.

Papers should be written in Springer LNCS style (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for details). The paper type
(completed research, research-in-progress, or a position paper) should
explicitly be indicated  after the paper title. In addition, the paper
abstract should not be longer than 150 words.
 As the workshop will apply double-blind reviews process, the papers should
not indicate t heir authors. Papers should be submitted through the on-line
system at
http://www.bgu.ac.il/~sturm/DE@CAiSE09/DE_%20CAiSE09_Submission.htm .  


Publication


The paper selection will be based upon the relevance of a paper to the main
topics, on its quality and on the potential to stimulate discussion in the
workshop. 
Accepted papers will be published in the online CAiSE'2009 workshop
proceedings. 
In addition, authors of some selected papers will be asked to consider
submitting revised version of the papers as chapters in a book on Domain
Engineering to be edited by the workshop co-chairs and published by
Springer.
