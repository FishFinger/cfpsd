SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS



Workshop on NLP for Educational Resources



In conjunction with RANLP-2007

September 26, 2007

Borovetz, Bulgaria



The submission system is available at the Workshop site

http://ixa.si.ehu.es/NLP_ER2007



RANLP 2007 site

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/



In this workshop we will discuss how using NLP techniques in the automatic

treatment of texts can support pedagogic goals. There are well over 100

documented projects at the use of NLP in Intelligent Computer-Assisted

Language Learning (ICALL) (Heift & Schulze,2007); however, there are

significantly fewer publications about the use of NLP techniques in

educational areas other than language learning.

This workshop will bring together NLP and ICALL researchers with colleagues

who are investigating NLP treatment for other educational purposes. Our main


aim is to discuss how we can use NLP in the automatic treatment of corpora
for

pedagogical purposes as well as in the analysis of learner corpora (students


free responses).

The contributions of this workshop will share at least two keywords: NLP and

Education. We especially seek contributions about the adaptation and
integration

of NLP techniques in the following areas:



* Automatic exercise and task generation

* Controlled language

* Error diagnosis and remediation

* Essay assessment

* Fostering language awareness

* Automatic generation of didactic resources

* Analysis of learners? interlanguage

* NLP for processing texts in ICALL environments

* Learner corpora

* Learning of textual analysis (in linguistics, literature, anthropology, ?)

* Student modelling

* Text production tools (e.g. grammar and spell checkers)

* Translator training
