Last Call for Papers

Deadline extended: March 31, 2009

Working languages: English, Russian

During the last 150 years, the Baltic languages (Lithuanian, Latvian and the
extinct Old Prussian) have received much attention from linguists specializing
on historical and comparative linguistics, etymology and Indo-European
reconstruction. However, many aspects of the structure of these languages and
their dialects remain understudied and virtually unknown to the general
linguistic community. This is due not only to the lack of comprehensive
typologically-oriented grammatical descriptions but also to the fact that Baltic
languages are generally underrepresented in the 'discourse' of contemporary
linguistics, even in comparison to many much more 'exotic' language families
outside Europe. 

The conference "Contemporary approaches to Baltic linguistics" aims at bridging 
the gap between Baltic languages, on the one hand, and current trends in
linguistic theory and language typology, on the other, and at attracting
attention of the linguistic community to this rich and yet not fully
investigated group of languages. 

Invited Speakers:
Axel Holvoet (Institute of Lithuanian Language, Vilnius)
Bj√∂rn Wiemer (University of Mainz)

We are soliciting abstracts on any aspect of phonology, morphology, syntax, and 
semantics of Lithuanian and Latvian, as well as of their dialects and Old
Prussian. We especially encourage abstracts putting the Baltic data in a broader
cross-linguistic context, as well as theoretically-oriented work based primarily
on the material of Baltic languages. Please note, that although the topic of the
conference does no exclude diachronic studies (e.g. issues of grammaticalization
or historical syntax, as well as any interesting aspects of Old Lithuanian and
Old Latvian), we will not accept abstracts on etymology and comparative
reconstruction.

Abstracts in Word and/or PDF format should be anonymous and must not exceed 2
pages (examples and references included), 12pt font size with 2 cm margins on 
all sides. Abstracts must be sent to baltistica.inslav@gmail.com no later than 
March 31, 2009. Please, include in the body of the message your name,
affiliation, and the title of your submission.

Notification of acceptance: ca. April 20, 2009.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any

your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
