                    Seventh International Workshop on

                        COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS

                             (IWCS-7)

             January 10-12, 2007, Tilburg, The Netherlands

                            -------------
                             Endorsed by SIGSEM,
        the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Semantics

                            -------------


                FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Tilburg University will host the Seventh International Workshop on
Computational Semantics (IWCS-7), which will take place on 10-12
January 2007. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers interested in any aspects of the computation, annotation,
extraction, and representation of meaning in natural language, 
in multimedia objects, and in multimodal messages.


                          TOPICS OF INTEREST

Areas of special interest for the workshop will be computational
aspects of semantic theories; theoretical aspects of the design of
language understanding systems and systems for multimodal
communication; and semantic annotation of natural language and
multimodal utterances. Papers are invited that are concerned with
topics in these and closely related areas, including, but not 
limited to, the following:

  * construction of representations of meaning in natural language
  * methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
  * modelling and using context in semantic interpretation
  * machine learning of semantic structures
  * formal and computational methods in lexical semantics

  * computing meaning in multimodal interaction
  * construction and use of underspecified semantic representations 
  * semantic concepts and ontologies
  * approaches to textual entailment
  * the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts

  * the semantic web and natural language processing
  * semantic aspects of language generation
  * the semantics-pragmatics interface in computational perspective
  * semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
  * shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning


                   ISO/SIGSEM JOINT WORKING GROUP MEETING

Immediately preceding IWCS-7, on 8-9 January 2007, a joint meeting 
will be held of the ISO TC 37/SC 4 Thematic Domain Group on Semantic 
Content, and the ACL SIGSEM Working Group on the Representation of 
Multimodal Semantic Information. This meeting will be open to (a 
limited number of) IWCS-7 participants. For more information see

                       SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Three types of submission are solicited: full papers, short papers,
and project abstracts.

Full papers
-----------
Full papers are original papers of maximally 12 pages, that will be 
published in the workshop proceedings and will have a full oral 
presentation of about 30 minutes at the workshop.

Short papers
------------
Short papers are mini-papers of maximally 4 pages, that will be 
published in the workshop proceedings and have a very brief ('flash') 
oral presentation at the workshop. Authors of short papers are 
invited to also put up a poster and participate in a poster session.

Project abstracts
-----------------
Project abstracts are brief descriptions of 2 pages of ongoing,
recently completed, or starting projects. They will be published in
the workshop proceedings and will be presented in a poster session.

Submission formats
------------------
Submissions of all three types should be in postscript or pdf
format and prepared with LaTeX; see the IWCS-7 website
http://let.uvt.nl/research/ti/sigsem/iwcs/iwcs7 for more
information on the style files to be used. The page limits
presuppose standard 11 point Computer Modern font. Final versions
of accepted contributions will have to be submitted as LaTeX
source files to facilitate publication of the proceedings; we also
aim at publishing a selection of accepted papers in book form
after the workshop.

Email your postscript or pdf file to: computational.semantics@uvt.nl

Submission deadlines
--------------------
For full papers the submission deadline is 25 September 2006; for
short papers and project abstracts the deadline is 1 November.
