Short Title: ELF Forum 

Date: 06-Mar-2008 - 08-Mar-2008
Location: Helsinki, Finland 
Contact Person: Niina Hynninen
Meeting Email: ELF-Forum@helsinki.fi.

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Psycholinguistics;
Sociolinguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

The status of English is dramatically changing as a foreign language: native
speakers of the 'core' varieties of British and American English are far
outnumbered by bilingual speakers. A global language in contact with a notable
proportion of the world's languages cannot remain intact: its speakers come from
an enormous variety of language backgrounds, proficiency levels and educational
systems. All speakers, including native speakers of English must accommodate to
other varieties; the emergent features may show simplification, universal
features, entirely new patterning, or all of these. 
The ELF Forum invites papers addressing any aspect of English as a lingua
franca: linguistic, sociolinguistic, or cognitive, or issues of teaching,
ideology or language policy relevant to ELF. 

Invited Speakers:

Prof. Jennifer Jenkins, University of Southampton
Prof. Barbara Seidlhofer, University of Vienna
Prof. Mirjaliisa Charles, Helsinki School of Economics

Round Table chaired by Prof. Robert Phillipson, Copenhagen Business School

Abstracts: 150-200 word abstracts should be sent by September 15, 2007 to
ELF-Forum@helsinki.fi.

Registration from early October, after the abstracts have been reviewed.

Standard fee: 110 , full-time graduate students: 80 

More information concerning the programme and registration will follow on this
website soon.

Prof. Anna Mauranen (Chair), 
Dr. Anna Solin,
