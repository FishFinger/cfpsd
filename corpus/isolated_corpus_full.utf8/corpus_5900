Full Title: Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2009 

Call for Papers - Journal of NCOLCTL

The Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages 
(NCOLCTL, http://www.councilnet.org/jnclctl/index.htm) is soliciting 
articles for publication. As the official journal of the Council, the 
journal serves the professional interests of teachers, researchers, and 
administrators of less commonly taught languages in all settings and all 
levels of instruction. The Journal is refereed and published once a year.

Our general editorial focus is on policy, education, programs, advocacy, and 
research in the field of less commonly taught languages (all foreign 
languages except English, French, German, and Spanish). The envisaged 
segmentation of the Journal is as follows:

a. Methodology and Technology,
b. Academia,
c. Beyond Academia,
d. Social Embeddedness

The first section shall include papers focusing on broader theoretical and 
technological issues in all fields of less commonly taught languages. The 
second section will encompass reports about research and teaching in 
academia, at both K-12 and collegiate levels. The third section shall 
comprise papers addressing research and teaching in government and industry. 
Finally, the fourth section will address the issues of a broader social 
environment, ranging from heritage communities to advancing LCTLs in federal 
initiatives and legislation.

In preparing the manuscript, please use the latest edition of the 
Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), see 
http://www.apa.org/journals/authors/guide.pdf. Manuscripts should be a 
maximum of 25 pages (excluding references, charts, notes, etc.) and 
preferably submitted electronically via email attachment. Double-space the 
manuscript throughout, including notes, references, and tables, using 
12-point font with a 1.5 inch left margin. The manuscript should be 
accompanied by a 150 word (or less) abstract and a cover sheet containing 
the manuscript title, name, address, office and home telephone numbers, fax 
number, email address, and full names and institutions of each author. 
Because the manuscript will be blind reviewed, identifying information 
should be on the cover sheet only, and not appear in the manuscript.

While submissions are welcome at any point, only papers received by October 
31, 2009 will be guaranteed consideration for the 2010 issue of the Journal.
