Scope of the Conference
      

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished
research that has been validated to the level of the creation of a
functioning prototype. We are interested in large-scale solutions to
the problem of accessing the semantic content found in unstructured
text, images, video and audio. Research describing solutions to these
problems from the following perspectives:

 . Automatic indexing of video, images, and speech

 . Improved indexing of text, image, video and sound

 . Ontologies and unstructured data

 . Semantic Web and Ontologies for Full-Scale Information Retrieval

 . Automatically producing textual descriptions of images

 . Automatically adding metadata to video and sound

 . Indexing and retrieval of mixed-media documents

 . Indexing interactive documents

 . Natural interface dialogue

 . Multimedia question answering systems

 . Competitive Intelligence

 . Intelligent Search Agents

 . Multimodal search

 . Architectures for semantic treatment of very large databases

 . Algorithms for semantic treatment of very large databases

 . Comprehension-based question answering and summarization

 . Cooperative indexing between media

 . Semantics for less studied languages

 . Semantic representations and standards

 . Collaborative construction of semantic resources

 . Indexing multilingual collections

 . Automatic extraction of ontologies from unstructured data

 . Aligning multilingual ontologies

 . Language resources for multimedia indexing

 . Extracting semantic resources from raw data

 . Semantic annotation of blogs and videoblogs

 . Exploiting large-scale resources for e-learning

 . Structuring cultural heritage

 . Technological, commercial, industrial watch systems

 . Semantic access to large and open archives

Paper Submission

      

We welcome submissions both from the research community and industry
treating the main conference theme of treating the semantic content
of large quantities of text, images, videos, and sound.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed
or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of
completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where
appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment
of statistical significance for quantitative results is encouraged.

Submissions should contain original material that has not been
previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel
submission to other publications for a as well as a significant
overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly
indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance,
technical quality, and presentation.

Papers can be submitted in two categories: full papers and short
papers, where full papers are appropriate for describing substantial
research with well-evaluated results and short papers will typically
describe ongoing research and preliminary results. All accepted
papers in both categories will be published in the conference
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a
talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.

The long papers must not be more than 20 pages, on one column,
starting with an abstract. The short papers must not be more than 6
pages, on one column, starting with an abstract. Submissions should
be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees
and through the CID after the conference.

History

RIAO'2007 will be held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, USA from May 30 until June 1, 2007. This triannual
international conference is the 8th RIAO after conference held at
Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988), Barcelona (1991), Rockefeller University
(1994), Montreal (1997), Paris (2000), and Avignon (2004).

The RIAO conferences have always treated robust and large-scale
scientific and industrial solutions to information processing. The
conferences are composed of peer-reviewed scientific sessions and
demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and advanced
research prototypes.
