Announcement of the second call for papers for a seminar on "Corpora in =

Discourse Analysis and in Language Teaching"
Seminar to be held at the ESSE 9 conference in Aarhus, Denmark, 22-26 =

August 2008 (European Society for the Study of English, =

http://www.esse2008.dk/)

About the seminar:

The seminar explores the nexus of three areas related to linguistics: =

corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, and ELT/ESP. It approaches the =

corpus as a resource rather than as a goal, focusing on the various ways =

corpus-based methods are employed in discourse analysis and in teaching =

/ learning. This involves asking what types of structures and levels of =

language can be explored using corpora; what corpora can tell us about =

interaction; what the roles and mutual relationships of general and =

specialized corpora are; what corpus tools and interfaces are needed; as =

well as what dangers we face when working with corpora.

Seminar convenors:
Dr. Mark=E9ta Mal=E1 (Charles University), e-mail: Marketa.Mala@ff.cuni.cz
Dr. Paul Thompson (University of Reading), e-mail: =

p.a.thompson@reading.ac.uk

Call for proposals:

Those wishing to present a paper at this seminar are invited to submit =

200-word abstracts of their proposed papers directly to /both/ convenors =

of the seminar in question before 1 March 2008. The convenors will let =

the proponents know whether their proposals have been accepted no later =

than 21 March 2008.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an =

oral presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than =

simply reading their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced =

versions of the papers are circulated among all speakers in advance of =

the seminar in question. There will be a maximum of 5 papers in each =

two-hour seminar session, and convenors should plan so that there is =

time for discussion between speakers and with the audience.
