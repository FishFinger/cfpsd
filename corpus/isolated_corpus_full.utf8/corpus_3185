Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition (PsychoCompLA-2008)

July 23rd at CogSci 2008  - Washington, D.C.

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated computational models o=
f language acquisition. That is, models that are compatible with research i=
n psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics.

Invited Speakers:

* Rens Bod, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Am=
sterdam, Netherlands
* Damir Cavar, University of Indiana, USA and Zadar University, Croatia
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Jeffery Lidz, University of Maryland, USA
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Josh Tenenbaum, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA

Workshop History:

This is the fourth meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human Langu=
age Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, held in Geneva, Switz=
erland as part of the 20th International Conference on Computational Lingui=
stics (COLING-2004), PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual Meeting o=
f the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in Ann Arbo=
r, Michigan where the workshop shared a joint session with the Ninth Confer=
ence on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), and PsychoCom=
pLA-2007 held in Nashville, Tennessee as part of the 29th meeting of the Co=
gnitive Science Society (CogSci-2007).


Workshop Description:

The workshop will present research and foster discussion centered around ps=
ychologically-motivated computational models of language acquisition, with =
an emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades there has been =
a thriving research agenda that applies computational learning techniques t=
o emerging natural language technologies and many meetings, conferences and=
 workshops in which to present such research. However, there have been only=
 a few (but growing number of) venues in which psychocomputational models o=
f how humans acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus.

Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular intere=
st in light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest that=
 very young infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an audib=
le input stream. Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical 'ma=
chinery' to the task of grammar acquisition, with or without an innate lang=
uage component, remains an open and important question. One effective line =
of investigation is to computationally model the acquisition process and de=
termine interrelationships between a model and linguistic or psycholinguist=
ic theory, and/or correlations between a model's performance and data from =
linguistic environments that children are exposed to.

Special Theme:

Although the workshop program speaks to many facets of psychocomputational =
language acquisition modeling, the theme of the workshop this year is:

* Computational resources: How much is just right, and does it matter?

The computational resources (e.g., number of calculations per input datum, =
size of memory store, etc.) employed by current psychocomputational modelin=
g efforts vary tremendously from model to model. However, two important que=
stions have rarely been addressed. How well do a particular acquisition mod=
el's resources parallel the resources employed by a human language learner?=
 And, how relevant (or not) is it to establish such a relationship?

Topics and Goals:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that incorporate p=
sychologically plausible constraints;
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported studies;
* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
* Models that address learning bias in terms of innate linguistic knowledge=
 versus statistical regularity in the input;
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics;
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
* Models of language change and its effect on language acquisition or vice =
versa;
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or =
developmental theories (e.g., principles & parameters, optimality theory, c=
onstruction grammar, etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from cognitive psycholo=
gy, computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical sciences, lingui=
stics and psycholinguistics working on all areas of language acquisition. D=
iversity and cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal.
