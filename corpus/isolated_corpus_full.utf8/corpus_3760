Meeting Description:

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American Association for
Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human Language Technology Conference
(HLT) of NAACL. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working
towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural
language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through services such
as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text
summarization, and information extraction. NAACL HLT 2009 will feature full
papers, short papers, demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as well as pre-
and post-conference tutorials and workshops. 

Call for Papers

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American Association for
Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human Language Technology Conference
(HLT) of NAACL. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working
towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural
language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through services such
as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text
summarization, and information extraction. NAACL HLT 2009 will feature full
papers, short papers, posters, demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as
well as pre- and post-conference tutorials and workshops.
 
The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial, original, and
unpublished research in disciplines that could impact human language processing
systems.  We encourage the submission of short papers that can be characterized
as a small, focused contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an
opinion piece or an interesting application note. A separate review form for
short papers will be introduced this year.
 
NAACL HLT 2009 aims to hold two special sessions, Large Scale Language
Processing and Speech Indexing and Retrieval.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are understood
to be applied to speech and/or text:
- Large scale language processing
- Speech indexing and retrieval
- Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
- Information extraction
- Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human-robot interaction,
education and learning systems, assistive technologies, digital entertainment)
- Machine translation
- Summarization
- Question answering
- Topic classification and information filtering
- Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/genre analysis)
- Topic clustering
- Text and speech mining
- Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
- Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
- Language generation
- Speech synthesis
- Speech understanding
- Speech analysis and recognition
- Multilingual processing
- Phonology
- Morphology (including word segmentation)
- Part of speech tagging
- Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
- Word sense disambiguation
- Lexical semantics
- Formal semantics and logic
- Textual entailment and paraphrasing
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Dialog systems
- Knowledge acquisition and representation
- Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
- Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, annotated corpora)
- Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information structure and sources
in speech)  
- Multimodal representations and processing, including speech and gesture

Submission information will soon be available at: http://www.naaclhlt2009.org

Meeting Email: baltistica.inslav@gmail.com

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): Lithuanian (lit)
                     Latvian (lav)

Language Family(ies): Baltic 

Call Deadline: 25-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

The conference aims at bringing together researchers working on different
aspects of the Baltic languages in a typological and theoretical perspective. 

Call for Papers

During the last 150 years, the Baltic languages (Lithuanian, Latvian and the
extinct Old Prussian) have received much attention from linguists specializing
on historical and comparative linguistics, etymology and Indo-European
reconstruction. However, many aspects of the structure of these languages and
their dialects remain understudied and virtually unknown to the general
linguistic community. This is due not only to the lack of comprehensive
typologically-oriented grammatical descriptions but also to the fact that Baltic
languages are generally underrepresented in the 'discourse' of contemporary
linguistics, even in comparison to many much more 'exotic' language families
outside Europe. 
The conference "Contemporary approaches to Baltic linguistics" aims at bridging
the gap between Baltic languages, on the one hand, and current trends in
linguistic theory and language typology, on the other, and at attracting
attention of the linguistic community to this rich and yet not fully
investigated group of languages. 

Invited speakers:
Axel Holvoet (Institute of Lithuanian Language, Vilnius)
Björn Wiemer (University of Mainz)

Working languages: English, Russian

We are soliciting abstracts on any aspect of phonology, morphology, syntax, and
semantics of Lithuanian and Latvian, as well as of their dialects and Old
Prussian. We especially encourage abstracts putting the Baltic data in a broader
cross-linguistic context, as well as theoretically-oriented work based primarily
on the material of Baltic languages. Please note, that although the topic of the
conference does no exclude diachronic studies (e.g. issues of grammaticalization
or historical syntax, as well as any interesting aspects of Old Lithuanian and
Old Latvian), we will NOT accept abstracts on etymology and comparative
reconstruction.

Abstracts in Word and/or PDF format should be anonymous and must not exceed 2
pages (examples and references included), 12pt font size with 2 cm margins on
all sides. Abstracts may be submitted in English or in Russian. Abstracts must
be sent to baltistica.inslav@gmail.com no later than March 25, 2009. Please,
include in the body of the message your name, affiliation, and the title of your
submission.

Notification of acceptance: ca. April 20, 2009.
