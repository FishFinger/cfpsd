Full Title: Register and Context 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Forensic Linguistics; General Linguistics; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

This is a call for papers for the first issue of Register and Context which
will appear in March 2008.

Register and Context is seeking submissions of previously unpublished
manuscripts on any topic dealing with occupational discourse. For this
first issue, we are accepting submissions from a range of linguistic
perspectives, both theoretical and applied. We especially welcome both
practical and research focused articles. Articles should have a clear focus
and be written so that they are accessible to a broad audience of linguists
and language professionals, including those individuals who may not be
familiar with the particular subject matter addressed in the article.
Articles should report on original research or present an original
framework that links previous research, linguistic theory, and current
practices. Full-length articles should be no more than 7500 words in length
and should include an abstract of no more than 200 words. We encourage
articles that take advantage of the electronic format by including
hypermedia links to multimedia material both within and outside the article.

Manuscripts should be prepared in accordance with the Publication Manual of
the American Psychological Association (currently, the 5th Ed.)

Manuscripts should be submitted as an .rtf file to
submit@registerandcontext.de no later than November 15th, 2007. 

The blind peer reviewing process requires anonymous manuscripts. Avoid any
information in the article which could reveal your identity. 

You should provide your name, address, title of the paper, and a short
abstract (no more than 500 words) in your cover email.

For more information, go to: www.registerandcontext.de
