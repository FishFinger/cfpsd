Meeting Description

The 3rd International Workshop on Vocabularies, Ontologies and Rules for the
Enterprise (VORTE 2007) 

Call for Papers (due to the delay of notifications for the main conference,
the submission deadline has been extended until 17 July)

The 3rd International Workshop on
Vocabularies, Ontologies and Rules for the Enterprise
(VORTE 2007)

http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/VORTE/

In conjunction with the 11th IEEE International
EDOC Conference (EDOC 2007)
''The Enterprise Computing Conference''
http://edoc.mitre.org/

15-19 October 2007, Annapolis, Maryland, USA

Selected papers accepted to the workshop to be invited for a
special issue in Elsevier's ISI-indexed Information Systems journal
http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infosys/

Workshop Overview

Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
VORTE 2007 is the third workshop associated with an EDOC conference that intends
to bring together researchers and practitioners in areas such as
philosophical ontology, enterprise modelling, information systems, Semantic Web,
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), business rules, and business processes. The
goal of the workshop is to discuss the role that foundational and domain
ontologies play in the conceptual development and implementation of next
generation tools for enterprise computing. Since enterprise vocabularies and
ontologies, as well as business rules do not exist in isolation but serve to
support business processes, this year we are planning to put special emphasis on
business progress modelling and management.

Themes and Topics

The workshop contributions will be organized along four major thematic
areas, under which the following topics of interest will be included,
but not limited to:

Conceptual Modelling
- Business Vocabularies, Terminologies, and Taxonomies
- Ontological Approaches to Content and Knowledge Management
- Enterprise Information Integration and Interoperability
- Service Taxonomies and Service Registries (for example, UDDI-related
research)
- Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modelling
- Languages for Conceptual Modelling (for example, OWL and UML)
- Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modelling
Business Rules and Business Process Semantics
- Semantic Web Services
- Service Ontologies (for example, research related to OWL-S)
- Business Rule Languages and Components
- Rule-based Approaches to Web Service Policies and Choreographies
- Ontologies for Business Process Management
- Agent-based Business Rule and Process Management
- Business Process Modelling and Execution Languages (for example, BPMN
and BPML)
Ontologies for Enterprise Computing
- Foundational Ontologies and Enterprise Computing
- Ontological Evaluation of Enterprise Systems
- Ontologies for Interoperability of Enterprise Systems
- Ontology-based Enterprise Architectures
- Ontology-based Software Engineering for Enterprises
- Enterprise Components' Modelling
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approaches to Enterprise Computing
- Modelling and Architecture Frameworks
- Domain Engineering
- Domain-specific Business Information and System Engineering
- Transformation between MDA layers

Submission Guidelines

All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program
committee. Submissions should be 6 to 8 pages long and must use the two-column
format of IEEE conference proceedings, which is referenced on the workshop's web
site, and include the authors' name, affiliation, and contact details. Papers
must be submitted in the PDF format using EasyChair at
http://www.easychair.org/VORTE2007. Authors will be notified about the decision
by the program committee by the 11th of August 2007. At least one author of each
accepted paper must participate in the workshop. The papers accepted for the
EDOC 2007 Workshops will be published after the workshop with its own ISBN in
the IEEE Digital Library (pending approval by IEEE), which is accessible by IEEE
Xplore.

Journal Special Issue

A selection of the best papers accepted to the workshop and presented there will
be invited to the special issue of Elsevier ISI-indexed Information Systems
journal (subject to the second round of peer-review).
