Interestingly, I once had the URL of a site that listed sham conferences but
the site went away.  I wonder if there were legal aspects to that.  Clearly
you want to be careful about defaming someone.  But we are now, of course,
in the fortunate position of having the whitelist of A/B/C conferences from
CORE, so perhaps we don't need a blacklist any more.

Dr. Nagib Callaos is well known for running this long standing conferences
about nothing. 
There was a time that I did some research on him and I could not find a PhD,
even though now he claims he has one.

Notice the big red lights in this sentence: 
Authors of accepted papers who register in the conference can have access to
the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who
recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can
accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered
authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

Does it look like revenue based for you?
Conferences by the same person already accepted completely automatically
generated papers and almost hosted the first random talk in history.

Hi all,

 

I get rather a lot of these.  I'm guessing it's another sham conference (red
lights come on at "papers on anything" and "in Orlando, Florida") but I'd
have to say that I don't have anything more authoritative than "this looks
dodgy" to draw that conclusion.

 

I wouldn't be considering submitting a paper to something like this, but it
does raise the question: how do we identify sham conferences?  Are there
well-known ones?  Is there a 'name and shame' web site somewhere?

 

Cheers,

Brett

accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered
authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

Awards will be granted to the best paper of those presented at each session.
>From these session's best papers, the best 10%-20% of the papers presented
at the conference will be invited to adapt their papers for their
publication in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics.

Also, we would like to invite you to organize an invited session related to
a topic of your research interest. If you are interested in organizing an
invited session, please, fill out the respective form provided in the
conference web page. We will send you a password, so you can include and
