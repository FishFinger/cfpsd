   Monday, 20 July - Friday, 31 July 2009
   Bordeaux, France
   Call For Course And Workshop Proposals
   Extended Deadline
* The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
  is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
  Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around
  Europe.
  The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics,
  logic and computation.  ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and
  advanced courses, as well as workshops, covering a wide variety of
  topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation,
  Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.
  Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
  500 students from Europe and elsewhere.  The school has developed into
  an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
  researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
  Language and Information.
  The ESSLLI 2009 Program Committee invites proposals for
  foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops
  for the 21st annual Summer School in the broad interdisciplinary
  area connecting logic, linguistics, computer science and the
  cognitive sciences. The Summer School program is organized around
  the components.

BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT:
  Second-Order Quantifier Elimination:
  Foundations, Computational Aspects and Applications
  by Dov M. Gabbay, Renate A. Schmidt, and Andrzej Szalas
  Studies in Logic: Mathematical Logic and Foundations, Vol. 12 
  College Publications 2008, 308 pages 
  ISBN 978-1-904987-56-7
* In recent years there has been an increasing use of
  logical methods and significant new developments have
  been spawned in several areas of computer science,
  ranging from artificial intelligence and software
  engineering to agent-based systems and the semantic web.
  In the investigation and application of logical methods
  there is a tension between:
    - the need for a representational language strong enough
      to express domain knowledge of a particular application,
      and the need for a logical formalism general enough to
      unify several reasoning facilities relevant to the
      application, on the one hand, and
    - the need to enable computationally feasible reasoning
      facilities, on the other hand. 
* Second-order logics are very expressive and allow us to
  represent domain knowledge with ease, but there is a
  high price to pay for the expressiveness. Most
  second-order logics are incomplete and highly
  undecidable. It is the quantifiers which bind relation
  symbols that make second-order logics computationally
  unfriendly. It is therefore desirable to eliminate these
  second-order quantifiers, when this is mathematically
  possible; and often it is. If second-order quantifiers
  are eliminable we want to know under which conditions,
  we want to understand the principles and we want to
  develop methods for second-order quantifier elimination.
  This book provides the first comprehensive, systematic
  and uniform account of the state-of-the-art of
  second-order quantifier elimination in classical and
  non-classical logics. It covers the foundations, it
  discusses in detail existing second-order quantifier
  elimination methods, and it presents numerous examples
  of applications and non-standard uses in different
  areas. These include:
    - classical and non-classical logics,
    - correspondence and duality theory,
    - knowledge representation and description logics,
    - commonsense reasoning and approximate reasoning,
    - relational and deductive databases, and
    - complexity theory. 
* The book is intended for anyone interested in the theory
  and application of logics in computer science and
  artificial intelligence.

BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT: A MODULAR CALCULUS FOR THE AVERAGE COST OF DATA
STRUCTURING
  by Michel Schellekens 
  Springer 2008 246 with CD-ROM. Hardcover
  ISBN: 978-0-387-73383-8
* A Modular Calculus for the Average Cost of Data Structuring introduces
  MOQA, a new domain-specific programming language which guarantees the
  average-case time analysis of its programs to be modular. "Time" in this
  context refers to a broad notion of cost, which can be used to estimate
  the actual running time, but also other quantitative information such as
  power consumption, while modularity means that the average time of a
  program can be easily computed from the times of its
  constituents--something that no programming language of this scope has
  been able to guarantee so far. MOQA principles can be incorporated in
  any standard programming language.
  MOQA supports tracking of data and their distributions throughout
  computations, based on the notion of random bag preservation. This
  allows a unified approach to average-case time analysis, and resolves
  fundamental bottleneck problems in the area. The main techniques are
  illustrated in an accompanying Flash tutorial, where the visual nature
  of this method can provide new teaching ideas for algorithms courses.
* This volume, with forewords by Greg Bollella and Dana Scott, presents
  novel programs based on the new advances in this area, including the
  first randomness-preserving version of Heapsort. Programs are provided,
  along with derivations of their average-case time, to illustrate the
  radically different approach to average-case timing. The automated
  static timing tool applies the Modular Calculus to extract the
  average-case running time of programs directly from their MOQA code.
* A Modular Calculus for the Average Cost of Data Structuring is
  designed for a professional audience composed of researchers and
  practitioners in industry, with an interest in algorithmic analysis and
  also static timing and power analysis--areas of growing importance. It
  is also suitable as an advanced-level text or reference book for
  students in computer science, electrical engineering and mathematics.
* Michel Schellekens obtained his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University,
  following which he worked as a Marie Curie Fellow at Imperial College
  London. Currently he is an Associate Professor at the Department of
  Computer Science in University College Cork - National University of
  Ireland, Cork, where he leads the Centre for Efficiency-Oriented
  Languages (CEOL) as a Science Foundation Ireland Principal Investigator.
* Written for:
  Researchers and students interested in algorithm analysis, static
  analysis, real-time programming, programming language semantics
* Keywords:
  - random structures
  - real-time languages
  - series-parallel data structures
  - software timing/power analysis
