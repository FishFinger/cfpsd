FOMI 2008 - 3rd Workshop on Formal Ontologies Meet Industry

June 5-6, 2008, Torino, Italy


		FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS


Conference web site: http://www.fomi2008.di.unito.it

This event is jointly organized by:
       - Laboratory for Applied Ontology, ISTC-CNR, Trento
       - University of Torino
       - University of Verona

CONFERENCE AIMS

FOMI is an international forum where academic researchers and
industrial practitioners meet to analyze and discuss issues related to
methods, theories, tools and applications based on formal ontologies.

There is today wide agreement that knowledge modeling and the semantic
dimension of information plays an increasingly central role in
networked economy: semantic-based applications are relevant in
distributed systems such as networked organizations, organizational
networks, and in distributed knowledge management. These knowledge
models in industry aim to provide a framework for information and
knowledge sharing, reliable information exchange, meaning negotiation
and coordination between distinct organizations or among members of
the same organization.

New tools and applications have been and are being developed in
diverse application fields, ranging from business to medicine, from
engineering to finance, from law to electronics. All these systems
have exploited the theoretical results and the practical experience of
previous work.  In all cases, it has been shown that formal ontologies
play a central role in describing in a common and understandable way
the logical and practical features of the application domain.

The success of the methodologies associated with knowledge modeling
and ontologies led to increased need of a comparison between different
approaches and results, with the aim of evaluating the
interdependencies between theories and methods of formal ontology and
the activities, processes, and needs of enterprise organizations.

The FOMI 08 Workshop aims to advance in this direction by bringing
together researchers and practitioners interested in ontology
application, paying particular attention to the topics listed below.

CONFERENCE TOPICS

*problems in ontology application:*
  - practical issues in using ontologies in the enterprise
  - real cases of successful/unsuccessful use of ontology in business
  - from legacy systems to the new ontology-driven systems

*ontology and business:*
  - ontology and ontological methodologies in business;
  - adaptation of ontologies for companies and organizations;
  - ontology effectiveness and evaluation in business

*ontology and enterprise:*
  - ontology-driven enterprise modeling;
  - ontology development and change within organizations;
  - ontology-driven representation of products, services,  
functionalities,
	 design, processes;

*ontology and enterprise knowledge:*
  - ontologies for the know-how;
  - ontologies for corporate knowledge;

*ontology in practice:*
  - ontologies for electronic catalogs, e-commerce, e-government;
  - ontologies for marketing;
  - ontologies for finance;
  - ontologies for engineering;
  - ontologies for medical sciences;

*ontology and linguistics:*
  - ontology-driven linguistic representation in organization
    knowledge;
  - linguistic problems in standards and in codification processes;
  - ontologies and multilingualism in business and organizations

PROGRAMME

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral
presentations, poster and demo presentations, and panels. Submitted
papers will be peer-reviewed and selected on the basis of technical
quality, relevance of the described experiences (depending on the type
of submission), and clarity of the presentation for the workshop. In
particular, we insist that papers should be written for a wide
audience. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, and
published as proceedings.

Accepted papers will be electronically published on CD and distributed
to participants. Following the past edition, a selection of the best
papers accepted at the workshop will be considered for publication in
the international journal "Applied Ontology"

SUBMISSIONS AND DATES

* Format
   - The maximal paper length is 10 pages, excluding title page and  
     bibliography.
   - Papers must be submitted in PDF format
   - Detailed instructions can be found in the conference site.

* Deadlines:
   - Paper Submission: January 7, 2008
   - Acceptance Notification: March 3, 2008
   - Camera Ready: March 31, 2008
