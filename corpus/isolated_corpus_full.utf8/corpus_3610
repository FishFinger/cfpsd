EACL workshop 'LaTeCH - SHELT&R 2009': 
Language Technology and Resources for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences,

Co-located with The 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association
for Computational Linguistics
Athens, Greece, 30 (31?) March 2009 

Call for Papers


Scope and Topics
Recent years have seen a growing interest in the application of language
technology tools and resources to text-based research in Social sciences,
Humanities and Education (SHE). 
Likewise, large scale digitization projects are currently underway to make
collections of cultural heritage (CH) stored in museums, archives, and libraries
around the world more accessible, where it is desirable to develop powerful
tools that enable annotating, structuring, enriching, searching, linking, and
mining the digitized data. Language technology has an important role to play in
these processes, even for collections which are primarily non-textual, since
text is the pervasive medium used for metadata. 

At the same time, the CH and SHE domains pose special challenges for the NLP
community, such as the use of historic or non-standard language (ellipsis, OCR
or transcription errors, linguistic variation, and the mixed use of languages),
the interplay between textual form and content, as well as the necessity to deal
with data from various media. Textual data from CH and SHE are typically
multifunctional, which allows for transdisciplinary research, promoting the
development of automatic creation and extension of controlled vocabularies and
information exchange standards. The CH and SHE domains therefore constitute an
interesting and challenging testbed for the robustness of existing language
technology.

The workshop, a continuation of LaTeCH-07 (Prague, Czech Republic) and LaTeCH-08
(Marrakech, Morocco) aims to foster interaction between researchers working on
all aspects of language technology applied to CH and SHE domains, and experts
from institutions who are testing deployed technologies and formulating improved
use cases.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Adapting existing NLP tools to the CH and SHE domains: machine learning and
semantic web technologies
- Automatic error detection and cleaning
- Complex annotation tools and interfaces
- Dealing with linguistic variation and non-standard or non-contemporary use of
language 
- Knowledge discovery from CH and SHE data
- Knowledge representation in CH and SHE
- Linking and retrieving information from different sources, media, and domains
- Ontologies, data models, taxonomies: automatic induction and standardization  
- Representing CH and SHE data to different audiences: personalization, text
simplification, text summarization, (hyper)text generation
- Transdisciplinary research on CH and SHE data
- User scenarios and use cases. 

Authors are invited to submit papers on original, unpublished work in the topic
area of the workshop. Papers should present completed work and should not exceed
8 pages.  All submissions should be formatted using the EACL 2009 stylefiles.

Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than Friday 19 December,
2008. The submission website is soon to be announced. The only accepted format
for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. 

The reviewing process will be blind; thus papers should not include the authors'
names and affiliations or any references to web sites, project names etc.
revealing the authors' identity. Each submission will be reviewed by at least
two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.
