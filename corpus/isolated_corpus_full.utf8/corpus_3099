Call Deadline: 20-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

Workshop will feature contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic
aspects of plurality.

We hope to feature contributions exploring the expressions of event plurality
and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals, distributivity,
'pluractionals', plural nominalizations) and the nature of cross-categorial
plurality markers. 

Call for Papers

Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality
November 7th -8th, 2008
Paris

Invited speakers:
Paul Newman (Indiana / Michigan)
Martina Faller (Manchester)
 
The Workshop on nominal and verbal plurality will take place on November 7th
-8th, 2008, in Paris. It is organized by the project ''Distributive
dependencies: nominal and verbal plurality'' (CNRS, Fédération TUL). 

This project explores the parallels and interactions between the nominal and the
verbal domain by targeting a wide semantic category, plurality, and its
morpho-syntactic manifestations accross languages.

All contributions on morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects of plurality
are welcome.

We particularly encourage contributions exploring the expressions of event
plurality and their interaction with argument plurality (reciprocals,
distributivity, ''pluractionals'', plural nominalizations) and the nature of
cross-categorial plurality markers.

We invite submissions for 30-minute presentations (plus ten-minute discussions).
Abstracts should be at most 2 pages in length (including examples and
references) written in French or English.

Abstracts must be anonymous and should be sent by e-mail (plain ASCII,
rtf, ps or pdf) to: pcabredo //AT// univ-paris8.fr

Please write the (first) author's name plus the word 'abstract' in the subject
line of your message (e.g., 'Dupont abstract'), and include author name(s),
affiliation, contact information and the title of the abstract in the body of
the email. For co-authored papers indicate the email address that we should use
for correspondence.

Abstracts should reach us by August 20, 2008.

Full Title: Perspectives on Gender in Dutch 

Date: 21-Nov-2008 - 21-Nov-2008
Location: Ghent, Belgium 
Contact Person: Gunther De Vogelaer
Meeting Email: gunther.devogelaer@ugent.be
Web Site: http://users.ugent.be/~gdvogela/T&T-call_Eng 

Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Morphology; Sociolinguistics; Syntax 

Subject Language(s): Dutch (nld)

Call Deadline: 30-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

Grammatical gender in Dutch has been a topic of continuous research for decades.
The present workshop 'Perspectives on gender in Dutch' aims at taking stock of
the recent developments on the topic. The workshop takes place on November 21,
2008, in Ghent (Belgium). 

2nd Call for Papers

Dutch grammatical gender displays a massive amount of variation, including: 

1. variation between the national varieties of Dutch (see, e.g., the
ANS-grammar, Geeraerts 1992, Audring 2006); 
2. dialectal variation (Taeldeman 1980, Hoppenbrouwers 1983, the Morphological
Atlas of Dutch Dialects); 
3. alternative gender systems found in L2 varieties of Dutch (Blom, Poli?enská &
Weerman 2006); 
4. alternative gender systems found in child Dutch and adult learner Dutch (De
Vogelaer 2006, Cornips & Hulk 2006, Hulk & Cornips 2006);  
5. diachronic variation (Geerts 1966). 

The present workshop aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the attested
variation. This overview should serve as a starting point from which more
fundamental questions can be addressed, including the quest for triggers in
gender change (deflection, language contact), the function of grammatical
gender, or the structure of gender systems. 

In addition, the Dutch gender data may shed some light over the ongoing debate
on different types of language change. Indeed there is no agreement as to which
speakers are the principal agents of language change. Labov (2007), for
instance, distinguishes two types of language change, viz. change as a result of
a non-identical transmission of language between generations, and change as a
result of the diffusion of patterns over adults as a result of contact. Other
models (e.g., Meisel 2001; Weerman, Bisschop & Punt 2006), however, have
emphasized factors that do not figure prominently in Labov's account, most
notably imperfect language learning by bilinguals and the age at which large
groups of bilinguals start acquiring the relevant language. 

Suggested topics: 
- One or more aspects of grammatical gender in (a variety of) Dutch or a related
language. 
- The function of grammatical gender. 
- The relationship between adnominal gender and pronominal reference. 
- Causes and triggers of gender change in Dutch. 
- The implications of Dutch gender change for present models of language change. 

To participate, send your one-page abstract (including references) to
gunther.devogelaerugent.be, to arrive no later than June, 30. Talks are 20 min.
(+ 10 min. discussion). We encourage abstracts in Dutch, but non-native speakers
of Dutch may submit in English. Decisions on the acceptance of the abstract can
be expected before September, 1. 

Organizers: 
- Leonie Cornips (Meertens Institute) 
- Gunther De Vogelaer (FWO Flanders / Ghent University) 

The following invited speakers have confirmed their participation: 
- Jenny Audring (VU Amsterdam) & Geert Booij (Leiden) 
- Aafke Hulk (UvAmsterdam) & Jasper Roodenburg (Stuttgart) 
- Georges De Schutter (UAntwerp) & Johan Taeldeman (UGent) 

Publication: 
A selection of papers will be published as a theme issue of 'Taal & Tongval'
(http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/taalentongval/).
