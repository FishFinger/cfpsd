Meeting Description

We invite papers reporting on biomedical resources specifically used to
facilitate biomedical text mining and the process of designing, building,
updating, delivering, evaluating and disseminating them. A focus of the workshop
is on lexical and knowledge repositories (e.g. controlled vocabularies,
terminologies, ontologies, factual databases) and annotated corpora. Another
focus is on design guidelines, standards for building resources, storage and

Meeting Description

LREC 2008 Workshop 'Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008)' 


Call for Papers

LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE 2008)

endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Deadline: Friday, 29 February 2008

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of
multiword expressions (MWE), the development of algorithms for their automatic
extraction from corpora, and the automatic identification of additional
properties such as morphosyntactic preferences or the interpretation of
semi-compositional expressions.

It is difficult to compare results of the many published studies on MWEs and
obtain a broader perspective, though, because algorithms and implemented
systems have been evaluated on vastly different gold standards and corpora, in
different languages, for different subtypes of MWEs, etc. In order to make the
next big step forward, the field of MWE research needs a shared task in which
different approaches are applied to the same data sets, allowing completely new
insights to be gained. Since there is as yet not a clear and universally
accepted definition of multiword expressions, the first instalment of this
shared task will be of a more exploratory nature than the competitions that have
been carried out in other areas of computational linguistics.

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for collecting, sharing
and exploiting MWE evaluation resources. We have solicited contributions of such
resources in a separate call.

After collection of the resources, teams are invited to participate in a
shared task by evaluating their MWE extraction algorithms on data sets
downloaded from http://multiword.sf.net/. Further instructions will be made
available on the workshop web site, and the full collection of data sets will
be online by February 1, 2008 at the latest.

There will be three different types of submissions to the workshop:

(1) short papers describing data sets and other evaluation resources made
    freely available on the community Web page;

(2) shared task participants, who evaluate an algorithm or MWE extraction
    system on multiple data sets and discuss implications of their results;

(3) regular papers addressing the evaluation and comparison of multiword
    extraction algorithms (but not limited to these topics).

With this call, we invite submissions of regular papers, in particular (but not
limited to) research on:

(a) Linguistic analysis of MWEs based on language resources (such as corpora)
and the impact that these studies have on NLP applications. We particularly
welcome papers that perform a cross-linguistic analysis of MWEs, identify
variation across languages, text types, domains, etc. or investigate the
variability of MWEs.

(b) Typologies of MWEs: Papers that describe classes of MWEs and their
representation in language resources, discuss different approaches to the
definition and classification of MWEs, or apply new MWE typologies to the
evaluation of computational techniques.

(c) The evaluation and comparison of multiword extraction techniques: Do
methods generalise across languages, text types, different classes of MWEs,
etc.? How useful and essential is linguistic knowledge and a theoretical
understanding of MWEs? Is fully automatic extraction feasible or will manual
intervention always be necessary?

(d) Evaluation methodology and the creation of gold standards for MWEs. Papers
should address theoretical and technical issues, while descriptions of
existing resources may be submitted as short papers for the shared task.
Topics of particular interest are novel types of gold standards (such as human
ratings from expert and non-expert subjects, language resources derived from the
Web, etc.), inter-annotator agreement in the manual validation of candidate
lists (which is often fairly low) and the task-based evaluation of MWE resources
in NLP applications.


Submission Information

Regular papers must adhere to the format of LREC proceedings (preferably using
the style files provided on the conference Web site) and must not exceed eight
(8) pages, including references. Short papers describing evaluation resources
and shared task participants will be allowed four (4) pages, using the same
formatting. Only submissions in PDF format will be considered.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to
projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity should
be avoided. For example, instead of ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'',
write ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.

The papers must be submitted no later than 23:59 GMT on February 29, 2008.
Papers submitted after that time cannot be reviewed.
