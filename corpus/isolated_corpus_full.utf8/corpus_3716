Arena Romanistica 01/09

Call for papers

'Genre Studies'

The notion of genre has seen an increasing importance in various fields of
Romance studies:  linguistics, literary and film studies. In this sense,
genre constitutes a common theoretical challenge for these disciplines and
may be a point of fruitful dialogue between them. However, this exchange
necessitates a clarification of the notion of genre itself: how is it
understood in the different disciplines, and how may these understandings
enrich and challenge each other?

The notion of genre highlights a number of questions relevant to our
disciplines, such as the following:
- how do we delimit genre? Should it be seen as a normative or empirical
category?
- the genre function as context for the study and production of texts: if
it is seen as a set of text conventions, the genre can be seen as an
ensemble of social norms where the inherited genre classifications and
hierarchies govern the production and classification of new texts.
-  what can genre studies allow us say about 'impure' genres and genre
transgressions?

In order to examine these questions, we welcome contributions from all the
fields of Romance studies whether they be theoretical reflections or
empirical studies. 

Deadline for submission of papers: February 1, 2009
