      Call for papers

* 3rd Web as Corpus Workshop (WAC3)
incorporating Cleaneval
An ACL-SIGWAC event*

Sept. 15-16, 2007
University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium

More and more people are using Web data for linguistic and NLP research. 
The workshop provides a venue for exploring how we can use it 
effectively and what we will find if we do.

We invite submissions which :

    * describe Web corpus collection projects, or modules for one part
      of the process (crawling, filtering, language-id, tokenising,
      lemmatising, POS-tagging, indexing, ...)
    * explore characteristics of Web data, from a linguistics/NLP
      perspective including registers, domains, frequency distributions
    * use crawled Web data for NLP purposes (with emphasis on the data
      rather than the use)


    Cleaneval

Anyone using web data needs to clean it, to get rid of unwanted material 
including, for example, HTML markup, navigation bars, advertisements. To 
date there has been no sharing of resources or expertise and the 
cleaning has often been done minimally. Cleaneval is an exercise to 
promote sharing and to improve our understanding of the issues. It will 
take the now-familiar form of an open competition and shared task. More 
info at Cleaneval <http://cleaneval.sigwac.org.uk>.

those languages : website <http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/stadas.html> 
currently lists 135 corpora/languages.
