Call for Papers

Collocated with the 11th International Business Rules Forum, the 2008
International Symposium on Rule Interchange and Applications 
(RuleML-2008) is
the second symposium (after last year's highly successful RuleML-2007 -
http://2007.ruleml.org/) devoted to work on practical distributed rule
technologies and rule-based applications which need language standards for
rules operating in the context of, e.g., the Semantic Web, Intelligent 
Multi-
Agent Systems, Event-Driven Architectures and Service-Oriented Computing
Applications. The RuleML symposium is a new kind of event where the Web 
Rules
and Logic community joins the established, practically oriented Forum of the
Business Rules community (http://www.businessrulesforum.com) to help cross-
fertilizing between Web and Business Logic technology.

The goal of RuleML-2008 is to bring together rule system providers,
representatives of, and participants in, rule standardization efforts (e.g.,
SBVR, RuleML, RIF, PRR, CL) and open source rules communities (e.g., jBoss
Rules, CLIPS/Jess, Prova, OO jDrew, Mandarax, XSB, XQuery), 
practitioners and
technical experts, developers, users, and researchers. They will be offered
an exciting venue to exchange new ideas, practical developments and
experiences on issues pertinent to the interchange and application of rules
in open distributed environments such as the Web.

The Symposium gives emphasis on practical issues such as technical
contributions and show case demonstrations of effective, practical,
deployable rule-based technologies, rule interchange formats and 
applications
as well as discussions of lessons learned that have to be taken into account
when employing rule-based technologies in distributed, (partially) open,
heterogeneous environments. We also welcome groundwork that helps to 
build an
effective, practical, and deployable rule standard, improve rule technology,
provide better understanding of the integration and interchange of 
rules, and
make the current generation of rule engines and rule technology more usable
for advanced Web and Service Oriented Architectures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RuleML-2008 Challenge

The RuleML-2008 Challenge is one of the highlights of RuleML-2008. It
addresses the system demonstration for practical use of rule technologies in
distributed and/or Web-based environments. The focus of the challenge is on
rule technologies (including rule languages and engines), interoperation and
interchange. The challenge offers participants the chance to demonstrate
their commercial and open source tools, use cases, and applications. Prizes
will be awarded to the two best applications. All accepted demos will be
presented in a special Challenge Session.
