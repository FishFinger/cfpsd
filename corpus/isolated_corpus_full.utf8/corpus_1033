Workshop Organizers:

  James Rogers <jrogers@cs.earlham.edu> and=20
  Stephan Kepser <kepser@sfs.uni-tuebingen.de>



Workshop Purpose:

  In 1996 ESSLLI hosted a workshop on "The Mathematics of Syntactic =
Structure"
that covered a range of topics in the area now known as Model-Theoretic =
Syntax
which was then just emerging.  Over the ensuing decade MTS has =
established
itself as a subdiscipline, focusing on descriptive approaches to =
formalizing
theories of syntax by defining classes of ordinary mathematical =
structures
directly in terms of linguistically relevant structural properties =
rather than
in terms of generative or automata-theoretic processes.  The 2001 FG/MoL
meeting, affiliated with ESSLLI'01, included a symposium on the then =
current
state of MTS.

  The purpose of this workshop at ESSLLI'07 is to survey the =
developments in
this area over its first decade and to lay the foundations for its =
further
development in the decades to come.  The workshop will include invited =
talks by
several participants of the previous meetings as well as current papers =
from
the broader community.



Workshop Topics:

  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following =
areas, with
particular focus in each area on Formal Language Theory and applications =
to
theories of Natural Language Syntax:

o Descriptive Complexity Theory=20
o Monadic Second-Order Logic
o Modal Logic
o Semantically constrained extensions of FOL/MSO
o Other declarative approaches defining syntactic structures
o Automata and Transducers over complex structures
o Logically defined translations between structures
o Logical query languages
o Model checking
o Applications to existing grammar formalisms
o Applications to Linguistics


Submission details:

  Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract describing either
perspectives on the development and current state of MTS or new work =
providing
foundations for its further development.  Submissions should not exceed =
five A4
pages, 11pt type, including the Bibliography and all figures and tables. =
While
PDF is preferred the following formats will be accepted: PDF, PS, Word, =
ASCII
text. Please send your submission electronically via the submission form =
at
http://cs.earlham.edu/esslli07mts/submit.html by the deadline listed =
below.=20

  Submissions will be reviewed anonymously by the workshop's program =
committee
and additional reviewers.  The submission form will isolate authors'
identification from the submitted paper and this information should not =
appear
in the paper itself.  Authors' are also asked to avoid first-person =
references
in the paper.

  Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by
ESSLLI. The format for the final versions will be LaTeX.  Assistance for =
those
unfamiliar with LaTeX will be available.  Our intention is to publish a
selected subset of the workshop papers in a collected volume.  These =
plans will
be discussed at the workshop.


Workshop format:

  The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. =
It
will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days =
in the
second week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 or 3 slots for paper presentation =
and
discussion per session.  One slot per day will be reserved for overview =
or
retrospective talks.  The first day of the workshop will include an =
integrative
introduction to the topic.  Submitters should keep in mind that this =
workshop
is part of the larger ESSLLI educational program; presentations should =
be
accessible to a broad audience from across the spectrum of ESSLLI areas.

Local Arrangements:

  All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to
register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper =
will
correspond to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee. =
Moreover, a
number of additional fee waiver grants will be made available by the =
ESSLLI
Organizing Committee on a competitive basis and workshop participants =
are
eligible to apply for those. There will be no reimbursement for travel =
costs
and accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding =
funding
should contact the local organizing committee to ask for the =
possibilities for
a grant.
