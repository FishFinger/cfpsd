Full Title: Natural Language Engineering 


Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Dec-2008 

Call for special issue proposals

Natural Language Engineering is following the trend of many areas in
becoming highly specialised with a number of application-orientated and
narrow-domain topics emerging or growing in importance. These developments,
often coincident with a lack of related literature, necessitate the
publication of specialised volumes focusing on specific topics of interest
to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) research community.

The Journal of Natural Language Engineering (NLE) invites proposals for
special issues on a competitive basis on any topics about applied NLP that
illustrate important developments in NLE and have attracted the attention
of several researchers/groups. After the 2006 Call for Proposals, which
resulted in 2 high quality special issues, we are pleased to announce
another call.

Topics could cover a range of NLP methods, tasks and resources as well as
NLP-related applications but should focus on the practical implications of
large scale operations. Topics covering NLP methods, tasks and resources
could include POS tagging, parsing, semantic role labelling, word sense
disambiguation, anaphora and coreference resolution, named entity
recognition, natural language generation, speech recognition, speech
synthesis, multimodal processing, statistical methods in NLE, machine
learning, evaluation methodologies, corpora and ontologies. Topics covering
NLP applications could include machine translation, translation memory and
translation tools, summarisation, information retrieval, information
extraction, question answering, text and web mining, opinion mining and NLP
for biomedical texts.

Calls for special issue proposals may be based on a successful workshop or
body of work associated with a particular group or community. In all cases,
however, the reviewing process is rigorous and all submissions will be
reviewed by 3 or more members of the Guest Editorial Board or other
suitable reviewers agreed by the NLE Editors. In the case of papers
previously submitted to workshops, Guest Editors will not be able to reuse
previous reviews.
Additionally, the call for papers of the accepted proposals is open to all
interested parties and all authors will be given equal treatment; in the
case of proposals based on previous workshops, submissions cannot be
limited to workshop participants only.

Interested editors can obtain preliminary feedback by emailing expressions
of interest plus a brief description of the intended special issue to the
Executive Editor (R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk). He will indicate whether the topic
is appropriate.

If the initial feedback is positive, the prospective Guest Editors will be
asked to submit a proposal for a special issue which will be reviewed by
the Editors and other members of the Journal Editorial Board. At least one
proposal will be selected on a competitive basis for each call, which will
be published during or after Oct 09.

The proposal should include a brief outline of the field and reason why it
is important to launch a special issue on the topic specified. It should
include a relevant literature survey (related previous special issues,
conference proceedings etc.) and should explain the value of the proposed
special issue against the background of other relevant or competing
publications/ volumes (if applicable). A rough estimate on expected
submissions to the special issue is desirable. Proposals should also
include a tentative Guest Editorial Board (one of the Guest Editorial Board
members should be a journal Editorial Board member), tentative timescale
for production of the special issue and information about the prospective
Guest Editors(relevant experience, publications etc.).

  Timescale
- Deadline for submission:
  15 Dec 08		(to R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk)
- Notification of acceptance/rejection:
  15 Jan 09
- Final version of the successful proposal(s) and call for papers:
  31 Jan 09
