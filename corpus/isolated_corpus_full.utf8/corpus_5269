Meeting Description:

Second ELC International Postgraduate Conference on English Linguistics (ELC2)
http://webs.uvigo.es/elcpostgrad
Vigo (Spain) 30-31 October 2009

We are pleased to announce the Second ELC International Postgraduate Conference on English Linguistics (ELC2), to be held at the University of Vigo (Spain) on 30-31 October 2009. ELC2 aims to provide linguistics postgraduate students with an opportunity to present and discuss their research in an informal and intellectually stimulating setting.

The conference is organised by postgraduate students from the English Departments of the Universities of Vigo and Santiago de Compostela. It is supported by these two universities and by the English Linguistics Circle, a research network involving the following research teams:

- Variation, Linguistic Change and Grammaticalisation (VLCG; University of Santiago de Compostela; Director: Prof. Teresa Fanego): http://www.usc-vlcg.es/index.html

- Spoken English Research Team at the University of Santiago de Compostela (SPERTUS; University of Santiago de Compostela; Director: Ignacio Palacios Martínez): http://www.usc.es/ia303/spertus/

- Language Variation and Textual Categorisation (LVTC; University of Vigo; Director: Javier Pérez Guerra): http://lvtcuvigo.blogspot.com/

- Methods and Materials for the Teaching and Acquisition of Foreign Languages (MMTAFL, University of Vigo; Director: Marta Dahlgren-Thorsell)

The English Linguistics Circle was also responsible for ELC1, a former edition of the International Postgraduate Conference on English Linguistics held in Santiago de Compostela in May 2008. A refereed volume containing a selection of the papers presented at ELC1 is now in preparation, and will be published as New trends and methodologies in applied English language research. Diachronic, diatopic and contrastive studies (Linguistic Insights Series; Bern: Peter Lang).

Plenary speakers:
- Ans van Kemenade, Radboud University Nijmegen
- Terence Odlin, Ohio State University 
- Geoff Thompson, University of Liverpool
