Full Title: Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology 
Short Title: sfcm2009 

Date: 04-Sep-2009 - 04-Sep-2009

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology (sfcm 2009)
http://sfcm2009.org
Workshop date: September 4, 2009
Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland
Submission deadline: March 1, 2009 

Call for Papers

This workshop concentrates on actual, working systems and frameworks of at least
prototype quality. To ensure fruitful discussions among workshop participants,
submissions on concrete morphology systems are preferably for German;
submissions on morphological frameworks are relevant if the framework can be
used to implement components for different languages.

In contrast to, for example, Morphochallenge, this workshop focuses on systems
and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing linguistically
motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of linguistic categories.

Topics
The topics of this workshop include both technical aspects, applications, and
uses of systems and frameworks for computational morphology. While purely
theoretical submissions may be relevant, the focus of the workshop is clearly on
actual, working systems and prototypes.

The workshop will mainly focus on German, but contributions for other languages
are encouraged in order to demonstrate open-source tools and runtime software
for full-scale morphologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Frameworks for developing morphological components.
- Open-source tools and resources for morphology.
- Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms, especially for
German.
- Suitability of morphological components for interactive use.
- Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with respect to
performance, quality, and coverage.
- Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance, hardware/software
requirements, resource usage.
- License models and legal aspects.

There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.

Submissions
We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages (including
references) or short papers of up to 10 pages. Papers submitted at review stage
must not contain the authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may
disclose the authors' identity.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research at the
workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the workshop
by Springer in their series Communications in Computer and Information Science.

The papers must use the Springer LNCS format. We recommend to use the LaTeX2e
format. Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format guidelines. Papers must
be submitted electronically in PDF format. For paper submissions we use
EasyChair, see
http://www.sfcm2009.org/?Submissions

If you have questions concerning format, EasyChair or submitting in general,
please contact us! (info@sfcm2009.org)
