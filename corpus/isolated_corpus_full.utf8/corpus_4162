Meeting Description:

The workshop on 'How Global is English in the Globalising World' will be held as
part of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea, 9-12
September 2009, Lisbon. 

Final Call for Papers

The aim of the workshop is to investigate the validity of the assumption that
English has become a lingua franca of the contemporary world and to discuss
possible scenarios for its future development. We would like to invite a
scholarly debate on whether the globalisation of English leads to the
consolidation of the global language or rather to its fragmentation into new
dialects and varieties. Therefore, we intend to explore the present factual
status of English in the globalising world as well as the emergence of new
Englishes, including, e.g. English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) and Lingua Franca
Core (LFC ). The debate may also incorporate issues related to the fate of
English as jeopardised by other lingua francas such as Spanish or Chinese. 
Finally, we would like to look to the pedagogical implications of the current
status of English by exploring foreign learners' expectations and attitudes
towards various pronunciation models.

Key Research Areas:
1) Facts about English as a global language
2) The emergence of new Englishes, Euro-English, foreigners' English
3) Fragmentation of English (internal threat)
4) Other Lingua Francas (external threat)
5) Pedagogical implications, current pronunciation models

Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce the First Vigo-Newcastle-Santiago-Leuven
International Workshop on 'The structure of the noun phrase in English:
synchronic and diachronic explorations' (NP1), to be held at the University of
Vigo (Spain) on 2-3 October 2009. 

Call for Papers

Although there exists an enormous literature on many aspects of nouns and noun
phrases (NPs) in English, there are still fundamental issues in their structure
and distribution that remain unsolved. These involve matters like the structural
relations between different types of NP elements, the relation between internal
and external properties of NPs, the parallels (or lack thereof) between verbal
and nominal constituents, the factors responsible for the textual frequencies of
various NP-related phenomena, and the contribution of different types of NPs to
the information structure of texts. This workshop aims at bringing together
researchers who are currently looking at the English NP from different points of
view (theoretical, structural, functional, textual and descriptive).

We would therefore like to invite presentations concerned with any topic
involving NPs, including the following:
- NP complexity: the relationship between grammatical function and NP complexity
- NP types, including binominal phrases, discontinuous NPs and possessive
constructions
- the structural representation of NPs and their constituents 
- strategies of premodification, postmodification and complementation in the NP
- apposition in the NP
- headedness and NPs
- the exploration of the implications of particular theoretical frameworks for
NP structure: diachronic, syntactic, construction-based, cognitive perspectives
on all of the above
 
Invited Speakers:
- Douglas Biber (Northern Arizona University)
- Evelien Keizer (Universiteit van Amsterdam)
- John Payne (The University of Manchester)

Abstracts must be submitted in MS Word or RTF format as an e-mail attachment to
np1@uvigo.es by 30 March 2009. The e-mail should use the subject header 'NP1
abstract'. Abstracts should be one page in length (single-spaced), excluding
references, and be written in standard 12-point font. The page should be headed
only by the title of the paper and not mention the presenter(s) nor their
affiliations or addresses. The accompanying e-mail should include:
(a) Title of the paper
(b) Name(s) of the author(s)
(c) Institutional affiliation(s)
(d) E-mail address(es)
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 30 April 2009.

Publication:
Authors of papers accepted for presentation will be invited to submit their
papers for publication in a special journal issue or volume with an
international publisher. Papers will be subjected to refereeing.

Important Dates:
30 March 2009: Deadline for abstract submission
30 April 2009: Notification of acceptance or rejection
1 September: (Re-)Submission of 1-page abstract for conference booklet
2-3 October: Workshop at Vigo, Spain

Workshop organisation: NP1 is organised by the Language Variation and Textual
Categorisation (LVTC) research group at the University of Vigo
(http://lvtcuvigo.blogspot.com), in cooperation with:
- the School of English at the University of Newcastle
- the VLCG Research Group at the University of Santiago de Compostela
- the Functional Linguistics Leuven (FLL) Research group at the University of
Leuven.
Providing there is sufficient interest, we anticipate having follow-up workshops
in later years.

This workshop is sponsored by the English Linguistics Circle (ELC), a network
coordinated by Professor Teresa Fanego involving four research groups based at
the Universities of Santiago de Compostela and Vigo (http://elc.org.es).
