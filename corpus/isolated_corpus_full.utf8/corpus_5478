Meeting Description:

The 13th Meeting of the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics
Association is hosted by Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian studies,
University of Oslo and Bredtvet Resource Centre, Oslo.

The program will consist of a combination of plenary talks, thematic symposia,
and general oral and poster sessions. The meeting will cover a wide range of
topics, which include (but are not limited to) the following: clinical
phonetics, clinical linguistics (phonology, semantics, syntax, pragmatics),
assessment, treatment and methodology in speech and language pathology,
developmental language disorders, acquired language disorders (aphasia, apraxia,
etc.), audiology, hearing impairment, communication disorders across languages. 

Call for Papers:

ICPLA 13 in Oslo invites submissions for panel proposals and abstracts for
individual research papers. All abstracts will be evaluated through peer
reviewing, and authors will be notified. 

Panel Proposals:

To encourage collaboration and topical coherence within the field of clinical
linguistics and phonetics, please submit a panel proposal on any topic relevant
to the conference by September 1, 2009. Panel proposals should consist of a
brief outline (500 words) of the theme and purpose of the panel, with an
indication of the people the organiser(s) anticipate(s) as speakers in the
panel. Panels are collections of 3-5 individual paper presentations that relate
to a narrowly defined topic of interest. Panel organisers are asked to avoid, if
at all possible, restricting their panel to an in-group; openness and diversity
of perspectives is compatible with topical coherence.

Accepted panels will be given a time slot of 90 minutes. A list of accepted
panels will be posted on the web-site by October 15, 2009. The organiser of a
panel is the person responsible for securing the cooperation of all the
participants who are to be involved in the panel, and for deciding on the
internal structure of the panel. 

Abstracts for individual panel contributions must be submitted by November 1,
2009 (cf. below on guidelines for submission of abstracts), and will be
subjected to peer reviewing. Contributions for panels cannot be submitted
without the prior consent of the panel organiser(s). 

Deadlines:

1. Panel proposals must be submitted no later than September 1, 2009. 
2. Abstracts for contributions to panels (subject to the panel organiser's prior
approval - see above) and individual abstracts for oral papers and posters on
any topic relevant to the conference must be submitted no later than November 1,
2009.
3. Notification of acceptance will be sent out by February 15, 2010. 
 
Guidelines for Submission of Abstracts:

Submission of abstracts can only be done via the Easy Abstracts facility at
Linguist List (lenke). All abstracts must be submitted in a .pdf format. The
site will be open for abstract submission from June 15, 2009. 

Before submitting your abstract, please read all of the following instructions:
 
- Abstracts should consist of max. 500 words and be based on research that is
completed or clearly in progress, with a well-formulated research question and a
good description of the type(s) of data used (if the work is empirical), the
theoretical and methodological approach and the results/conclusions. 
- For posters, a clear description of a research design may be acceptable, as
this can lead to useful discussions in the early stages of a project. Posters
will be up for one whole day; during that day, there will be a specific time
slot during which the presenters will be present at their poster for discussion. 
- For oral presentations, 20-minute slots will be available (including
discussion time). 
- It is the individual submitter's choice to submit for an oral presentation or
a poster. However, provided your consent, the organising committee may allocate
your presentation to a poster session rather than an oral session. 

The official language of the conference is English. Posters and oral
presentations must therefore be in English.
