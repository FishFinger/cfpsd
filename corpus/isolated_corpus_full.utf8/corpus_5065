Location: University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Christopher Hart
Meeting Email: c.j.hart@herts.ac.uk

Call Deadline: 15-Dec-2009 

Meeting Description:

The third UK Cognitive Linguistics conference (UK-CLC3) will take place at the
University of Hertfordshire, over three days: 6-8th inclusive, July 2010.  The
conference theme is meaning, mind and (social) reality. 

Call for Papers

The following distinguished scholars will be giving keynote lectures relating to
aspects of the conference theme: 
- Professor William Croft (University of New Mexico, USA)
- Professor Ewa Dabrowska (University of Sheffield, UK)
- Professor John Lucy (University of Chicago, USA)
- Professor Peter Stockwell (University of Nottingham, UK)
- Professor Gabriella Vigliocco (University College London, UK) 

We now invite the submission of abstracts (for paper or poster presentations)
addressing all aspects of cognitive linguistics.  These include but are by no
means limited to:
- Domains and frame semantics
- Categorization, prototypes and polysemy
- Metaphor and metonymy 
- Mental spaces and conceptual blending
- Cognitive and construction grammar
- Embodiment and language acquisition
- Language evolution and language change
- Language use and linguistic relativity

Cognitive linguistics is an inherently interdisciplinary enterprise which is
broadly concerned with the connection between language and cognition in relation
to body, culture and contexts of use.  We are therefore especially interested in
interdisciplinary research - theoretical, empirical, and applied - that combines
theories and methods from across the cognitive, biological and social sciences.
These include but are not limited to:
- Linguistics
- Anthropology
- Evolution
- Paleoanthropology
- Primatology
- Neuroscience
- Cognitive and developmental psychology
- (Critical) Discourse and Communication studies

Papers will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for question.  Posters will
stay up for a day and be allocated to dedicated, timetabled sessions.  The
language of the conference is English.

Abstracts of no more than 300 words (excluding references) should be sent by
email as a Word attachment to c.j.hart@herts.ac.uk by 15 December 2009.  The
document should contain presentation title, the abstract and preference for
paper or poster presentation.  Please DO NOT include information identifying the
author(s) in the email attachment.  Author(s) information including name,
affiliation and email address(es) should be detailed in the body of the email. 
All abstracts will be subject to peer review by an international Scientific
Committee.  Notification of acceptance decisions will be communicated by
February 15th 2010.

Presenters will be invited to submit papers based on the conference theme for 
an edited volume to be published by Equinox Publishing Co. in the  Advances in
Cognitive Linguistics series.  Accepted papers will be subject to peer-review.
Keep up-to-date by checking the conference website regularly:

The conference is organized by Chris Hart (Chair of local organizing committee),
and Vyv Evans (on behalf of the UK-CLA).  For details of the UK-CLA see:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
