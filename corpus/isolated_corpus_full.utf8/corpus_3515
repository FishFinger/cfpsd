Meeting Description:

Generation Challenges 2009 is an umbrella event designed to bring together a
variety of shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of natural
language.  Evaluation results and participating systems will be presented at the
Generation Challenges 2009 Special Session at the 12th European Workshop on
Natural Language Generation (ENLG'09). 

Second Call for Papers


Generation Challenges 2009 
To be held in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

Following the NSF/SIGGEN Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative Evaluation in
NLG in April 2007 
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/), and the INLG'06 Special
Session on Sharing Data and Comparative Evaluation 
(http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/inlg06-specsess.html), there has
recently been a lot of activity in connection with shared tasks in Natural
Language Generation (NLG).  The Pilot Attribute Selection for Generating
Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place between May and September
2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge
2008 has just been completed; the GIVE Challenge is currently underway; and
other challenges are being prepared.  More information about all of these
activities can be found via the links on the Generation Challenges
homepage: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09

To provide a common forum for these activities, we are organizing Generation
Challenges 2009, an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of
shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of natural language.
 Evaluation results and participating systems will be presented at the
Generation Challenges 2009 Special Session at the 12th European Workshop on
Natural Language Generation (ENLG'09).

Shared Tasks:
There will be three shared tasks at Generation Challenges 2009 which will be
organised independently (for details, please refer to the Call for Participation
for each task):
1. The GIVE Challenge (Koller, Byron, Moore, Oberlander & Striegnitz):
Generation of natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a
virtual environment. This task has started, for more information go to:
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/v1akolle/proj/give
2. GREC Tasks (Belz, Gatt, Kow & Viethen): Generation of references to named
entities in discourse; (i) GREC-MSR Task: selection of referring expressions for
references to the main subject of the text; (ii) GREC-NEG
Task: generation of referring expressions for all mentions of people in a text.
For more information go to:
http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/grec
3. TUNA Progress Test (Gatt, Belz & Kow): An opportunity to improve on
REG'08 Task 3, i.e. mapping from TUNA domain representations to referring
expressions. For more information go to:
http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/tuna

Special Track- Proposals for Future Tasks:
We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the
general area of language generation.  Proposed tasks can be in the area of core
NLG, or straddle more than one research area in which language is generated,
e.g. core NLG and MT, or core NLG and text summarization.  Submissions should
describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding
organizers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application
context, size and state of completion of data to be used, and evaluation plans.

Open Track:
We invite submissions of papers reporting any language generation method and
results obtained using the training and development data from any of the shared
task tracks.  The task definition should differ from that in the corresponding
shared task track, and submissions will be reviewed according to standard
workshop reviewing criteria.

Evaluation Methods Track:
We invite submissions of papers describing any evaluation method that can be
used to evaluate systems submitted to any of the shared tasks. Papers should
report results for applying the evaluation method to one or more systems
implementing a solution to one of the shared tasks (although different data may
be used).  Submissions will be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing
criteria.

Instructions for Paper Submissions:
Submissions in the Special Track, Open Track and Evaluation Methods Track should
be no more than 4 (four) pages long, and should follow the ACL'09 guidelines
using the style files provided via the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 homepage.  Papers should
be sent in PDF format by email to nlg-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk.  Special Track
papers should be submitted no later than 30 November 2008.  Papers in the Open
Track and the Evaluation Methods Track should be submitted no later than 12
January 2009.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the review committee (see
below).  As reviewing will not be blind, there is no need to anonymise papers.

Accepted submissions will be included in the ENLG'09 proceedings, but the page
limit for camera-ready versions has not yet been finalized (the final limit will
depend on how many submissions there are).

Dates:
Submission of task proposal papers- 30 November 2008
Notification of acceptance of task proposals- 31 December 2008
Submission of papers in Open and Evaluation Methods tracks- 12 January 2009
Expected deadline for camera-ready papers- early Feb 2009
ENLG'09 (provisional)- 30-31 March 2009
