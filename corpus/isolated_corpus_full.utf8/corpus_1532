CALL FOR PAPERS
************************************************************************

The 3rd International Workshop on
VOCABULARIES, ONTOLOGIES AND RULES FOR THE ENTERPRISE
(VORTE 2007)

http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/VORTE/

In conjunction with the 11th IEEE International
EDOC Conference (EDOC 2007)
"The Enterprise Computing Conference"
http://edoc.mitre.org/

15-19 October 2007, Annapolis, Maryland, USA


Selected papers accepted to the workshop to be invited for a
special issue in Elsevier\u2019s ISI-indexed Information Systems journal
http://www.elsevier.com/locate/infosys/
************************************************************************

WORKSHOP OVERVIEW

Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
VORTE 2007 is the third workshop associated with an EDOC conference
that intends to bring together researchers and practitioners in areas
such as philosophical ontology, enterprise modelling, information
systems, Semantic Web, Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), business
rules, and business processes. The goal of the workshop is to discuss
the role that foundational and domain ontologies play in the
conceptual development and implementation of next generation tools for
enterprise computing.  Since enterprise vocabularies and ontologies,
as well as business rules do not exist in isolation but serve to
support business processes, THIS YEAR WE ARE PLANNING TO PUT SPECIAL
EMPHASIS ON BUSINESS PROCESS MODELLING AND MANAGEMENT.

THEMES AND TOPICS

The workshop contributions will be organized along four major thematic
areas, under which the following topics of interest will be included,
but not limited to:

* Conceptual Modelling
- Business Vocabularies, Terminologies, and Taxonomies
- Ontological Approaches to Content and Knowledge Management
- Enterprise Information Integration and Interoperability
- Service Taxonomies and Service Registries (for example, UDDI-related
  research)
- Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modelling
- Languages for Conceptual Modelling (for example, OWL and UML)
- Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modelling
* Business Rules and Business Process Semantics
- Semantic Web Services
- Service Ontologies (for example, research related to OWL-S)
- Business Rule Languages and Components
- Rule-based Approaches to Web Service Policies and Choreographies
- Ontologies for Business Process Management
- Agent-based Business Rule and Process Management
- Business Process Modelling and Execution Languages (for example, BPMN
  and BPML)
* Ontologies for Enterprise Computing
- Foundational Ontologies and Enterprise Computing
- Ontological Evaluation of Enterprise Systems
- Ontologies for Interoperability of Enterprise Systems
- Ontology-based Enterprise Architectures
- Ontology-based Software Engineering for Enterprises
- Enterprise Components\u2019 Modelling
* Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approaches to Enterprise Computing
- Modelling and Architecture Frameworks
- Domain Engineering
- Domain-specific Business Information and System Engineering
- Transformation between MDA layers

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. Submissions should be 6 to 8 pages long and MUST
use the two-column format of IEEE conference proceedings, which is
referenced on the workshop's web site, and include the authors\u2019
name, affiliation, and contact details. Papers must be submitted in
the PDF format using EasyChair at
http://www.easychair.org/VORTE2007. Authors will be notified about the
decision by the program committee by the 11th of August 2007. At least
one author of each accepted paper must participate in the
workshop. The papers accepted for the EDOC 2007 Workshops will be
published after the workshop with its own ISBN in the IEEE Digital
Library (pending approval by IEEE), which is accessible by IEEE
Xplore.

JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE

A selection of the best papers accepted to the workshop and presented
there will be invited to the special issue of Elsevier ISI-indexed
Information Systems journal (subject to the second round of
peer-review).
