Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 22-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

In 1996 ESSLLI hosted a workshop on 'The Mathematics of Syntactic Structure'
that covered a range of topics in the area now known as Model-Theoretic Syntax
which was then just emerging. Over the ensuing decade MTS has established itself
as a subdiscipline, focusing on descriptive approaches to formalizing theories
of syntax by defining classes of ordinary mathematical structures directly in
terms of linguistically relevant structural properties rather than in terms of
generative or automata-theoretic processes. The 2001 FG/MoL meeting, affiliated
with ESSLLI'01, included a symposium on the then current state of MTS.
