Full Title: International Journal of Translation 


Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2007 

International Journal of Translation, ISSN 0940-9819, published since 1989
by Bahri Publications, solicits papers relevant for theory and practice of
manual, computer-aided, or machine translation.

Several special issues of this journal are planned for the nearest future,
the nearest one being on "Multilingual Lexical Resources" (other topics can
also be considered). Relevant for this issue are any papers related to the
compilation and use of multilingual lexical resources in machine
translation or translation practice. 

The publication has no cost for the authors, and the publisher sends one
complete copy of the issue to every author. The publisher's income comes
from the readers, not from the authors, which guarantees quality.
