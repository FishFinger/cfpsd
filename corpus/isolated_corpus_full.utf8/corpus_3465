Meeting Description:

Relating Asymmetries between Speech & Comprehension in the Acquisition of
Language (RASCAL) Conference

University of Groningen, the Netherlands
January 24th & January 25th, 2009 

2nd Call for Papers 

Background:
In the past decades, research on language acquisition has identified several
asymmetries between production and comprehension in various languages and in
various components of the grammar (e.g., with respect to word order, referring
expressions such as pronouns, tense/aspect, and contrastive stress). Many of
these asymmetries came as a surprise to their investigators, because no
asymmetries are expected under the traditional view of the grammar as a
direction-insensitive system of rules. The aim of this conference is to bring
together empirical and theoretical research addressing symmetries and
asymmetries in language production and comprehension.

Important questions that we hope to address at the conference are: Are
production/comprehension asymmetries purely pragmatic phenomena, or do they
arise in all modules of the grammar? If one language displays a particular
asymmetry, do we find the same asymmetry in other languages? At what ages do we
find such asymmetries and at what age do these asymmetries generally disappear?
Is it methodologically valid to compare performance in production with
performance in comprehension? What is the relation between
production/comprehension asymmetries and general cognitive measures such as
working memory capacity and Theory of Mind abilities? 

Invited speakers:
Lila Gleitman, University of Pennsylvania
Helen Tager-Flusberg, Boston University

Panel Discussion: 
''Asymmetries in Child Language: Where do they come from?''

We welcome contributions related to the following fields: 
- Linguistic Theory
- First language acquisition		
- Second language acquisition
- Bilingualism
- Language Disorders
- Cognition & Language
- Psycholinguistics
- Semantics
- Syntax
- Pragmatics
- Discourse & Narrative

The topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Symmetries and asymmetries in language comprehension and production
- The relation between production and comprehension and the role of grammar therein
- Methodological problems in comparing performance in comprehension with
performance in production
- Asymmetries between comprehension and production in language disorders

Abstracts: 
Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (with 15 minutes for discussion), as
well as poster presentations. The conference language is English.

Submissions should include:
- A cover page with the title of the paper/poster, all authors' names and
affiliations, and contact information of the 1st author (postal address, email
address, telephone). On the cover page, include 2-4 key words relating to
research fields and indicate whether you would like your abstract to be
considered for a poster, a paper, or both.
- A one-page abstract (single-spaced with at least size 11 font), with an
optional second page for examples, data and references. No identity properties
of the author should be found on the abstract page(s).

Cover page and abstract must be submitted electronically to rascal@rug.nl, in
PDF format.  Please title the email ''Abstract RASCAL''  +  the first author's
last name.  All authors will be invited to submit their paper for a journal
proceedings volume.  

The deadline for abstract submission is September 22, 2008 and notification of
acceptance will be sent no later than October 27, 2008.
