Location: Trim, Ireland 
Contact Person: Albert Gatt
Meeting Email: albert.gatt@um.edu.mt

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 11-Apr-2010 

Meeting Description:

To be held in conjunction with INLG 2010.

Over the past three years, there has been a lot of activity in connection with
shared tasks in Natural Language Generation (NLG).Three separate sets of shared
tasks with their own data and organisation team have so far been organised: TUNA
(Gatt et al.), GREC (Belz et al.) and GIVE (Koller et al.).  The Pilot Attribute
Selection for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place in
2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge in 2008; the first
umbrella event encompassing all three sets of shared tasks, Generation
Challenges 2009, has just been completed; and other challenges are being
prepared.  More information about all of these activities can be found via the
links on the Generation Challenges homepage:
http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal10

In order to continue to provide a common forum for these activities, we are
organising Generation Challenges 2009, an umbrella event designed to bring
together a variety of shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation
of natural language.  Evaluation results and participating systems will be
presented at the Generation Challenges 2010 Special Session at the 6th
International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG'10). 

Call for Papers

Shared Tasks:
There will be two shared tasks at Generation Challenges 2010 which will be
organised independently (for details, please refer to the Call for Participation
for each task):
- The GIVE-2 Challenge (Koller et al.): Generation of natural-language
instructions to aid human task-solving in a virtual environment. This task has
started, for more information go to: http://www.give-challenge.org/research/give-2/

- Post-processing Referring Expressions (using GREC-NEG and DUC data) (Belz et
al.): Call for Participation in preparation. For more information go to:
http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal10

Track on Proposals for Future Tasks:
We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the
general area of language generation.  Proposed tasks can be in the area of core
NLG, or straddle more than one research area in which language is generated,
e.g. core NLG and MT, or core NLG and text summarization.  Submissions should
describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding
organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application
context, size and state of completion of data to be used, and evaluation plans.

Open Track:
We invite submissions of papers reporting any language generation method and
results obtained using the training and development data from any of the shared
task tracks. The task definition should differ in some way from that in the
corresponding shared task track, and submissions will be reviewed according to
standard workshop reviewing
criteria.

Evaluation Methods Track:
We invite submissions of papers describing any evaluation method that can be
used to evaluate systems submitted to any of the shared tasks. Papers should
report results for applying the evaluation method to one or more systems
implementing a solution to one of the shared tasks (although different data may
be used).  Submissions will be reviewed according to standard workshop reviewing
criteria.

Instructions for Paper Submissions:
Submissions in the Task Proposals Track, Open Track and Evaluation Methods Track
should be no more than 4 (four) pages long, and should follow the ACL'10
guidelines using the style files provided via the ACL 2010 homepage.  Papers
should be sent in PDF format by email to nlg-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk. Task
Proposals, Open and Evaluation Track papers should be submitted no later than 11
April 2010.

Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Generation Challenges
Steering Committee (see below).  As reviewing will not be blind, there is no
need to anonymise papers.

Accepted submissions will be included in the INLG'10 proceedings, but the page
limit for camera-ready versions has not yet been finalized (the final limit will
depend on how many submissions there are).

Dates:
Paper submission: 11 April 2010
Notification of acceptance:	25 April 2010
Submission of camera-ready papers: 23 May 2010
INLG'10: 7-9 July 2010
