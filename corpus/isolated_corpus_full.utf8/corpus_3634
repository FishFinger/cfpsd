Hi all,

Please distribute the following call for abstracts and indeed consider
submitting. The deadline is 19 October, just a few days away.

Note that there will be a keynote presentation by Dina Demner-Fushman,
and possibly an additional keynote presentation (waiting for
confirmation).

                   BioSearch08
      HCSNet Next-Generation Search Workshop on
          Search in Biomedical Information

   http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/bio-search08


Date:     30 November 2008
Location: Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane

Contact:  Diego Molla, diego@ics.mq.edu.au;
         Robert Dale, Robert.Dale@mq.edu.au


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

There are many aspects of research and practice in medical
environments that require searching for medical information in large
information repositories of published research papers (such as
PubMed), and large ontologies and other structured resources (such as
UMLS). The availability of these resources and the need to find
information in them has prompted intensive research on the treatment
of medical text, images and videos for information extraction and
retrieval.

All of these tasks require the development of techniques that go
beyond the localisation of generic search and information extraction
techniques, given the high level of complexity in terminology, and the
need for achieving high performance.

The aim of HCSNet's Priority Research Area in Next Generation Search
is to bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines to
address issues related to search and information extraction. This
specialised workshop will focus on the medical and biological domains
and will take place just before GIW 2008, in Brisbane.


AUDIENCE

We welcome anyone from academia and industry with an interest in any
area related to search and information extraction from biomedical
information, including but not limited to the following:

   * Text search
   * Text mining
   * Named entity recognition
   * Information extraction
   * Linguistic analysis
   * Parsing
   * Text pre-processing
   * Text summarisation
   * Video retrieval
   * Image retrieval
   * Question answering
   * Ontologies
   * Human-computer interaction

KEYNOTE PRESENTATION

There will be a keynote presentation by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman with
title:

"Information retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Clinical
Decision Support"

Information retrieval and natural language processing methods are
instrumental in enhancing healthcare by providing clinicians, patients
and other involved individuals with knowledge and person-specific
information presented at appropriate times. Some of the specific
challenges of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) are: using free-text
information to drive CDS, representing clinical knowledge and CDS
interventions in standardized formats, and leveraging the data
available in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which often contain
narrative healthcare data.

This talk will present research on several aspects of the CDS
challenges: developing strategies for automatic question and query
formulation using information extracted from clinical narratives;
finding adequate evidence and extracting answers to clinical and
translational research questions; and retrieving images to illustrate
evidence.

Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman is a Staff Scientist for the Communications
Engineering Branch at the National Library of Medicine. She conducts
research in clinical decision support, clinical question answering,
use of natural language processing in information retrieval, human
computer interaction aspects of information retrieval, and information
retrieval in biomedical domain. Her interest in biomedical language
processing stems from years of clinical practice (M.D. obtained from
Kazan State Medical Institute in 1980) and clinical research
(Doctorate (Ph.D.) in Medical Science earned from Moscow Medical and
Stomatological Institute in 1989.) She earned her MS and PhD in
Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2003
and 2006, respectively.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

We aim to facilitate an environment that helps to further develop
grounds for collaboration across the research and development
communities. Accordingly, the workshop will consist of a number of
presentations of different types with this focus in mind:

   * 10 minute speed presentations that describe a new project or
     specific idea to be shared with the community, with the aim of
     encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration;

   * 10 minute student project presentations, with the aim of
     informing the community of new ideas being developed, and to get
     feedback from an interdisciplinary audience; and

   * 3 minute poster presentations for those presenting a poster
     only.


SUBMISSIONS

We want to involve as many as possible in discussion, so the effort
required for attendance is deliberately small.

Those interested in making a speed presentation, student presentation
or poster should submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length.

In addition, we ask all those interested in attending to submit a
100-150 word statement indicating their research interests pertinent
to the workshop theme. These will be made available as part of the
workshop materials.

Please send all submissions by using the submission form at
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/bio-search08.


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a
number of participants from outside the Brisbane area. The provision
of a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If
not all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated
based on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop theme; also,
early career researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received
their PhDs in the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards will be available for
postgraduate students outside the Brisbane area. To apply for this
funding stream, include a short CV in plain text in the submission
form.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, membership of
HCSNet (join via the website) and prior registration for this workshop
are required.


IMPORTANT DATES

   * Submission of Abstracts: 19 October 2008
   * Notification of Awards:  24 October 2008
   * Workshop:                30 November 2008
