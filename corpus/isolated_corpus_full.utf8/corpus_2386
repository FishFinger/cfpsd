The Programme Committee for the 22nd International Conference on  =

Computational Linguistics invites proposals for workshops to be held  =

in conjunction with COLING 2008 in Manchester, United Kingdom.  =

Workshops provide the opportunity for in-depth discussion on a  =

focused area of research. We solicit proposals on any topic of  =

interest to the Coling community, including those which explore  =

emerging research and/or inter-disciplinary issues.

Workshops will be held close to the location of the main conference  =

during the weekends preceding and following the main conference  =

(16-17th and 23-24 August).

The START system will be available to assist workshop organisers with  =

the reviewing process.

1 Title and short description (up to 500 words) of the workshop topic  =

and motivation.

2 A description of target audience and expected number of  =

participants. (If the workshop is part of a series, also provide  =

details of number of submissions, acceptances and registered  =

participants for previous events.)

3 The intended length and format of the workshop. (It is expected  =

that the majority of workshops will last for one day although half- =

day and two-day workshops can also be accommodated.)

4 Whether you have any preference for the workshop to be held before  =

or after the main conference. (Pre-conference workshops will be held  =

on the 16th and 17th of August, post-conference workshops on the 23rd  =

and 24th.)

5 Proposed timetable for workshop submissions and reviewing process,  =

including dates for submission deadline, notification of acceptance  =

and submission of camera-ready versions. (Please ensure these are  =

consistent with the important dates listed below.)

6 Budget proposal. Coling will provide the workshop with a meeting  =

room (including projection facilities), electronic proceedings and  =

coffee break refreshments. Please indicate whether you have any  =

requirements for exceptional items and how you would expect to meet  =

these costs.

7 Special requirements (e.g. computer infrastructure or shared task).

8 List of workshop organisers and, for each organiser, a brief  =

paragraph describing their relevant experience.

9 List of individuals who have agreed to be part of the workshop  =

programme committee if the proposal is accepted.

10 Full contact details (postal address, phone number, e-mail address  =
