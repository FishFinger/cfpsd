Meeting Description:

The International Association for Dialogue Analysis (IADA) announces 
the 11th International Conference on Dialogue Analysis on the topic of
'Dialogue Analysis and Rhetoric' to be held on March 27-30, 2007 at 
the University of Muenster in Westphalia/GER. 

Convener:
Prof. Dr. Edda Weigand (University of Muenster) 

Call for Papers:

Over the past two decades interest in rhetoric has become more and more 
central in dialogue studies. The basic questions concerning the nature of 
dialogue and of rhetoric have been addressed from new perspectives. Are 
they to be dealt with separately by focusing on a distinction between 
rhetorical and non-rhetorical texts, or is rhetoric an intrinsic part of dialogue 
analysis? How do we most effectively pursue our goals in communication? 
How can we optimize performance? As the object itself - effective dialogic 
interaction - is a complex object, addressing rhetoric in dialogue cuts across 
disciplinary boundaries of linguistics, philosophy, media and communication 
sciences. It is dealt with in rule-governed models of communicative 
competence as well as in models of ever-changing performance. Recently a 
research tendency can be observed which aims to bring both strands 
together, competence and performance, in describing human beings' ability 
of competence-in-performance. In this sense, the conference is open to the 
various approaches in Dialogue Analysis and Rhetoric but will have a 
specific focus on approaches that aim at addressing the mixed game of 
effective dialogic interaction. Questions of culture and institutions are 
included.

Plenary papers will be given by: Adelino Cattani (Padova), Kenneth N. 
Cissna (Tampa/South Florida), François Cooren (Montreal), Robert T. Craig 
(Boulder/Colorado), Werner Kallmeyer (Mannheim), Frans van Eemeren 
(Amsterdam), Edda Weigand (Münster)

Conference languages are English, German, French.

Possible session topics:

-Advances in the complex of competence-in-performance

-Rhetoric in institutions, Legal argumentation, Media strategies, Political
