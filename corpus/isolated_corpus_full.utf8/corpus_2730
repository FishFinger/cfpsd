CALL FOR PAPERS
***Deadline extended until March 16th*** =

 =

Second IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing  =

IEEE ICSC2008   =

August 4th-7th,  2008, Santa Clara, CA, USA =

http://icsc.eecs.uci.edu/ =

 =

Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society =

 =

The field of Semantic Computing (SC) brings together those disci- =

plines concerned with connecting the  (often  vaguely-formulated) =

intentions  of humans with computational content. This connection =

can go both ways: retrieving,  using  and  manipulating  existing =

content according to user's goals ("do what the user means"); and =

creating, rearranging, and managing content that matches the  au- =

thor's intentions ("do what the author means"). =

 =

The  content  addressed  in  SC  includes, but is not limited to, =

structured and semi-structured data, multimedia data, text,  pro- =

grams, services and, even, network behavior.  This connection be- =

tween content and the user is made  via  (1)  Semantic  Analysis, =

which  analyzes content with the goal of converting it to meaning =

(semantics); (2) Semantic Integration, which  integrates  content =

and  semantics  from multiple sources; (3) Semantic Applications, =

which utilize content and semantics to solve  problems;  and  (4) =

Semantic Interfaces, which attempt to interpret users' intentions =

expressed in natural language or other communicative forms. =

 =

Example areas of SC include (but, again, are not limited to) the =

following: =

 =

ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF CONTENT =

 Natural-language processing =

 Image and video analysis =

 Audio and speech analysis =

 Analysis of structured and semi-structured data =

 Analysis of behavior of software, services, and networks =

 =

INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS =

 Database schema integration =

 Ontology integration =

 Interoperability and Service Integration =

 =

SEMANTIC INTERFACES =

 Natural-Language Interface =

 Multimodal Interfaces =

 =

APPLICATIONS =

 Semantic Web and other search technologies =

 Question answering =

 Semantic Web services =

 Multimedia databases =

 Engineering of software, services, and networks based on =

   natural-language specifications =

 Context-aware networks of sensors, devices, and/or applications =

 =

The second IEEE International Conference  on  Semantic  Computing =

(ICSC2008)  builds on the success of ICSC2007 as an international =

interdisciplinary forum  for  researchers  and  practitioners  to =

present  research that advances the state of the art and practice =

of Semantic Computing, as well as identifying  the  emerging  re- =

search topics and defining the future of Semantic Computing.  The =

conference particularly welcomes interdisciplinary research  that =

facilitates the ultimate success of Semantic Computing. =

 =

The  event  is  located  in Santa Clara, California, the heart of =

Silicon Valley.  The technical program of ICSC2008 includes tuto- =

rials,  workshops, invited talks, paper presentations, panel dis- =

cussions, demo sessions, and an industry track.   Submissions  of =

high-quality  papers  describing  mature results or on-going work =

are invited. =

 =

In addition to Technical Papers, the conference will feature =

    * Tutorials, =

    * Workshops, =

    * Demo Sessions, =

    * Special Sessions, =

    * Panels, =

    * and an Industry Track. =

 =

Please  refer  to the conference website for further information: =

http://icsc.eecs.uci.edu/ =

 =

SUBMISSIONS  =

Authors are invited to submit an 8-page technical paper manuscript =

in double-column IEEE format following the guidelines available on the =

ICSC2008 web page under "submissions". =

 =

The Conference Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer =

Society Press.  Distinguished quality papers presented at the con- =

ference will be selected for publications in internationally renowned =

journals. =

 =

There will be a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award for =

the best submitted paper and the best submitted student paper. The =

award winners will be announced at the conference banquet. =

 =

IMPORTANT DATES  =

Regular Paper Submission (extended): March 16th, 2008  =

Notification: April 24th, 2008  =

Camera-Ready Papers: May 16th, 2008  =

Conference: August 4th-7th, 2008 =
