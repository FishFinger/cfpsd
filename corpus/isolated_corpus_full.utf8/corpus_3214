FOIS 2008 Call for Posters

The 5th International Conference
on Formal Ontology in Information Systems

http://fois08.dfki.de

October 31st - November 3rd, 2008
Saarbrücken, Germany
DFKI, Competence Center Semantic Web
http://semanticweb.dfki.de/

Conference Description:

Since its inception ten years ago, the International Conference on Formal
Ontology in Information Systems has explored the multiple perspectives on the
notion of ontology that have arisen from such diverse research communities as
philosophy, logic, computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, and various
scientific domains.

As ontologies have been applied in new and exciting domains such as the World
Wide Web, bioinformatics, and geographical information systems, it has become
evident that there is a need for ontologies that have been developed with solid
theoretical foundations based on philosophical, linguistic, and logical
analysis. Similarly, there is also a need for theoretical research that is
driven by the issues that have been raised by recent work in the more applied
domains.

FOIS is intended to be a forum in which to explore this interplay between the
theoretical insights of formal ontology and their application to information
systems and emerging semantic technologies.

Invited Speakers:
- Johanna Seibt (Aarhus Universitet, Denmark)
- Mike Uschold (Boeing Corporation, USA)
- York Sure (SAP Research, Germany)

Accepted Papers:
The list of accepted papers is available via
http://fois08.dfki.de/joomla/index.php/papers .

Poster Session:
The poster session at FOIS 2008 shall give young scientists the opportunity to
present their current work related to formal ontology in information systems and
discuss their approach, results, problems and methods with the other
participants of the conference. The selection of poster contributions will be
based on submitted research papers and pay specific attention to their relevance
to the topics of FOIS 2008.

The poster proceedings compiled from the contributions will be published
electronically and made available via the conference web page.

Important Dates and Further Information:
-  Submissions: August 31, 2008
-  Acceptance Notification: September 22, 2008
-  Submission of camera-ready papers: October 5, 2008
-  Electronic publication of poster proceedings: October 20, 2008
-  Conference: October 31 - November 3, 2008

Submitted poster presentations must not exceed 6 pages (including bibliography).
They should be submitted electronically in the form of a pdf-file (formatted
according to the IOS paper guidelines
http://www.iospress.nl/authco/instruction_crc.html) to be mailed to
fois08@easychair.org.
Further information will be provided on the conference web page:

Chairs:
Conference Chair:
- Nicola Guarino (ISTC-CNR, Trento, Italy)
Program Chairs:
- Carola Eschenbach (University of Hamburg, Germany)
-  Michael Gruninger (University of Toronto, Canada)
Local Organization: DFKI - Competence Center Semantic Web
-  Paul Buitelaar (DFKI GmbH, Saarbrücken, Germany)
-  Massimo Romanelli (DFKI GmbH, Saarbrücken, Germany)
-  Michael Sintek (DFKI GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany)

Topics:
We seek contributions on a wide range of topics. While authors may focus on
fairly narrow and specific issues, all papers should emphasize the relevance of
the work described to formal ontology and to information systems.
Topic areas of particular interest to the conference are:

Foundational Issues
-  Kinds of entity: particulars vs. universals, continuants vs. occurrents,
abstracta vs. concreta, dependent vs. independent, natural vs. artificial
-  Formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence, constitution,
subsumption, instantiation
-  Vagueness and granularity
-  Identity and change
-  Formal comparison among ontologies
-  Ontology of physical reality (matter, space, time, motion, ...)
-  Ontology of biological reality (genes, proteins, cells, organisms, ...)
-  Ontology of mental reality and agency (beliefs, intentions and other mental
attitudes; emotions, ...)
-  Ontology of social reality (institutions, organizations, norms, social
relationships, artistic expressions, ...)
-  Ontology of the information society (information, communication, meaning
negotiation, ...)
-  Ontology and Natural Language Semantics, Ontology and Cognition

Methodologies and Applications
-  Top-level vs. application ontologies
-  Ontology integration and alignment; role of reference ontologies
-  Ontology-driven information systems design
-  Requirements engineering
-  Knowledge engineering
-  Knowledge management and organization
-  Knowledge representation; Qualitative modeling
-  Computational lexica; Terminology
-  Information retrieval; Question-answering
-  Semantic web; Web services; Grid computing
-  Domain-specific ontologies, especially for: Biomedical science, eBusiness,
Enterprise integration, Geography, Law, Library science, Linguistics,...

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Meeting Description:

The Conference will bring together researchers from various domains and offer
them an opportunity to confront practices and theories. Rather than on the
technical aspects of corpus linguistics, the focus will be on the
epistemological issues raised by corpus design and exploitation. The Conference
will try to address the crucial question of the theoretical status of the
language data which linguists constantly refer to and rely on. 

Call for Papers

The status of examples and corpora in linguistics

Over the last fifteen years or so, corpora have come to play an increasing, or
even invasive, role in most areas of linguistics. This successful development
inevitably raises a set of questions as to:
- the status of examples and corpora (how does one envisage the relationship
between such data and linguistic analysis?)
- how corpora are designed (are they thought of as representative samples, and
if so of what? How does one know if this aim has been met?)
- how corpora are used (what types of exploitation are considered and to what
extent can past experience lead to a reassessment of current practice and
reflection?)

Presentations will last 25 minutes and will be followed by 15 minutes'
discussion. The Conference will include a poster session, and there will be
about 15 presentations altogether. The Proceedings will be published in 2010 in
Travaux Linguistiques du CerLiCO, Vol. 23, Presses Universitaires de Rennes.

Submissions should include, in addition to the author's institutional
affiliation and e-mail address, an anonymous abstract of around 500 words /
3,000 characters, with a few references attached. Authors should specify whether
they wish to present a paper or a poster. The abstracts will be posted on the
CerLiCO website and sent to participants on registration for the Conference.

Submissions should be sent in electronic format to :

Hélène Chuquet : helene.chuquet@univ-poitiers.fr

no later than September 15th 2008

Information about the Conference will be posted 
on the CerLiCO and FoReLL websites :
