Meeting Description:

This workshop is part of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics =
Society (DGfS 2010) at the Humboldt University, Berlin, from 23-26 February=
, 2010. It aims to bring together researchers conducting studies with secon=
d language (L2) children in order to generate a discussion on the impact of=
 internal and external factors in comprehension, production, and processing=
 in child L2 acquisition.

A considerable amount of research has investigated the impact of internal a=
nd external factors in adult second language (L2) acquisition including e.g=
., transfer effects from the L1 and effects of age of onset (internal) and =
the effects of instructed vs. naturalistic exposure (external) (White, 2003=
). Research on child L2 acquisition is relatively limited compared to adult=
 L2 acquisition, but in the last five years a growing number of studies has=
 started to investigate child L2 acquisition, both in comparison to adult L=
2 acquisition (e.g., Blom, Polisenska, & Weerman, 2006; Schwartz, 2003; Uns=
worth, 2005) and to children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) (e.g.,=
 Paradis, 2005; 2008; Paradis & Crago, 2003). Most studies have focused on =
language production, (e.g., Thoma & Tracy 2006), with a limited number inve=
stigating comprehension (Grueter, 2005; Schulz & Wenzel 2008), and on-line =
processing (Marinis, 2007; 2008). This workshop aims to bring together rese=
archers conducting studies with L2 children from different perspectives in =
order to generate a discussion on the impact of internal and external facto=
rs in comprehension, production, and processing in child L2 acquisition.=20

Call for Papers:

We invite papers investigating the impact of internal and/or external facto=
rs on child L2 acquisition of morphology, syntax, and semantics using a var=
iety of tasks including production, comprehension, and on-line processing.=
=20

The following research questions will be addressed:

- How do the properties of the L1 and the L2 interact in child L2 acquisiti=
on?=20
- Are transfer effects limited to production or do they also appear in comp=
rehension and processing strategies?
- How does age of onset, years of exposure, quantity and quality of input a=
ffect child L2 acquisition and how do these factors interact with the age o=
f the learners?=20
- Are child L2 acquisition of morphology, syntax, and semantics affected in=
 the same way by these internal and external factors?
- Can individual variation in children be explained on the basis of externa=
l factors?

This workshop is relevant for researchers working on L2 acquisition in typi=
cally-developing children and children with SLI. We hope it will provide a =
rich forum to address the impact of internal and external factors in L2 acq=
uisition in a systematic way.
