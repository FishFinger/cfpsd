Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This three-day workshop on Variation, Gradience, and Frequency in Phonology will
run concurrently with the 2007 Linguistic Institute at Stanford University in
July 2007. The goal is to facilitate the collaboration among phonologists
seeking unified theoretical explanations for qualitative and quantitative
patterns in phonology. 

Workshop on Variation, Gradience and Frequency in Phonology

Call for posters:

The workshop will focus on three main topics:

-	Phonological variation 
-	Gradient phonotactics 
-	Lexical frequency effects 

Phonology studies the sound patterns of human languages. Sound patterns
sometimes emerge as quantitative tendencies and preferences. This can be
illustrated by the following three examples. First, in American English,
word-final /t/ is variably deleted, more often before consonants (''west side'')
than before vowels (''west end''). Second, some sound combinations make better
words than others. This can be seen in the dictionary where some combinations
are statistically overrepresented, others underrepresented, as well as in
experiments where subjects judge some nonsense words to sound more natural than
others (''stin'' > ''smy'' > ''bzharsk''). Third, word frequency influences
phonological patterns. The low-frequency word ''exploit'' has initial stress as
a noun, final stress as a verb, whereas the high-frequency word ''express'' has
final stress under both readings. 

Phonological theory has traditionally focused on qualitative patterns.
Quantitative phenomena, such as variation, gradient phonotactics and lexical
frequency effects, have not figured prominently in theoretical discussion. This
is changing. Quantitative studies are becoming common, partly because of new
methodological developments (annotated corpora, sociolinguistic databases,
searchable dialect archives, on-line dictionaries, experimental psycholinguistic
data, new computational tools), and partly because of new theoretical
developments. This has broadened the empirical base of phonology and is likely
to lead to new discoveries and connections to neighboring fields of inquiry.

author(s) of the abstract should not be identified in the abstract itself. The
body of the submission message should include the title of the abstract, the
names(s) of the author(s), the(ir) affiliation(s), and e-mail address(es).
Submissions are limited to one individual and one joint abstract per author, or
two joint abstracts per author.

Deadline for submission: April 30, 2007. The workshop program will be announced
in early May.

Important Dates: 

April 30: Poster abstracts due (send to: variation07@gmail.com) 
Early May: Notification of acceptance

Meeting Description

IVA'07 is an interdisciplinary conference, bringing together researchers,
industrialists and users in the fields of interactive graphics, animation,
computer games, cognitive modelling and human-computer interaction. 

7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
Plus GALA - Gathering of Lifelike Agents
17th - 19th September 2007
Paris, France
http://iva07.ntua.gr
Call for Papers

Scope

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied agents in
an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able to interact
intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and especially with human users.

The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners
in computer graphics, animation, computer games, virtual environments,
artificial intelligence, natural language processing, cognitive modeling,
human-computer interaction and artificial life. Since the first IVA back in 1999
firm lines of research have been established and there is much that the graphics
and AI communities can learn from each other.

The domain of Intelligent Virtual Agents has become much more diverse and now
encompasses a wide range of disciplines; cognitive and social psychology,
communication models (conversational skills, interaction loops, conversational
analysis), non-verbal communication, sociology (modeling human / IVA societies),
HCI (intelligent user interfaces, gesture/body tracking interfaces), design and
arts (e.g., interactive installations with IVAs), and numerous application domains.

While initial research often focused on the use of IVAs in virtual environments,
they are now increasingly used in web-based interfaces, personal computing
devices and interactive television. The rapid advances in the field have enabled
it to be applied in both in research and industrial contexts. IVAs can provide
appealing characters for games and entertainment. They can also be used in novel
user interfaces or even as tools of psychological research.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners from
academia and industry with an interest in the design, implementation, and
evaluation of IVAs and IVA applications. We aim for a lively program of timely,
high-quality presentations and demonstrations to discuss the state of the art
and future of Intelligent Virtual Agents. Papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series.

This year, IVA'07 and ACII'07 (http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/acii2007/) are happening
close to each other. While we do encourage submitting to both conferences we do
highlight there are differences in topics of interest in each conference. We
highly advise authors to read them carefully. Papers submitted to both
conferences should be clearly different in their scope and topic.

IVA'07 will also host GALA - The Gathering of Life-like Agents - see
http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/
