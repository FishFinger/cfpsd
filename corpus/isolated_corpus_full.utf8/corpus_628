Full Title: Workshop on Language Complexity as an Evolving Variable 

Date: 12-Apr-2007 - 13-Apr-2007
Location: Leipzig, Germany 
Contact Person: David Gil
Meeting Email: gil@eva.mpg.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Dec-2006 

Meeting Description:

Workshop on Language Complexity as an Evolving Variable. 

First Call for Abstracts

12-13 April 2007
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
Leipzig, Germany

There has been a widespread assumption that all human languages, past and
present, are about equally complex (or are incommensurable in complexity), and
that adult language users do not vary significantly in the complexity of their
internalized language models. This idea survived the transition from 1950s'
descriptive linguistics to the subsequent generative paradigm unscathed.
Recently, many scholars have begun to question various aspects of this
assumption, and to provide evidence against it. Arguably, some languages are
more complex than others, and some individuals internalize more complex
idiolects than others.

This workshop aims to provide a forum where these sceptical strands can be drawn
together and tested by the research community. Invited speakers include:

  Ngoni Chipere, Barbados 
   (''Understanding Complex Sentences'')

-  Östen Dahl, Stockholm 
   (''Growth and Maintenance of Linguistic Complexity'')

-  Guy Deutscher, Leiden 
   (''Syntactic Change in Akkadian'')

-  Dan Everett, Illinois 
   (''Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã'')

-  John Hawkins, Cambridge 
   (''Efficiency and Complexity in Grammars'')

-  John McWhorter, New York 
   (''Defining Creole'')

The workshop welcomes offers of papers either challenging or defending any
aspect of the assumption of equal linguistic complexity.  Abstracts for
30-minute oral presentations should be submitted in electronic form (preferably
pdf, but MsWord also acceptable) to David Gil at the following address:

gil@eva.mpg.de

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 15 December 2006

Decisions regarding acceptance/rejection of abstracts will be announced on or
before 15 January 2007.

Sponsor:

Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig

Organizers:

Geoffrey Sampson (Sussex)
David Gil (Leipzig)]
