Meeting Description:

The 2009 Annual Meeting of the Linguistics Association of Great Britain will be
the fiftieth anniversary Golden Jubilee LAGB meeting. It will be held at the
University of Edinburgh and both members and non-members are welcome to attend. 

Call for Papers

The first circular for the 2009 LAGB Meeting, including full details for
abstract submission, is available for download from this address:
http://www.lagb.org.uk/meetings.htm

Special events at the 2009 LAGB meeting:

1. Rather than inviting speakers to give the Henry Sweet and LAGB lectures, as
is normal at LAGB Meetings, the Association has decided, as part of the
celebration of 50 years of LAGB meetings, to invite three speakers from the UK
linguistic scene (chosen by an LAGB subcommittee established to organise the
Jubilee celebrations) and to ask them to speak on a specific topic. They will
discuss the past 50 years of developments in key linguistic subfields in
Britain, and look forward to the future. 

The speakers are: Ronnie Cann (University of Edinburgh), speaking on
developments in Semantics and Pragmatics, John Harris (University College
London), speaking on Phonetics and Phonology, and Caroline Heycock (University
of Edinburgh), speaking on Syntax and Morphology. They will all speak at a
Fiftieth Anniversary Symposium on the afternoon of Sunday 6th September.

2. Following on from the Symposium, there will be a Golden Jubilee Dinner on the
evening of 6th September. This will feature a talk on the history of the LAGB by
Dick Hudson.

3. There will be a Language Tutorial on Scottish Gaelic, by David Adger (Queen
Mary, University of London).

4. There will be a session organised by the LAGB's Education Committee with the
title "Typology for schools." Speakers will probably include Anna Siewierska
(University of Lancaster, speaking on syntax) and Greville G. Corbett
(University of Surrey, speaking on inflectional categories), each presenting
topics and materials that might be used in schools. Further details will soon be
made available on this website: www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/ec/ecsessions.htm

5. The Journal of Linguistics, the LAGB's journal (published for the Association
by Cambridge University Press), is marking its 45th volume in 2009, and this
will also be celebrated as part of this year's meeting.
