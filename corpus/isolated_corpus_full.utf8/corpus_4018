Call for Papers


Web as Culture
Ethnographic, linguistic and didactic perspectives

International Symposium of the Giessen Graduate Centre for Study of Culture=
 (GCSC) and the Centre for Media and Interactivity (ZMI), Justus Liebig Uni=
versity, Giessen

July 16 - 18, 2009

The World Wide Web is a cultural space in which new forms of social network=
ing, of creating, acquiring and teaching knowledge and competencies, and of=
 constructing personal and cultural identities have emerged. The Internatio=
nal Symposium "Web as Culture" is intended to address issues that are invol=
ved in the processes of the construction and the perpetuation of social str=
uctures, cultural narratives, memories, knowledge and language in the World=
 Wide Web. Particular emphasis is placed on sociocultural processes of tran=
sformation such as the change of social networks, the change of teaching an=
d learning cultures and language change instigated by the World Wide Web. T=
hese sociocultural processes of transformation will be discussed from vario=
us disciplinary perspectives and at all relevant levels of analysis. It is =
very much in the spirit and tradition of an interdisciplinary study of cult=
ure that we invite scholars from all pertinent areas of research to partici=
pate in the International Symposium "Web as Culture". Apart from researcher=
s from the core disciplines of ethnography, didactics and linguistics, we w=
ould particularly like to invite scholars from the areas of media studies, =
literary studies, sociology, anthropology, philosophy and neighbouring disc=
iplines to submit abstracts.

The plenary lectures will be given by:
- Prof. Dr. Henning Lobin (Justus-Liebig-Universit=E4t Giessen)
- Prof. Dr. Angelika Storrer (Universit=E4t Dortmund)
- Prof. Dr. J=F6rg Str=FCbing (Universit=E4t T=FCbingen) [to be confirmed]
- Prof. Steven L. Thorne, Ph.D. (Pennsylvania State University)

The Symposium will discuss the new cultural space provided by the World Wid=
e Web with a particular focus on three topics: (1) Networks, (2) Learning, =
(3) Language. The three corresponding sections at the Symposium will addres=
s (but are not restricted to) the following research questions:

1. Networks
- How does the Web change structures and mechanisms of sociocultural intera=
ction? How is the Internet influenced by social interaction?
- How do semantic structures and traditional concepts change on the Web?
- How is the cultural space of the Web created (from a sociological and tec=
hnological perspective) and limited?
- In what ways can ethnographic methods contribute to research into sociocu=
ltural phenomena on the web and how would such an Internet-oriented applica=
tion change and influence the ethnographic toolkit?

2. Learning
- How do learning processes change on the Web?
- What role does the Web play in different learning environments and contex=
ts?
- How can the Internet as a medium of information, communication and produc=
tion exert a positive influence on teaching and learning processes?
- What are the pedagogical challenges posed by the Web when it comes to int=
egrating the Internet into learning processes?

3. Language
- How does language use change on the Web?
- Which new forms of communication and genres have emerged on the Web?
- How can the Web be utilized as a linguistic and language-pedagogical reso=
urce?
- How do Web-specific interactions (e.g. in social networks and in web-base=
d learning processes) manifest themselves in language use?

Working languages of the Symposium are English and German. Please submit yo=
ur abstract of max. 400 words by 31 January 2009 to info@webasculture.de. W=
e intend to confirm acceptance of submissions by 28 February 2009. The pape=
r presentations at the Symposium will be 20 minutes in length, complemented=
 by 10 minutes of discussion time. We expect to publish a collection of sel=
ected papers after the Symposium.
