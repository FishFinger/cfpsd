Full Title: Journal of the National Council of Less Commonly Taught Languages 


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

The Journal of Less Commonly Taught Languages
(http://www.councilnet.org/jctl/index.htm) is soliciting articles for
publication. 

Our general editorial focus is on policy, education, programs, advocacy,
and research in the field of less commonly taught languages (all foreign
languages except English, French, German, and Spanish). The envisaged
segmentation of the Journal is as follows:

a. Methodology and Technology,
b. Academia,
c. Beyond Academia,
d. Social Embeddedness

The first section shall include papers focusing on broader theoretical and
technological issues in all fields of less commonly taught languages. The
second section will encompass reports about research and teaching in
academia, at both K-12 and collegiate levels. The third section shall
comprise papers addressing research and teaching in government and
industry. Finally, the fourth section will address the issues of a broader
social environment, ranging from heritage communities to advancing LCTLs in
federal
initiatives and legislation.

In preparing the manuscript, please use the latest edition of the
Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), see 

http://www.apa.org/journals/authors/guide.pdf

Manuscripts should be a maximum of 25 pages (excluding references, charts,
notes, etc.) and preferably submitted electronically via email attachment.
Double-space the manuscript throughout, including notes, references, and
tables, using 12-point font with a 1.5 inch left margin. The manuscript
should be accompanied by a 150 word (or less) abstract and a cover sheet
containing the manuscript title, name, address, office and home telephone
numbers, fax number, email address, and full names and institutions of each
author.

Because the manuscript will be blind reviewed, identifying information
should be on the title page only, and not appear in the manuscript.

While submissions are accepted throughout the year, in order for a paper to
be considered for the 2009 volume, it has to be received by October 1,
2008. Please send your manuscripts to:

ncolctl@mailplus.wisc.edu

455 N. Park Street
Madison, WI 53706

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
