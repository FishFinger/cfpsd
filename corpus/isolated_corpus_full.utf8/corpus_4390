> Dear Colleague,
>
> On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to  
> inform you of the:
>
> INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE IN SOCIETY
> University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
> 5-7 August 2009
> http://www.ScienceInSocietyConference.com ( http://www.scienceinsocietyconference.com/ 
>  )
>
> Key themes addressed by the Conference include the social impacts of  
> science, the values and ethics of science, the pedagogies of  
> science, the knowledge making processes of science, the politics of  
> science and the economics of science. At first glance, the scope and  
> concerns of the Conference are enormous. However, in contrast to  
> conferences with a specialist disciplinary focus, this Conference  
> aims to explore in an interdisciplinary spirit linkages between  
> different areas of concern and practices of investigation. We  
> welcome presentation proposals which range from broad explorations  
> of philosophical, theoretical, methodological and policy questions,  
> to proposals which present finely grained evidence of the  
> connections of science to society in microcosms of research,  
> teaching and practice.
>
> As well an impressive international line-up of main speakers, the  
> Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium  
> presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would  
> particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call- 
> for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for  
> publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Science  
> in Society. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person,  
> virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a  
> paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed  
> academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the  
> Conference proceedings.
>
> Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference,  
> we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel.  
> Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for  
> further details.
>
> The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and  
> short abstract) is 19 February 2009. Proposals are reviewed within  
> two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including  
> an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the  
> Conference website - http://www.ScienceInSocietyConference.com ( http://www.scienceinsocietyconference.com/ 
>  )
>
> We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able  
> to join us in Cambridge in August 2009.
>
> Yours Sincerely,
>
> Homer Stavely
> Professor of Psychology Emeritus
> Keene State College
> Keene, New Hampshire, USA
> For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Science in  
> Society and International Journal of Science in Society
