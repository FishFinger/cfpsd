Call for Papers

Submission deadline: 5 June 2009

Motivation
After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are =

happy to announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a =

standard means of integrating syntactic knowledge into high level =

applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, or =

question answering, for which efficiency and robustness is of =

importance. In comparison with chunking and deep parsing, partial =

parsing consists in finding structure that is richer than chunks but =

less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing =

may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking) =

without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial parsing =

is not a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to =

almost full parsing. This workshop will bring together researcher who =

work on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Scope
The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not =

restricted to):
- linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: =

syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical =

structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);
- development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine =

learning, hybrid;
- the usability of language resources for the development of partial parser=
s;
- multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;
- experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial =

parsers for new languages;
- technical aspects of partial parsers:
robustness, scalability;
time and space complexity;
expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. context- free =

rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);
- applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question =

answering, machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical =

information, etc.;
- evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards, =

application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different =

partial parsing tasks, etc.;
- ways of combining multiple partial parsers;
- comparison (classification) of partial parsers.

Submissions
Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should =

indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In =

particular, any overlap with previously published work should be =

clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty, =

technical strength, clarity of presentation, and significance/relevance =

to the workshop.

Submissions should be no longer than 7 pages typeset in an 10pt font. =

Guidelines are available at the RANLP 2009 web page: =

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009.

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system, at =

https://www.softconf.com/ranlp09/PaPa2009/.

Important Dates
Submission deadline: 5 June 2009
