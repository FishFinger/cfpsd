Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics; Language Description 

Call Deadline: 26-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop, to be held July 13-15 at Stanford University in conjunction with the 2007 LSA Summer Institute, will bring linguists, language engineers, and archivists together to collaborate in the development of digital tools and services for linguistics. This meeting, which will focus on interoperability, will capitalize on the momentum of two workshops held in conjunction with the 2006 LSA Summer Meeting: the Digital Tools Summit in Linguistics (DTSL), and the E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data) workshop on "Tools and Standards: the State of the Art." 

3rd Call:

Please note that the deadline for abstracts has been extended to 26 February 2007.

We invite submissions from linguists, archivists, community members, and computer scientists. Participation will represent the perspectives of the user and the service provider, as well as the tool developer.

Selection:
The workshop program is based on discussions in small working groups. Participants will not submit abstracts or make individual oral presentations of their own projects. Instead of submitting abstracts of presentations, participants are requested to submit one-page issue statements, which will inform the working group foci for the first conference day. In these issue statements, we urge applicants to present one issue or idea relevant to the technological support of linguistic scholarship.

For example, the position paper might address one or more of the following questions:

What are the greatest barriers to interoperability?
What could this workshop do to best promote interoperability?
What sets of tools or facilities have you used that are currently interoperable? What are the benefits and drawbacks of these and/or similar tool suites?
If you have been involved in tool development, what are the primary challenges involved in designing interoperable tools?
If your work involves a range of non-interoperable tools, what solutions or work-arounds have you found?
Do you agree that interoperable tools will produce interoperable documentation, and this in turn will facilitate the development of Internet services and digital archives? Or does this claim require qualification or explication?

Those participants who have been working since DTSL 2006 on a tool charette will be encouraged to incorporate current design work into their position papers.

The workshop will also include a poster session. For this, we will extend special invitations to individual projects that are developing suites of tools or platforms that offer good examples of interoperability. If you would like to present a poster on your project, please include a two-line project description along with your issue statement.

Each issue paper must be accompanied by a short (half page or less) biography.

Housing will be provided for participants; and some travel support will be available.

Send submissions to: tilr@linguistlist.org
Deadline: Issue statements and biographies are due by 26 February 2007.
Issue statements should be one page long.
Biographies should be half a page.
