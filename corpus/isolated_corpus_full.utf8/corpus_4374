ICMI-MLMI 2009

Cambridge, MA, USA,
November 2-6 2009
sponsored by ACM SIGCHI

The Eleventh International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces and The Si=
xth=20
Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction will jointly take=
 place=20
in the Boston area from November 2-6, 2009. The main aim of ICMI-MLMI 200=
9=20
is to further scientific research within the broad field of multimodal in=
teraction,=20
methods and systems. This joint conference will focus on major trends and=
=20
challenges in this area, and work to identify a roadmap for future resear=
ch and=20
commercial success. ICMI-MLMI 2009 will feature a single-track main=20
conference with keynote speakers, panel discussions, technical paper=20
presentations, poster sessions, and demonstrations of state of the art=20=

multimodal systems and concepts. It will be followed by workshops.


Venue:
The conference will take place at the MIT Media Lab, widely known for its=

innovative spirit. Organized in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, ICMI-MLMI
2009 provides an excellent setting for brainstorming and sharing the late=
st
advances in multimodal interaction, systems, and methods in a city known =
as
one of the top historical, technological, and scientific centers of the U=
S.


Important dates:

 Workshop proposals March 1, 2009
 Special Sessions proposals March 1, 2009
 Paper submission May 22, 2009
 Author notification July 20, 2009
 Camera-ready due August 20, 2009

Human interaction analysis and modeling:
 Modeling and analysis of multimodal human-human communication
 Audio-visual perception of human interaction
 Analysis and modeling of verbal and non-verbal interaction
 Cognitive modeling of users of interactive systems

Multimodal data, evaluation, and standards:
 Evaluation techniques and methodologies for multimodal interfaces
 Authoring techniques for multimodal interfaces
 Annotation and browsing of multimodal data
 Architectures and standards for multimodal interfaces


Paper Submission:

There are two different submission categories: regular paper and short pa=
per.
The page limit is 8 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers=
. The
presentation style (oral or poster) will be decided by the committee base=
d on
suitability and schedule.

Demo Submission:

Proposals for demonstrations shall be submitted to demo chairs electronic=
ally.
A two page description with photographs of the demonstration is required.=


Doctoral Spotlight:

Funds are expected from NSF to support participation of doctoral candidat=
es
at ICMI-MLMI 2009, and a spotlight session is planned to showcase ongoing=

thesis work. Students interested in travel support can submit a short or =
long
paper as specified above.
