                         1ST CALL FOR PAPERS

                        LREC 2008 Workshop on

                           PARTIAL PARSING
                  Between Chunking and Deep Parsing

                          Marrakech, Morocco
                             1 June 2008

                   http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/

                Submission deadline: 17 February 2008


MOTIVATION
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic
knowledge into high level applications such as information retrieval,
machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and
robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep
parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer
than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses:
partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike
simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a sentence.
However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather an area
ranging from chunking to almost full parsing.  This workshop will
bring together researcher who work on partial parsing in its different
interpretations.


SCOPE:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not
restricted to):

. linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications:
  syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical
  structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);

. development methodologies for partial parsers: manual,
  machine learning, hybrid;

. the usability of language resources for the development of
  partial parsers;

. multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;

. experience and utilization of existing tools for building
  partial parsers for new languages;

. technical aspects of partial parsers:
  . robustness, scalability;
  . time and space complexity;
  . expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs.
    context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);

. applications of partial parsers: information extraction,
  question answering, machine translation, web text mining,
  acquisition of lexical information, etc.;

. evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
  application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for
  different partial parsing tasks, etc.;

. ways of combining multiple partial parsers;

. comparsion (classification) of partial parsers.


SUBMISSIONS:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Authors are invited to submit original research papers.  Papers should
indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In
particular, any overlap with previously published work should be
clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty,
technical strength, clarity of presentation, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages typeset in an 11pt font.
Detailed guidelines will appear at the LREC 2008 web page:
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/ and, once they are available, they
will also appear at the web page of the workshop:
http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/.

The publication of selected papers in a special issue of a journal is
planned.
