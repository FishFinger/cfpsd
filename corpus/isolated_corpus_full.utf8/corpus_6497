Meeting Description:

This workshop is devoted to the study of the case systems in Uralic
languages.The Uralic languages are well known for their rich case inventori=
es.
However, most studies of Uralic cases deal with the rather extensively stud=
ied
Hungarian, Finnish and perhaps Estonian cases and case systems. Cases of ot=
her
Uralic languages have been studied to a much lesser extent. The goal of thi=
s
workshop is to fill that void by giving a fuller picture of the phenomena o=
f the
case systems of Uralic languages and dialects as well. We encourage
contributions from lesser-studied Uralic languages.=20

Call for Paper

The proposed workshop consists of two parts. The first part of the workshop
clarifies the phenomena, the terminology and the comparability of the data =
in
the individual languages, as specific to Uralic and in more general terms. =
The
goal is to accumulate knowledge about the case systems of each language, an=
d
about the specific cases in Uralic languages and dialects. Firstly, we plan
'case studies of case', such as genitive, partitive, abessive, locatives,
comitative etc in Uralic languages, both in individual languages and across
(Uralic) languages. Secondly, we invite papers on the more general issues, =
such
as the 'Uralicness' of the case systems or cases.

We are inviting abstracts on the cases and case systems of Uralic languages=
 and
dialects: firstly, 'case studies of case', secondly, on more general issues
concerning case.

Please send your anonymous abstract, maximum 2 pages with examples and
references, and the same abstract containing your data and named
yournameabstract.pdf, by January 15, 2010 to the organizers Seppo Kittil=E4=
 and
Anne Tamm, seppo.kittila@helsinki.fi and anne.tamm@unifi.it . Authors will =
be
notified about their acceptance by January 31.
