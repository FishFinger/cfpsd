CALL FOR PAPERS
Special Issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing (IJSC)
on Ambient Semantic Computing

GUEST EDITORS
Iryna Gurevych (Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, Technische Universit=
=E4t Darmstadt, Germany)
Max M=FChlh=E4user (Telecooperation Division, Technische Universit=E4t Darm=
stadt, Germany)

This special issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing (IJSC=
 http://www.worldscinet.com/ijsc) is concerned with novel methods, algorith=
ms, and concepts which fruitfully combine ambient intelligence and semantic=
 technologies, called ambient semantic computing. =


By 'ambient intelligence', we refer to distributed, mobile, and ubiquitous =
computing approaches that emphasize the dawning era of networked 'anytime a=
nywhere' computers, which users wear and encounter in everyday life - witho=
ut perceiving them as computers. Context-aware computing, multimodal and ta=
ngible interaction, and smart environments are examples for relevant resear=
ch fields in ambient intelligence. =


By 'semantic technologies', we refer to natural language processing (NLP), =
knowledge related research, and computer perception approaches (e.g. handwr=
iting and speech recognition, computer vision, multimedia analysis, situati=
on detection, etc.) that target 'human understanding' of the 'perceived med=
ia'. Examples of relevant NLP technologies are spoken dialogue interfaces, =
natural language information search, question answering and NLP-based metho=
ds in service or software discovery, composition or maintenance. =


We are convinced that the vision of ambient intelligence, i.e. a world of o=
mnipresent 'hidden' computers that truly aid human beings can only be achie=
ved if these computers can deal with concepts that reflect human understand=
ing and common sense. Therefore, the 'smartness' of ambient intelligence mu=
st be combined with the 'naturalism' of semantic technologies.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
* language-based and multimodal human-computer interfaces for ambient intel=
ligence
* combinations of distributed systems and natural language processing techn=
ologies to support knowledge work
* unstructured information management methods for semantically enabled soft=
ware
* next generation public security based on ambient intelligence and semanti=
c technologies
* situational context used to improve information management and NLP contex=
t used for context-sensitive ubiquitous computing
* combining human and computer-based trust, privacy, reliability etc.
* concepts and methods, resources and tools for the development of ambient =
semantic computing systems
