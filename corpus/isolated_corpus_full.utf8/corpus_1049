Invited Speaker: ANETTE FRANK (DFKI)

Background
----------

This workshop is aimed at bringing together the different
computational linguistic sub-communities which model language
predominantly by way of theoretical syntax, either in the form of a
particular theory (e.g. CCG, HPSG, LFG, LTAG+, the Prague
School) or a more general framework which draws on theoretical and
descriptive linguistics. We characterise this style of computational
linguistic research as "deep linguistic processing", due to it
aspiring to model the complexity of natural language in rich
linguistic representations.

Deep linguistic processing has traditionally been concerned with
grammar development. The linguistic precision and complexity of the
grammars meant that they had to be manually developed and maintained,
and were computationally expensive to run.  With recent developments
in computer hardware, parsing/generation algorithms and statistical
learning theory, the way has been opened for deep linguistic
processing to be successfully applied to an ever-growing range of
languages, domains and applications.

This workshop aims to foster existing and new relationships between
groups working on deep linguistic processing, highlighting the
considerable linguistic, developmental and algorithmic commonalities
shared by the various approaches. In the spirit of cross-comparison
and collaboration, we will focus on:

- grammar engineering (e.g. frameworks for grammar evaluation, best
  practice in grammar engineering, cross-linguistic/formalism
  generalisations & comparisons, semantic representation)

- treebanking (e.g. frameworks for treebank evaluation/normalisation,
  grammar extraction/induction, the interface between grammar
  engineering and treebanking, treebanking methodologies,
  cross-linguistic/formalism generalisations & comparisons)

- system development (e.g. grammar profiling, system integration,
  preprocessing strategies, robustness enhancement)

- parser/generator development (e.g. algorithm development, grammar
  reversibility, efficiency, evaluation)

- machine learning for deep linguistic processing (e.g. parse
  selection/ranking, supertagging, deep lexical acquisition, grammar
  induction)

- applications of deep linguistic processing (e.g. information
  extraction, question answering, machine translation, dialogue
  systems, CALL)


Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research
concerning deep linguistic processing.  The submission deadline is March =
26th,
2007.


Submissions:
------------

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document
template that will be made available on the conference Web site
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/).  We reserve the right to reject
submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size
restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than March
26th, 2007.  Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed. For
details of the submission procedure, please consult the submission
webpage reachable via the conference website.

Questions regarding the submission procedure should be directed to the
workshop organisers at acl2007-deep@unimelb.edu.au

If a paper is being submitted to another conference or workshop, then
the workshop organisers must be informed.  The START submission page
will contain the possibility to enter this information.
