Meeting Description:

This third MALINDO Workshop aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners, representing different perspectives, to share and to exchange
their ideas on the processing of Indonesian and Malaysian languages. See the
workshop website at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~malindo for details. 

Call for Papers

The Third International MALINDO Workshop (MALINDO2009)
2 August 2009
Suntec Singapore International Convention & Exhibition Centre, Singapore
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~malindo/
(An official  ACL-IJCNLP 2009 co-located event, http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/)

A considerable amount of research has been done on the processing of Malaysian
and Indonesian languages offering a variety of Computational Linguistics (CL)
and Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources (dictionaries, thesauri,
monolingual/parallel corpora etc.), tools (morphological analysers/generators,
stemmers, spelling checkers, syntactic parsers, etc.) and applications (machine
translation, information extraction, information retrieval, etc.).  All these
valuable language resources, tools, and services are most of the time ignored by
the public and often not known by the researchers and students working on these
languages.

Thus, the organisers of the workshop want to highlight the effort and promising
works done on the processing of Malaysian and Indonesian languages in order to
attract more students to the CL and NLP fields and also to let all the NLP
communities in this World  be aware of their existence. The MALINDO workshop is
organized by the National University of Singapore (NUS, Republic of Singapore),
Universitas Indonesia (UI, Jakarta, Indonesia), and Multimedia University (MMU,
Cyberjaya-Malacca, Malaysia).

Prospective authors are invited to submit unpublished papers on any topic that
is of interest to the processing of Malaysian and Indonesian languages and its
broad applications, for presentation at the workshop and publication in the
proceedings.

Topics of Interest
The topics of the papers are requested to be in all areas related to the
processing - computational and theoretical point of view - of Malaysian and
Indonesian languages.

- Language resources development, acquisition, annotation, and representation:
dictionaries, thesauri, terminology, lexicons, written and spoken corpora,
grammars, ontology
- CL and NLP tools and techniques: spelling/grammatical/style checkers,
morphological analyser, stemmer, lemmatiser, part of speech tagger, chunker,
syntactic parser, word sense disambiguator, discourse processing, text and
speech alignment, text and speech segmentation, term extraction and recognition,
named entity extraction,

- CL and NLP applications: machine translation and translation aids, information
retrieval, information extraction, text summarisation, term extraction, natural
language generation, question translation aids, information retrieval,
information extraction, text summarization, term extraction, natural language
generation, question answering, document categorization, language
identification, speech recognition, speech synthesis, character recognition,
e-learning,

Important Dates

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
