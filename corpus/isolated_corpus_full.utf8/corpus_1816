Description  

It is fairly well established by now that meaning is regarded as representing
update potential rather than merely truth conditions, taking a dynamic
perspective on semantics and/or pragmatics. Topic - Focus information structure
becomes more complex because of discourse-connected, largely quantificational,
contrastiveness; sets of alternatives are involved in Contrastive Topic and
Contrastive Focus. Contrastiveness and the range of alternatives must be further
explored. 

At the same time, sets of alternatives are required in the computation of scalar
implicatures. What would be the range of relevant or comparable alternatives?
Gricean, neo-Gricean, relevance-theoretic or other 'relevant'? Utterances with
Contrastive Topic generate scalar implicatures. How other utterances generate
scalar implicatures? Is the exhaustivity operator exh good enough? What would be
an adequate representation - pragmatic, semantic or syntactic? How can a
game-theoretic approach serve as a new model? What other scales work except
Horn's entailment scales? We need a forum to discuss and resolve these
cutting-edge issues. 

Important Dates:

August 31, 2007: Deadline for submitting the abstract.
November 30, 2007: Notification of acceptance.

Form and submission of abstracts:

An abstract(.pdf or .doc file) should be up to 3 pages long, including data and

please give the author's name, affiliation, e-mail address, telephone number,

All the invited and designated speakers are also requested to send their
abstracts by the same deadline (August 31, 2007) to help determine the number of
accepted abstracts in total and to include in the Proceed's of CIL 18 for the
prospective participants.
