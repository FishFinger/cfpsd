2nd Call for Papers
Workshop on Use of Context in Vision Processing (UCVP)

http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/ucvp09  =20

in conjunction with
Eleventh International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces and Workshop
on Machine Learning for Multi-modal Interaction (ICMI-MLMI 2009)

http://icmi2009.acm.org/ =20
Boston, USA, November 2-6, 2009
=20

Background. The Workshop on Use of Context in Vision Processing (UCVP)
offers a timely opportunity for the exchange of recent work on employing
contextual information in problems of Computer Vision. Recent efforts in
defining ambient intelligence applications based on user-centric
concepts, the advent of technology in different sensing modalities, as
well as the expanding interest in multi-modal information fusion,
situation-aware and dynamic vision processing algorithms have created a
common motivation across different research disciplines to utilize
context as a key enabler of application-oriented vision. Improved
robustness, efficient use of sensing and computing resources, dynamic
task assignment to different operating modules, as well as adaptation to
event and user behavior models are among the benefits a vision
processing system can gain through the utilization of contextual
information.

Aims and scope. UCVP aims to address the opportunities in incorporating
contextual information in algorithm design for single or multi-camera
vision systems, as well as systems in which vision is complemented with
other sensing modalities, such as audio, motion, proximity, occupancy,
and others. The objective of the workshop is to gather high-quality
contributions describing leading-edge research in the use of context in
vision processing. The workshop further aims to stimulate interaction
among the participants through a panel discussion.

Topics of interest to the workshop include:
*   Sources of context (multi-camera networks, multi-modal sensing
systems, long-term observation, behavior models, spatial or temporal
relationships of objects and events, interaction of user with objects,
internet resources as knowledge-base for context extraction)
*   User-centric context (demographic information, activity, user's
emotional state, stated preferences, explicit and implicit interfaces,
interaction between users)
*   Uses of context (context-driven event interpretation, active vision,
multi-modal activation, service provision and switching based on
context, response and interaction with user, detection of abnormal
behavior, active sensing, task assignment to different sensing modules,
guided vision based on high-level reasoning, user behavior modeling,
applications in smart environments, human-computer interfaces)=20

The workshop aims to encourage collaboration between researchers in
different areas of computer vision and related disciplines. In addition,
by introducing topics of emerging applications in smart environments,
multi-camera networks, and multi-modal sensing as sources of context in
vision, the workshop aims to extend the notion of context-based vision
processing to include high-level and application-driven information
extraction and fusion.

Paper submission. The workshop solicits original and unpublished papers
that address a wide range of issues concerning the use of context in
vision processing. Authors should submit papers not exceeding six (6)
pages in total in ACM format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html). Submissions must
be sent in PDF to the following email address: ucvp09@cs.utwente.nl.=20

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and will appear in the
ACM Digital Libraries. A hardcopy proceedings will be available during
the workshop. At least one author of each paper must register and attend
the workshop to present the paper.=20

Important dates.
Paper submission: July 15, 2009
Author notification: September 1, 2009
Camera-ready due: September 25, 2009
Workshop: November 5, 2009

Registration. Please note that registration is needed in order to
include an accepted paper to the proceedings. Please refer to the main
ICMI 2009 website for more details.
