Workshop on Search and Information Extraction from Audio Data

Description

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December 1stâ5th 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Search and Information Extraction from Audio Data.

There is a vast amount of information embedded in audio data, most notably in speech and music recordings. Due to the nature of this data, it is time-consuming for people to assimilate this information; but the ever-increasing quantity of data in this form means there is an impending need for automated processes that can help humans to extract relevant information from audio recordings. Yet machine-based information search, browsing and extraction over audio data is still in its early stages.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and developers in all areas related to the extraction of information from sound recordings, retrieval of recordings, and their browsing and summarisation. Special emphasis will be given to aspects related to human-human and human-machine communication.

Intended Audience

This workshop is relevant to any researchers or developers focusing on the analysis or processing of speech or music, and in general in any area related to the use of audio for communication between people or between humans and machines. The workshop should be of particular interest to HCSNet members engaged in the Priority Areas of Next-generation Search Technology, Speech, and Perception and Action. For enquiries about the workshop, contact Diego Molla.

Submissions

Submissions for presentation at the workshop are sought. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

Speech recognition 
Speaker identification 
Extraction of named entities 
Question answering 
Retrieval of speech data 
Music retrieval 
Music summarisation 
Speech summarisation 
Analysis of music, speech, sounds 
Extraction of communicative features (e.g. prosody, formants, emotion, turns, topic change, song chorus) 

Submission Format

Submission is via a title and 250-word abstract via the HCSNet website at http://sf08.hcsnet.edu.au/submissions.  A limited number of travel bursaries will be available to Australian-based presenters of accepted abstracts.

Important Dates

Call for Abstracts released Tuesday 19th August 
Abstract submission deadline Monday 15th September 
Notification of acceptance Monday 29th September 
Online registration opens Tuesday 16th September 
Online registration closes Tuesday 11th November
