               		       ACL 2007 Workshop
=09
	      A Broader Perspective on Multiword Expressions

              Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the =20
Lexicon (SIGLEX)


Date:      June, 28 (AM), 2007
Location:  Prague, Czech Republic

Submission deadline: 26 March 2007
Workshop Website: http://www.let.uu.nl/~Nicole.Gregoire/personal/=20

########################################################################=20=

###########

In recent years, the NLP community has increasingly become aware of =20
the problems
that multiword expressions (MWEs) pose. A considerable amount of =20
research has
been conducted in this area, some within large research projects =20
dedicated to
MWEs. Although progress has been made especially in the area of =20
multiword
extraction, a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered.

Following up workshops on various aspects of MWEs at previous ACL =20
conferences,
we want to address these questions in this year's MWE workshop:

- Is it sufficient to use purely statistical methods for the =20
extraction of MWEs
from corpora, or is it necessary to harness human knowledge and =20
linguistic insights?
- Is fully automatic MWE extraction feasible, or will manual =20
validation always
be required?
- What is the nature of MWEs, and how can they be defined formally?
- To what extent can definitions and extraction procedures be =20
generalised to other
languages, other text types and other types of MWEs?
- Can and should we distinguish subtypes of MWEs for NLP applications?

In addition to these fundamental issues, we want to address the =20
practical question
of what is needed for a successful treatment of MWEs in NLP:

- What properties should be specified for MWEs or subtypes of MWEs in =20=

the lexicon?
- Can we detect these properties automatically with sufficient accuracy?
- How can existing grammars be adapted in order to deal better with =20
MWEs?
- What role do the semantics of MWEs play in NLP applications and can =20=

they be
determined automatically from large corpora?

We therefore solicit papers describing linguistically motivated =20
approaches to MWEs,
comparative studies across languages or different subtypes of MWEs, =20
and the
treatment of MWEs in NLP applications. This includes (but is not =20
limited to) research
on:

- Linguistic, Empirical and Cognitive Properties of MWEs: research =20
into the definitions
and characteristic properties of MWEs and the impact that such =20
information has on NLP
applications.

- Classes of MWEs: investigating classes (or subtypes) of MWEs and =20
the extent to which
computational techniques transfer to different classes and different =20
languages.

- Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs: combining the =20
computational
treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic and/or =20
psycholinguistic analysis.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings =20
and should not
exceed eight (8) pages, including references.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' =20=

names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. =20
to projects,
corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity should =20
be avoided. For
example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", write =20
"Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Submission will be electronic, using the workshop's START paper =20
submission webpage
(http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS6/submit.html). The only =20
accepted format for
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later =20
than 7pm US
Eastern time March 26, 2007 (23:59 GMT March 26, 2007). Papers =20
submitted after
that time will not be reviewed.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

This is a half-day workshop. The accepted papers will be presented as =20=

20-minute talks
followed by a 10-minute discussion.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline: March 26, 2007
Notification of acceptance: April 30, 2007
Camera ready papers due: May 9, 2007
Workshop date: June 28 (AM), 2007
