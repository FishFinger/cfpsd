Meeting Description:

Harnessing Images, Text, and Sound for Education in the Context of Culture,
Multimedia, Technology and Cognition
June 25 - June 28, 2009, University of Prince Edward Island
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada 

Call for Papers

Recent developments in computer multimedia technologies provide new means for
enhancement of teaching and learning. Improvements in teaching methods could
arise from harnessing the power of multimedia, but which ways of exploiting
media for learning are the best? At what point, for example, does multimedia
overtake rather than enhance teaching? Research on effective ways of using the
opportunities provided by multimedia is still in its infancy, but early results
strongly suggest the necessity for collaboration across disciplines for answers
to questions about the best uses of multimedia for education in a cultural
context.  

Since 2001, a multidisciplinary group drawn from the University of Prince Edward
Island (UPEI), the University of New Brunswick, and l'Université de Moncton has
pursued research on how electronic media can enhance education in a cultural
context under the aegis of the "Institute for Interdisciplinary Research in
Culture, Multimedia, Technology, and Cognition" (CMTC). The CMTC has secured a
significant infrastructure for research, including a large digital library,
multimedia production facilities, multimedia classrooms, and visual and auditory
perceptual testing equipment, all housed at UPEI. 

The research goals of the CMTC are 
a) to develop a model of the mind of the learner (perceiver/user of multimedia)
in order to predict how best to use media (including digital images, text, and
sound) 
b) to promote learning and develop versions of course materials that exploit
multimedia resources based on theories of the learner and learning 
c) to test a range of versions of course materials and course delivery for
different cultural groups, and - on the basis of the findings - 
d) to develop automatic techniques for altering course materials (or learning
objects) for end-users from different cultures.

The CMTC is holding this conference to gather researchers focused on using
images, technology, and sound in teaching, to discuss their work, share their
results, and develop recommendations for best practice.

The conference will 
a) reflect on and analyze new digital media, multimedia, and text-based
computing technologies, and integrate these into research in the humanities and
social sciences 
b) bring together theorists, experimentalists, and technologists from different
disciplines, to share ideas and methods that stimulate advances in research
through the use of audio-visual and text-based technologies
c) facilitate the creation of regional, national, and international networks and
partnerships among researchers, industries, governments, and individuals to
promote and sustain research and develop resources across disciplines and cultures.

Proposals for panels, papers, posters, and workshops are invited from
individuals, academics, teams, and institutes whose research and activities
involve any aspect of the conference's mandate. Submit abstracts electronically
to http://ocs.vre.upei.ca/index.php/hits/, attached as an anonymous, titled,
single-spaced document of not more than 400 words in a Microsoft Word file, if
possible. The name, address, contact information, and affiliation of the
researcher should be included in the body of the e-mail. Within the body of the
e-mail, please indicate any audio-visual equipment needed. Those wishing to
propose panels or special sessions should submit an abstract for the panel
together with abstracts for each of the constituent papers. Time allotted for
each presentation will be 20 minutes for delivery of the paper plus 10 minutes
discussion. Papers will be distributed on a CD of proceedings at the conference
or published in a book growing out of the conference.

Deadline for receipt of abstracts is March 15, 2009. Notification of acceptance
will be sent out by April 15, 2009.

Limited funds are available to support conference travel. Special consideration
will be given to graduate students presenting papers or posters. 

The CMTC organizing committee gratefully acknowledges the generous funding
provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), making
 this conference possible.

Call for Papers

This year's GL conference will be in a new format, combining both an open call
for papers and a workshop on semantic annotation. The annotation workshop will
address the following three tasks:

1. Compositional mechanisms of argument selection and coercion
2. The role of qualia in argument selection and modification constructions
3. Type selection in modification of dot objects (complex types)

The workshop is intended to provide feedback and training for the 2010 SemEval
"Argument Selection and Coercion" task, which focuses on identifying the
compositional operations involved in argument selection by a predicate.

The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse contributions from
theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science,
and lexicography, which explore compositionality from the point of view of
generative approaches to the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed,
as a starting point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon theory
(Pustejovsky, 1995, 2001). 

Topics include:
- Polysemy and sense shifting
- Co-compositionality and creation of new word senses
- Type coercion and argument selection phenomena
- Argument realization: mapping from lexicon to syntax
- Cognitive foundations for semantic categories
- The trade-off between pragmatics and lexical knowledge
- Presupposition and commonsense knowledge
- Underspecification and word sense disambiguation

These topics can be approached from either a theoretical or computational
perspective. Computational issues relating to the above phenomena include:
- Automatic knowledge acquisition
- Computational models of compositional phenomena
- Robust semantic annotation
- Evaluation of algorithms and annotation schemes

The conference will be held over a period of three days. The first day will be
devoted to the annotation workshop and the second day to conference papers. The
final day will be dedicated to the presentation of results from the workshop and
an open discussion of remaining issues.
