Meeting Description:

7th biennal Conference of the Association for Linguistic Typology 

Association for Linguistic Typology
Fédération Typologie et Universaux linguistiques, Paris 

A general call for papers for ALT 7

The seventh International Conference of the Association for Linguistic Typology (ALT VII) will be held in Paris at the Ministry of Research, from Tuesday September 25 to Friday September 28, 2007. The conference will be organized by the French Fédération Typologie et Universaux Linguistiques of the CNRS. The local organizers for ALT VII will be Stéphane Robert, Isabelle Bril, Jocelyne Fernandez-Vest and Martine Vanhove.

Members and non-members wishing to present a paper at ALT VII are asked to e-mail a one-page abstract to the chair of the program committee, David Gil, to reach him no later than January 15, 2007. A second page may be included with the abstract listing data.  The abstract itself should contain no identification of the author.  A separate page should indicate the title of the abstract, the name(s) of the author(s), and one mailing address, with telephone, fax, and e-mail address as available. The conference will be held in English and French; abstracts may be submitted in either language. After the decision of acceptance of the abstracts has been conveyed, authors will be asked to send their abstracts in both languages.

Submissions should be sent to:

David Gil
Fax +49 341-9952119 
gil at eva.mpg.de

The committee strongly encourages submissions by e-mail (preferably with the abstract in pdf format and author information as part of the e-mail text), but abstracts may also be sent by fax.  Authors are asked to check their pdf files carefully to ensure that special characters are embedded properly.

The time allotted for presentation and discussion is 30 minutes. Participants may not be involved in more than two abstracts, of which at most one may be single-authored. 

Members and non-members are also encouraged to present posters at ALT7 (final format should be 2m high and 1m wide). An abstract should be submitted under the same conditions as for papers (see above).

By March 1, 2007, the program committee will convey its decision on acceptance of papers to those submitting abstracts. The committee consists of David Gil (chair), Nicholas R.D. Evans, M.M. Jocelyne Fernandez-Vest, Ekkehard Koenig, Brian Migliazza, Edith Moravcsik, and Martine Vanhove 

Details concerning registration and accommodation for the conference will follow. There is also a dedicated website: http://www.alt7.cnrs.fr/
