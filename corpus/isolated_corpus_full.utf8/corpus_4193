Date: 17-Apr-2009 - 18-Apr-2009
Location: Berlin, Germany 
Contact Person: Stefan Müller
Meeting Email: stefan.mueller@fu-berlin.de
Web Site: http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/Events/ws-gti2009.html 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

We are interested in all aspects of grammar theory and grammar implementation. A
strong focus is on work on German or Germanic languages and implementation in
constraint-based theories, but submissions concerning other languages or
implementations of grammar fragments/parsers in derivational frameworks are
welcome as well. 

Call for Papers

We explicitly encourage the presentation of work in progress. According to this
philosophy the selection of papers is not based on a review process of abstracts
but on a first-come-first-served basis.

The workshop is organized by the scientific network Constraintbasierte
Grammatikanalyse: Empirie, Theorie, Implementierung (CoGETI) and the Center for
the Study of European Languages of the FU Berlin (ZEUS) and supported by a DFG
grant to CoGETI.

Meeting Description:

Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing - BSNLP 2009
Second International Workshop
Cracow, Poland
15 June 2009
http://erssab.u-bordeaux3.fr/BSNLP

This year BSNLP is co-located with the IIS 2009 (Intelligent Information
Systems) conference. 

Call for Papers

Topic and Motivation:
The recent political and economic changes in Central and Eastern Europe and the
related on-going enlargement of the European Union brings into focus new
cultures and languages. Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic group
have an outstanding role because of their rich cultural heritage and the
widespread use: over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the
Balto-Slavonic languages. The NLP tasks include, but are not limited to,
morphological analysis and generation, tagging, named-entity recognition,
information extraction, co-reference resolution, question-answering, information
retrieval, text summarization, machine translation. Research on these topics in
the context of Balto-Slavonic languages is still in its early stage and is
progressing relatively slowly. Due to specific linguistic phenomena, such as
rich inflection and relatively free word order, a construction of language
processing tools for these languages is an intriguing and challenging task.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages. The workshop will give an
opportunity to exchange ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle problems
in this field of research, and to make available resources more widely known.

This workshop is a follow-up to the successful first BSNLP 2007 workshop held in
conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference in Prague. In particular, we would
strongly encourage submissions describing systems, resources or solutions that
are made available to the wider public, as this would help to promote
computational linguistics applications for these languages.

Areas of Interest:
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP in the context of:
- text segmentation
- morphological analysis
- morphology models
- morpho-syntactic disambiguation
- named-entity recognition
- named-entity disambiguation
- named-entity lemmatization
- name variant recognition and merging
- term and keyword extraction
- syntactic parsing and chunking
- co-reference resolution
- word sense disambiguation
- corpus-based knowledge acquisition
- information extraction
- question answering
- machine translation
- text summarization
- text classification
- information retrieval
- linguistic processing in search engines 

B. Multilingual frameworks applied to these languages
- tools and resources (freely available for research purposes will be preferred)
- experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and processing resources
- comparative evaluation between languages
- encoding standards and formats 

Submission
We expect two kinds of submissions:
- full papers
- short papers

Long papers should describe original unpublished work and should indicate the
state of completion of the reported results. In particular, an overlap with
previously published work should be clearly mentioned. The authors should
indicate in the abstract of their submission if the paper has been submitted
elsewhere.

Short papers should describe work in progress and/or interactive software demos.

All submissions, both of long and short papers, will be judged on correctness,
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and
significance/relevance to the workshop. Submissions will be reviewed by at least
3 members of the Program Committee. The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the
paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-citations and other references that could reveal the author's identity
should be avoided.

The final papers are to be prepared using LaTeX. Please download the zipped
archive with files needed to process your document: iis4authors.zip. Both class
files and an example of use are contained in the archive. Please follow all the
recommendations given in the example.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than March 15, 2009 using the
submission webpage.

The page limit for long papers is 14 pages, whereas short papers / software demo
descriptions are limited to 7 pages.

Publication
Workshop proceedings in electronic form will be distributed at the workshop.
They will be available on-line after the workshop.
Additionally, the accepted long papers will be published along with the main IIS
2009 conference papers in a monograph form.

Important Dates
- Paper submissions due: 15.03.2009
- Notification of acceptance: 13.04.2009
- Camera-ready versions due: 4.05.2009

Venue
Kraków (Cracow) is one of the largest and the oldest cities in Poland. Nowadays
it is an important center of science, education and business. Thanks to its
history, monuments, unique atmosphere of the old town district and excellent
restaurants Kraków attracts tourists from all parts of the world.
