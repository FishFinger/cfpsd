PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

MobiCASE 2009

The International Conference on Mobile Computing, Applications and Services
http://www.mobicase.org

October 26-29, 2009
San Diego, California, USA

Sponsored by ICST
Technically co-sponsored by Create-Net

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Researchers and engineers face new challenges stemming from consumer
habits that continue to shift to encompass both a desktop-centric work
environment as well as a smartphone-centric lifestyle. MobiCASE, the
International Conference on Mobile Computing, Applications, and Services,
will allow scientists and practitioners from both academia and industry
to highlight their best work in mobile wireless applications and service
provisioning.

MobiCASE is specifically focused on application-layer research and
development in mobile computing: applications, application management,
and application services.

We seek novel submissions in mobile applications and systems research in
domain topics above the OSI transport layer with an emphasis on complete
end-to-end systems and their components. The conference will be organized
into two broad categories, with topics of interest including, but not
limited to:

Mobile applications:
* Mobile social networking, such as crowd-sourcing or twittering
* Healthcare, such as emergency notification or body monitoring systems
* Transportation, such as nav-sat systems or traffic congestion management
* Personalization
* Context-aware applications
* Online mobile targeted advertising
* Novel user experience and interfaces
* Mobile Web 2.0 and mobile web application frameworks (such as Mobile
   Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME, and others)
* Supporting development toolkits, programming languages, or libraries
* Use of hardware features such as accelerometers, touch sensing, and GPS
* Applications for enterprise environments

Service provisioning for mobile users:
* Application lifecycle management and distribution models
* Application management
* Smartphone platforms (Windows Mobile, Symbian, Android, and others)
* Adaptive, self-configuring applications
* Context-modeling and ontologies
* Support for large-scale, scalable messaging and event processing
* End-user network monitoring and management
* Middleware and distributed systems in support of mobile applications

In addition to scientific research papers, MobiCASE will also host
an industry paper track where industry product groups in the mobile
computing space can share best practices, real-world observations,
and projected near- and long-term expectations that will hopefully help
guide and focus all attending researchers and practitioners.

Selected papers will be considered for publication in the ACM/Springer
Mobile Networks and Applications (MONET) journal.

Research papers should focus on the design, implementation, and
evaluation of complete systems and components. Papers will be limited
to 10 single-spaced, double-column, 8.5" x 11" pages with 10-point
font. Industry papers are limited to 8 pages. MobiCASE requires that all
papers (both research and industry) describe novel, unpublished work,
not concurrently under review elsewhere.


PANELS/WORKSHOPS:
We are soliciting proposals for panels/workshops. Interested parties are
encouraged to submit a proposal to the workshop chair. Please see the
MobiCASE webpage (www.mobicase.org) for further information.


IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract due:  May 1, 2009
Full papers due: May 8, 2009
Acceptance notification: June 29, 2009
Camera-ready version due: August 1, 2009
