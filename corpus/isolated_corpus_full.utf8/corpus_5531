Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Advisory Board, we would like to inform you of the:

GLOBAL STUDIES CONFERENCE     
Pusan National University      
Busan, South Korea     
21-23 June 2010     
http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com     

We are excited to be holding the Third Global Studies Conference in Busan, South Korea. Busan the second largest South Korean city and, as one of the busiest world's ports, is significantly involved in globalizing processes. Busan's growing financial services sector promises to increase its involvement in globalization, as does its commitment to international sport. In 2002, Busan was a host city for both the Asian Games and the FIFA World Cup. In addition, it has submitted a bid to be the host of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. Busan is also a center for higher education, and includes the distinguished Pusan National University, the host of the Global Studies Conference.

The Global Studies Conference and Global Studies Journal are devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization. The Conference and Journal attempt to do this from many points of view, from many locations in the world, and in a wide-angle kaleidoscopic fashion.

As well as impressive line-up of international plenary speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the Â Global Studies Journal. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this refereed academic Journal.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the Call-for-Papers (a title and short abstract) is 9 July 2009. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date. Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Busan in June 2010.

Yours Sincerely,

Jan Nederveen Pieterse     
University of California, Santa Barbara, USA     
For the Advisory Board, Global Studies Conference and Global Studies Journal
