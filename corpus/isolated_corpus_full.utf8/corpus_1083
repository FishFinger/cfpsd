ACL 2007 Workshop on Deep Linguistic Processing

June 28th, 2007

Prague, Czech Republic

This workshop is aimed at bringing together the different computational
linguistic sub-communities which model language predominantly by way of
theoretical syntax, either in the form of a particular theory (e.g. CCG, HPSG,
LFG, LTAG+ or the Prague School) or a more general framework which draws on
theoretical and descriptive linguistics. We characterise this style of
computational linguistic research as deep linguistic processing, due to it
aspiring to model the complexity of natural language in rich linguistic
representations. 

First Call for Papers
ACL 2007 Workshop on Deep Linguistic Processing
Workshop to be held at ACL 2007
June 28th, 2007
Prague, Czech Republic
                                                      
http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~tim/events/acl2007-deep/
                                                          
Paper submission deadline: March 26th, 2007

Invited Speaker: Anette Frank (DFKI)

Background:

Deep linguistic processing has traditionally been concerned with
grammar development. The linguistic precision and complexity of the
grammars meant that they had to be manually developed and maintained,
and were computationally expensive to run.  With recent developments
in computer hardware, parsing/generation algorithms and statistical
learning theory, the way has been opened for deep linguistic
processing to be successfully applied to an ever-growing range of
languages, domains and applications.

This workshop aims to foster existing and new relationships between
groups working on deep linguistic processing, highlighting the
considerable linguistic, developmental and algorithmic commonalities
shared by the various approaches. In the spirit of cross-comparison
and collaboration, we will focus on:

- grammar engineering (e.g. frameworks for grammar evaluation, best
  practice in grammar engineering, cross-linguistic/formalism
  generalisations & comparisons, semantic representation)

- treebanking (e.g. frameworks for treebank evaluation/normalisation,
  grammar extraction/induction, the interface between grammar
  engineering and treebanking, treebanking methodologies,
  cross-linguistic/formalism generalisations & comparisons)

- system development (e.g. grammar profiling, system integration,
  preprocessing strategies, robustness enhancement)

- parser/generator development (e.g. algorithm development, grammar
  reversibility, efficiency, evaluation)

- machine learning for deep linguistic processing (e.g. parse
  selection/ranking, supertagging, deep lexical acquisition, grammar
  induction)

- applications of deep linguistic processing (e.g. information
  extraction, question answering, machine translation, dialogue
  systems, CALL)


Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research
concerning deep linguistic processing. The submission deadline is March 26th, 2007.


Submissions:

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document
template that will be made available on the conference Web site
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/). We reserve the right to reject
submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size
restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'',
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than March
26th, 2007. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed. For
details of the submission procedure, please consult the submission
webpage reachable via the conference website.

Questions regarding the submission procedure should be directed to the
workshop organisers at acl2007-deep@unimelb.edu.au

If a paper is being submitted to another conference or workshop, then
the workshop organisers must be informed. The START submission page
will contain the possibility to enter this information.

Paper submission deadline - March 26th

Subject Language(s): Arabic, Standard (arb)
                     English (eng)

Call Deadline: 01-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
The focus of 'Dialogue Under Occupation' is the ongoing exploration of dialogue
and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occupation. Dialogue is
intended in the sense that understanding of differing perspectives comes through
dialogue. Discourse refers to the types of talk that the various stakeholders
involved in occupation engage in (e.g., political discourse, media discourse,
public discourse).

The goal of the conference is to provide a venue to maximize the investigation
and application of differing perspectives (i.e., the dialogue or discourse of
the occupied, the dialogue or discourse of the occupiers, or the interaction
between opposing sides), and to actively promote greater understanding of the
ideologies, issues, concerns, etc. of individuals affected by occupation in its
various dimensions.

As we intend this conference to be interdisciplinary, we invite scholars from
various disciplines to submit papers that address the use of dialogue in the
creation, maintenance, resistance, and resolution of occupation. 
 
Multidisciplinary approaches and models of dialogue analysis such as Dialogue
Grammar, Discourse Analysis, Critical Discourse Studies, Multi-modal Discourse
Analysis, Conversational Analysis, Social Constructionism, etc., are welcomed. 

Strands:
Papers relating to hegemony, power, agency, identity, among others, will be
particularly relevant. Be sure to identify the strand for your submission as
this will help to determine its applicability to the conference. 
 
Discourse of Enactment: 
The language of the policies and politics of occupation 
 
Discourse of Transaction: 
The language of the media and its role in spreading the policies, keeping the
occupied and the occupiers informed (or misinformed). 
 
Discourse of Reaction: 
The language of daily life under occupation: talking about the ''self '' vs. the
''other'', historical narratives of the occupation, center vs. periphery, the
language of the ingroup, outgroup, and/or intergroup. 
 
Discourse of Resolution: 
The language of peacemakers and peacekeepers, as well as the language of
resignation, acceptance, and coexistence.

Submission Instructions:
Abstract (250-300 words) & Cover Sheet
You may submit a proposal for a paper presentation (20 minutes with 10 minutes
for questions), a panel (maximum of 4 papers limited to a 2-hour block), or a
roundtable (limited to one hour). Posters may also be submitted for works in
progress. 

Do not include any self-identifying information on the abstract; indicate only
the title and the abstract itself. On the separate cover sheet, include:
1.	Title 
2.	Strand you're submitting to (i.e., Enactment, Transaction, Reaction, Resolution) 
3.	Format (paper, panel, roundtable, or poster) 
4.	Author(s) 
5.	Affiliation(s) 
6.	Postal Mailing Address (for primary author) 
7.	E-mail (for primary author)

N.B. Incomplete or inaccurate submissions may not be considered.
