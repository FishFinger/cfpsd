Call for Papers

3rd ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-based Systems  
(DEBS 2009)
July 6-9, 2009, Nashville, TN, USA
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA

Conference web site: http://debs09.isis.vanderbilt.edu

Abstract submission: February 23, 2009
Paper submission: March 2, 2009
Author notification: April 27, 2009
Final manuscript: May 18, 2009

Scope
-----

Event-based systems are rapidly gaining importance in many application
domains ranging from real time monitoring systems in production,
logistics and networking to complex event processing in finance
and security. The event based paradigm has gathered momentum as
witnessed by efforts in areas including publish/subscribe systems,
event-driven architectures, complex event processing, business
process management and modeling, Grid computing, Web services
notifications, information dissemination, event stream processing,
and message-oriented middleware. The various communities dealing
with event based systems have made progress in different aspects
of the problem. The DEBS conference attempts to bring together
researchers and practitioners active in the various sub communities
to share their views and reach a common understanding. The scope of
the conference covers all topics relevant to event-based computing
ranging from those discussed in related disciplines (e.g., coordination,
software engineering, peer-to-peer systems, Grid computing, and  
streaming
databases), over domain-specific topics of event-based computing
(e.g., workflow management systems, mobile computing, pervasive/ 
ubiquitous
computing, sensor networks, user interfaces, component integration,
Web services, and embedded systems), to enterprise related topics
(e.g., complex event detection, enterprise application integration,
real time enterprises, and Web services notifications).
The topics addressed by the conference include (but are not limited to):

Models, Architectures and Paradigms
* Event-driven architectures
* Basic interaction models
* Event algebras, event schemas and type systems
* Languages for event correlation and patterns, streaming and
continuous queries, data fusion
* Models for static and dynamic environments
* Complex event processing
* Design and programming methodologies
* Event-based business process management and modeling
* Experimental methodologies
* Performance modeling and prediction based on analytic approaches

Middleware for Event-Based Computing
* Federated event-based systems
* Middleware for actuator and sensor networks
* Algorithms and protocols
* Event dissemination based on p2p systems
* Context and location awareness
* Fault-tolerance, reliability, availability, and recovery
* Security issues
* (Self-)Management
* Mobility and resource constrained device support
* Streaming queries, transformations, or correlation engines

Applications, Experiences, and Requirements
* Use cases and applications of event-based systems
* Real-world application deployments using event-based middleware
* Domain-specific deployments of event-based systems
* Real-world data characterizing event-based applications
* Benchmarks, performance evaluations, and testbeds
* Application requirements for next-generation event-based solutions
* Relation to other architectures
* Enterprise application integration
* Event-driven business process management
* Information logistics
* Seamless integration of event-based mechanisms into middleware  
platforms

Author Instructions
-------------------
Three types of paper submissions will be accepted: research papers,
industry papers, and demo papers. Submitted papers should clearly
indicate their type. Papers must not exceed the given number of
pages for the respective paper type:
Research Papers: (max. 12 pages),
Industry Papers: (max. 8 pages),
Demo Papers: (max. 4 pages).

DEBS 09 will have separate program committees for the research and
industry track. A separate CFP will be issued for tutorial proposals.

Submissions must be in the ACM format for conference proceedings.
DEBS 09 will use EasyChair for paper submissions. The conference adopts
a double blind review process, where neither authors nor reviewers know
each others' identities. Accepted papers will be published by ACM and
disseminated through the ACM Digital Library.
