Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Forum Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

SECOND WORLD UNIVERSITIES FORUM      
Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay, Mumbai, India      
16-18 January 2009      
http://universitiesforum.com     

The World Universities Forum was created in the belief that academe must better engage today's most crucial questions, and that higher education itself must be included as part of the wider discussion of global change.  The Forum encourages the participation of university executives, administrators, scholars and research students, as well as journalists, policy makers, business and political leaders, and others who understand that the importance of the university extends well beyond campus.

Keynote speakers include:      
    * Professor Brenda Gourley (Vice Chancellor, Open University, UK)     
    * Professor Richard Larkins (Vice Chancellor, Monash University, Australia)     
    * Professor Ashok Misra (Director, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, India)     
    * Professor Mahmood Mumdani (Columbia University, USA)     
    * Lord Bikku Parekh (University of Westminster, UK)     
    * Professor Deepak Pental (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi, India)     
    * Professor Mark Wrighton (President, Washington University, USA)     

In addition, the Forum will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Forum Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed Journal of the World Universities Forum. If you are unable to attend the Forum in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for review and possible publication in the Journal, and provide access to the online edition of the Journal.

The deadline for the next round in the call-for-papers (a title and short abstract) is 11 September 2008.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Forum website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Forum, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Forum website - http://universitiesforum.com.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Mumbai in January 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Professor Fazal Rizvi     
Department of Educational Policy Studies, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA     
For the International Advisory Board of the World Universities Forum and the Journal of the World Universities Forum
