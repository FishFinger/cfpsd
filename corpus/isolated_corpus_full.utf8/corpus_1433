Meeting description:

Linguistic Evidence 2008: Empirical, Theoretical, and Computational Perspectives 

Call for papers for the conference ''Linguistic Evidence 2008: Empirical,
Theoretical, and Computational Perspectives''

Hosted by the SFB 441 ''Linguistic Data Structures'' at the University of
Tuebingen (Germany)

31st January to 2nd February 2008

Aims and scope:

The SFB 441 'Linguistic Data Structures' has been working since 1999 on the 
implications for linguistics of the rapid increase in quantity and evidential
quality of data types.  As part of the SFB 441's effort to further external
links, this conference aims to bring together researchers from all areas of
linguistics who are working on the closer integration of linguistic theory and
linguistic evidence.  We are particularly interested in innovative perspectives
on the use and exploitation of data sources in investigating linguistic research
questions. We therefore invite unpublished contributions which relate to issues
of the empirical base of linguistic explanation and linguistic theory from all
fields of linguistics (including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonology,
morphology, phonetics, psycholinguistics, acquisition, computational
linguistics, neurolinguistics, historical linguistics, typology.)

Papers might concern issues of data collection and analysis, the comparison and
contrast of multiple data types, studies of the evidential value of data
sources, their relevance for the evaluation and construction of linguistic
theory, and studies illustrating the explanatory insights to be gained.

There will be a special session on empirical methods in syntax and semantics.

For more details about aim and scope of the conference see also the proceedings
volume: Kepser, S. & M. Reis (2005), Linguistic Evidence: Empirical, Theoretical
and Computational Perspectives. Berlin: De Gruyter 

Invited speakers:

Greg Carlson (Rochester)
Lyn Frazier (Amherst)
Hubert Haider (Salzburg)  
Rada Mihalcea (North Texas)

Submissions:

We invite abstracts for 25+10 minute talks and also for poster presentations.
Further submission instructions can be found on the conference website:

http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/LingEvid2008/call.html

We intend to publish selected papers in a separate proceedings volume, as at the
preceding conferences. 

Successful students submissions may be subsidized. 

Important deadlines:

Deadline for receipt of abstracts: 30th September 2007
Notification of acceptance: First week of November 2007
Conference: 31st January to 2nd February 2008
