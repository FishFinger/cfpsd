Call for Papers

Network-based Models of Cognitive and Social Dynamics of Language

Special Issue of Computer Speech and Language Journal

Guest Editors:
    * Monojit Choudhury, Microsoft Research India
    * Samer Hassan, University of North Texas
    * Animesh Mukherjee, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur
    * Smaranda Muresan, Rutgers University

Aim and Scope

This special issue builds up on the special theme of the workshop
'TextGraphs-4: Graph-based Algorithms for NLP' that is going to be held on
7th August 2009 in conjunction with ACL-IJCNLP 2009. The special theme of
TextGraphs-4 is 'Models of Social and Cognitive Dynamics of Languages in
the Framework of Complex Networks'. While some of the articles shall be
directly chosen from the TextGraphs-4 submissions, we can still accommodate
around four to five fresh submissions in the special issue. Please treat
this call as an open invitation to submit to this special issue.

Cognitive dynamics of languages include topics focused primarily on
language acquisition, which can be extended to language change (historical
linguistics) and language evolution. Since the latter phenomena are also
governed by social factors, we can further classify them under social
dynamics of languages. In addition, social dynamics of languages also
include topics such as mining the social networks of blogs and emails. The
special issue will contain work that investigates any of the aforementioned
phenomena using graph theory or complex networks as a tool. Example topics
include, but are not limited to:

* Lexical acquisition and growth of the mental lexicon

* Phonological, syntactic and semantic acquisition

* Lexical change

* Applications of networks in modeling language variation and dialectometry

* Effect of social structure on language change and evolution

* Analysis of blog and email networks for IR and IE

More details can be found at the official website of the workshop
http://www.textgraphs.org/ws09/index.html

Submission of articles: 15th October, 2009

Language guidelines for papers, references, and citations
