Meeting Description:

What Is the Language Creation Conference?

The Conference is a set of talks and panel discussions about various issues
related to language creation, from several different perspectives. It includes
both fairly technical linguistic discussions as well as more general,
sociological, or philosophical ones and examples of craft in action; voices from
many parts of the conlanging community; and people from all over the world. The
conference is open to the public; preregistration requested. Lunch and snacks
will be provided.

What Is Language Creation?

Language creation (or 'conlanging' -- 'conlang' is short for 'constructed
language') is the process of inventing and (usually) describing a new language.
Though the extent to which a language is created varies, creators might include
sound systems, grammars, and writing systems for their languages. Some creators
are also interested in cosmogenesis: the creation of cultures and worlds in
which their languages are used.

What's the Point?

People create constructed languages for a number of reasons. Artistic languages
are often included in fictional works: for example, Tolkien's Quenya in The Lord
of the Rings or Klingon in Star Trek. International auxiliary languages
(auxlangs) are intended for communication between people of different native
languages, usually to prevent one being elevated over others or to making
learning easier; some famous examples are Esperanto, Ido, and Interlingua.
Logical and philosophical languages are used to test linguistic (and other)
theories; Loglan and Lojban are well-known examples of the former, and Suzette
Haden Elgin's LÃ¡adan is an example of the latter -- which she incorporated into
the Native Tongue series of novels. 

Note: LCC3 is tentatively set for U. Rochester, April 2008. See below.

3rd Language Creation Conference - Call for Papers:

We are currently accepting proposals for talks. Please email a title, abstract,
bio, any relevant links, range of places and dates you would be able to attend,
and a description of any support needed (from sponsorship to technology), to
lcs@conlang.org. If you have more than one idea, send them all.

Submissions do not need to be 100% formal or set in stone. All submissions must
be related to language creation to be considered, but beyond that we encourage a
very wide range of formats and topics - including technical papers on
(regular/socio-/inter-/etc-) linguistics, research papers involving created
languages or language acquisition (such as in cognitive science and
developmental or cognitive linguistics), theoretical innovations or
philosophical considerations of the craft, reviews of certain kinds of conlangs,
presentations of conlang-related art, small presentations or posters about the
particularly delightful features of your latest work in progress,
conlang-related games and humor, etc.

Workshops are typically limited to a maximum of 2 hours, full talks to 1 hour
(including Q&A), and talks that discuss a particular conlang (but do not address
some larger issue relevant to the craft itself) to 15 minutes. More or less time
may be allotted depending on organizational needs.

We treat submissions about artlangs, auxlangs, engelangs, loglangs, etc., all
equally; it is our goal to provide a forum that unites and is relevant to the
entire conlanging community.

We will consider presentations given via teleconferencing, though we can't
guarantee that the technology will be available. If this interests you, please
submit a proposal.

We would rather hear your submission than not, and we would rather hear it
sooner than later.

Please note that the time and place of LCC3 is still tentative - let us know
where and when you could make it, no matter what that is. If anything, we will
keep your proposal in consideration for LCC4. We are considering locations
throughout the world, but particularly the east and west coast United States,
and Western Europe.

Unsure of what to speak about, or whether your talk is appropriate? You can view
all the talks from LCC1 on video.google.com, and view the program and schedule
of both LCC1 and LCC2 on our website. For information, visit
http://conlangs.berkeley.edu. Please note that we are seeking to diversify our
program, so if in doubt, send it in, and we will work with you to tune your
proposal to our audience.

If you have any questions about giving a presentation or a workshop at this or
any future LCC, please contact us at lcs@conlang.org.
