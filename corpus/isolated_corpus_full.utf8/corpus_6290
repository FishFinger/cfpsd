Call for Papers

In the same spirit as the previous conferences of this series (SWL1 - Leipz=
ig
2004, SWL2 - Lancaster 2006, and SWL3 - Berlin 2008), SWL4 will provide a f=
orum
for linguists working on the syntax of less widely studied languages or lan=
guage
varieties. Its main purpose is enlarging our knowledge and understanding of
syntactic diversity. Contributions are expected to be data-driven, and the
discussion of theoretical issues is appreciated to the extent that it helps=
 to
elucidate the data and remains understandable to persons that are not
specialists of the relevant theory. All major theoretical frameworks are eq=
ually
welcome, and papers that adopt a diachronic or comparative perspective are =
also
welcome, as well as papers dealing with morphological or semantic issues, i=
n so
far as syntactic issues also play a major role.

Abstracts of no more than one page (plus possibly one additional page for
examples), should be sent in PDF format to Denis Creissels
(denis.creissels@univ-lyon2.fr) before 31st January 2010, with "SWL4" in th=
e
subject line. Submissions should be anonymous and refrain from self-referen=
ce.
Please provide contact details (name, phone, fax) and the title of your
presentation in the body of the email. Participants may not be involved in =
more
than two abstracts, of which at most one may be single-authored. The confer=
ence
will be held in English and French; abstracts may be submitted in either la=
nguage.

Notification of acceptance by the 31st of March 2010.=20

A limited number of small grants might be available for participants with
limited funding. Information will be announced later.
