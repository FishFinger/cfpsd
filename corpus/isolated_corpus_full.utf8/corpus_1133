                 SIGIR 2007 News letter for February 2007

            The 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference
                       23-27 July 2007, Amsterdam
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this edition:

  1. Dead line for posters, demos, workshops and tutorials approaching
  2. More paper submissions than ever before
  3. Microsoft - the first Diamond Sponsor
  4. Industry Day on final day of the conference
  5. Call for workshops and tutorials
  6. Call for posters and demonstrations
  7. Call for doctoral consortium
  8. Important Dates

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Dead line for posters, demos, workshops and tutorials approaching

Authors are invited to submit proposals for poster presentations, 
demonstrations, workshops and tutorials. Please read the submission 
guidelines on http://www.sigir2007.org/submissions.html
The dead line for sending in proposals is 25 February 2007.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. More paper submissions than ever before

The SIGIR program chairs reported 491 paper submissions, an increase
of 92 compared to last year, and a new record for this conference. 
The program committee will prepare a program with more papers than 
last year to keep the acceptance rates at a reasonable level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Microsoft - the first Diamond Sponsor

We are happy to announce that Microsoft supports SIGIR in Amsterdam 
at the Diamond level!

Sponsor donations allow the conference registration fees to be kept 
as low as possible, both to promote attendance and to offset the cost 
of events and provide services and items that benefit all involved in 
the event. Thank you Microsoft!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Industry Day on final day of the conference

SIGIR Amsterdam will be the first SIGIR conference to be followed 
by a special day for information retrieval practitioners and
companies. Jan Pedersen, Chief Scientist for the Search and 
Marketplace Division of Yahoo!, chairs the organisation of this
Industry Day. Jan will be supported  by Martine Kunel of TNO 
Information and Communication Technology, and Bernd Wondergem 
of Thaesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Call for workshops and tutorials

Proposals are solicited for one-day or half-day workshops to be held 
on July 27, 2007, the last day of the conference. The purpose of SIGIR 
workshops is to provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less
formal and possibly more focused way than the conference itself. As 
such, they also offer a good opportunity for young researchers to 
present their work and to obtain feedback from an interested community. 
The format of each workshop is to be determined by the organizers, but 
it is expected that they contain ample time for general discussion. 
Workshop proposals must be sent by email to the Workshops Chair, 
Josiane Mothe by February 25, 2007. Read more on:
http://www.sigir2007.org/cfw.html 

Proposals are solicited for tutorials of either a half-day (3 hours 
plus breaks) or full day (6 hours plus breaks) on all topics of 
information retrieval and its applications. Especially encouraged are 
(1) cross-disciplinary tutorials that educate the IR community about 
recent technical advancements in related fields (e.g., machine 
learning, natural language processing, data mining); (2) tutorials 
about emerging application areas of information retrieval technologies 
(e.g., Web, bioinformatics). Tutorial proposals must be sent via email 
by February 25, 2007 to the Tutorial Chair, ChengXiang Zhai. Read more:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Call for posters and demonstrations

Poster presentations offer researchers a unique opportunity to present 
late-breaking results, significant work in progress, or research that 
is best communicated in an interactive or graphical format. They 
further provide researchers with an opportunity to obtain direct 
feedback about their work from a wide range of persons during the 
poster session. Posters should focus on problems and methodology of the
presented research. Extended abstracts describing the work will be 
reviewed and published in the conference proceedings. Please note 
however, that posters describing work at the proposal stage will not 
be accepted. Submissions need to be received by February 25, 2007. 
Read more on: http://www.sigir2007.org/cfposters.html

Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes 
or operational systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas 
gained from implementing IR systems and to obtain feedback from expert 
users. Demonstration submissions are welcomed in any of the areas 
identified in the call for papers. One-page demonstration abstracts 
will appear in the conference proceedings. Demonstration proposals 
must be submitted by February 25, 2007. Read more on: 
http://www.sigir2007.org/cfd.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Call for doctoral consortium

The ACM SIGIR Doctoral Consortium provides doctoral students with a 
unique opportunity to have substantive interaction with other 
researchers regarding their proposed dissertation research. The 
objectives of the Doctoral Consortium are: 
  *  To provide a forum where doctoral students can present and 
     discuss their proposed research with experienced IR researchers 
     the members of the Doctoral Consortium Program Committee. 
  *  To give students an opportunity to establish a supportive 
     community of other doctoral students at the same stage of their 
     dissertation research as themselves. 
The Consortium will take place on the same day as the Tutorials, 
with the format being: student presentations with plenary discussions, 
lunch, individual meetings with experienced researchers, and dinner. 
Submissions must arrive on or before March 11, 2007. Read more on:
http://www.sigir2007.org/cfdc.html
