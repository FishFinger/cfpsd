Meeting Description:

ISLOJ 2
The Second 
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE LANGUAGES OF JAVA

4-5 June 2009 
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, Senggigi, Lombok, Indonesia

ISLOJ provides the opportunity for scholars working on various linguistic
aspects of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak to gather and
share their research. 

Second Call for Papers

Keynote Speakers: 
Dr. Thomas Hunter: The interaction of irrealis with the symmetrical voice system
of Old Javanese. 
Dr. Husni Muadz, Universitas Negri Mataram: A topic on Sasak TBA 

The island of Java is home to several major languages.  Javanese--spoken mainly
in Central and East Java-- is the world's 10th or 11th largest language in
number of native speakers.  It has one of the oldest and fullest recorded
histories of any Austronesian language.  It also has been of considerable
interest to scholars because of the system of speech levels or speech styles
found in a number of varieties of Javanese.  Sundanese--spoken in West Java--
has over 27 million speakers, and Madurese--spoken on the neighboring island of
Madura and throughout parts of East Java--has over 13 million speakers. 
Varieties of both of these languages have speech level systems and such systems
can also be found in the geographically, historically, and linguistically
related languages on the neighboring islands of Bali and Lombok.  Each of these
languages displays a range of dialects, isolects, continua, and contact
varieties and yet they have received relatively little attention from linguists.
 With this symposium, we offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect
of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese and Sasak to come together and share
their findings.  We aim to encourage and promote continued research on these
important and unique languages.  

Abstracts are invited for papers to be presented on any linguistic topics
dealing with the languages of Java and its environs--Javanese, Sundanese,
Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak.  Given the location of the conference, papers on
Sasak are especially encouraged.  Papers on other languages will be judged
according to their relevance to the symposium topic.  Papers are welcome from
any subfield of linguistics and using any approach or theoretical background. 
Studies of non-standard(ized) versions, dialects, and isolects, including
contact varieties, are particularly welcome.  All papers are to be presented in
English.

Persons wishing to present papers at the symposium are invited to submit a
one-page [data and references may be on a second page] abstract in electronic
form (PDF AND MSWord) to Thomas Conners at the following address:
oranghutan@cbn.net.id

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2009

Please note that the 13th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian
Linguistics (ISMIL 13) will be held immediately following ISLOJ, also at the
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, on 6-7 June, 2009.  For more information see:

Full Title: XVII Symposium on Languages for Specific Purposes 

Date: 17-Aug-2009 - 21-Aug-2009
Location: Aarhus, Denmark 
Contact Person: Sabina Bjerre Hansen
Meeting Email: LSO2009@asb.dk
Web Site: http://www.asb.dk/LSP2009 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

XVII Symposium on Languages for Specific Purposes 

Call for Papers

Conference Tracks
We expect contributions to fall mainly, but not exclusively, under the following
thematic strands:
Communication of specialised knowledge
Construction of specialised knowledge
Cognitive aspects of specialised languages 
-The translation of specialised discourse
-Technical Writing in theory and practice
-LSP in Business Communication 
-Diachronic perspectives on LSP
-Linguistic features of specialised language 
-Textual and genre analysis of specialised discourse 
-LSP and multimedia discourse 
-Intercultural aspects of specialised discourse 
-Pedagogical aspects of LSP 
-Terminology and Terminography 
-Specialised lexicography

Today, the characteristics of LSP and specialized discourse are seen as
increasingly interesting not only by scholars working in the traditional fields
of LSP like terminology and genre studies, but also by scholars in other fields
like sociology, psychology and communication studies. 

This widening of the range of scholars studying specialised discourse makes it
relevant to set up a contemporary map of the field. And as we see it as one of
the central characteristics of studies of specialised discourse that they are
driven by problems of the investigated discourse communities rather than mere
theoretical concerns, we want the methods and aims behind the studies presented
in Aarhus (and thus of LSP studies in general) to be a central concern of the
conference. 

The following questions are examples of possible perspectives with relevance for
mapping the purposes of LSP research:
-What kinds of problems do we intend to solve (inefficiency of work processes,
lack of understanding in specific situations, lack of knowledge about
conventions, social problems,...)? 
-What discipline or disciplines are we focusing upon (law, medicine, business,
engineering,...)? 
-What research communities do we intend to contribute to (linguistics,
sociology, communication, computer science, cognition, law, economics, applied
linguistics, didactics,...)? 
-What relations are there between chosen research community and chosen
methodology? Why do we choose to use specific methods (qualitative,
quantitative, interpretative, form orientation vs. content orientation,...)  in
our research? 
-What types of knowledge are we trying to achieve (knowledge about social
structures, about language, about power, about cognitive characteristics, ...)? 

We would like you to also discuss these or similar questions in your
contribution, so that one of the outcomes of the Aarhus symposium would be a map
of the methods and aims currently driving the study of specialised language and
discourse.

The deadline for submission of abstracts will be January 15, 2009. Papers should
be designed to fit into a 30-minute time slot (including time for discussion).
Further information concerning the guidelines for abstracts is posted on the
conference website. 
Deadline for registration will be April 15, 2009 at the price of  275. 
Final deadline will be June 30, 2009 at the price of  300.
