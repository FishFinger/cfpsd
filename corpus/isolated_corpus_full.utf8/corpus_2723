Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

Conference on biological aspects of human language with specific focus on
language acquisition and language evolution, Department of Language and
Linguistic Science, University of York 

Call for Papers

A major goal of current linguistic research is to understand the unique language
ability of human beings. A central question is the nature of our genetic
endowment for language, as reflected in its acquisition and its neurological and
biological underpinnings. The key questions of language acquisition include the
extent and role of innate knowledge of linguistic structure and the interaction
of such knowledge with the ambient language input to which children are exposed.

Language evolution, similarly, questions the possible origin of a unique
'language faculty'. Hypotheses regarding both acquisition and evolution must
confront the issue of the interaction of Universal Grammar with other human
cognitive and perceptuomotor capacities. At the same time, cultural and
historical perspectives on evolution are also needed, as are insights from
interdisciplinary fields such as psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology,
genetics and computational modelling. This conference would like to invite
contributions for these or other disciplines which can address any or all of the
three topics named in our title.

We call for papers for 20-minute talk and 10-minute discussion. Anyone may
submit one abstract as the sole author and a second as co-author, or two as
co-author.

All abstracts must be submitted by 11 am GMT, on Monday, March 31, 2008.
Abstracts should conform to the following specifications:

PDF format, with file name ''Lastname'' (e.g., Chomsky.pdf).

Typed in 12 pt and 1-inch margins.

Abstract should be no more than 500 words in length. Data, graphics, and
references are not included in the final count, but please interleave data with
the main body of the abstract. There is no limit in total abstract (including
data, graphics and references).

Author name(s) should not appear on the main body of the abstract.

For abstract submission, please visit our
website:http://www.york.ac.uk/conferences/bale2008/index.html

Location: Sydney, NSW, Australia 
Contact Person: Maria Herke
Meeting Email: isfc2008@ling.mq.edu.au

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Forensic
Linguistics; Ling & Literature; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Translation; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

We are delighted to call for contributions in the form of papers, workshops and
colloquia to ISFC 2008, to be held at Macquarie University
(http://www.mq.edu.au/), Sydney, Australia, 21-26 July 2008.
The Congress will be preceded by a Pre-ISFC seasonal (winter / summer)
Institute, to be held at UNSW (the University of New South Wales;
http://www.unsw.edu.au/), Sydney, Australia, 14-19 July, 2008. 

Call for Papers

Congress Theme: Voices Around the World
Congress Website: http://minerva.ling.mq.edu.au/isfc/ 
Congress Email: isfc2008@ling.mq.edu.au 
Pre-Congress Email: isfc.institute@unsw.edu.au 

Theme:
The theme of the 35th ISFC is Voices Around the World, emphasizing the rich
multi-faceted nature of contributions to systemic functional linguistics around
the world and the centrality of all the regions that make up the global systemic
functional community and promoting regional resonances and complementarities.
Like the theme of previous ISFCs, this theme is intended to be broad and
inclusive. It is intended to be multiply interpretable, promoting regional
contributions in terms of:

- Engagement with the rich range of languages and other semiotic systems around
the world as objects of study;
- Engagement with the varied contexts of research and application around the
regions of the world, including problems arising both in academic institutions
and in the wider communities and also the implications of conducting systemic
functional work in different languages;
- Engagement with the different institutional environments in which systemic
functional linguistics is taught and in which systemic functional linguistics
informs educational efforts the different curricular contexts in which systemic
functional linguistics operates;
- Engagement with the different ''dialects'' and ''registers'' of systemic
functional linguistics around the world, with an emphasis on both commonalities
and complementarities.
- Engagement with different ''metalanguages'' close enough to systemic
functional linguistics to allow for inter-translatability and cross-fertilization.

The congress theme of Voices Around the World will be supported not only by the
programme subcommittee of the local organizing committee but also by a special
regional subcommittee. 

Relating to the congress theme of Voices Around the World, the congress will be
designed to promote the development of:

- Resource Networks around the world networks for sharing resources across
regions and across institutions, taking advantage of the regional and global
systemic functional communities during a period when resources sharing is
increasingly being supported by technological developments at the same time as
individual institutions are increasingly being positioned to compete with one
another in local and national contexts;
- Research Networks around the world networks for pursuing research defined in
terms of fields such as educational linguistics, translation studies,
computational linguistics, multimodal studies, stylistics or themes such as
systemic organization, complexity, semogenesis, helping to identify synergies
and to develop collaborative research projects, potentially drawing on new
sources of funding.

Existing Resource and Research Networks will be supported in the organization of
the programme through workshops and papers, and the formation of new networks
will be encouraged and supported. In addition, these Networks will be supported
in the programme through a forum for reporting on and comparing activities
relating to different fields and themes. The Resource Networks can be compared
with the development of repositories in linguistics, as within the Linguistic
Data Consortium, and the Research Networks can be compared with the research
networks established by AILA (and the earlier scientific commissions) and with
research networks more generally supported by funding agencies.
