Call for Courses

3rd Russian Summer School in Information Retrieval (RuSSIR 2009) 
Friday September 11 - Wednesday September 16, 2009
Petrozavodsk, Russia
http://romip.ru/russir2009/eng/index.html 

First Call for Course Proposals

The 3rd Russian Summer School in Information Retrieval will be held September
11-16, 2009 in Petrozavodsk, Russia. 

The school is co-organized by:
-Russian Information Retrieval Evaluation Seminar (ROMIP, http://romip.ru/)
(English site: http://romip.ru/en/)
-Petrozavodsk State University (http://petrsu.ru/)(English site:
http://petrsu.ru/Structure/structure_e.html)
-Karelian Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences
(http://www.krc.karelia.ru/). 

The first and second RuSSIRs took place in Ekaterinburg in 2007 and Taganrog in
2008, respectively (see http://romip.ru/russir2007/eng/index.html and
http://romip.ru/russir2008/eng/index.html).
Both events were very successful.

Petrozavodsk, the capital of the Republic of Karelia is a large industrial and
cultural center of the Russian North-West. Petrozavodsk is situated on the
shores of Onega Lake, one of the biggest inner lakes in Europe. Karelia is often
called ''stony lake-forest land'' and ''the lungs of Europe'', highlighting
beautiful landscapes created by countless lakes and rivers and the forest
covered land. Petrozavodsk is 400 km away from Saint-Petersburg, an overnight
train journey from Saint-Petersburg takes about eight hours. 

The target audience of the Summer School is advanced graduate and PhD students,
post-doctoral researchers, academic and industrial researchers, and developers.

The mission of the school is to teach students about a wide range of modern
problems and methods in Information Retrieval; to stimulate scientific research
in the field of Information Retrieval; and to create an opportunity for 
informal contacts among scientists, students and industry professionals. The
Russian Conference for Young Scientists in Information Retrieval will be
co-organized with the school. RuSSIR2009 will offer 4 or 5 one-week courses and
host approximately 100 participants. The working languages of the school are
English (preferable) and Russian.

The RuSSIR2009 Organizing Committee invites proposals for courses on a wide
range of IR-related topics, including but not limited to:

IR theory and models
IR architectures
Algorithms and data structures for IR
Text IR
Multimedia (incl. music, speech, image, video, etc.) IR
Natural language techniques in IR tasks
User interfaces for IR
Web IR (including duplicate detection, hyperlink analysis, query log processing)
Text mining, information and fact extraction
Mobile applications for IR
Dynamic media IR (blogs, news, WIKIs)
Social IR (collaborative filtering, tagging, recommendation systems)
IR evaluation.

Each course should consist of five 90-minute-long sessions (normally in five
subsequent days). The course may include both lectures and practical exercises
in computer labs. A course proposal must contain a brief description of the
course (up to 200 words), preferred schedule, prerequisites, equipment needs, a
short description of teaching/research experience and contact information of the
lecturer.

RuSSIR2009 organizers will cover travel expenses and accommodation at the
school. Lecturers are not paid for their contribution. Details of reimbursement
will be negotiated with each lecturer individually. The RuSSIR organizers would
highly appreciate if, whenever this is possible, lecturers could find
alternative funding to cover travel and accommodation expenses and indicate this
possibility in the proposal.

All proposals will be evaluated by the RuSSIR2009 program committee according to
the school goals, presentation clarity, lecturer's qualifications and
experience. Topics not featured at previous RuSSIRs are preferred.

Anyone interested in lecturing at RuSSIR2009 is encouraged to submit proposal by
email to Pavel Braslavski (pb@yandex-team.ru), by January 31, 2009. All
submitters will be notified by February 20, 2009 about selection results.
