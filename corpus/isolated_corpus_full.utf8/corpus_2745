Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

THE GLOBAL STUDIES CONFERENCE, University of Illinois, Chicago, 16-18 May 2008
http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com

The Global Studies Conference on Global Studies Journal are devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization. This journal and the conference attempt to do this from many points of view, from many locations in the world, and in a wide-angle kaleidoscopic fashion.

The Conference will include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed Global Studies  Journal. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 13 March 2008. Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Chicago in May 2008.

Yours Sincerely,

Jan Nederveen Pieterse
Professor of Sociology
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA
