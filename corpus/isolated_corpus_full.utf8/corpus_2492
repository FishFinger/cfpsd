AAAI-08 Workshop on
What Went Wrong and Why: Lessons from AI Research and Applications

CALL FOR PAPERS
Submissions due: April 7th, 2008


Bugs, glitches, and failures shape research and development by charting=20
the boundaries of technology; they identify errors, reveal assumptions,=20
and expose design flaws.  When a system works we focus on its input/output =

behavior, but when a problem occurs, we examine the mechanisms that=20
generated behavior to account for the flaw and hypothesize corrections.=20
This process produces insight and forces incremental refinement.  In a=20
sense, failures are the mother of necessity, and therefore the grandmother =

of invention.

Unfortunately, bugs, glitches, and failures are rarely mentioned in=20
academic discourse.  Their role in informing design and development is=20
essentially lost. The first What Went Wrong and Why workshop during the=20
2006 AAAI spring symposium [1,2] started to address this gap by inviting=20
AI researchers and system developers to discuss their most revealing bugs, =

and relate problems to lessons learned.  Revised versions of the articles=20
and the invited talks will be published as a special issue of the=20
AI-Magazine in Summer 2008 [3].

The first workshop clarified that WWWW experiences can be studied at three =

different levels of abstraction: the Strategic (AI research in general),=20
Tactical (research area) and Execution (project or implementation) levels. =

 An additional category turned out to be the study of how, why and when=20
failures occur in the first place.

The second workshop will continue our analysis of failures in research. In =

addition to examining the links between failure and insight, we would like =

to determine if there is a hidden structure behind our tendency to make=20
mistakes that can be utilized to provide guidance in research.=20

As such, we invite researchers to submit papers (8 pages in AAAI format)=20
connecting problems they have encountered to lessons learned on the=20
tactical or execution level. We would also welcome papers on the study of=20
failures themselves. We encourage authors to elaborate on what they=20
believe was the source cause of the failure, how the problem helped them=20
arrive at a better solution, and to suggest a broader categorization of=20
failures and how to utilize them.  Papers should be submitted to=20
submission@whatwentwrongandwhy.org

Important Dates
* Submissions Due: April 7, 2008
* Notifications: April 21, 2008
* Final Papers Due: May 5, 2008
* Workshop: July 13 or 14, 2008 (TBA) in Chicago at AAAI 2008
