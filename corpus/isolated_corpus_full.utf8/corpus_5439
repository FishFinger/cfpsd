Overview and Aim
===================================================================

The International Symposium on Rules, Applications and Interoperability has
evolved from an annual series of international workshops since 2002,
international conferences in 2005 and 2006, and international symposia since
2007. This year, the 3rd International Symposium on Rules, Applications and
Interoperability (RuleML-2009) takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA,
collocated with the 12th Business Rules Forum, the world's largest Business
Rules event. RuleML-2009 is devoted to practical distributed rule
technologies and rule-based applications which need language standards for
rules (inter)operating in, e.g., the Semantic Web, Multi-Agent Systems,
Event-Driven Architectures, and Service-Oriented Applications. 

The main goal of RuleML-2009 is to stimulate the cooperation and
interoperability between business and research, by bringing together rule
system providers, participants in rule standardization efforts, open source
communities, practitioners, and researchers. The concept of the symposium
has also advanced continuously in the face of extremely rapid progress in
practical rule and event processing technologies. As a result, RuleML-2009
will feature hands-on demonstrations and challenges alongside a wide range
of thematic tracks, and thus will be an exciting venue to exchange new ideas
and experiences on all issues related to the engineering, management,
integration, interoperation and interchange of rules in open distributed
environments such as the Web.

Conference Theme
===================================================================

This year, we particularly welcome submissions that address applications of
Web rule technologies for business and information systems. We invite you to
share your ideas, results, and experiences: as an industry practitioner,
rule system provider, technical expert and developer, rule user or
researcher, exploring foundations, developing systems and applications, or
using rule-based systems. We invite high-quality submissions related to (but
not limited to) one or more of the following topics:

Track Topics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Transformation and Extraction
  - Transformation and extraction with rule standards, such as SBVR, RIF and

    OCL

  - Event and action definition, detection, consumption, termination, 
    lifecycle management
  - Dynamic rule-based workflows and intelligent event processing (rule-
    based CEP)
  - Non-functional requirements, use of annotations, metadata to capture 
    those
  - Design time and execution time aspects of rule-based (Semantic) Business

    Processes Modeling and Management
  - Practical and business aspects of rule-based (Semantic) Business Process

    Management (business scenarios, case studies, use cases etc.)

    - MISMO: Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Org
    - FIXatdl: FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language
    - FpML: Financial products Markup Language
    - HL7: Health Level 7
    - Acord: Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development

      (Insurance Industry)
  - Rules for Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC), e.g., rules for internal

    audit, SOX compliance, enterprise risk management (ERM), operational 
    risk, etc
  - Rules and Corporate Actions
    
General Rule Topics
  - Rules and ontologies
  - Execution models, rule engines, and environments
  - From rules to FOL to modal logics
  - Rule-based reasoning with non-monotonic negation, modalities, deontic, 
    temporal, priority, scoped or other rule qualification
  - Rule-based default reasoning with default logic, defeasible logic, and 
    answer set programming
  - Graphical processing, modelling and rendering of rules
  - Rules in Semantic Web Technologies
  - Miscellaneous rule topics
    
Case studies, experience reports, and industrial problem statements are
particularly encouraged.

RuleML-2009 Challenge 
===================================================================

The RuleML-2009 Demo Challenge is one of the highlights of RuleML-2009. We
invite submissions of demo papers and demos where rules are used in
interesting and practically relevant ways to, e.g., derive useful
information, transform knowledge, provide decision support and provide
automated rule-based monitoring, enforcement, validation or management of
the behavioural logic of the application. The Challenge offers participants
the chance to demonstrate their commercial and open source tools, use cases,
and applications. Submissions are solicited in these categories:

  - Benchmarks (test cases, suites) with evaluations of (their own, other)
    rule engines and/or rule translators, possibly drawing on our growing  
    pool at http://ruleml-challenge.cs.nccu.edu.tw
  - Case studies (use cases) implemented via engines/translators employing
    rule standards such as RIF, RuleML, CLIPS, Common Logic, SBVR, and ISO
    Prolog.

We welcome all demos about tools and applications using rules such as: 

  - Derivation rules, including query and integrity rules  
  - ECA rules, including production rules, reaction rules, and rule-based 
    CEP languages

Authors of demo are also invited to submit a Challenge demo paper for
publications in the conference proceedings, see the submission section below
for submission details.

Prizes will be awarded to the two best applications from each category. All
accepted demos will be presented in a special Challenge Session. A
submission to the RuleML Challenge has to meet the requirement that
declarative rules explicitly play a central role in the application.
Basically this means that:
Rules are explicitly represented in a declarative format and they are
decoupled from the application (rather than being compiled or hard-coded
into the application logic). The demo should preferably (but not
necessarily) be embedded into a web-based or distributed environment so that
there will be a need for features related to the RuleML conference topics,
as listed in the call for papers. For more details and the demo site web
link please consult the RuleML-2009 Challenge website:

                    http://ruleml-challenge.cs.nccu.edu.tw


Student Grant Awards
===================================================================

Two travel grants are available to students who are authors or co-authors of
papers or demos accepted for presentation at the symposium. The grants
include free registration and cover travel expenses up to 1000 dollars.


Conference Language
===================================================================

The official language of the conference will be English.


Submission
===================================================================

Authors are invited to submit original contributions of practical relevance
and technical rigor in the field, experience reports and show case/use case
demonstrations of effective, practical, deployable rule-based technologies
or applications in distributed environments. Papers must be in English and
may be submitted at

            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ruleml2009

as:

Full Papers (15 pages in the proceedings)
Short Papers (8 pages in the proceedings)
RuleML-2009 Challenge Demo Paper + Show Cases (3-5 pages in the proceedings)

Please upload all submissions as PDF files in LNCS format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). To ensure high quality,
submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by 3 PC members based on
originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
Authors are requested to upload the abstracts of their papers before June 9,
2009 and to upload their complete papers by June 16, 2009. The selected
papers will be published in book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series along with a CD with demo software and
documents. The best paper from all submissions will be determined by the PC
and a Best Paper Award will be handed over at the Symposium by a Sponsor.
All submissions must be done electronically. A selection of revised papers
will be resubmitted to a special issue of a journal.
 
Submissions to the RuleML Challenge 2009 consist of a demo paper of 3-5
pages, describing the demo show case, and a link to more information about
the demo/show case, e.g. a project site, an online demonstration, a
presentation about the demonstration, or a download site for the
demonstration. In case of product demos, the link can be password-protected:
please submit a password for anonymous login from any Web browser, giving us
the permission to pass the password on to 3 PC members. The submissions
should satisfy the minimal requirements defined in the topics of interest
and preferably exhibit some of the additional desiderata. The more
desiderata are met by an application, the higher the score will be. The
demos will be evaluated by the RuleML-2009 Program Committee and prizes will
be awarded to the two best applications, sponsored by the RuleML Inc.
non-profit organization.

 
Review Process
