CALL FOR PAPERS 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forth International Workshop "Dependability Aspects on Data WArehousing
and Mining applications" DAWAM 2009. 

dawam.ares-conference.eu 

http://www.ares-conference.eu/conf/index.php/workshops/dawam
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
in conjunction with The Forth International Conference on
Availability, Reliability and Security - ARES 2009
(http://www.ares-conference.eu/conf/)
March 16th ï¿½ 19th, 2009
Fukuoka Institute of Technology (FIT)
Fukuoka, Japan 

Overview
 --------
The rapid growth of information technologies has brought tremendous
opportunities for data sharing, integration, and analysis across multiple
distributed, heterogeneous data sources. In the past decade, data 
warehousing and mining are the well-known technologies used for data 
analysis and knowledge discovery in vast domain of applications. 

Data mining technology has emerged as a means of identifying patterns and
trends from large quantities of data. Data mining has used a data 
warehousing model of gathering all data into a central site, then running an 
algorithm against that data. 

A growing attention has been paid to the study, development and application
of data warehousing and mining. Nevertheless, dependability aspects in these 
applications such as availability, reliability, integrity, privacy, and 
security issues are still being investigated. For example, in data 
warehousing applications, privacy considerations may prevent the approach of 
collecting data into the centralized warehouse because each data source has 
different privacy policy. Furthermore, the complexity of security increases 
as different sources of information are combined.
Reliable, consistent and trustworthy of information are also significant
requirements in data warehousing applications. Data mining has been shown to 
be beneficial in confronting various types of attacks to computer systems 
such as fraud detection, intrusion prevention. In some applications, e.g. 
clinic information system, government management, business competitive 
information, it is required to apply the mining algorithms without observing 
the confidential data values thus demands the privacy preservation. There 
are also many challenging issues that need further investigation in the 
context of data mining from both privacy
and security perspectives such as mining of imbalanced data, bioinformatics
data, streaming data, ubiquitous computing data, grid computing data etc. 

Starting from the beginning of the ARES conference in 2006, the DAWAM 
workshop (workshop on "Dependability Aspects on Data Warehousing and Mining
applications"), like ARES, will reach the 4th year in 2009. Previous DAWAM 
workshops were held at Vienna University of Technology, Austria on April 
20-22, 2006 (DAWAM 2006), April 10-13, 2007 (DAWAM 2007), Polytechnic 
University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, March 4-7, 2008 (DAWAM 2008). 
This year, DAWAM 2009 will be held at Fukuoka Institute of Technology, 
Fukuoka, Japan, March 16-19, 2009. 

The goals of this workshop are to bring together users, engineers and
researchers (from industry and academy) alike to present their recent work, 
discuss and identify problems, synergize different views of techniques and 
policies, and brainstorm future research directions on various dependability 
aspects of data warehousing and data mining
applications. We strongly encourage researchers and practitioners with 
interest in the  areas of reliability, availability, privacy and security, 
databases, data warehousing, data mining, and statistics to submit their 
experience, and/or research results. 

Topics related to any of dependability aspects in data warehousing and 
mining, theory, systems and applications are of interest. These include, but 
are not limited to the following areas: 

ï¿½ Dependability and fault tolerance
ï¿½ High Availability and Disaster Recovery
ï¿½ Survivability of evaluative systems
ï¿½ Reliability and Robustness Issues
ï¿½ Accuracy and reliability of responses
ï¿½ Reliable and Failure Tolerant Business Process Integration
ï¿½ Reliable Event Management and Data Stream Processing
ï¿½ Failure Tolerant and trustworthy Sensor Networks
ï¿½ Highly available data warehouses for business processes integration
ï¿½ Handling different or incompatible formats, and erroneous data
ï¿½ Privacy and security policies and social impact of data mining
ï¿½ Privacy preserving data integration
ï¿½ Access control techniques and secure data models
ï¿½ Encryption & Authentication
ï¿½ Pseudonymization and Encryption
ï¿½ Anonymization and pseudonymization
ï¿½ Trust management, and security
ï¿½ Security in Aggregation and Generalization
ï¿½ User Profile Based Security
ï¿½ Secure multi-party computation
ï¿½ Secondary use of personal data, clinic data, credit record
ï¿½ Fraud and misuse detection
ï¿½ Intrusion detection and tolerance
ï¿½ Data mining applications for terrorist detection
ï¿½ Private queries by a (semi-trusted) third party
ï¿½ Query authentication, logging, auditing, access control and
authorization policies 

The program of the workshop will be a combination of invited talks,
paper/poster presentations and discussions. 

Important Dates
 ---------------
Submission Deadline: November, 1th 2008
Author Notification: December, 1th 2008
Author Registration: December, 15th 2008
Proceedings Version: December, 15th 2008
Conference/Workshop: March 16-19th, 2009 

Submission Guidelines
 ---------------------
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers in IEEE 
Computer Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (two columns, single-spaced, 
including figures and references, using 10 fonts, and number each page). You 
can confirm the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Author Guidelines at the 
following web page: 

URL: http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html 

Submission are classified into 3 categories (1) full paper (6 pages), (2) 
short paper (4 pages) and (3) poster (1 page) representing original, 
previously unpublished work.
Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality,
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. 

Contact author must provide the following information: paper title, authors'
names, affiliations, postal address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the 
author(s), about 200-250 word abstract, and about five keywords and register 
at our ARES website:
http://www.ares-conference.eu/conf/ and select DAWAM workshop submission. 

You can also prepare your paper in PDF file and send it to the workshop
co-chair:
Prof. Bhavani Thuraisingham, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA (
bhavani.thuraisingham@utdallas.edu ) or Dr. Nguyen Manh Tho, Institute of 
Software Technology, Vienna University of Technology, Austria ( 
tho@ifs.tuwien.ac.at ) 

Submission of a paper implies that should the paper be accepted, at least 
one of the authors will register and present the paper in the conference. 
Accepted papers will be given guidelines in preparing and submitting the 
final manuscript(s) together with the notification of acceptance. 

Publication
 -----------
All accepted papers will be published as ISBN proceedings published by IEEE
Computer Society. Based on quality and referee reviews, some papers not 
suitable for acceptance as full paper will be accepted for presentation at 
DAWAM 2009 as short paper or Poster presentation category and will be also 
included in the IEEE Proceedings. 

Like in DAWAM 2007 and DAWAM 2008, A selected number of DAWAM 2009 best 
papers will be nominated to be published as special issues in appropriate 
journals such as International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data 
Mining (IJBIDM), Journal of automatic and trusted computing (JoATC).
