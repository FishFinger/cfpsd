peers as well as senior researchers.  

Abstracts are due by April 27, 2007. Your proposal should describe original,

one individual and one joint submission (papers co-authored with faculty will
not be accepted). Send your abstract as a PDF or WORD file to bide@fil.deusto.es
with 'abstract submission' in the subject field. The abstract should be
anonymous and abide by the following specifications: do not exceed two pages
(examples and references included); use 1 inch ( 2.54 cm) margins on all sides;
and a 12 point size font (preferably Times New Roman). Include your name(s),
title of the paper, affiliation(s) and contact information in the email body,
and indicate what area of linguistics your contribution fits in best, e.g.
morphology, phonetics, phonology, syntax, etc. English is the official language
of the conference and all abstracts must be written in this language.  

Notification of acceptance will be sent around mid May. Accepted papers are
allotted 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for discussion.  

The papers presented at BIDE'07 are eligible for publication in the
International Journal of Basque Linguistics. The deadline for submitting papers
