        Call for participation

             INFILE@CLEF2008

     Information, Filtering, Evaluation
     =

          http://www.infile.org


INFILE welcomes participation of any institution to its first evaluation =

campaign. This participation is free of charge and
participants can keep and use the development and evaluation data for =

free after the evaluations for research and development purposes.

INFILE (INformation, Filtrage, Evaluation) is a cross-language adaptive =

filtering evaluation campaign jointly organized by CEA,
Universit=E9 de Lille 3 and ELDA. It is organized as a pilot track in CLEF =

2008 and is supported by NIST TREC.

INFILE extends the last filtering track of TREC 2002 in the following ways:
-INFILE is crosslingual (English, French and Arabic); a corpus of  =

100,000 comparable news-wire stories from Agence France Presse (AFP)
 for each language is used for the evaluations.

-Evaluation will be performed using an automatic interrogation of test  =

systems with a simulated user feedback. Each system will be able to
 use the feedback at any time to increase performance.

The participant systems will have to provide a Boolean decision for each =

document according to each filtering  profile. A curve of the evolution =

of efficiency will be computed.
Although cross-lingual systems are encouraged, the campaign is also open =

to monolingual systems.


Tasks and languages
-------------------
Two tasks and three languages are considered. The first task is =

Information Filtering on general news and events. For this task, =

participants will have to classify each transmitted news-wire into
zero, one or more different profiles. 30 general profiles will be made =

available in 3 languages (Arabic, English and French).

The second task is Information Filtering on science and technology =

domain. Participants will have to associate to each news-wire zero, one =

or more science and technology profiles.
A total of 20 profiles will be available in 3 languages (Arabic, English =

and French).

For each task, participants are free to register to monolingual =

filtering (e.g. information filtering using profiles and news-wires in =

the same language) or to crosslingual filtering (e.g. information
filtering according to profiles in one language and news-wires in =

another language).

Corpus
------
The corpus consists of 300,000 news-wires in Arabic, English and French =

from the news agency Agence France Presse covering the 2004-2006 period.
The news-wires are related to general news and events information and =

are comparable between Arabic, English and French.


Protocol description
---------------------
General information about the domain of profiles is given to each =

participant. 15 days afterwards, 50 profiles are given to participants =

(30 general
profiles and 20 profiles related to science and technology). Profiles =

are composed of a list of keywords (simple and complex noun phrases) and =

up to 3
documents illustrating each profile.
 =

Then, news-wires are transmitted by the organizer to an automated  =

interface of each participating system. The interface returns a
 Boolean response for each profile. After reception of this response, =

and if requested by the participant, the organizer sends a feedback
 consisting of expected profile assignments for each document  =

submitted. Participants may adapt their system at any time using this =

feedback.
