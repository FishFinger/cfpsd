Call Deadline: 30-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description
The Fifth International Contrastive Linguistics Conference (ICLC5) will be
held on July 7 - 9, 2008 at the University of KULeuven 

First Call for Papers

We are pleased to announce that the Fifth International Contrastive
Linguistics Conference (ICLC5) will be held on July 7 - 9, 2008 at the
University of KULeuven.

The aim of the conference is to promote linguistic comparison between two
(or more) languages in the area of theoretical linguistics. Although
contrastive linguistics has for long been primarily associated with applied
linguistics (in particular foreign language teaching), it is defined here
as a subdiscipline of linguistics with a strong theoretical dimension,
which may contribute to our understanding of linguistic structures and
functions.

Papers or posters with a comparative approach are invited on topics related
to one of the following domains: discourse analysis and pragmatics, syntax
and semantics, lexicon and morphology, phonetics and phonology. Any
empirically founded research with theoretical implications will be welcomed.

The following keynote speakers have confirmed their participation:
Kasia Jaszczolt (University of Cambridge)
Ekkehard König (Freie Universität Berlin)
Peter Koch (Eberhard-Karls Universität Tübingen)
Antoinette Renouf (University of Birmingham)
Anne Zribi-Hertz (Université de Paris 8)

Papers will have a maximum duration of 20 minutes with an additional 10
minutes for discussion. To ensure maximum intelligibility among the
audience, they should preferably be in English. However, if necessary, they
may be presented in Dutch, French, Spanish, German or Italian.

Submission Information 
Participants can only present one paper. However, a maximum of two papers
may be presented provided both are co-authored. The maximum number of named
authors/participants per paper will be three.
In order for your paper to be accepted, an anonymous abstract must be sent
as indicated below. 

The abstract must specify the subject that you will address as well as the
main conclusions. It should also provide the crucial data and indicate the
main references to previous work on the subject.  

Abstracts should be sent by e-mail to ICLC5@arts.kuleuven.be, using the
Word template which is available on the website
http://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ICLC5 
before October 30, 2007. Under subject, write ''ICLC5 abstract''. Please
name the attachment: ICLC5 plus your full name.

Fees/ Accomodation and Social Programme
Information will be sent along with the registration form in the second
circular.

Publication
After a blind refereeing process, those papers that fulfil the scientific
requirements will be selected for publication by the Scientific Committee.

Meeting Description

Morphological Variation and Change in Languages of the Caucasus 
Workshop at the 13th International Morphology Meeting
February 2008, Vienna, Austria
http://www.let.uu.nl/~nino.amiridze/personal/organization/mvclc.html 

A great diversity of languages is spoken in the Caucasus, most of which have
rich inflectional systems, on the noun (e.g. North-East Caucasian), on the verb
(e.g. North-West Caucasian), or both (e.g. South Caucasian).

The Caucasus offers rich material for studying genetically diverse languages
being in close contact for centuries, e.g. Georgian (South Caucasian) with
Abkhaz (North-West Caucasian); Ossetian (Indo-European) and Batsbi (North-East
Caucasian); Armenian (Indo-European) with Azeri (Turkic); or Kumyk (Turkic) with
major North-East Caucasian languages of Daghestan; or, for a much shorter
period, the languages indigenous to the region being in contact with the
unrelated Russian and Turkish. While much is known about the
contemporary grammar of individual languages of the Caucasus, much less can be
said with regard to the various contact situations and their impact on the
morphosyntax of individual languages. Our workshop aims to broaden the knowledge
on this subject.

We invite researchers working on morphological variation and change in the
languages spoken in the Caucasus to submit abstracts for participation in the
workshop, planned to be held at the 13th International Morphology Meeting. We
would like to invite contributions dealing with contact-induced morphological
changes in any language of the Caucasus region. This includes investigations of
changes driven by influence from any other language of the region, irrespective
of the genetic affiliation of the languages in contact. Of great interest are
not only inter-family, but also somewhat more subtle intra-family contacts, such
as contacts between various North-East Caucasian languages spoken in adjacent
areas or neighboring villages. Contributions exploring morphological variation
and language-internal morphological changes are also welcome.

Important Dates

Abstract submission: September 17, 2007
Notification: October 31, 2007
Workshop: In the first week of February, 2008
(The exact date will be announced later)

Organizers

- Nino Amiridze, Utrecht University (The Netherlands)
- Michael Daniel, Moscow State University (Russia)
- Silvia Kutscher, University of Cologne (Germany)

Publication

If after the workshop there will be interest in publishing either a proceedings
or a special journal issue, then the organizers will take responsibility of
finding a suitable forum and will act as editors.

Submission

Abstracts (maximum 3 pages, including data and references) have to be submitted
electronically as portable document format (.pdf) or Microsoft Word (.doc) files
via the EasyChair conference management system: http://www.easychair.org/MVCLC2008/.

If you do not have an EasyChair account, click on the button ''I have no
EasyChair Account'' on that page and follow the instructions. When you receive a
password, you can enter the site and upload your abstract.
