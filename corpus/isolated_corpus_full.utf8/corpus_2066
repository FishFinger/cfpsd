Call for Papers

Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations

Digital Humanities 2008


Hosted by the University of Oulu, Finland


25-29 June, 2008

http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/


Abstract Deadline: November 18, 2007 (Midnight Universal Time)



Presentations can include:

* Single papers (abstract, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500 words)

* Multiple paper sessions (overview, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500 =
words)

* Posters (abstract, min. of 750 words, max. of 1500 words)



Call for Papers Announcement


I. General


The international Programme Committee invites submissions of abstracts =
of between 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of humanities computing and =
the digital humanities, broadly defined to encompass the common ground =
between information technology and issues in humanities research and =
teaching. As always, we welcome submissions in any area of the =
humanities, particularly interdisciplinary work. We especially encourage =
submissions on the current state of the art in humanities computing and =
the digital humanities, and on recent and expected future developments =
in the field.


Suitable subjects for proposals include, for example,

* text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing, =
language learning

* creation, delivery and management of humanities digital resources

* collaboration between libraries and scholars in the creation, =
delivery, and management of humanities digital resources

* computer-based research and computing applications in all areas of =
literary, linguistic, cultural, and historical studies, including =
interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship

* use of computation in such areas as the arts, architecture, music, =
film, theatre, new media, and other areas reflecting our cultural =
heritage

* research issues such as: information design and modelling; the =
cultural impact of the new media

* the role of digital humanities in academic curricula


Proposals should report significant and substantive results and will =
include reference to pertinent work in the field (up to 10 items) as =
part of their critical assessment.


The range of topics covered by humanities computing can also be =
consulted in the journal of the associations: Literary and Linguistic =
Computing (LLC), Oxford University Press.


The deadline for submitting paper, session and poster proposals to the =
Programme Committee is November 18, 2007 (midnight Universal Time). All =
submissions will be refereed. Presenters will be notified of acceptance =
by February by 13, 2008.


The electronic submission form will be available at the conference site =
from October 15th, 2007. See below for full details on submitting =
proposals.


Proposals for (non-refereed, or vendor) demos and for pre-conference =
tutorials and workshops should be discussed directly with the local =
conference organizer as soon as possible.


For more information on the conference in general please visit the =
conference web site, at http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/.


II. Types of Proposals


Proposals to the Programme Committee may be of three types: (1) papers,

(2) poster presentations and/or software demonstrations (poster/demos), =
and (3) sessions (either three-paper or panel sessions). The type of =
submission must be specified in the proposal.


Proposals to the Programme Committee may be presented in English and any =
of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, =
Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. Conference presentations may be in these =
languages as well, and the Programme Committee encourages presenters to =
consider multilingual presentations (for example, a presentation in one =
language with accompanying slides or handouts accommodating speakers of =
another language).


1) Papers


Proposals for papers (750-1500 words) should describe original work:

either completed research which has given rise to substantial results, =
or the development of significant new methodologies, or rigorous =
theoretical, speculative or critical discussions. Individual papers will =
be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.


Proposals that concentrate on the development of new computing =
methodologies should make clear how the methodologies are applied to =
research and/or teaching in the humanities, and should include some =
critical assessment of the application of those methodologies in the =
humanities. Those that concentrate on a particular application in the =
humanities should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches =
to the problem and should include some critical assessment of the =
computing methodologies used. All proposals should include conclusions =
and references to important sources. Those describing the creation or =
use of digital resources should follow these guidelines as far as =
possible.


2) Poster Presentations and Software Demonstrations (Poster/Demos)


Poster presentations may include computer technology and project =
demonstrations. The term poster/demo refers to the different possible =
combinations of printed and computer based presentations. The =
poster/demo sessions build on the recent trend of showcasing some of the =
most important and innovative work being done in humanities computing. =
By definition, poster presentations and project demonstrations are less =
formal and more interactive than a standard talk. They provide the =
opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees and to discuss =
their work in detail with those most deeply interested in the same =
topic. Presenters will be provided with about two square meters of board =
space to display their work. They may also provide handouts with =
examples or more detailed information. Poster/demos will remain on =
display throughout the conference, but there will also be a separate =
conference session dedicated to them, when presenters should be prepared =
to explain their work and answer questions. Additional times may also be =
assigned for software or project demonstrations.


There should be no difference in quality between poster/demo =
presentations and papers, and the format for proposals is the same for =
both. The same academic standards should apply in both cases, but =
posters/demos may be a more suitable way of presenting late-breaking =
results, or significant work in progress, including pedagogical =
applications. Both will be submitted to the same refereeing process. The =
choice between the two modes of presentation (poster/demo or paper) =
should depend on the most effective and informative way of communicating =
the scientific content of the proposal.


As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters and =
demonstrations to the conference, the Programme Committee will award a =
prize for the best poster.


3) Sessions


Sessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:


Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement =
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for =
each paper, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in =
the session;


Or


A panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an =
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be =
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each =
speaker is willing to participate in the session.


The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for =
papers, i.e. November 18, 2007.



III. Format of the Proposals


All proposals must be submitted electronically using the on-line =
submission form, which will be available from October 15th, 2007 at:


https://secure.digitalhumanities.org/conftool/


Those who registered as authors, reviewers or participants at the DH2007 =
conference are kindly asked to log on to their existing account (the one =
used for the DH2007 conference) rather than making up a new account.



IV. Bursaries for Young Scholars


A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made available =
to those presenting at the conference. If you wish to be considered for =
a bursary, please refer to information about the bursary schemes =
available from the Association for Computing in the Humanities =
(http://www.ach.org/ach_bursary/) and the Association for Literary and =
Linguistic Computing (_http://www.allc.org/awards/bursary.htm_).


Applications may be made to either the ACH or the ALLC, but not both =
organizations.
