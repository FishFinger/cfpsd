Meeting Description

OWNAL is a one-day workshop that focuses on Native languages of the Americas; it
takes place concurrently with the Symposium on the American Indian. 

The Center for Tribal Studies at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, OK,
announces its 1st annual Oklahoma Workshop on Native American Languages. OWNAL
focuses on descriptive studies of indigenous languages of the Americas. This
one-day workshop takes place on the last day of the 36th Annual Symposium on the
American Indian (April 16-19, 2008) and is located in the historic Bacone house,
site of the first Indian University west of the Mississippi. After the workshop,
participants may attend the Saturday Powwow that brings together well-known
fancy dancers and local Oklahoma tribes. 

The deadline for abstracts is February 29. Talks are 20 minutes in length,
followed by 10 minutes for questions. Abstracts should be less than 500 words
and should be submitted by email. Contact detail and institutional affiliation
must be included. The program committee will announce the presentation schedule
no later than March 10. Abstracts and questions should be submitted to Brad
Montgomery-Anderson (montgomb@nsu.edu).
Registration: $40, $20 for students. (This fee is primarily a fundraiser for the
symposium; it also pays for refreshments and a catered lunch. Make checks
payable to NSU with 'Center for Tribal Studies-OWNAL' in the memo). 

Registration should be sent to:

Northeastern State University
Center for Tribal Studies-OWNAL

Meeting Description

The workshop aims to provide a forum to researchers working on language
technology to process and enrich cultural heritage data. This year's special
theme is on 'Studying language variety and change'. 

Call for Papers

LREC 2008 Workshop on
Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data
(LaTeCH 2008)

Special Theme: 
''Resources and Tools for Studying Language Variety and Change''
1 June, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco

http://ilk.uvt.nl/latech08/

Submission deadline: 20 February 2008

The Second Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data 
(LaTeCH 2008) will be held in conjunction with LREC 2008, and will
take place on June 1 in Marrakech, Morocco. 

Scope and Topics

Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large collections of
cultural and scientific heritage objects, such as archaeological artefacts,
audio and video recordings, or manuscripts, archival documents and other written
sources. Such collections are a potentially very valuable resource for
specialists and laypersons alike, provided they can be easily accessed and
automatically processed. Furthermore, textual cultural heritage resources, such
as old manuscripts and early printed books, are not only interesting for
their information content, but are also an invaluable source for linguistic
research on diachronic and synchronic language variety and change. While several
large scale digitisation projects are currently underway to make cultural
heritage resources more accessible, it is equally important to develop powerful
tools to search, link, enrich, and mine the digitised data. Language technology
has a crucial role to play in this, even for collections which are primarily
non-textual, since text is the pervasive medium used for meta-data. At the same
time, the cultural heritage domain poses special challenges for the NLP
community, including the use of historic or non-standard language,
the presence of OCR or transcription errors in the data, and the necessity to
deal with data from various media. 

For LaTeCH 2008, we invite papers on language technology for cultural
heritage data in general and on the special theme of ''Studying Language Variety
and Change''. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 

- enriching cultural heritage data by inducing meta-data
- dealing with linguistic variation and non-standard or non-contemporary use of
language  
- automatic error detection and cleaning
- adapting existing NLP tools for the cultural heritage domain
- linking and retrieving information from different sources, media, 
and languages 
- representing cultural heritage data to different audiences (personalisation,
text simplification, text summarisation, text generation from databases,
hypertext generation) 
- knowledge discovery in cultural heritage data
- complex annotation tools
- determination of word and sentence boundaries within manuscripts
- resources for and treatment of dialects (general solutions)
- annotations of language variety on the orthographic, morphological, and
syntactic level
- global language resource management systems
- repositories of cultural and scientific heritage data

Submissions

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop. Submissions should not exceed 8 pages and should be
typeset using a font size of 11 points. (Style files will be made available by
LREC for the camera-ready versions of accepted papers.)

The reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least
two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.

Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than February 20, 2008. The
only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Details about the
submission procedure will be published on the workshop webpage
(http://ilk.uvt.nl/latech08/) closer to the time.
