Meeting Description

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual
workshop designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working
in research related to spoken dialogue systems. The roundtable provides an
open forum where participants can discuss their research interests, current
work and future plans. 

YRR-2007: Call for participation

Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems
September 1, 2007, Antwerp, Belgium

First Call for Participation

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual
workshop designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working
in research related to spoken dialogue systems. The roundtable provides an
open forum where participants can discuss their research interests, current
work and future plans. The workshop is meant to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about current issues in
spoken dialogue systems research, and help create a stronger international
network of young researchers working in the field. The workshop is
co-located with Interspeech 2007 and will occur the day before the 8th
SIGdial workshop.

Workshop Format

During the workshop we will form small groups to discuss research problems
the participants currently face, and identify issues that are likely to be
important in the coming years. The results of each discussion group will
then presented and discussed in plenary sessions. The topics for discussion
are still open and will be determined by participant submissions and
finalized online before the workshop.
Potential participants should submit a short paper, as described below in
the submission process to get accepted to the workshop.

Submission Process

We invite participation from students, post docs, and junior researchers
who are currently working in spoken dialog systems research. We also invite
participation from those who are working in related fields such as
linguistics, psychology, or speech processing, as applied to spoken
dialogue systems. Please note that by 'young researchers' the workshop's
organizers mean to target students and researchers in the field who are at
a relatively early stage of their careers, and in no
way mean to imply that participants must meet certain age restrictions.

Potential participants should submit a 2-page position paper and suggest
topics for discussion. A template and specific submission instructions will
be available on http://www.yrrsds.org/ on March 30. Submissions will be
accepted on a rolling basis from that day until the maximum number of
participants for the workshop (50) is reached, or until the submission
deadline (July 14th, 2007) is reached. Proceedings from previous years'
workshops are also available on our web site. Specific questions can be
directed to the organizing committee at yrr-organizers07 at ira dot uka dot de.

Important Dates

Open for submissions: March 30th, 2007
Submissions deadline: July 14th, 2007
Registration begins: July 2nd, 2007
Registration deadline: July 27th, 2007
Workshop: September 1st, 2007

Full Title: RANLP-07 Workshop on Genre and NLP 

Date: 30-Sep-2007 - 30-Sep-2007
Location: Borovets, Bulgaria 
Contact Person: Marina Santini
Meeting Email: MarinaSantini.MS@gmail.com
Web Site: http://www.sics.se/use/genre-ws/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 22-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description
Workshop: 'Towards Genre-Enabled Search Engines: The Impact of NLP'  
Held in conjunction with RANLP-2007 (Recent Advances in Natural Language
Processing) 

First Call for Papers

Generally speaking, genres are textual categories that streamline communication
by relying on acknowledged conventions and raising predictable expectations. For
instance, the conventions underlying the blog genre are represented by a
sequence of daily entries that contain narratives, opinions, and feelings of the
blogger, an individual who wishes to participate in a discussion on a certain
subject. These entries are public and other bloggers can directly comment on
them by sending their own postings. These conventions are different from those
underlying the editorial genre, where a single person presents an argumentative
statement of views that are considered to be representative of a newspaper as a
whole. In brief, genres convey the context of communication. This context is
essential when determining the relevance of the information contained in a text.

The concept of genre has great potential for Information Retrieval (IR). One
application is its integration in a search-engine architecture, enabling the
user to combine topic-based search with genre-based search. 

The distinction between topical and non-topical textual dimensions is crucial
when it comes to features. Traditionally, topics and domains rely on features
based on content words (e.g. in the bag-of-words approach), while genre classes
appear to be more easily identified through the use of grammatical features
(like function words, POS tags, and syntactic features). As Natural Language
Processing (NLP) provides methods to retrieve grammatical features, an
investigation of the influence of NLP on automatic genre identification appears
of primary importance. For this reason, we wish to investigate to what extent
NLP can help identify genre in an IR scenario. 

The main aims of the workshop are as follows: 

- To identify the key features that help classify documents by genre, and their
efficiency and effectiveness within an IR framework. 
- To explore how genres can improve search engines, and in particular how it can
be integrated with topic-based retrieval. 
- To bring together researchers working on genre in different communities - such
as Computational Linguistics, NLP, Information Retrieval and Extraction, Text
and Web Mining, or Summarization - in order to investigate the extent to which
NLP can assist or enable automatic genre identification. 

Topics 
The topics of interests include but are not limited to: 

- Computational modeling of genres for web applications; 
- Implementation of genre-based applications for retrieval; 
- The impact of lexis, morphology and syntax on automatic genre identification; 
- Genre-revealing features and their automatic extraction; 
- Genre-driven NLP tools, such as genre-driven taggers, parsers, or discourse
annotation; 
- Genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and no-genre documents; 
- Test collections and evaluation metrics for genre-enabled applications; 
- Clustering and visualization of results based on genre. 

Categories of Papers 
Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: regular paper and poster.
Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time. Regular
papers are full-length papers and must not exceed 8 pages. Posters are submitted
as extended abstracts (MAX 4 pages). If accepted, a poster is presented in the
workshop poster session. Both regular papers and poster papers are included in
the workshop proceedings. 

Submission Instructions 
Format. Authors are invited to submit papers and posters on original and
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers and posters should
be submitted as PDF files, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 stylefiles,
without author name(s) and affiliation(s). Papers and posters should not exceed
the length indicated above. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are available at:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm 

Please, send papers and posters to both MarinaSantini.MS@gmail.com and
georg.rehm@uni-tuebingen.de 

Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by three members of the
Program Committee. Reviewing will be blind. Reviewers will be asked to provide
detailed comments, and to score submissions on the following factors: 

- Relevance to the workshop 
- Significance and originality 
- Technical/methodological accuracy 
- References to related work 
- Presentation (clarity, organization, English) 

Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers (regular papers and posters) will be
published in the workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at least one
of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected
to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration fees. 

Dual submissions to the main RANLP 2007 conference and this workshop are
allowed; if you submit to the main session, please DO indicate this when you
submit to the workshop. If your paper or poster is accepted for the main
session, you should withdraw it from the workshop upon notification by the main
session. 

Registration 
Information on registration and registration fees will be provided at the
conference website.
