Full Title: Academy of Aphasia 

Date: 19-Oct-2008 - 21-Oct-2008
Location: Turku, Finland 
Contact Person: Frances Laven
Meeting Email: contact@academyofaphasia.org
Web Site: http://academyofaphasia.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Neurolinguistics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Academy of Aphasia welcomes submissions of original experimental, clinical, theoretical and historical research from any field that contributes to the study of aphasia (including Speech-Language Pathology, Psychology, Neurology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, History and Computational Modeling) for its 46st Annual Meeting at the Spa Hotel Caribia in Turku, Finland. 

Call for Papers

The Academy of Aphasia encourages submissions for platform papers, poster presentations, proposals for symposia that bring together researchers from different laboratories reporting on a common research theme, and mini-workshops with a methodological emphasis in which a unique approach to a timely topic may be presented by a single research group.  Submissions are accepted from both members and non-members of the Academy of Aphasia and all submissions are given equal consideration.

General Guidelines for Submission:
The annual meeting has both platform and poster sessions. The platform sessions include: Scientific papers (original research that has not yet been published), Symposia (a number of papers from researchers representing different laboratories and focusing on a common theme - these papers may report on previously published research), and Mini-Workshops (a methodologically oriented session including a number of papers that may be from a single research group reporting a unique approach to a timely topic). Poster sessions include scientific papers that can be presented primarily in a visual format. The Academy considers poster sessions to be as scientifically meritorious as platform sessions. Poster sessions will not conflict with platform sessions.

Both members and non-members of the Academy are encouraged to submit papers, symposia and mini-workshops for the annual meeting. Student papers need to be co-authored by a member of the Academy. All submissions will be given equal consideration on the basis of their scientific merit and fitness for the Academy. The Program Committee welcomes all types of experimental and theoretical papers from any field that contributes to the study of language and its disruption, including (but not limited to) linguistics, neurology, psychology, computational modeling, and speech-language pathology.

Attendance at the Conference: The meeting is open to anyone interested in attending. However, meeting space is limited, and Academy of Aphasia members, authors of accepted papers, and the first authors of rejected papers will have preference if space limitations restrict the number of registrants.

Guidelines for Submission: 
The submitted abstract should provide a concise statement of the problem or hypothesis, procedures and analyses conducted, results obtained, and final conclusion drawn. In the case of symposia and mini-workshops, the organizer should submit an abstract summarizing the topic and an abstract for each of the individual presentations (including the names and affiliations of the participants). To help the planning of the program, it is recommended that organizers of symposia and mini-workshops contact the Chair of the Program Committee (Hugh W Buckingham) by email (hbuck@lsu.edu) about their plans no later than March 15 in order to get feedback on organizational issues. More than one abstract may be submitted by an individual, but an individual can be listed as first author on only one submission.

Please Note the Following Guidelines: 
Abstracts may include a maximum of 500 words (including references) as well as one camera-ready figure/table. The abstracts will be printed in Brain and Language, so the text and figure/table should be prepared in accordance with its published the specifications Instructions for authors in Brain and Language (including reference format). They will be published online and on a separate CD. Please submit your abstract electronically to: contact@academyofaphasia.org. Please send all files as attachments, saved in either Microsoft Word or RTF format. Please send two copies of the abstract, one prepared normally and the other with all identifying information removed (for anonymous review). For both versions, please use a one-word filename with the author's last name and initials separated by a period. Use suffix ''1''for the regular version and ''2'' for the anonymous version (e.g., smith.ab.1, smith.ab.2). Charts and graphs should be embedded in the document as a chart or graph.!
  Alternatively, you may mail a disk CD and 8 hard copies of your abstract to: Academy Of Aphasia, Frances Laven, Director, P.O. Box 26532, Minneapolis MN 55426, USA.

Please include the corresponding address at the end of the normally prepared abstract. For each electronic or disk CD submission, please include the information sheet available at:
http://academyofaphasia.angularis.org/Annual_Meeting/2008/AoA_Call.html

The Program committee will notify you of its decision by email, so your email address must be included with the normally prepared abstract. To receive notification by surface mail, a typed label with the corresponding author's address must accompany the abstract. Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will not be reviewed.

Abstracts must be received no later than 12:00 noon Central Standard Daylight Time on Tuesday, April 1, 2008. There will be absolutely no exceptions to this deadline. The Program Committee will review the abstracts anonymously. Selection of papers will be based on scientific merit, on appropriateness for the Academy of Aphasia, on the representation of topics in the program, and on space and time restrictions. Unfortunately, not all papers can be accepted. We will send out notification of the decision by the Program Committee by mid-summer. You will be notified by e-mail; therefore, your e-mail address must accompany each submission.

Sincerely,

Frances Laven, Director of the Academy

Full Title: ESSLLI 2008 Workshop: What Syntax Feeds Semantics? 

Date: 11-Aug-2008 - 15-Aug-2008
Location: Hamburg, Germany 
Contact Person: Maribel Romero
Meeting Email: synsem.esslli08@uni-konstanz.de
Web Site: http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/WhatSyntaxFeedsSemantics.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of this workshop is to investigate on what kind of syntactic
representation semantic interpretation applies. A dominant trend defends
the existence of a covert level of representation, Logical Form (LF) in
Generative Grammar/Minimalism, mediating between surface syntax and the
semantic component. However, many of the original empirical reasons for LF
have been challenged, and, for many phenomena commonly attributed to LF,
alternative accounts exist that derive the semantics from the surface
syntax. Other grammar formalisms -e.g. TAG, HPSG, LFG, CCG- use different
syntactic inputs to arrive at the desired semantic interpretation. The
workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers (including advanced PhD
students) to present and discuss their work with colleagues working on the
same or on different frameworks, in connection with the broad subject areas
represented at ESSLLI. 

Final Call for Papers

- scope and Noun Phrases (NPS): quantificational NPs, plurals, branching quantifier readings, etc.
- scope reconstruction
- connectivity effects (reflected in Binding Theory, NPI-licensing, opacity, etc.)
- scope in degree constructions (comparatives, superlatives, etc.)
- ellipsis (VP-ellipsis, gapping, NP-ellipsis, etc.)
- representation and binding of pronouns
- representation and binding of world/situation variables
- representation and binding of temporal variables

Submission Details:
