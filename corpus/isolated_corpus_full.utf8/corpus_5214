Meeting Description:

Fourth Workshop on Speech in Mobile and Pervasive Environments 
(in conjunction with ACM MobileHCI '09)
Bonn, Germany
http://research.ihost.com/SiMPE

With the proliferation of pervasive devices and the increase in their processing
capabilities, client-side speech processing has been emerging as a viable
alternative. SiMPE 2009, the fourth in the series, will continue to explore
issues, possibilities, and approaches for enabling speech processing as well as
convenient and effective speech and multimodal user interfaces. One of our major
goals for SiMPE 2009 is to increase the participation of speech/multimodal HCI
designers, and increase their interactions with speech processing experts.

Multimodality got more attention in SiMPE 2008 than it has received in the
previous years. In SiMPE 2007, the focus was on developing regions. Given the
importance of speech in developing regions, SiMPE 2008 had SiMPE for developing
regions as a topic of interest. We think of this as a key emerging area for
mobile speech applications, and will continue this in 2009 as well. 

SiMPE is organised in conjunction with ACM MobileHCI 2009.

Call for Papers
 
Topics of Interest:
All areas that enable, optimize or enhance speech in mobile and pervasive
environments and devices. Possible areas include, but are not restricted to:
Speech Interfaces/Applications for Developing Regions
Speech User Interaction in Cars
Multilingual Speech Recognition
Robust Speech Recognition in Noisy and Resource-Constrained Environments
Memory/Energy Efficient Algorithms
Multimodal User Interfaces for Mobile Devices
Protocols and Standards for Speech Applications
Distributed Speech Processing
Mobile Application Adaptation and Learning
Prototypical System Architectures
Design and Usability Testing of Mobile Interfaces
User Modeling

Submissions:
We seek original, unpublished papers in the following three categories: 
(a) Position papers that describe novel ideas that can lead to interesting
research directions, 
(b) Early results or work-in-progress that has significant promise, or, 
(c) Full papers. 
Papers should be of 4-8 pages in length in the MobileHCI publication format. The
LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates are available at the ACM Template site. All
submissions should be in the PDF format and should be submitted electronically
through the workshop submission web site,
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=simpe09. Since the submission
deadlines are dependent on the MobileHCI conference, we will not be able to
grant any extensions in any circumstances.

We also welcome participation without paper submission.

Note: Since the workshop also aims to be a meeting point for researchers working
in this area, at least one author of accepted papers has to attend the workshop
to present their work, else the paper will not be included in the final workshop
proceedings. Participants who wish to attend the workshop will have to register
for the main conference as well.

For any comments regarding submissions and participation, contact: 
namit AT in DOT ibm DOT com, rnitendra AT in DOT ibm DOT com 
andrew DOT kun AT unh DOT com


Seed Questions:
What are the usability issues with speech on mobile devices?
Are there efficient ways of enabling voice search on the device?
How to make voice UIs flexible and adaptive?
Are there any novel and easier ways to handle multiple languages and dialects?
How do we construct speech systems with small footprints of memory and power
consumption?
How can we distribute processing more efficiently given the increased available
computing power on handhelds? How do we trade this off with a remote server to
conserve energy?
How can we design scalable speech applications?
How can we leverage context (such as location) to make more intelligent UIs that
reduce the `cognitive burden' of semi-literate/illiterate users?
How to design speech interfaces that are safe and robust for using in cars?


Key Dates:
Position Paper Submission Deadline: May 18, 2009 (11:59 PM Amsterdam Time)
Notification of Acceptance: June 08, 2009
Early Registration Deadline: June 29, 2009,
Workshop: 8:45AM -- 5:00PM, September 15, 2009.
