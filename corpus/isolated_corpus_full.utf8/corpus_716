The workshop is a follow-up of the GLDV GermaNet Workshops
2003 and 2005 and the DGfS 2006 Workshop "Lexical-Semantic
Resources for Language Documentation and Language Processing".


Workshop Description
--------------------

Lexical-semantic and ontological resources are of fundamental
importance for many applications within the areas of Natural
Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, and the
Semantic Web. Semantic lexicons and wordnets usually have
large coverage with respect to general vocabulary and are
therefore well-suited to NLP-tasks such as semantic labeling
and lexical chaining. Ontologies, on the other hand, oftenlack 
significant coverage or are restricted to special
domains; moreover, they are typically more formalized and
thus suitable for inference techniques.

Various initiatives have been launched to convert semantic
resources of the WordNet and FrameNet family to W3C standard
representation languages such as RDF/OWL in order to make
them more easily accessible to the Semantic Web community.
Other approaches like the OntoWordNet project aim at the
more demanding goal to fully axiomatize the semantic content
of lexical-semantic resources.

The workshop is intended as a forum to discuss possible
interactions between lexical-semantic and ontological
resources as well as their design, construction, extension,
maintenance, validation, and application. Contributions
addressing the following topics are particularly welcome:

* Interfaces (alignments, mappings) between lexical-semantic
  and ontological resources.

* Ontological enrichment of semantic resources, such as
  linking wordnets with existing upper or mid-level ontologies
  like SUMO, MILO, DOLCE, etc.

* Meta-data approaches and standardization efforts for
  integrating different semantic and ontological resources.

* Domain-specific extensions of lexical-semantic resources.

* Automatic acquisition and extension of lexical-semantic
  and ontological resources by corpus-based methods or by
  exploiting other machine-readable knowledge sources.

* Issues of multi- and interlinguality of lexical-semantic
  and ontological resources.

* Tools and techniques for maintaining lexical-semantic
  resources and ontologies (e.g. graphical user interfaces,
  visualization tools, database techniques).

* Applications of semantic lexicons and ontologies in all
  sorts of NLP-based information systems, especially with
  respect to evaluating the impact of these resources.
