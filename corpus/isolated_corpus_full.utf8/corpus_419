The Computing Department, Macquarie University are offering one Australia
Postgraduate Awards (Industry) Scholarship (APAI). The Australia
Taxation Office (ATO) and Macquarie University have gained funding unde
the ARC Linkage Projects (LP0561985) to support a research program fo
the optimisation of tax collections by improving the prediction an
classification of taxpayer debt payment risk

Predictive models for financial distress and insolvency risk will b
developed in this project. These models will be used to contribute to th
understanding taxpayers; circumstances and the choice of appropriat
collection actions. The successful applicant (PhD student) will conduc
research in Macquarie's Intelligent Systems Group and collaborate wit
the Analytics team in the Office of the Chief Knowledge Officer at th
