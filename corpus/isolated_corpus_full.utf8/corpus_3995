Approaching Constraints in Linguistics and Literature
Sponsor: Department of French and Italian Graduate Student Organization

Keynote Speakers:
French Literature: David Bellos, Princeton University 
Italian Literature: Laura Benedetti, Georgetown University

Round Table with Prof. Bellos, Prof. Douglas Hofstadter (Indiana University),

Deadline for abstracts: Jan. 10, 2009

This graduate student conference will address the notion of constraints in
French and Italian from the perspectives of literature and language, or both.
The issue of constraints occurs frequently in the study of language and
literature. Constraints are either forced by an exterior factor, or used as a
motor for creativity. Their nature is variable: they may be cognitive (what can
be processed, what is merely dispreferred), formal (restrictions on shape,
narrative composition, poetic verse), social (what can be said depending on the
context, what relationships are possible among individuals), methodological (how
can certain things be studied, how analyses can be unbiased; how "typical" are
certain features in linguistic corpora or works of an author, how can literature
be neatly classified into genres), epistemological (what people can know, what
characters can know), and more. Constraints may be implicit and inaccessible to
conscious thought, or they may be explicit and prescriptive, encoded in rules of
etiquette, social mores, and family matters. Their relative strength is an open
question: which constraints may be violated, and which constraints must a
writer, reader, or speaker obey? There are inevitably a number of constraints
operating in any system, social or otherwise, so what happens when two or more
of them come into conflict?

All abstracts or questions about the conference should be sent, in Italian,
French, or English, to cstrobbe@indiana.edu (for French Literature),
siegeljf@indiana.edu (for French Linguistics), rgalli@indiana.edu (for Italian
Literature). Authors will receive notice by February 1, 2009. Students may
submit up to one single-authored and one co-authored paper. Information about
travel and lodging will be provided after acceptance of the abstract.

This conference is made possible thanks to generous support from the French and
Italian Department, the Mary-Margaret Barr Koon Fund, the Lilly Library, and the
Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition, all at Indiana University.

Linguistics:
