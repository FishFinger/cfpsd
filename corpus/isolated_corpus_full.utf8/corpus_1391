Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes of
evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and evaluation for internal purposes.

Grammar Engineering across Frameworks 
July 13-15, 2007
Stanford, California, USA
http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF07.html

This workshop is part of the 2007 LSA Summer Institute. (But note that workshop
attendees do not have to register for the Institute.)

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to support
robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world domains and
applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in significant
advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic
approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The
effective development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a central
issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars forces
these processes to be tackled in ways that have much in common with software
engineering.  This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from
different frameworks to compare their
research and methodologies.

Panel Discussion on Evaluation: How can we develop evaluation
methodologies and metrics which can capture the added benefits of deep
linguistic analysis?

Mary Dalrymple, Oxford University (moderator)
Roger Levy, University of California, San Diego
Stephan Oepen, University of Oslo
Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder

Paper Topics:
The workshop is soliciting submissions for papers on the following
themes:

 1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages

 2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks on promoting or inhibiting modularity

 3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multideveloper
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis

 4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on
 how to present grammar engineering work to other research communities.

 5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars

of machine learning to natural language processing. The topics of interest
include (but are not limited to):

- ML applied to various NLP tasks (syntax and semantics)
- Supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques for NLP
- Language acquisition
- Information extraction
- Relational learning
- Ontology learning and enrichment
- Learning with the background knowledge

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit

information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns
