SIGIR 2007:  Call for Tutorials and Call for Workshops

    The 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on
      Research and Development in Information Retrieval
         23-27 July 2007, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                  http://www.sigir2007.org

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new 
research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques
in the broad field of information retrieval (IR).

*CALL FOR TUTORIALS*

SIGIR 2007 will begin with a full day of tutorials on July 23, 2007.

Proposals are solicited for tutorials of either a half-day (3 hours plus 
breaks) or full day (6 hours plus breaks) on all topics of information 
retrieval and its applications. Especially encouraged are (1) cross-
disciplinary tutorials that educate the IR community about recent 
technical advancements in related fields (e.g., machine learning, 
natural language processing, data mining); (2) tutorials about emerging 
application areas of information retrieval technologies (e.g., Web, 
bioinformatics).

Submissions should include a cover sheet and an extended abstract. The 
cover sheet should specify: (1) the title and length of the tutorial; 
(2) the intended audience (introductory, intermediate, advanced);
(3) complete contact information for the contact person and other 
presenters; and (4) a brief biography (max. 2 paragraphs) for each 
presenter. The extended abstract should be 3 to 4 pages, and should 
include an outline of the tutorial, along with descriptions of the 
course objectives, its relevance to the IR community, and course 
materials.

Tutorial proposals in PDF format must be sent via email by February 25,
2007 to the Tutorial Chair, ChengXiang Zhai (czhai AT cs.uiuc.edu). 
The submissions will undergo peer review and be decided by the Program 
Committee. Notifications will be made by April 11, 2007.

*CALL FOR WORKSHOPS*

SIGIR 2007 will end with a full day of workshops on July 27, 2007.

Proposals are solicited for one-day or half-day workshops to be held 
on July 27, 2007, the last day of the conference. The purpose of SIGIR 
workshops is to provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less 
formal and possibly more focused way than the conference itself. As 
such, they also offer a good opportunity for young researchers to 
present their work and to obtain feedback from an interested community. 
The format of each workshop is to be determined by the organizers, but 
it is expected that they contain ample time for general discussion.

Researchers and practitioners from all segments of the information 
retrieval community are invited to submit proposals for review. The 
organizers of approved workshops are expected to define the workshop's 
focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon final program 
content. Organizers (including co-organizers) are expected to attend 
their entire workshop and to provide an article for the SIGIR Forum 
summarizing the event.

Submissions describing proposed workshops (up to 1,000 words) should 
include the theme and goals of the workshop, planned activities, the 
maximum number of participants, the selection process for participants 
and names of potential program committee members (if a program 
committee will be formed). The submission should include a one-paragraph 
biographical sketch for each organizer, describing relevant 
qualifications and experience.

Workshop proposals must be sent by email to the Workshops Chair, 
Josiane Mothe (mothe AT irit.fr) by February 25, 2007.

*IMPORANT DATES*

January 28, 2007:  Full research papers due
February 25, 2007: Poster, demonstration, tutorial, and workshop submissions
March 11, 2007:    Doctoral consortium submissions due
