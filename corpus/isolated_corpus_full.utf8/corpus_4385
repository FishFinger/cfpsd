Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE IN SOCIETY     
University of Cambridge, United Kingdom     
5-7 August 2009     
http://www.ScienceInSocietyConference.com     

Key themes addressed by the Conference include the social impacts of science, the values and ethics of science, the pedagogies of science, the knowledge making processes of science, the politics of science and the economics of science. At first glance, the scope and concerns of the Conference are enormous. However, in contrast to conferences with a specialist disciplinary focus, this Conference aims to explore in an interdisciplinary spirit linkages between different areas of concern and practices of investigation. We welcome presentation proposals which range from broad explorations of philosophical, theoretical, methodological and policy questions, to proposals which present finely grained evidence of the connections of science to society in microcosms of research, teaching and practice.

As well an impressive international line-up of main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Science in Society. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the Conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 19 February 2009. Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.ScienceInSocietyConference.com

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Cambridge in August 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Homer Stavely     
Professor of Psychology Emeritus     
Keene State College     
Keene, New Hampshire, USA     
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Science in Society and International Journal of Science in Society
