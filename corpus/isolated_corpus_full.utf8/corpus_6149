Meeting Description:

4th  International Conference on Late Modern English
27 - 29 May 2010
School of English, University of Sheffield

The University of Sheffield will be hosting the Fourth International Conference
on Late Modern English 27 - 29 May 2010.  This follows on from three very
successful conferences on Late Modern English, the first in Edinburgh in 2001,
the second in Vigo in 2004 and the third in Leiden in 2007. 

Call for Papers

We invite scholars interested in any aspect of the history of the English
language during the Late Modern period to submit abstracts for papers. The theme
of the 2010 conference will be 'Late Modern English in Context'.  We are
therefore particularly interested in papers which take an interdisciplinary
approach, for example, by considering Late Modern English in relation to
literature, journalism, history, politics, or science; Late Modern English in
non-English speaking countries or in relation to other languages; Late Modern
English and identity.

Plenary speakers will be:  
Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade (University of Leiden)
Bob Shoemaker (University of Sheffield, Department of History)

The deadline for submission of abstracts is 15 November 2009. Notification of
acceptance will occur by mid-January 2010.

Abstract format: maximum length 1 page A4, using Times New Roman font no smaller
than 12 point, including references.  Please send the abstract in WORD to
4LModE@sheffield.ac.uk.   Send one version with your name and affiliation
appearing below the title (name the WORD file: yourname4LModE), and one version
without name and affiliation (name this: anon4LModE). 
Deadline: 15 November 2009.
