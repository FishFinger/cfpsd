Meeting Description:

The aim of this workshop is to draw up an inventory, combine, and discuss
effects of word order, case and prominence in the production and comprehension
of argument structure in languages of the world. 

To build up a meaningful construction language users have several sources of
information at their disposal, including grammatical rules, situational
knowledge, and general world knowledge. More particularly, verbs come with their
own argument structure, which establishes the syntactic and semantic
relationships between arguments, representing the participant(s) of the
eventuality expressed by the verb. Since the pioneering work of Fillmore's Case
Grammar (1968) several approaches have been developed addressing the
relationship between cases, grammatical relations, and semantic roles. More
recently, a combination of different decompositional views was proposed by
Primus (1999, 2006) taking into account the relation between case-marking and
the degree of involvement of a participant in the event, as well as the
correlation between structural syntactic relations with role semantics.
Meanwhile, psycholinguistic research has shown that in different languages,
factors such as case morphology, word order and semantic prominence features of
arguments may play a different role in the production and comprehension process
of argument structure (Bornkessel & Schlesewsky, 2006; de Hoop & Lamers, 2006).
The aim of this workshop is to draw up an inventory, combine, and discuss
effects of these factors in the production and comprehension of argument
structure in languages of the world. In particular, we seek to enhance the link
between theoretical and experimental findings. We therefore encourage
contributions that address the role of different sorts of information in
argument structure from a theoretical, a time-insensitive, or an incremental
perspective, or a combination of these. 

Invited Speakers:

- Ina Bornkessel
- Beatrice Primus
- Matthias Schlesewsky
- Peter de Swart

Abstracts should be anonymous and no longer than two pages, including references
