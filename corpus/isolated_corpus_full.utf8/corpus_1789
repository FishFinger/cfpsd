Meeting Description

Cognitive and Functional Perspectives on Dynamic Tendencies in Languages

Description

The aim of the conference is to bring together linguists working in the
functional and cognitive linguistic paradigms. We invite linguists who take a
functional and/or cognitive perspective in describing and explaining linguistic
phenomena in the language(s) they are researching and those working on language
dynamics from a functional or cognitive perspective to participate.
We especially encourage linguists working on the Uralic languages to submit
papers, in the hope of expanding the Cognitive Linguistic paradigm with data
from these languages; researchers involved with other languages and language
families are, of course, also most welcome. We also encourage papers on
grammaticalization and those looking at the role of oral and written forms, or
different language varieties, in language change, as well as changes in grammar
resulting from language contact. Furthermore, presentations dealing with
different usage-based models, including construction grammar, are also welcome.

Keywords

cognitive and functional studies on grammar
grammaticalization
dynamics of language
synchronic and diachronic language change
language contact: aspects of grammar
usage-based approaches and models
emergent grammar
language typology
language evolution
Uralic languages
