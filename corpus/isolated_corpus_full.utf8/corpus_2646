Norms in Educational Linguistics - Linguistic, Didactic and Cultural Perspectives

University of Giessen
International Graduate Centre for the Study of Culture (GCSC)
1-2 September 2008

In this first international Symposium for Young Researchers on Educational
Linguistics, we aim to discuss the concept of norms from different perspectives
before the backdrop of current and innovative research concepts in linguistics,
language teaching and the study of culture. Norms and the related question of
standards play a major role in the interplay of language, culture, society and
education. The goal of this symposium is to describe, analyse and discuss the
concept of norms on the basis of three topic areas:

- Language Policy as a Reflection of Cultural Norms
- Norm, Standard, Deviation
- Target Norms in Foreign-Language Teaching

In each of the blocks, three young researchers from different academic
backgrounds present their viewpoint on the concept of norms in a 15-minute
position paper. There follows a plenary discussion about how the combination of
theories and methods used in linguistics, teacher training and the study of
culture can foster innovative research projects in Educational Linguistics. Each
topic area is then rounded off by a plenary lecture from an internationally
renowned scholar. The symposium closes with a panel discussion among the keynote
speakers and associates of the Educational Linguistics research network at the
University of Giessen.

Further current research projects from these and all other areas of Educational
Linguistics can be presented as part of a poster session.

Two keynote speakers have already accepted our invitation:

- Prof. Frank Königs (Marburg)
- Prof. Bernard Spolsky (Ramat Gan)

The conference languages are English and German.

Please submit your abstract in English or German on our website: 
http://www.uni-giessen.de/nel08. The deadline is 15 April 2008.

Call Deadline: 24-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

A considerable amount of research has been done on the processing of
Indonesian and Malaysian languages offering a variety of Computational
Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources
(dictionaries, thesauri, monolingual/parallel corpora, etc.), tools
(morphological analysers/generators, stemmers, spelling checkers, syntactic
parsers, etc.) and applications (machine translation, information extraction,
information retrieval systems,etc.). All these valuable language resources,
tools, and services are most of the time ignored by the public and often not
known by the researchers and students working on these languages. This second
MALINDO Workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners,
representing different perspectives, to share and to exchange their ideas on the
processing of Indonesian and Malaysian languages. Thus, the organisers of the
workshop wants to highlight the effort and promising works done on the
processing of Indonesian and Malaysian languages in order to attract more
students to the CL and NLP fields and also to let all the NLP communities in
this World to be aware of their existence.
