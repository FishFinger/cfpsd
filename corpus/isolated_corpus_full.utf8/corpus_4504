		    Fourth Workshop of the HCSNet

	   Next-Generation Search Technology Priority Area

	 http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/priorityareas/nextgensearch


Date:	   16-17 April 2009
Location:  Jembi-Rinjah Eco-Lodge, Blue Mountains, NSW

Contact:   Diego Molla,	Diego.Molla-Aliod@mq.edu.au

CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST AND ABSTRACTS


Search for information is an ever increasingly important and complex
task. The first retrieval systems effectively treated documents as
bags of words, and this is still the main approach in current
systems. Yet the human processing of information makes use of a much
deeper understanding of text than these systems exhibit. Is there a
way to combine the computing power of machines with the sophisticated
processing of humans? In addition, there has been an explosion of
information available digitally in a wide range of media including
audio and video. How can we extend current technology to find
information in all available media?

This workshop is fourth in a series that aims to strengthen
collaboration among researchers and developers in all areas related to
search technology. In this last year of HCSNet funding support, we
would like to place the emphasis in this workshop on 'where next?'.
Accordingly, the event will take place in a secluded location in the
Blue Mountains, providing scope for uninterrupted discussions and
contemplation.  We particularly welcome submissions which sketch
personal views of where research in search should go in the coming
years, and how interdisciplinary approaches to research might
encourage developments.

The workshop will run from the afternoon of the first day to noon of
the second day, and there will be evening activities to complement the
day presentations.


AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to gather people from all areas of
research, development and industry. We welcome people from academia
and industry with interest in any area related to innovative methods
for search, including but not limited to the following:

    * Cognitive Science
    * Natural language Processing and Language Technology
    * Information Retrieval
    * Human-computer Interaction
    * Data Mining
    * Formal Syntax and Morphology
    * Formal Semantics
    * Conversational and Discourse Analysis
    * Philosophy of Language 


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will consist of a number of presentations during the day
and special activities during the evening. The day presentations will
be:

    * 20-minute presentations that describe a new project or specific
      idea to be shared with the community, with the aim of fomenting
      discussion; and

    * 2-minute poster boosters for those bringing a poster.

As evening activities we envisage group activities and discussion
sessions.

SUBMISSIONS

We plan to bundle accommodation and venue and we need an accurate
estimate of the number of people who plan to attend. We therefore ask
those interested in participating to email diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au
indicating the names of people who plan to attend BY MONDAY 2 MARCH
FEBRUARY.

In addition, submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length and a
paragraph with research interests BY THURSDAY 5 MARCH. Please send the
submissions by using the submission form at the workshop webpage (link
at the top of this call).


FUNDING

HCSNet will fund accommodation and train fare from Sydney to
BlackHeath for all participants. In addition, HCSNet fill fund $300
towards the cost of the air ticket for a number of participants from
outside the Sydney area. The provision of a submission as described
above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants can be
covered, funding grants may be allocated based on the relevance of
your abstract to the workshop theme; also, students and early career
researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in
the last fifteen years) will have priority.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, membership of
HCSNet and registration for this workshop are required in advance of
the event.

Since we intend to book out the entire lodge, it is possible that
there may be space available for family and friends; if you are
interested in this possibility please let the organisers know as soon
as possible. Note that accommodation and travel costs for those who
are not taking part in the workshop cannot be covered.
