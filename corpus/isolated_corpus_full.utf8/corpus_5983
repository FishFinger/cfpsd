Full Title: 5th International Symposium on Politeness=20

Location: Basel, Switzerland=20
Contact Person: Miriam Locher
Meeting Email: miriam.locher@unibas.ch

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2009=20

Meeting Description:

The aim of this panel is to bring together scholars of varied disciplines t=
o explore the interconnections between face and identity in on/off line sit=
uations.

The studies of face and identity have formed the cornerstones of im-politen=
ess theories and modern sociological thought respectively. However, despite=
 their obvious conceptual proximity, little consideration has been given to=
 the interrelation between face and identity (Spencer-Oatey 2007), at least=
 within those approaches to the study of im-politeness phenomena derived fr=
om Brown and Levinson's (1987) formative model (but see the work of scholar=
s working within the North American School of Communication studies, among =
others Ting-Toomey and Kurogi 2005; Domenici and Littlejohn 2006).=20

However, the field of politeness research has of late experienced a shift t=
owards discursive (Eelen 2001; Mills 2003; Watts 2003; Locher and Watts 200=
5) and face-constituting (Arundale 1999, 2006) approaches which allow for a=
 dynamic construction of im-politeness while delving into the relationship =
between im-politeness and appropriate or politic behavior (Watts 2003; Loch=
er and Watts 2005) in specific contexts.=20

The emphasis on im-politeness as a social, discursive phenomenon has led sc=
holars (see Lambert-Graham 2007; Spencer-Oatey 2007; Locher 2008; Garces-Co=
nejos Blitvich 2009, among others) to look for alternative ways to conceptu=
alize and describe im-politeness. Identity theory (Joseph 2004; Bucholtz an=
d Hall 2005; de Fina et al 2006; Benwell and Stokoe 2006) presents itself a=
s a useful, alternative analytical tool.=20

Call for Papers:

This panel aims to further this discussion by including original papers tha=
t bring together notions of face and identity and apply them to the analysi=
s of situated im-politeness.

Paper proposals dealing with, but not limited to, the following topics are =
welcome:
=20
-Face and identity in web 2.0 sites
-Face and identity in traditional media
-Face and identity in professional settings
-Face, identity and gender
-Face, identity and bilingualism

Those scholars interested in contributing a paper to this panel are kindly =
requested to send a 400 word abstract to Pilar Garces Blitvich (pgblitvi@un=
cc.edu) by October 15th, 2009.=20
