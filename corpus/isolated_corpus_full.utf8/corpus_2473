2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

Second IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing =

IEEE ICSC2008  =

August 4th-7th,  2008, Santa Clara, CA, USA
http://icsc.eecs.uci.edu/

Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society

The field of Semantic Computing (SC) brings together those disci-
plines concerned with connecting the  (often  vaguely-formulated)
intentions  of humans with computational content. This connection
can go both ways: retrieving,  using  and  manipulating  existing
content according to user's goals ("do what the user means"); and
creating, rearranging, and managing content that matches the  au-
thor's intentions ("do what the author means").

The  content  addressed  in  SC  includes, but is not limited to,
structured and semi-structured data, multimedia data, text,  pro-
grams, services and, even, network behavior.  This connection be-
tween content and the user is made  via  (1)  Semantic  Analysis,
which  analyzes content with the goal of converting it to meaning
(semantics); (2) Semantic Integration, which  integrates  content
and  semantics  from multiple sources; (3) Semantic Applications,
which utilize content and semantics to solve  problems;  and  (4)
Semantic Interfaces, which attempt to interpret users' intentions
expressed in natural language or other communicative forms.

Example areas of SC include (but, again, are not limited to) the
following:

ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF CONTENT
 Natural-language processing
 Image and video analysis
 Audio and speech analysis
 Analysis of structured and semi-structured data
 Analysis of behavior of software, services, and networks

INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS
 Database schema integration
 Ontology integration
 Interoperability and Service Integration

SEMANTIC INTERFACES
 Natural-Language Interface
 Multimodal Interfaces

APPLICATIONS
 Semantic Web and other search technologies
 Question answering
 Semantic Web services
 Multimedia databases
 Engineering of software, services, and networks based on
   natural-language specifications
 Context-aware networks of sensors, devices, and/or applications

The second IEEE International Conference  on  Semantic  Computing
(ICSC2008)  builds on the success of ICSC2007 as an international
interdisciplinary forum  for  researchers  and  practitioners  to
present  research that advances the state of the art and practice
of Semantic Computing, as well as identifying  the  emerging  re-
search topics and defining the future of Semantic Computing.  The
conference particularly welcomes interdisciplinary research  that
facilitates the ultimate success of Semantic Computing.

The  event  is  located  in Santa Clara, California, the heart of
Silicon Valley.  The technical program of ICSC2008 includes tuto-
rials,  workshops, invited talks, paper presentations, panel dis-
cussions, demo sessions, and an industry track.   Submissions  of
high-quality  papers  describing  mature results or on-going work
are invited.

In addition to Technical Papers, the conference will feature
    * Tutorials,
    * Workshops,
    * Demo Sessions,
    * Special Sessions,
    * Panels,
    * and an Industry Track.

Please  refer  to the conference website for further information:

SUBMISSIONS =

Authors are invited to submit an 8-page technical paper manuscript
in double-column IEEE format following the guidelines available on the
ICSC2008 web page under "submissions".

The Conference Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society Press.  Distinguished quality papers presented at the con-
ference will be selected for publications in internationally renowned
journals.

There will be a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award for
the best submitted paper and the best submitted student paper. The
award winners will be announced at the conference banquet.
