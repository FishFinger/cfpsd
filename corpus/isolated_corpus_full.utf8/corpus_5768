Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics 

Call Deadline: 10-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Ultrafest meetings bring together researchers from around the world working on the use of ultrasound imaging to understand the complexity of tongue motion in speech production. Building on the success of the previous 4 meetings, this conference, at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, will address several themes:

1. Results on linguistic patterning of tongue motion
2. Methods of quantification of tongue shape and motion
3. Comparison of tongue images from ultrasound and MRI
4. Computational physical models of tongue motion
5. Tongue motion developments through the life span and in various dysfluencies

Two days will be devoted to presentations. A half-day session (19 March 2010) prior to the main meeting will be a hands-on introduction to several systems for ultrasound imaging of the tongue, allowing a direct comparison for those considering a new system or for those interested in evaluating their current system. 

Call for Papers:

Ultrafest V, the 5th meeting of researchers interested in using ultrasound for linguistic investigation, invites abstracts for presentations at our meeting in New Haven, CT. There are two parts to the meeting: a hands-on session to demonstrate ultrasound machines and ancillary equipment on Friday, March 19th, 2010, and a general session, March 20-21, 2010, which will consist primarily of presentations on technical issues of ultrasound measurement and theoretical papers based on results from ultrasound. Two invited speakers will also be presenting (see names and titles below).  There is, in addition, a targeted session on comparisons of ultrasound and MRI techniques, which is also open to contributed papers.  

As previously announced, the deadline for submission of abstracts is Sept. 10th, 2009.  Presentations will be 20 minutes long.  You can only be first author on one submission.  Abstracts should be 500 words or less and submitted in PDF format. Notifications will be made by Oct. 9th.  Please email abstracts to: ultrafest@haskins.yale.edu

If you would also like to demonstrate your system in Friday's hands-on session, please let us know what the system is and how much space you would require.

Vendor spaces are also available.  Commercial providers are encouraged to contact us at ultrafest@haskins.yale.edu.

Invited Speakers:

Yoram Yekutieli, Hadassah Academic College and Weizmann Institute of Science: ''Biomechanics and Control of the Octopus Arm''
Hemant Tagare, Yale University School of Medicine:  ''Finding Anatomical Structures in Ultrasound Images''
