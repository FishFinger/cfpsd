March 26-27, 2009
The School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, University of Maryland,
College Park announces the Seventh Annual SLLS Graduate Student Forum. 

Call for Papers

"Although the world is not perfect, it is yet the best that is possible."
Centuries have passed since Leibniz made this much debated statement, but the
discourse on optimism and the role it plays in our daily lives remains just as
relevant.  Numerous academic fields ranging from literature to psychology,
visual arts, and gender studies have examined the effects of optimism on the
Self.  Even at the global level, there has been an analysis of the consequences
of trust and optimism on foreign and domestic policy. Conversely, the value of a
literary work with an optimistic outlook is often questioned, and a jaded
Weltanschauung has become a trait and catalyst of intellectualism.  The
questions surrounding the function and character of optimism are more prevalent
than ever.  What role does optimism play in today's culture?  What was its role
in the past?  Can it sway politics or society?  How does it affect the
individual?  Is a happy ending necessarily a characteristic of kitsch?  How have
various cultures perceived and represented optimism across the centuries? To
what extent can optimism deceive, placate or desensitize?  
With these and many other questions in mind the graduate students of the School
of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the University of Maryland cordially
invite the submission of papers from all disciplines that analyze possible
"Reflections on Optimism".  Topics include but are not limited to:

Crisis and Optimism
Utopia
Escapism and Elsewhere
Staging Hope and Despair
Freewill vs. Determinism
The Language of Optimism
Rebirth, Reconstruction, Resilience and Healing
Identity, Gender, Sexuality
Religion and Hope/Religion and Optimism

Abstracts are encouraged from all fields and all papers should be in English. 
Please submit a 250 word abstract by December 20, 2008 to:
SLLC Graduate Student Forum

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

Workshop Aims:
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from around the
world who have worked on pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds in the different
areas mentioned above in order to share expertise in different methodologies and
theoretical approaches to the study of these sounds and attempt to answer
various outstanding questions regarding:

1. Language universals: why are pharyngeal sounds present in only 1% of
languages surveyed in the UPSID data base when they are present in children's
early vocalizations? How have these sounds evolved in languages that have lost
the pharyngeal distinctions? Is there a relationship between a dense consonantal
system and the existence of pharyngeal/pharyngealised sounds in a language?

2. Production and perception: what are the acoustic, articulatory, and
perceptual correlates of pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds? What role do
visual cues (e.g. lip rounding) play in processing pharyngeal articulations?

3. The sociolinguistic indices of pharyngeal/pharyngealised articulations: How
does pharyngealisation manifest itself in different languages/dialects? Is the
gender-correlated patterning that has been documented in urban areas in the Arab
world with respect to de-emphasis found in other varieties/languages with
pharyngeal/pharyngealised articulations? How are pharyngeal articulations
affected in language contact situations?

4. Acquisition: at what age are pharyngeal and pharyngealised sounds acquired
and what are the developmental manifestations across languages and/or dialects?
