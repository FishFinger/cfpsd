Full Title: Unsupervised and Minimally Supervised Learning of Lexical Semantics 

Date: 05-Jun-2009 - 05-Jun-2009
Location: Boulder, Colorado, USA 
Contact Person: Suresh Manandhar
Meeting Email: suresh@cs.york.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/lls-workshop 

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

Unsupervised and Minimally Supervised Learning of Lexical Semantics - is a
workshop being held in conjunction with NAACL-HLT 2009 in Boulder, Colorado. 

Call for Papers 

Submission deadline: March 15, 2009

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working in topics
related to the unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of the semantics
of lexical items. These include learning of word meanings, learning of lexical
relationships (e.g. hyponym, meronym, antonym learning), learning of idiomatic
and multi-word expressions, learning of bilingual lexicons etc.

Each of these topics has so far been covered in diverse venues eg. WordNet
conferences, SemEval, EMNLP etc. but has lacked a focused venue that brings
together the issues and methods relevant to lexical semantics within a single
venue. In the past few years there has been a surge of interest in unsupervised
and minimally supervised methods in natural language processing. The proposed
workshop will help focus on methods that are suitable in learning of lexical
semantics.

The workshop format would help speedup development in this area as it will make
it accessible to both experienced researchers and new PhD graduates working in
the field. Another purpose of the workshop will be to make available the
workshop proceedings that should serve as a review of the current
state-of-the-art in the field.

The scope of the workshop will be limited to topics that cover unsupervised and
minimally supervised methods relevant to learning of lexical semantics. The
following is a list of potential topics:

- representation, feature selection and parameter tuning for representing word
meanings e.g. bag-of-words context window, syntactic dependency (e.g.
verb-direct object), methods for feature selection (e.g. log likelihood vs
mutual information), issues dealing with sense conflation, measures of
similarity (e.g. distributional similarity), smoothing techniques

- unsupervised and minimally supervised induction of word senses including
senses of both single word and multi-word lexical items e.g. uniform methods for
both single and multi-word lexical items, methods for detecting near synonyms,
issues focussing on minimising manual parameter tuning

- unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of lexical relations e.g.
learning of hyponomy, antonomy, noun-adjective, meronomy relations

- unsupervised and minimally supervised learning of bilingual lexicon e.g.
bootstrapping methods for extending a small bilingual lexicon, use of cognates
in unsupervised bilingual lexicon extraction.

Important Dates
- Submission deadline: March 15, 2009
- Notification of acceptance: April 5, 2009
- Camera-ready papers due: April 12, 2009
-  Workshop: June 05, 2009

Submission Guidelines
Papers will be accepted on or before 15 March in PDF or Postscript formats.
Details of the electronic submission mechanism will be made available via the
workshop website located at http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/lls-workshop. Submissions
should follow the NAACL HLT 2009 length and formatting requirements for full
papers of eight (8) pages of content with one (1) extra page for references,
found at http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html.
