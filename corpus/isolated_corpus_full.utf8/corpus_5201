Meeting Description:

The aim of the conference is to pursue dialogue between applied linguists and 
theoreticians about methodological issues in linguistic education. In the era 
of globalization, when political and administrative borders in the educational 
sphere are brought down, issues of international and intercultural 
communication in different professional areas become even more acute. There is 
a growing demand to increase the efficiency of higher learning educational 
programs called upon to enhance the second or foreign language communicative 
competence of would-be specialists. Yet it is no secret that the existing 
methods of teaching a foreign or second language are far from being 
satisfactory in terms of expected efficiency. This is symptomatic of a general 
methodological problem: we lack holistic understanding of how natural language 
shapes the cognitive domain of human interactions. The conference aims to 
contribute to the ongoing discussion of the problem in the cognitive/linguistic 
community.

Venue Description:
The City of Irkutsk is a major cultural and educational center in Eastern 
Siberia. Founded in 1661 at the junction of two rivers, the Irkut and the 
Angara, it has a rich history and boasts a unique combination of old wooden and 
modern architecture, numerous museums, picturesque landmarks, and, above all, 
is a gateway to one of the greatest wonders of the world - Lake Baikal.

Conference events will include: conference dinner, excursions about the city 
and to an architecture and ethnography museum in the settlement of Taltsy by 
the River Angara. After the conference, on  20 June: a one-day train trip on 
the scenic Circum-Baikal Railroad that will give you a load of unforgettable 
memories.
