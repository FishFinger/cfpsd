Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 28-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

The COLING 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for demonstrations.  This forum will allow developers of implemented software systems and libraries the opportunity to describe the design, development and functionality of their work in an interactive setting. It is also an opportunity to gain feedback from users and exchange ideas. 

Call for Papers

COLING 2008 First Call For Demonstrations
The 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics
8th-22nd August 2008
Manchester, UK
http://www.coling2008.org.uk/
                     
Submission Deadline: April 28, 2008

The committee encourages submission of early or experimental prototypes but will also consider mature systems, particularly those with novel or experimental features.

Demonstration Chairs: 
Allan Ramsay (University of Manchester) and Kalina Bontcheva
(Sheffield University)

Areas of Interest

We encourage proposals for the interactive presentation of software systems and libraries related to any area of computational linguistics.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
- pragmatics, semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon;
- lexical semantics and ontologies;
- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;
- parsing, generation and summarization;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- language models, spoken language recognition and understanding;
- linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, question answering, information extraction and text mining;
- machine learning for natural language;
- corpus-based modelling of language, discourse and dialogue;
- multilingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;
- multimodal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- applications, tools and language resources;
- system evaluation. 

Demonstration Sessions

Each demo will be allocated a session which will overlap a morning/afternoon tea or lunch break for maximum exposure. The interactive presentations will be setup in a room with a (220 volt UK) power supply, computer screen for each presentation and a cluster of chairs.

This environment will allow for presenters to communicate with many people at once but still encourage interactive engagement in the presentation. Questions and comments should be strongly encouraged during the presentation.

Presenters will be expected to provide their own laptops and/or other hardware unless otherwise arranged with the demonstration chairs when it is absolutely necessary.

We cannot confirm internet access will be available at this point.

Format for Submission

Demonstration proposals must consist of a detailed 4 page description of the system or library being presented, and a (maximum) two page script of the demonstration itself.

System/Library description (4 pages)

The system or library description will be included in a companion volume to the COLING 2008 proceedings. It should be typeset using the standard COLING 2008 guidelines including the title, authors, contact information, references and acknowledgements.

The 4 pages should describe the purpose, functionality and applications of the system or library. It should also contain information about the design, implementation, testing and evaluation of system. The description should also compare the work to existing work and highlight the novel functionality/techniques of the system/library.

Demonstration script (2 pages)

The presentation script will not appear with the system description in the companion proceedings.

The presentation script should describe the aim of the presentation, a narrative or script of the presentation itself and a description of any other visual aids to be used during the presentation: live demos, websites, screenshots, diagrams etc. It should also describe how the audience will be able interact during the presentation.

The 2 pages should conclude with a description of any other hardware or software required for the presentation to be provided by the local organiser. Please remember that we cannot guarantee any other equipment other than the power supply and computer screen.

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to computational linguistics, innovation, scientific contribution, presentation, and user friendliness, as well as potential logistical constraints.

Submission Style Files

Submissions should follow a two-column format and should not exceed four (4) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of the Coling 2008 LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's conference - available here:

http://www.coling2008.org.uk/style.html

A description of the format is also available, in case you are unable to use these style files directly. Papers must conform to the official Coling 2008 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided. For example, instead of ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991)...'', write ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...''. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. 

Submission Procedure

These 6 pages in total should be submitted as a single PDF document with the system description coming first.  The presentation script should follow and use the same font size and margins. Single column format may be used for the presentation script part if it is more convenient.

Proposals should be submitted by 28 April 2008, to the COLING 2006
Demonstration Chairs using the START Conference Management
system:

https://www.softconf.com/coling08/main/submit.html

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Authors are responsible for ensuring their PDF documents print correctly, e.g. all of the necessary fonts are embedded in the PDF document. 

The papers must be submitted no later than April 28, 2008 23:59pm GMT. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.

Important Dates
Submission Deadline: 28 April 2008
Notification: 9 June 2008
Camera Ready: 3 July 2008
Conference Dates: 18-22 August 2008

Full Title: Diachronic Generative Syntax X 
Short Title: DiGS X 

Date: 07-Aug-2008 - 09-Aug-2008
Location: Ithaca, NY, USA 
Contact Person: John Whitman
Meeting Email: jbw2@cornell.edu
Web Site: http://phonetics.cornell.edu/DiGSX/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Language Family(ies): Indo-European 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

DiGS X will highlight generative work on early Indo-European. The special focus of DiGS X will be on fostering interaction between generativsts and Indo-Europeanists, as we feel that both the locale (the U.S. Northeast) and the times favor heightening such interaction. We emphasize that the focus of this tenth anniversary DiGS meeting will not be at the expense of papers treating syntactic change in languages outside early Indo-European. Given current trends in the field, we expect the opposite. 

Call for Papers

DiGS (Diachronic Generative Syntax)X at Cornell University
August 7-9, 2008
Abstract Deadline Extended to April 15

Abstracts are invited for oral or poster presentations. The oral presentations will be allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussions. Note that some abstracts submitted for oral presentations may be accepted for posters.  Papers are welcomed in any area of theoretical diachronic syntax.  Abstracts should be no longer than one page, with an additional page for data and references. The body of the abstract should not identify the author or authors.

We particularly want to encourage graduate student participation; in addition to the poster session, we have established a budget category to assist with travel for graduate student presenters.

Deadline for sumbission: now extended to April 15, 2008
Contact email: digsx@cornell.edu

The final program will be announced by June 15, 2008.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
