                       Coling 2008 Call For Papers





      22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics



                         18th-22nd August 2008

                            Manchester, UK



                     http://www.coling2008.org.uk/







             *** Submission deadline: 30TH MARCH 2008 ***







Programme Co-Chairs:

     Donia Scott (Open University)

     Hans Uszkoreit (Saarland University and DFKI)



Local Organization Chair:

     Harold Somers (University of Manchester)



The International Committee for Computational Linguistics is pleased

to announce its 22nd meeting, to be held in Manchester UK on the

18th-22nd August 2008. We invite papers on substantial, original,

and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics,

including, but not limited to:



- pragmatics, semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon;

- lexical semantics and ontologies;

- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;

- parsing, generation and summarization;

- paraphrasing and textual entailment;

- language models, spoken language recognition and understanding;

- linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of language;

- information retrieval, question answering, information extraction

   and text mining;

- machine learning for natural language;

- corpus-based modelling of language, discourse and dialogue;

- multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;

- multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

- applications, tools and language resources;

- system evaluation.







REQUIREMENTS



Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed

work or -- in the case of posters -- ongoing research rather than

intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of

the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation

results should be included. Submissions will be judged on

correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and

relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.



Submissions presented at the conference should mostly contain new

material that has not been presented at any other meeting with

publicly available proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in

parallel to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the

title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with

previously published work.





REVIEWING



Reviewing will be managed by an international Conference Programme

Committee consisting of Area Chairs and associated Programme Committee

Members.



Area Chairs:

     Paul Buitelaar (DFKI, Germany)

     Robert Dale (Macquarie University, Australia)

     Mary Dalrymple (University of Oxford, UK)

     Bill Dolan (Microsoft Research, USA)

     Eva Hajicova (Charles University, Czech Republic)

     Julia Hirschberg (Columbia University, USA)

     Chu-Ren Huang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)

     Pierre Isabelle (NRC Institute for Information Technology, Canada)

     Mark Johnson (Brown University, USA)

     Miles Osborne (University of Edinburgh, UK)

     Stephen Pulman (University of Oxford, UK)

     Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)

     Junichi Tsujii (Univ. of Tokyo, Japan; Univ. of Manchester, UK)

     Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield, UK)





The reviewing process will be blind and each submission will be

reviewed by at least three programme committee members.





CATEGORIES OF PAPERS



Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: as a REGULAR PAPER

or as a POSTER. Authors must designate one of these categories at

submission time. Regular papers will be presented a single time to a

potentially large audience during one of the parallel paper sessions

at the conference, and poster presentations will be repeated several

times before small groups of people (using paper posters) at one of

the conference poster sessions. Regular papers are most appropriate

for presenting substantial research results, while posters are more

appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort. The maximum

submission length will be the same for both regular papers and posters

(8 pages). However the final published versions will be 8 pages for

regular papers and 4 pages for posters. Regular and poster papers

will appear in separate volumes of the proceedings.



SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted

papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 30th

March 2008. Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed.



Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings

and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We

strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word

document template that will be made available on the conference Web

site. A description of the format is also available, in case you are

unable to use these style files directly. Papers must conform to the

official Coling 2008 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to

reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including

font size restrictions.



As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'

names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references

(e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's

identity should be avoided. For example, instead of "We previously

showed (Smith, 1991)...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith,  
1991)...".

Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected  
without

review.



For details of the submission procedure, please consult the submission

web page at

          http://www.coling2008.org.uk/submission.html

CONFERENCE VENUE



Manchester is the largest city and urban area of Northern England.

The City of Manchester itself has a population of 452,000. But with a

population of more than 2.2 million, the Manchester metropolitan area

is the second largest urban zone in the UK and the fourteenth most

populated in Europe. Manchester's international airport is a major

international hub with 220 direct destinations, more than offered by

Heathrow or Gatwick.



The city gained global fame as one of the capitals of the Industrial

Revolution.  Today Manchester is a city in transformation. The dark

satanic mills of Lowry's paintings belong to the 19th and 20th

centuries. Twenty-first century Manchester is a city of canalside

restaurants and cafes, famous for its cultural and sporting activity

as much as its business, science and education. Easily accessible by

road, rail and air, and easy to get around once you're here,

Manchester has become one of the world's most attractive, exciting

and vibrant cities, with great attractions, friendly people, and a

decent climate with -- contrary to popular belief -- about the same

rainfall as any other British city.



The city has undergone massive refurbishment in recent years, and

offers a superb range of accommodation, shopping, recreation and

dining possibilities, including the UK's second-biggest Chinatown,

the world-famous curry mile, with restaurants serving cuisine from

more than 30 different cultures, and more entries in the Good Food

Guide than any other city outside London.



Coling 2008 will take place at the brand new University Place, a

purpose-built conferences centre, one of several stunning buildings

recently built as part of the university's expansion following the

merger of UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester, making it

the biggest university in Britain.



As a birthplace of modern computing, and one of the pioneers in

computational linguistics in the UK, Manchester is delighted to host

the first Coling to be held in this country and looks forward to

welcoming you in August 2008.
