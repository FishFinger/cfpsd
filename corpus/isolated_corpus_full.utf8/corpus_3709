Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 10-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

Session at ICHL-19, Nijmegen (the Netherlands)

Despite several decades of research, our understanding of grammatical gender
systems is still relatively poor in comparison to other parts of grammar. The
present workshop aims at taking stock of current developments in the field. 

Call for Papers

The workshop on gender aims at addressing questions including, but not
restricted to, the following:

- Patterns of change in gender systems: can we find any regularity in changes
that gender systems can undergo? And to what extent can we derive answers from
such patterns with regard to more fundamental questions such as the quest for
triggers in gender change (deflection, language contact), the function of
grammatical gender, or the structure of gender systems?

- Loss or renewal of grammatical gender: in Indo-European languages, most
ongoing changes concern the loss of aspects of the gender system, such as the
decrease of the number of genders or the loss of gender agreement from parts of
the grammar (although there are exceptions, such as the emergence of a
'neo-neuter' in varieties of Italian (Haase 2000). Are there language families
where the reverse is observed, i.e. frequent changes towards more genders or
towards more gender agreement? In addition, to what extent do these innovations
match alleged universal pathways such as the one proposed by Greenberg (1978).

- The global distribution of grammatical gender: it appears that gender systems
are quite widespread in the world, but not universal (cf. the WALS). Are there
any linguistic properties that facilitate or inhibit the presence of grammatical
gender? And how can such correlations be explained?

- Grammatical gender and theories of language change: recent data, e.g. from
Dutch, have shown substantial differences in the way grammatical gender is
acquired in L1 and L2. Hence data on gender change can be shed some light over
the ongoing debate on the role of L1 vs. L2 speakers in language change.

Conveners:

Abstracts: 
The workshop is part of the ICHL-19 conference, which takes place 10-15 August
2009, at the Radboud University Nijmegen (the Netherlands). Abstracts should be
submitted via the ICHL-19 website: http://www.ru.nl/cls/ichl19/. Deadline is 10
January 2009.

Meeting Description:

understanding and modeling of how (morpho)syntax change comes about in
languages, or groups of languages, including but not restricted to: 
- parameter theory, 
- the role of language acquisition and contact on language change, 
- the dynamics of syntactic change
- grammaticalization,
- language reconstruction.

Abstracts should be no longer than two pages, including references and examples,

Please, indicate clearly in your submission email whether your abstract should
be considered for presentation or for the poster session.
