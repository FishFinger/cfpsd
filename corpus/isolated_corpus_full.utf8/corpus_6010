Meeting Description:

Utterance Interpretation and Cognitive Models 3
=20
The third edition of the Brussels conference on Utterance Interpretation an=
d Cognitive Models will take place on February 5-7, 2010, under the auspice=
s of the Belgische Kring voor Lingu=EFstiek / Cercle Belge de Linguistique.

The first edition addressed the issue of the semantics/pragmatics interface=
 from a cognitive perspective and drew essentially on the work of semantici=
sts, pragmaticists and philosophers of language. The second broadened the p=
erspective by inviting the views of scholars from the related subfields of =
syntax, cognitive linguistics and evolutionary linguistics. For this third =
edition, the focus will be on the developmental and cognitive determinants =
of utterance interpretation. On the one hand, the ontogenetic development o=
f our ability to interpret linguistic utterances provides invaluable insigh=
ts into adult cognition; on the other, the methods of cognitive psychology,=
 with their emphasis on experimental inquiry and empirical results raise cr=
ucial epistemological questions for the progress of research in the field. =
The focus of this third edition is fully in keeping with our continued ambi=
tion to reach across disciplinary boundaries and bring together researchers=
 who, though belonging to different schools or traditions, all take a view =
of interpretation that is informed by cognitive concerns and share the assu=
mption that the ultimate test for any theory of utterance interpretation is=
 its psychological plausibility.

Keynote Speakers:
=20
Bart Geurts (Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen)
Jean-Marie Marandin (CNRS, Universit=E9 Paris 7)
Anna Papafragou (University of Delaware)
Josef Perner (Universit=E4t Salzburg)
Dan Sperber (CNRS, Institut Jean Nicod)=20

Abstract submissions:
=20
In addition to keynote lectures, the conference will feature parallel sessi=
ons with contributed papers. We welcome submissions of abstracts for 25-min=
ute papers that focus on the psychological or cognitive underpinnings of ut=
terance interpretation or, conversely, address the implications that theori=
es of any aspect of utterance interpretation can have for the psychology of=
 language and for cognitive science at large. We also welcome papers from s=
cholars who study utterance interpretation in connection with language deve=
lopment, impaired communication, non-verbal communication and non-human com=
munication. Abstracts will be anonymously refereed by members of the progra=
m committee.
