Meeting Description:

Workshop: Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Portmanteau Morphemes=20

Portmanteau morphemes combine more than one meaning into a single form. As =
a
theoretical concept a portmanteau is an unanalyzable unit, which cannot be =
split
up into separate forms corresponding to the individual meanings. In actual
linguistic data this strict criterion is hardly ever met. Most portmanteau-=
like
forms are at least partly analyzable. Often they can be understood
synchronically and/or diachronically as non-portmanteaus, either because th=
ey
are formed by concatenation from two different forms, or because they are
identical in form to non-portmanteau forms and one component of the meaning=
 is
understood through implicature.=20

Given this observation, portmanteaus are of vital interest for a wide range=
 of
linguistic subfields. Of course, first of all morphology comes to mind. Her=
e the
question arises how portmanteaus are integrated into paradigms, especially =
if
they are alternating with non-portmanteau forms. Beyond this the study of
portmanteaus is also highly relevant for our understanding of syntactic
analysis, both from a theoretical and a psycholinguistic point of view. Rel=
ated
to this is the question of whether portmanteaus are stored as one unit or
whether they are derived from their components at each utterance. Even thou=
gh
portmanteaus might be analyzable in a number of languages by linguists, tha=
t
does not necessarily mean that they are actually analyzed by the speakers o=
f
that language. If one analyzes at least some portmanteaus as holistically s=
tored
by speakers, how and when does the switch from analyzing portmanteaus as
separate forms to a unified representation come about -- given that portman=
teaus
originate from simplex morphemes? And how is linguistic theory able to repr=
esent
this switch? This is only one of the many questions concerning the diachron=
ic
development of portmanteaus.

From a typological perspective the question arises if there are any systema=
tic
restrictions on the distribution of portmanteaus in lexical inventories wit=
hin
and across languages? Furthermore, is the development of portmanteaus
constrained by any other features of the language, and how?

This workshop is part of the annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f=
=FCr
Sprachwissenschaft (German Linguistic Society, DGfS) in Berlin from Februar=
y
24--26, 2010. Presentations at multiple workshops during DGfS are generally=
 not
approved of.
