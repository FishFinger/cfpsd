efforts toward this end. The conference planning committee, in their selection
of presenters strives to balance linguistic research, instructional techniques,
technological innovations and most recently, indigenous languages in the context
of the visual, written and performing arts.

We invite you to share your work and in so doing, further efforts to reclaim,
perpetuate and celebrate Native North America's unique and precious languages of
heritage.

second language speakers, workbooks, CDs, computer-interactive programs, videos,
TPR, the Silent Way, Immersion Nests, etc.

B. Artistic Application of Language, such as storytelling, performing artists,
authors and playwrights for all age groups, visual artists, etc.

C. Linguistics in the Context of Language Preservation and Reconstruction,
such as historical linguistics of Native - North America, preferably but
not limited to Algonquian languages and those of Southern New England.
Papers addressing methodologies and sources used in preservation and
reclamation projects as well as place-names' analyses sought.

D. Technological Innovations in the areas of language documentation,
databases and dictionary software, educational and instructional software, etc.

Meeting Description:

Studies Conference, March 7-9, 2008 at the University of California, Berkeley on

Rebellion and Revolution: Defiance in German Language, History and Art

Paper proposals are being accepted for the 16th Annual Interdisciplinary German
Studies Conference, March 7-9, 2008 at the University of California, Berkeley.  

The German-speaking world has witnessed a wide array of rebellions. Whether the
yearly May-Day riots, the disputes over orthographic reform, the
extra-parliamentary opposition of the late 1960s, or the failed revolution of
1848, a multitude of events have incited and continue to incite defiance and
acute emotional intensity. Such protests often take the form of political and
artistic movements, but they have also arisen through fictional representations,
ranging from Wernher der Gartenaere's Helmbrecht, Martin Luther's Bible
translation, and Goethe's Werther to Feridun Zaimoglu's Ertan Ongun and Kanak TV. 

In a time when Germany has become increasingly concerned with ''parallel
societies'' and the threat of international and homegrown terrorism, various
modes of protest have resurfaced in political and academic discussions. With the
fortieth anniversary of the student insurrections of 1968 fast approaching, this
conference seeks to reflect on past rebellions and revolutions, as well as
explore new manifestations thereof in the German-speaking world. We wish to
encourage an informed discussion on the phenomena and limitations of rebellion
during times of war and intensified national security. 

What does collective emotional intensity, in the form of rebellion and
revolution, effect in society? What is at stake when defiant expression is
censored? Should societies and governments respond to rebellious acts
differently than they did in previous eras? What happens to former rebels and
revolutionaries? Does society reject them? Punish them? Integrate them? How does
public reception of rebellious acts and revolutions shape academic and political
discourse?

We invite scholars from all disciplines to submit paper proposals in English or
German responding to questions of rebellion and revolution in the
German-speaking world. Possible topics include but are not limited to the following:

Rebellious/Revolutionary Movements in History, Art, Literature and Film
Language and Propaganda 
Linguistic Rebellion (Dialects, Anglicisms, Sprachinseln,         
Multilingualism, Language Reform) 
Communal Rebellion (Riots, Subcultures, Sects and Communes)
Icons of Rebellion and Revolution and German National Identity 
Defying Censorship  
Rebelling Against History, Legacy and Collective Memory 
Resisting Categorization and Oppression: Class, Gender and Ethnicity 
Staging German Identity through Communal Enthusiasm (World Cup 2006)

Forward abstracts of no more than 300 words, in either German or English, to
Melissa Etzler metzler@berkeley.edu. Deadline: Dec. 15, 2007.

For further details, or questions please contact Priscilla Layne
pdlayne@berkeley.edu
