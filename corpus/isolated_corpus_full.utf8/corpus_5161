Meeting Description:

The School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures at the University of Edinburgh
invites you to Scotland's capital and festival city in the summer of 2010 for
the fourth instalment in the 'Trends in Toponymy' interdisciplinary conference
series. The previous conferences in the series have been held in
Kárá?johka-Karasjok, Ballarat and Durban.

The multilingual heritage and culture of Scotland will provide an excellent
context within which to discuss recent advances in onomastics and strengthen the
international links between researchers. Through the conference theme of
'attitudes to names and naming', it is hoped to improve understanding of the
dialectic between different views on naming practices and policies. Bringing
together leading experts on names from around the world, the conference will
present a forum for sharing ideas between name scholars and practitioners
including those currently dealing with the standardisation of Gaelic names in
Scotland.

In conjunction with the conference, a public event will be held at the National
Library of Scotland to further understanding of the importance of promoting
Gaelic and the official use of Gaelic place-names specifically.

Keynote Presentations 

Laura Kostanski (University of Ballarat/Office of the Surveyor-General of Victoria)
'Grampians - As Aussie as Shrimp on a Barbie: An Exploration of Toponymic
Attachment'

Simon Taylor (University of Glasgow)
'Scottish Place-Names: The Cultural and Linguistic Challenge' 

Call for Papers

We are now inviting proposals for papers of twenty minutes in length on the
conference theme of 'attitudes to names and naming'. As previously in the
series, this conference will continue to deal with place-names, but papers are
also invited on personal names. Papers are especially welcome on the following
topics:

- Attitudes towards minority or aboriginal names
- Names in multicultural or multilingual contexts
- Names in official use (official maps, road signs etc.) or in everyday use
- Name theory
- Names in educational contexts or in the media
- Names and the linguistic landscape

Proposals are invited from all fields of onomastics, linguistics, geography,
anthropology, area studies, sociology, political and historical studies,
literary studies, and other related subject areas. It is hoped to publish a
selection of the most innovative papers from the conference.

If you wish to present a paper at the conference, please send an abstract (up to
300 words) and a short biographical description of the speaker or speakers to
g.puzey@ed.ac.uk by 30 November 2009. These will be reviewed by the conference
committee, and you will be notified of the outcome by 15 February 2010. More
details about registration fees and the conference programme will also be sent
and will be published on the conference website.


Conference language: 
The conference working language will be English.

Venue and accommodation:

The conference will be held in the recently opened Chrystal Macmillan Building
in George Square, in the city centre. There is a wide variety of restaurants,
