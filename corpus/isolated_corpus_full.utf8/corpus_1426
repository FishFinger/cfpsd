Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context

Roskilde University, Denmark
August 20, 2007

Alessandro Lenci (University of Pisa)
Magnus Sahlgren (Swedish Institute of Computer Science)


*** Topics of the Workshop ***

Some variation of the so-called distributional hypothesis - i.e. that
words with similar distributional properties have similar semantic
properties - lies at the heart of a number of computational approaches
that share the assumption that it is possible to build semantic space
models through the statistical analysis of the contexts in which words
occur.

However, the very notion of context on which semantic spaces rely on
gives rise to various crucial issues both at the theoretical and at
the computational level, which in turn determine a large space of
parametric variations. The aim of this workshop is to foster a fully
cross-disciplinary debate around the major open questions pertaining
to the definition and usage of context in context-based semantic
modeling.

In particular, we invite papers on the following topics:

* using new linguistic and extra-linguistic contexts in semantic
   space modeling;
* integration of different context sources (linguistic,
   extra-linguistic, etc.) to bootstrap semantic spaces;
* plausible contexts for cognitively and neurally realistic semantic
   space models;
* effect of context choice on the performance of semantic space
   models in applicative settings;
* critical analysis of the limits of current context-based models of
   meaning and future perspectives.


*** Paper Submission ***

The papers should not be longer than 8 pages, and they should be
submitted anonymously in PDF format following the LNCS guidelines (see
Workshop's website for link to style-sheets).

Paper selection will occur through a blind review process. Each paper
will be read by 2 reviewers.

Online paper submission is now open at:

http://www.easychair.org/COSMO2007


*** Important dates ***

* Paper submission: May 15
* Notification of acceptance/rejection: June 20
* Final version of paper due: July 20
* Workshop: August 20
