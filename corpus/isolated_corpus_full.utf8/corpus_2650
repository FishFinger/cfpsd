schedule allows extending the submission =

deadline to March 21, 2008.

BioNLP 2008 =

An ACL 2008 Workshop
Columbus, OH June 19 or 20, 2008
http://compbio.uchsc.edu/BioNLP2008
Submissions due: March 21, 2008, 11:59 PM Eastern US

Continuing a successful series of BioNLP workshops at ACL 2002, =

ACL 2003, NAACL 2004, ACL 2005, NAACL 2006, and ACL 2007, and =

in accordance with the ACL BioNLP tradition of presenting work =

on a broad range of topics, we invite submissions on any topic =

of current interest in the field of Biomedical Natural Language =

Processing.  =


We especially encourage submissions on:

- Entity identification and normalization for a broad range of =

  semantic categories
- Ontologies and knowledge bases in BioNLP
- Extraction of complex relations
- The economics of text mining and database curation
- Resources and novel strategies for system testing and evaluation
- Shared tasks in the biomedical domain
- Test suites and corpora for BioNLP
- Quantifying utility to end-users
- Portability for non-developers
- Summarization
- Question-answering
- Full text and figures

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: Friday, March 21, 2008
Notification of acceptance: Sunday, April 20, 2008
Camera-ready copy due from authors: Saturday, April 26, 2008
Workshop: June 19 or 20, 2008

Submission instructions:

Two types of submissions are invited: full papers and poster abstracts.  =

Submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST on March 21, 2008.  =

Submit your paper or abstract via the ACL BioNLP 2008 site =

at https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS05/.

Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references.  =

These are intended to be reports of original research. =

BioNLP aims to be the forum for interesting, innovative, and =

promising work involving biomedicine and language technology, =

whether or not yielding high performance at the moment.  =

This by no means precludes our interest in and preference for =

mature results, strong performance, and thorough evaluation.  =

Both types of research and combinations of thereof are encouraged. =


Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages. Accepted abstracts =

will be published in a separate section of the workshop proceedings.  =

Appropriate poster topics include preliminary results, application =

notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format, and should follow =

the two-column format of ACL proceedings.  Ensure that you are =

*not* in A4 format.  =

Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting =

specifications. Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX =

or Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting website =

(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html).  =

Submissions need not be anonymous. Authors who cannot submit a PDF =

file electronically should contact the workshop organizers well in =

advance of the submission deadline.  =


Dual submission policy: note that papers may not be submitted to the =

BioNLP 2008 workshop if they are or will be concurrently submitted =

to another meeting or publication and that other meeting or =

publication prohibits dual submissions.  If your paper is also =

submitted to ISMB, you should expect it to be rejected by ISMB.  =

If your paper is or will be concurrently under consideration by =

another meeting or publication, notify us of that fact in a footnote =

on the first page.  Do not dual-submit your BioNLP 2008 workshop =

paper to ISMB.

Authors are invited to submit expanded versions of their papers to =

a special issue to BMC Bioinformatics. Such papers will go through =

the normal BMC review process.

Note: BMC Bioinformatics is an open access journal. As such, =

submissions to a special issue bear a publication cost of =A3600 =

per paper regardless of the authors' institutional membership =

in BMC. Submission to the special issue is entirely voluntary. =

In order to get the special issue out in a timely fashion, we =

simply ask authors of accepted papers to notify us if they plan =

to submit an expanded version of their paper for the special issue.

 - Sophia Ananiadou, National Centre for Text Mining =

   and University of Manchester, UK
