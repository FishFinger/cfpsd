Meeting Description:

Workshop: Grammaticalization in German - In the European context Deutscher =
Germanistentag 2010

In the last decades, grammaticalization research has given rise to several =
functional as well as formal approaches to language change focusing on sema=
ntics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics, discourse analysis, and syntax.

The aim of the section held at the Deutscher Germanistentag 2010 in Freibur=
g/Germany is to adopt or, if necessary, to refine the existing approaches a=
nd to apply them also from a contrastive perspective to Grammaticalization =
processes in German. Going along with the main topic of the meeting 'German=
 Language and Literature in the European Context', this workshop is also at=
tempting to determine the influence of language contact and standardization=
 processes on language change, especially of those relating to German.

The workshop will be held in German.

Scholarships:

In order to support young scholars to participate at the conference, the De=
utscher Germanistenverband (DGV) offers 20 scholarships in amount of 500 eu=
ro each (membership in the DGV is required, for the application form see ht=
tp://www.germanistenverband.de/hochschule/mitglied-werden/anmeldung.php).=
