CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS EACL 2009, NAACL HLT 2009, AND ACL-IJCNLP
2009

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for
workshops to be held in conjunction with one of the three flagship
conferences sponsored in 2009 by the Association for Computational
Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2009, EACL 2009, and NAACL HLT 2009.  We solicit
proposals on any topic of interest to the ACL community. Workshops will
be held at one of the following conference venues:

EACL 2009 is the annual meeting of the European chapter of the ACL. The
conference will be held in Athens, Greece, March 30-April 3 2009;
workshops March 30-31.

NAACL HLT 2009 is the annual meeting of the North American chapter of
the ACL.  It continues the inclusive tradition of encompassing relevant
work from the natural language processing, speech and information
retrieval communities.  The conference will be held in Boulder,
Colorado, USA, from May 31-June 5 2009; workshops will be held June 4-5.

ACL-IJCNLP 2009 combines the 47th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL 2009) with the 4th International Joint
Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP).  The conference will
be held in Singapore, August 2-7 2009; workshops will be held August
6-7.


       SUBMISSION INFORMATION

In a departure from previous years, ACL-IJCNLP, EACL and NAACL HLT will
coordinate the submission and reviewing of workshop proposals for all
three ACL 2009 conferences.

Proposals for workshops should contain:

       * A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic
         and content.
       * The desired workshop length (one or two days), and an estimate
         of the audience size.
       * The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses
         of the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their
         research interests and areas of expertise.
       * A budget.
       * A list of potential members of the program committee, with an
         indication of which members have already agreed.
       * A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.
       * A description of special requirements for technical needs.
       * A venue preference specification.

The venue preference specification should list the venues at which the
organizers would be willing to present the workshop (EACL, NAACL HLT, or
ACL-IJCNLP).  A proposal may specify one, two, or three acceptable
workshop venues; if more than one venue is acceptable, the venues should
be preference-ordered.  There will be a single workshop committee,
coordinated by the three sets of workshop chairs.  This single committee
will review the quality of the workshop proposals.  Once the reviews are
complete, the workshop chairs will work together to assign workshops to
each of the three conferences, taking into account the location
preferences given by the proposers.

The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find general
information on policies regarding attendance, publication, financing,
and sponsorship, as well as on financial support of SIG workshops, at
the following URL:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/index-policies.html

Please submit proposals by electronic mail no later than September 1
2008, to acl09-workshops at acl09-workshops@uni-konstanz.de with the
subject line: "ACL 2009 WORKSHOP PROPOSAL."


       PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS

Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no later
than September 23, 2008.  Since the three ACL conferences will occur at
different times, the timescales for the submission and reviewing of
workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be
different for the three conferences. Suggested timescales for each of
the conferences are given below.
