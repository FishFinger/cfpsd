Meeting Description:

You are cordially invited to the conference organised by the School of English, Academy of Management, which will be held in Warsaw from 12th to 13th December 2009. The conference will be devoted to 'Foreign influences on Medieval English'. The aim of the conference is to bring together specialists in the areas of Medieval English linguistics, particularly interested in language contact in Old and Middle English.

Four plenary sessions have been scheduled with papers by: 

Dr Richard Dance (Cambridge):
"Tomor3an hit is awane: words derived from Old Norse and 12th-century English"

Professor Marcin Krygier (Poznan):
"Scandinavian influence on the Middle English prepositional system"

Professor Rafal Molencki (Katowice): 
"New prepositions and subordinating conjunctions in Middle English" 

Professor Hans Sauer (Munich): 
"Patterns of loan-influence on the Medieval English plant-names (loan words, loan-formations, etc.)" 

Call for Papers:

Section Papers: 

A number of proposals for section papers have already been received from Europe, the United States and Asia. Further proposals and registration will be accepted until the end of July 2009. Please do not forget to attach a brief abstract. 

We would like to take this opportunity and inform you that there will be no MESS devoted to language at AMU this year. Since we have received many enquiries from scholars working on topics other than foreign influences who would like to present their work at the Conference, we would like to accept a few papers not referring to the topic of the Conference.  

Venue and Accommodation: 

The conference will be held at: 

School of English, 
Academy of Management, 
Ul. Lucka 11
00-842 Warsaw

You should book your accommodation yourself. A list of hotels can be found onthe website. 

Publication: 

A selected number of papers will be published by Lang Verlag in a volume edited by Prof. J. Fisiak and Dr M. Bator.

All enquiries concerning the Conference should be addressed to the Organisers, preferably by e-mail:
