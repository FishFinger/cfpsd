                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
    International Workshop on Hybrid Logic 2009 (HyLo 2009)
             "Conmemorating the Ten Years of HyLo"
              http://hylo.loria.fr/content/Hylo02
                      15 - 17 July, 2007
                        Nancy, France
***************************************************************

WORKSHOP PURPOSE:

Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic allowing direct reference
to worlds/times/states. It is easy to justify interest in hybrid
logic on the grounds of applications, as the additional expressive
power is very useful.  In addition, hybrid-logical machinery
improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism.  For
example, it becomes considerably simpler to formulate modal proof
systems, and one can prove completeness and interpolation results
of a generality that is not available in orthodox modal logic.
But more generally, the topic of HyLo 2009 is not only standard
hybrid-logical machinery (like nominals, satisfaction operators,
binders, etc) but also extensions of modal logic that increase
its expressive power in one way or other.

HyLo 2009 will be an special event, conmemorating the ten years
since the organization of the first HyLo workshop in 1999.

HyLo 2009 will be relevant to a wide range of people, including
those interested in description logic, feature logic, applied
modal logics, temporal logic, and labelled deduction. The workshop
continues a series of previous workshops on hybrid logic. The
workshop aims to provide a forum for advanced PhD students and
researchers to present and discuss their work with colleagues and
researchers.

For more general background on hybrid logic, and many of the key
papers, see the Hybrid Logics homepage (http://hylo.loria.fr/).

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

We invite the contribution of papers reporting new work from
researchers interested in hybrid logic. Details about the submission
procedure will be announced in the second call for papers. The accepted
papers will appear in the workshop proceedings, and selected papers
will be included in a special volume to conmemorate the 10th aniversary
of the first Hybrid Logic Workshop.

One author for each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to
present the paper.
