################################################################

  CALL FOR SHARED TASK PARTICIPATION

     LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE  =

2008)

  endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)


Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Deadline: Friday, 14 March 2008 (Shared Task)

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

#################################################################

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for  =

collecting, sharing and exploiting MWE evaluation resources.  =

Following an earlier call, numerous contributors have submitted data  =

sets of various kinds, which can now be downloaded from the Multiword  =

homepage: http://multiword.sourceforge.net/

With this call, we invite teams to participate in a SHARED TASK on  =

MULTIWORD EXTRACTION, based on a subset of the new resources. For  =

this first and exploratory evaluation campaign, we decided to focus  =

on the simplest and most straightforward task -- ranking MWE  =

candidates -- in order to make it easier for participating teams to  =

adapt their existing systems before the deadline on March 14th.

Participating teams have to apply a MWE candidate ranking algorithm  =

to at least two different data sets, provided in the form of a list  =

of MWE candidates that have been manually annotated as true positives  =

(TP) and false positives (FP). Evaluation is carried out by the teams  =

themselves in terms of n-best precision and precision-recall graphs  =

(sample R scripts for the evaluation will be provided on the shared  =

task homepage soon). Further analysis and experiments are strongly  =

encouraged (e.g. on different subsets of the candidates, or for  =

different subtypes of MWE). Baseline results for standard association  =

measures will be presented by the workshop organisers.

More information and downloads can be found on the shared task homepage:

   http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwe2008/shared_task.html

Teams planning to participate in the shared task should also join the  =

multiword mailing list for up-to-date information and discussions:

   https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/multiword-expressions

We expect a full-fledged competition with a more varied range of  =

tasks to be organised in the near future, making use of the full  =

collection of data sets from this workshop.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Shared task participants have to submit a short paper with complete  =

evaluation results for their ranking algorithm on at least three  =

different data sets. Submissions are not anonymous and will be  =

briefly reviewed by the workshop organisers for complicance with the  =

shared task requirements.

Papers must adhere to the format of LREC proceedings (preferably  =

using the style files provided on the conference Web site) and must  =

not exceed four (4) pages, including references. Only submissions in  =

PDF format will be considered.

The papers must be submitted no later than 23:59 GMT on March 14, 2008.

Please submit your paper here: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/ =

MWE2008/submit.html

In addition, participants should make available their full candidate  =

rankings and, if possible, an implementation of their ranking  =

algorithm, to encourage further experiments. Details will be  =

discussed on the multiword mailing list.

8-page regular paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
4-page resource paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
4-page shared task paper submission deadline: March 14, 2008
