PURPOSE/HISTORY:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the 25 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
   fields.  We anticipate to have 2,600 or more attendees from over 80
   countries participating in the 2008 joint conferences.

   WORLCOMP'08 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
   lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and
   poster presentations.  In recent past, keynote and/or tutorial speakers
   included: Prof. Michael J. Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John H. Holland
   (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. H. J. Siegel (Colorado State U.);
   Prof. Barry Vercoe (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U. of California,
   Berkeley); Prof. David Cheriton (Stanford U.), Prof. A. K. Dunker
   (Indiana U. and Purdue U.); Prof. Jun Liu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys
   (developer of X Window, ...); Dr. Chris Rowen (President and CEO,
   Tensilica, Inc.); and many other distinguished speakers.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft paper
   (about 5 to 7 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by March 10, 2008. email submissions in MS document
   or PDF formats are preferable.  All reasonable typesetting formats
   are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be
   asked to follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their
   papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited
   to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously
   published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The
   first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,
   name, affiliation, postal address, email address, and telephone
   number for each author.  The first page should also identify the
   name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that
   would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally, the name
   of the conference that the paper is being submitted to must be
   stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
   impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts
   in the field who are independent of the conference program committee.
   The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of
   the program committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of
   the track that the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make
   the final decision.
