Call for papers for

Production, Perception, Attitude
An interdisciplinary workshop on understanding and explaining linguistic
variation

Hosted by the University of Leuven, April 2-4, 2009

Organized by the Universities of Leuven, Nijmegen, and Groningen for the
VNC-research
programme
The interaction between intelligibility, attitude, and linguistic distance.



We invite paper and poster presentations for a two day symposium which
focuses on (and
confronts) work in variationist linguistics, perceptual dialectology, and
language
attitude research. Contributions preferably tackle one of the following
topics:


* Innovative methods and techniques for measuring language variation and
change, language
perceptions, or language attitudes;
* Innovative methods and techniques for collecting reliable data in these
disciplines;
* Data-based analysis which highlights the causal relations between
production,
perception, and attitudes.
Although the focus in the research programme which frames this workshop is
on Dutch,
contributions need not be restricted to linguistic variation in the Low
Countries.



Background


Although linguistic variation in the Dutch language area (The Netherlands
and Flanders)
has enjoyed an enormous amount of descriptive and theoretical attention, fe=
w
reliable
data are available on the origin of this variation and on how it can be
accounted for. In
order to explain language variation, the sociolinguistic correlates of
phonetic, lexical,
and morpho-syntactic variables ?have to be traced back to a complex set of
underlying
criteria? (Knops & Van Hout 1988: 2). The identification of at least some o=
f
these
criteria is the ambitious aim to which the present workshop is devoted.

Up to now, linguistic variation in The Netherlands has been investigated
predominantly
from the perspective of language production, i. e. in terms of the
description of the
linguistic distance observed between regional and stylistic varieties of
Dutch (cf.
Geeraerts, Grondelaers & Speelman 1999; Van Hout & Van de Velde 2001;
Heeringa & Nerbonne
2001). In order, however, to move from merely describing linguistic
variation to
explaining variation, three extensions are needed.

First, the production perspective on linguistic variation has to be refined
theoretically
and methodologically to chart hitherto unknown patterns and (more
importantly) triggers
of variation. Second, it is well-known that some language variation and
change patterns
are sustained by attitudinal factors (whereby ?attitudes? are provisionally
defined as
the culturally and experientially acquired inclination to perceive and
evaluate a variety
as systematically negative or positive). Although the causal link between
perception and
production has recurrently been demonstrated (cf. Van Bezooijen 2001), both
define
different disciplines in (socio)linguistics and social psychology which
rarely interact.
Attitude research is moreover hindered by a lack of reliable quantitative
data
(Grondelaers, Van Hout & Steegs: in press).

In addition to these two perspectives, the workshop also focuses on the
(often missing)
link between the production and the evaluative perception of language
variation. Before
language variation can be subjectively evaluated, it must first be
recognized by the
layman. Perceptual dialectology (Long & Preston 1999) therefore investigate=
s
to what
extent linguistic laymen recognize and understand other varieties, and wher=
e
they situate
the boundaries between their own and other varieties. Although this paradig=
m
represents
one of the oldest disciplines in sociolinguistics (pioneered in Weijnen
1946), its
findings have rarely been systematically confronted with production and
attitudinal
perception data. Another crucial perspective which has largely been ignored
in this
respect is the mutual intelligibility between language varieties, a factor
which is
co-determined by attitudes and by linguistic distance (Gooskens 2007).

The present meeting is devoted to enhancing the convergence between the
cited research
disciplines in order to develop (the preliminaries to) an explanatory model
of language
variation and change. The workshop is interdisciplinary in focus and
features three
plenary speakers and presentations by the universities participating in the
research
programme. In addition, we invite contributions from (socio)linguists and
(social)
psychologists working in the three aforementioned areas for plenary oral
presentations as
well as an extended poster programme (poster presenters will be allowed
plenary
presentation time to advertize their posters).
