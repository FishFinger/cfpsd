Meeting Description:

International Workshop on Terminology and Lexical Semantics (TLS'09)
Held in conjunction with
Fourth International Conference on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT'09)
June 16-18, 2009 

Second Call for Papers

Recent work on terminology processing (corpus-based or knowledge-based
terminology, computational terminology, terminography or specialized
lexicography, etc.) has shown the importance of taking into account the
linguistic aspects of terms as well as their conceptual aspects. Linguistic
aspects are often those that must be dealt with when processing or analyzing
corpora. Conceptual aspects, on the other hand, are those that terminologists
must take into account when building knowledge representations in specific
subject fields. The weight given to each aspect depends on the theoretical model
on which a terminology project relies, its objectives or the application for
which it is developed.

Although conceptual and linguistic aspects of terms are recognized as being
necessary, less work has been carried out on their linguistic properties and
their formal representation. Which linguistic properties should be represented?
Which theoretical model is better adapted to terminological needs? How can
linguistic properties of terms, especially lexico-semantic aspects implemented
in terminology applications? All these questions must be addressed and resolved
when processing specialized texts and representing knowledge.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in linguistic
approaches -- especially lexico-semantic aspects to the description of terms.
This workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss issues of a fundamental
nature (e.g., the modelling of meaning or the definition of sets of lexical
relationships) as well as applied work dealing with the acquisition of lexical
aspects of terms or their representation in formal structures.

Topics
- Use of lexical semantics models (e.g. Semantic Frames, Generative Lexicon, 
Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology, Functional-Lexematic Model) in
terminological descriptions
- Combination of concept-based and lexico-semantic approaches in terminological
descriptions
- Modelling of lexical relationships (paradigmatic and syntagmatic), specialized
meaning, sense distinctions, argument structure, multilingual terminological data
- Implementation of lexical descriptions of terms in terminological databases,
dictionaries, ontologies and other formal knowledge representations
- Use of lexical descriptions of terms in computer applications
- Automatic or semi-automatic identification of lexical relationships,
collocations and other lexical aspects of terms in specialized corpora 

Submission of papers (Now open!)
