variety of fields, including, for example, English studies, education, discourse

psychology, and sociology. Proposals reporting on action research (inside and
outside the classroom), works in progress, submissions based on successful term
projects, pilot research, as well as proposals for discussion sessions and
workshops are welcome. Presentations requiring computer facilities can be
accommodated. Multiple proposals will be considered. Submit and register via the
conference website. The deadline for proposal submission is Monday, November 30,
