Meeting Description:

The Second International Conference on Language Contact in Times of Globalization will focus on the effects of language contacts as a result of the on-going globalization process. 

Call for Papers

Almost two decades ago a tradition of organising international conferences with a focus on language contacts was established at the University of Groningen. It started in November 1991 with a conference on Finno-Ugric languages amidst Slavic and Germanic language communities. Since then similar international conferences have been held in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2006.

As a follow-up to the successful first International Conference on Language Contact in Times of Globalization in 2006 (of which the proceedings will be published in 2008), the University of Groningen is organising a second conference on June 4-6, 2009. This conference is one of the cultural and scholarly activities planned for this year, which has been proclaimed Year of the Hanseatic League by the Cultural Forum of Groningen. The festivities for this occasion include an exhibition in the Groningen Museum, an international congress of historians, and numerous other activities. Although the League was mainly an economic organisation, it was also a major instigator of prolonged linguistic contacts in medieval times. 

This second conference will largely focus on the same theme as the previous one, i.e. the effects of language contacts as a result of the on-going globalization process. The organisers, however, feel that language contact should not only be seen as a recent development, but much more as a process of all ages happening at all locations where cultures come into contact with each other.

The Hanseatic League is but one example of early language contact, there are of course many more. We therefore welcome papers related to all issues on language contact and language change from a synchronic and diachronic perspective. We are pleased to announce that Prof. George van Driem (University of Leiden), Prof. Johanna Nichols (University of California, Berkeley), Prof. Pekka Sammallahti (University of Oulu) and Prof. Peter Schrijver (University of Utrecht) have agreed to give plenary lectures.

We invite speakers from around the world to send in papers (30 minutes) on this particular theme. Abstracts must not exceed 500 words and should be sent by email attachment (word or rtf file) to lctg2@rug.nl by 30 September 2008. Notification on acceptance will be sent out by 30 November 2008. The registration fee will be 100 euros until 1 April 2009, after which it will be 120 euros. A peer-reviewed selection of the contributions is planned to appear after the conference.
