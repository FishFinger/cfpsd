                            CALL FOR PAPERS
          Seventh International Andrei Ershov Memorial Conference
                   PERSPECTIVES OF SYSTEM INFORMATICS
           15--19 June, 2009, Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok, Russia
                                 http://psi.nsc.ru

[AIMS AND SCOPE]

PSI is a forum for academic and industrial researchers, developers and users 
working on topics relating to computer, software and information sciences. 
The conference serves to bridge the gaps between different communities whose 
research areas are covered by but not limited to foundations of program and 
system development and analysis, programming methodology and software 
engineering, and information technologies. The PSI forum provides a venue 
for such communities at which common problems, methods and methodologies can be 
discussed and explored. In doing so, PSI aims to support researchers in their 
quest to improve the reliability, flexibility and efficiency of methods, 
algorithms and tools for developing computer, software and information systems. 
The first six conferences were held in 1991, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2006, 
respectively, and proved to be significant international events.
   
The PSI 2009 Conference is dedicated to the memory of a prominent scientist 
academician A.P. Ershov and to a significant date in the history of computer 
science in the country, namely, to the 50th anniversary of the Programming 
Department founded by him. Initially, the Department was a part of the Institute 
of Mathematics and later, in 1964, it joined the newly established Computing 
Center of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A.P. Ershov, 
who was responsible for forming the Department, gathered a team of young graduates 
from the leading Soviet universities. The first significant project of 
the Department was aimed at the development of ALPHA system, an optimizing
compiler for an extension of Algol 60 implemented on a Soviet computer M-20. 
Later the researchers of the Department created the Algibr, Epsilon, Sigma,
and Alpha-6 programming systems for the BESM-6 computers. The list of their
achievements also includes the first Soviet time-sharing system AIST-0,
the multi-language system BETA, research projects in artificial intelligence
and parallel programming, the integrated tools for text processing and publishing,
and many others. The scope of problems facing the Programming Department was
widening in time, its organizational structure changed and there appeared new
research directions, school informatics and mixed computation among them. 
Founded in 1990, the Institute of Informatics Systems is justly considered
to be a successor of the Programming Department keeping its main research
directions and maintaining its best traditions.
