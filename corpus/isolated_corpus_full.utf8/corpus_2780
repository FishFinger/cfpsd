CALL FOR PAPERS

WORKSHOP on PRIOR KNOWLEDGE FOR TEXT AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING

9 July 2008, Helsinki, in conjunction with ICML/UAI/COLT conferences

Web page: http://prior-knowledge-language-ws.wikidot.com
(please monitor this page for updates)

CONTEXT: The workshop is part of the Thematic Programme "Leveraging Complex=
 Prior Knowledge for Learning" of the PASCAL-2 European Network of Excellen=
ce starting in March 2008.

GOALS: The aim of the workshop is to present and discuss recent advances in=
 machine learning approaches to text and natural language processing that c=
apitalize on rich prior knowledge models in these domains.

MOTIVATION: Traditionally, in Machine Learning, a strong focus has been put=
 on data-driven methods that assume little a priori knowledge on the part o=
f the learning mechanism. Such techniques have proven quite effective not o=
nly for simple pattern recognition tasks, but also, more surprisingly, for =
such tasks as language modeling in speech recognition using basic n-gram mo=
dels. However, when the structures to be learned become more complex, even =
large training sets become sparse relative to the task, and this sparsity c=
an only be mitigated if some prior knowledge comes into play to constrain t=
he space of fitted models. We currently see a strong emerging trend in the =
field of machine learning for text and language processing to incorporate s=
uch prior knowledge for instance in language modeling (e.g. through non-par=
ametric Bayesian priors) or in document modeling (e.g. through hierarchical=
 graphical models). There are complementary attempts in the field of statis=
tical computational linguistics (e.g in statistical machine translation) to=
 build hybrid systems that do not rely uniquely on corpus data, but also ex=
ploit some form of a priori grammatical knowledge, bridging the gap between=
 purely data-oriented approaches and the traditional purely rule-based appr=
oaches, that do not rely on automatic corpus training, but only indirectly =
on human observations about linguistic data. The domain of text and languag=
e processing thus appears as a very promising field for studying the intera=
ctions between prior knowledge and raw training data, and this workshop aim=
s at providing a forum for discussing recent theoretical and practical adva=
nces in this area.

TOPICS: The workshop aims at presenting a diversity of viewpoints on prior =
knowledge for language and text processing. Discussion of the following top=
ics, techniques and issues is encouraged (non-limitative):

* Prior knowledge for language modeling, parsing, translation
* Topic modeling for document analysis and retrieval
* Parametric and non-parametric Bayesian models in NLP
* Graphical models embodying structural knowledge of texts
* Complex features/kernels that incorporate linguistic knowledge;
  kernels built from generative models
* Limitations of purely data-driven learning techniques for text and
  language applications; performance gains due to incorporation of prior
  knowledge
* Typology of different forms of prior knowledge for NLP (knowledge
  embodied in generative Bayesian models, in MDL models, in ILP/logical
  models, in linguistic features, in representational frameworks, in
  grammatical rules ...)
* Formal principles for combining rule-based and data-based approaches
  to NLP
* Linguistic science and cognitive models as sources of prior knowledge

FORMAT: The workshop will consist of a mix of submitted papers, invited tal=
ks, and discussion/panels in which different viewpoints will be emphasized.=
  =


CALL FOR PAPERS: Researchers interested in presenting their work at the wor=
kshop should send an email (preferably plain text or pdf attachment) to ws_=
pktlp@xrce.xerox.com with the following information: =
