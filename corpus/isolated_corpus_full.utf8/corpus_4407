Meeting Description:

LEXVIN, the UNED based research group is pleased to announce the First
International Workshop on "Linguistics Approaches to Food and Wine Description"
 to be held at the Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia in Madrid
(Spain) on May 7-8, 2009. 

Call for Papers

The linguistic description of the tasting experience provides for excellent
arena where the complexities of this type of verbalization can be analyzed and
studied. 

A multisensory and interdisciplinary approach is needed in the coding and
decoding of the food and wine sensory descriptions. Because of this, the present
workshop provides an opportunity for a joint examination of sensory analysis and
to the evaluation of the role that different linguistic approaches can take when
dealing with this type of restricted lexicons. 

Finally, the development of lexical applications related to the world of food
and wine description is expected to show how the industry and this
field-dependent semantic research can benefit from a mutual collaboration.

Workshop Organizers:
Timothy Fowler and Gerald Penn, University of Toronto
{tfowler,gpenn}@cs.toronto.edu

Workshop Purpose:
Among computational linguists, there has been an enormous recent resurgence of
interest in parsing with categorial grammars, both because of their extreme
lexicalism and because of their well-defined connection to interpretable
semantic terms.  The recent work of Clarke, Curran and others on Combinatory
Categorial Grammars, and of Moot, Baldridge and others on multimodal extensions
of categorial grammar, in particular, has produced a collection of efficient and
expressive parsing tools that have only just begun to make an impact on tasks
such as the Pascal RTE challenge.  As the CL community attempts to push the
state of the art from mere syntactic annotation into parsers that actually allow
for semantic inference, CG's position can only improve.  At the same time, there
is no shortage of variations on "categorial grammar," and there has not to date
been a great deal of communication between the adherents of these various
strands on their relative linguistic or semantical merits, nor on more technical
concerns of algorithm design and numerical parametrization.

The aim of this workshop is to bring Ph.D. students and researchers in these
various strands to share and assess their progress in the spirit of promoting
categorial grammar's overall advancement.  The intended focus of this workshop
is the formal / computational side of CG research, with the intention of
representing work across all variations of categorial grammar.

Submission Details:
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract describing recent, completed
research (published or unpublished) dealing with this theme. Submissions should
be formatted in PDF or plain ASCII text only, and should not exceed 5 pages. 
Authors may anonymize their submissions at their discretion.

Please send your submission electronically as a MIME-encoded email attachment
to: tfowler@cs.toronto.edu

by the deadline listed below.  Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's
programme committee and additional reviewers, as necessary.

Accepted abstracts will be distributed by ESSLLI prior to the workshop, but no
formal, published proceedings are planned.

Workshop Format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the first week
of ESSLLI. There will be 2-3 slots for paper presentation and discussion per
session. On the first day the workshop, the organizers will present an
introduction to the topic.

Invited Speakers: TBA

Important Dates:
Submissions: March 6, 2009
Notification: April 15, 2009
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2009
ESSLLI early registration: May 1, 2009
Final papers for proceedings: May 15, 2009
Final programme: June 15, 2009
Workshop dates: July 20-24, 2009

Local Arrangements:
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register
for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will correspond
to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee. Moreover, a number of
additional fee waiver grants will be made available by the OC on a competitive
basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those.

There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. Workshop
speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should contact the local organizing
committee to ask for the possibilities for a grant.
