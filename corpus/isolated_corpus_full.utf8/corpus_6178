Meeting Description:

The seventh international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)
will be organised in 2010 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of
international associations and organisations.

In 12 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has become the
major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language
Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange
information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and
tools, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements
coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to
technological and organisational ones. 

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies
from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find
new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support
to investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies and
development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

you will acquaint yourself with the new form for the LREC Map.

We suggest to submit your abstract and the corresponding LREC Map information as

version of the abstract and the Map forms, at any time (before the call closure
