> "Knowlege is stories" - Roger Schank
>
> While much work in AI has represented simple knowledge about everyday
> life and activities at the word, sentence, and logical assertion
> level, we see a growing need to understand it at a larger granularity,
> that of stories. A story is a short, focused description of people and
> events occurring over time, that has a "point" -- to inform, teach,
> question, entertain, educate, illustrate or amuse.
>
> Capturing common sense knowledge often involves uncovering the
> implicit, unstated assumptions behind communication, often best
> expressed through stories.  Work in story representations dates back
> to Schank-style scripts and other efforts in the 80s, but recent
> developments have unleashed new potential in this area. The maturity
> of common sense knowledge bases such as Cyc, Open Mind and
> ThoughtTreasure; statistical and corpora-based natural language
> understanding techniques; the explosion of participatory knowledge
> collection over the Web; progress in cognitive science; the  =

> popularity of
> Web-based storytelling media such as blogs; and new common sense  =

> reasoning
> techniques are all enablers of the new generation of work on common
> sense stories.
>
>
> Topics include, but are by no means limited to:
>
>     * Story understanding and natural language understanding
>     * Extraction of common sense knowledge from stories
>     * A cognitive modeling based understanding of stories
>     * Common sense knowledge bases to facilitate story understanding
> and story generation
>     * Acquiring story knowledge from users or from the internet
>     * Representation and reasoning with story knowledge
>     * Blogs and nonlinear fiction and nonfiction media as a source of
> stories or as a domain
>     * Interfaces to facilitate storytelling by users in text, audio,
> pictures, and video media
