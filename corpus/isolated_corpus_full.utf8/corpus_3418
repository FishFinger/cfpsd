Location: Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Patrick Honeybone

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

The department of Linguistics and English Language at the University of
Edinburgh is proud to announce that the sixth Old World Conference in Phonology
(OCP6) will take place in Edinburgh from 22nd to 24th January 2009. OCP6 is
organised by a group of phonologists at Edinburgh, and it follows in the line of
previous OCP conferences, which have been held in Leiden, Troms√∏, Budapest,
Rhodes and Toulouse. 

Second Call for Papers

Abstracts for consideration for presentation as either talks or poster papers at
the conference are now invited.

The conference will be preceded (on 21st January) by a semi-separate workshop
entitled ''The Privative Project: is it still worth pursuing?'' Further details
about the workshop are now available on the conference website, and those
attending the OCP6 conference will certainly be welcome to attend the workshop,
too, at no extra cost. Abstracts addressing issues related to the workshop theme
will be welcome at the main conference, but there is no conference theme for
OCP6 at all, and abstracts on any phonological issue (theoretical or empirical)
in any language(s) and in any phonological framework are invited, as are
abstracts which deal with connections between phonology and psycholinguistics or
sociolinguistics (or any other area of linguistics).

Abstract Submission

This is a summary - please consult the website for full details:
www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ocp6

- There is no obligatory conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on
anything. Abstracts should be sent to Patrick Honeybone as attachments to an
email (patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk) by 15th September 2008.
- Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm or one inch
margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal
character spacing.
- Please send two copies of your abstract - one of these should be anonymous and
one should include your name, affiliation and email address at the top of the
page, directly below the title. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by
members of the organising committee.
- Please use one of these formats for your abstract: pdf, Word, or plain text.
If you need to use a phonetic font in your abstract, either embed it in a pdf
file, or use the Doulos SIL font.
- Full papers will last around 25 minutes with around 5 minutes for questions,
and we also have plans for a high-profile poster session. Please indicate
whether you would prefer to present your work only as an oral paper or a poster,
or whether you would be prepared to present it in either form.
- If you need technical equipment for your talk, please say so in the message
accompanying your abstract and we will do our best to provide it, although this
cannot be guaranteed.
- We aim to finalise the programme, and to contact abstract-senders by around
the end of September.

Further important details concerning abstract submission are available on the
conference website - please make sure that you consult these before submitting
an abstract: www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ocp6

Contact Details:
The main organiser for OCP6 is Patrick Honeybone. If you would like to attend or
