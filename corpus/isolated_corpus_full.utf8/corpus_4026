Full Title: Communication in Institutional Elderly Care 

Date: 01-Oct-2009 - 02-Oct-2009
Location: German Institute for Japanese Studies, Tokyo, Japan 
Contact Person: Peter Backhaus
Meeting Email: backhaus@dijtokyo.org

Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

This conference brings together researchers of communication in institutional
elderly care. Its aim is to get a better idea of the communicative properties of
caring facilities and to discuss differences and similarities in cross-cultural
comparison. 

Call for Papers

Population ageing is a worldwide phenomenon that poses great challenges to the
societies concerned. Among these challenges are an ever increasing number of
elderly people in need of institutional care. This conference takes a closer
look at the communicative properties of elderly care from a cross-cultural
perspective. 

As the small body of previous research into the topic suggests, communication in
the environment of an elderly people's home takes place under a set of
relatively extreme conditions that are absent from most other contexts of talk:
varying degrees of mental and/or physical deficiencies on the part of the
residents, recurrent discrepancies between the rules of a "total institution"
and the needs of its users, chronic scarcity of time, personnel and other
resources, and the necessity to provide, respectively accept, help with
performing intrusive and highly embarrassing actions like feeding, bathing, and
toileting. 

It can be assumed that these basic conditions apply to most elderly care
institutions in postmodern societies. The question is how they shape the way
people communicate in these settings and to what extent they differ across
different cultures. This conference brings together an international group of
specialists to discuss this question. Its aim is to get a better understanding
of the communicative properties of institutional elderly care and to discuss how
the relatively similar conditions under which interactants operate manifest
themselves in different cultures and languages.

The organizers particularly invite papers dealing with the topic within a
conversation or discourse analytical framework. For more information, please
contact Peter Backhaus at backhaus@dijtokyo.org.
