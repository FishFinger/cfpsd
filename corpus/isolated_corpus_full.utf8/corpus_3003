Call for Papers

PRESENCE 2008 

11th Annual International Workshop on Presence
Padova, Italy
October 16-18, 2008
Second Call for Papers
Submission deadline (extended): May 23, 2008

Overview:

Academics and practitioners with an interest in the concept of (tele)presence
are invited to submit their work for presentation at the 11th Annual
International Workshop on Presence, to be held in Padova, Italy, on October
16-18, 2008. 

Often described as a sense of ''being there'' in a mediated environment,
telepresence is broadly defined as a psychological state or subjective
perception in which a person fails to accurately and completely acknowledge the
role of technology in an experience. It is a rich, fascinating subject of
scientific investigation, artistic exploration and diverse application, with
increasingly important implications for the ways in which people interact and
technologies are developed. Designing technologies and imagining practices to
modify, prolong and reconfigure the possibilities of being present has been a
continuous endeavor of the human species, from early attempts at constructing
communication and transportation devices, to the many current technologies we
continue to develop to reach other places and people. Originally focused on
bringing ''presence'' from the real world to a simulated one, the phenomenon is
today analyzed and investigated in the context of diverse environments and
involves questioning simple distinctions between ''real'' and ''artificial''.
This opening to a wide range of mediated environments is accompanied by a
growing involvement of different research fields that are continuously updating
and modifying the contours of presence scholarship. The phenomenon of presence
is challenging from a scientific point of view as much as it is viable in
everyday life, where people participate in simultaneous mediated experiences,
feeling present or co-present in digital locations without any need for explicit
instructions and orchestrating technical and cognitive resources to control and
enhance presence. What it means to be present in mediated environments is then
an extremely relevant and enticing question, bearing all sorts of implications
for the design and application of diverse technologies.

Topics:

Continuing with the series of annual workshops, PRESENCE 2008 will provide an
open discussion forum to share ideas regarding concepts, measurement techniques,
technologies, and applications related to presence. Issues of prominent interest
include (but are not limited to): 

- Presence in shared virtual environments and online communities 
- Presence in social interactions with virtual agents and digital counterparts 
- Real bodies, avatars and cyborgs 
- Presence and ubiquity with mobile and geo-location technologies 
- Presence as a socio-cultural achievement; practices, preferences and material
resources to manifest presence 
- Realistic action in virtual environments 
- Parasocial interaction and relationships 
- Cognitive processes and the sense of presence 
- Linguistic and non-verbal strategies to create, negotiate and challenge
presence in mediated environments 
- Neuropsychology of presence 
- Presence affordances in digital technologies 
- 3D sound, acoustic environments and presence 
- Advanced broadcast and cinematic displays (stereoscopic TV, HDTV, IMAX) 
- Haptic and tactile displays 
- Holography 
- Affective and socio-affective interfaces 
- Presence analysis, evaluation, and measurement techniques 
- Causes and consequences (effects) of presence 
- Presence augmentation through social, physical, and contextual cues 
- Presence, involvement and digital addiction 
- Presence applications (education and training; medicine; e-health and
cybertherapy; entertainment; communication and collaboration; teleoperation;
usability and design; art and performance, etc.) 
- Presence theory; historical investigation of presence concepts; fictions,
constructions and realism; transportation, flow, absorption, awareness;
philosophical perspectives on presence 
- Ethical and societal implications of presence technologies 
- The future of presence experiences

Original, high quality papers are sought which make substantial contributions to
the field. All accepted papers will be collected in the printed volume (with
ISBN) of the official conference Proceedings, and will also be permanently
available for download on the ISPR conference archive (http://ispr.info).
Authors may also be invited to revise their paper for publication in a special

Reality (ISSN: 1359-4338/1434-9957)
