Meeting Description

An international conference on metrics, organised by the Nordic Society for
Metrical Studies in cooperation with the University of Iceland and the Árni
Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, Reykjavík. 

Call for Papers

The theme of the conference will be: Germanic Features in Nordic and European
Poetry, Linguistic and Literary Aspects. Our invited speakers will be:

We plan to have a special session on medieval Nordic poetry as represented in
the eddic and skaldic forms, and described by Snorri Sturluson, who lived,
worked and died (in 1241) in Reykholt. In his terminology, the distinctive
traits or branches (greinir) of poetry were those of diction (mál), sound
(hljóð) and number (tala). 

Submissions are invited for 30-minute papers on the linguistic and literary
aspects of metres and poetry. (Languages: Danish, English, Norwegian and Swedish.)

Meeting Description

Reflecting the diverse research interests of the Department of German, this
conference will feature panels on literature, cultural studies, linguistics and
Second Language Acquisition. 

10th Annual Graduate Student Conference
Department of German
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Madison, WI
Spring 2008

Deadline for submission of proposals extended to January 25th, 2008

Recognizing (Dis)Order

"Aufgabe von Kunst heute ist es, Chaos in die Ordnung zu bringen"
	-Th. W. Adorno, "Minima Moralia"

Ist alles in Ordnung? Muss Ordnung sein? Herrscht hier Ordnung? Erhält Ordnung
die Welt? In the 10th Annual Graduate Student Conference of the German and Dutch
Graduate Students' Association at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we will
explore the concept of order and its inevitable subversion and disruption in
German and Dutch literature, culture and language. How is structure conceived
of, implemented, and regulated? How do individuals negotiate between conformity,
resistance and rebellion in both the private and the public sphere? How does the
concept of order regulate literary and artistic production? How do we approach
and receive the apparent order in texts? How is language structured, regulated
and changed?

Reflecting the diverse research interests of the Department of German, this
conference will feature panels on literature, cultural studies, linguistics and
Second Language Acquisition.

We will consider abstracts dealing with the concept of order in all areas of
Germanic linguistics, including phonetics, syntax, morphology, and socio- and
historical linguistics. Possible topics might address:

Prescriptive and descriptive grammars
Word order and syntax
Learner resistance and curriculum issues
Language contact and koinés

Abstracts on literary and cultural topics may include but are not limited to the
following themes:

1) Individual measure, moderation and excess
	(Dis)orderly bodies and minds
Ostracism, exclusion, crisis (Nachdenken über Christa T. by Christa Wolf)
	The gendered body and mind
	Repression, digression, psychosis
	Family politics (Das Muschelessen by Birgit Vanderbeke)
The invention and performance of tradition

2) Revolution, war and peace
	Class conflict and social hierarchy (Kabale und Liebe by Friedrich Schiller)
	Defining utopia vs. dystopia 
	Social upheaval and times of political instability
	Representations of natural and/or man-made disasters (Der Schimmelreiter by T.
Storm) 
	Germany's place in the world 

3) Structuring narrative:
	Textual order and narrative disruption
Ordering of time and space (Das Ornament der Masse by Sigfried Kracauer)
	Narratological hierarchies and taxonomies
	Rephrasing genre (fairy tales, detective literature, the Bildungsroman, etc.)

Abstracts of no more than 250 words must be received by January 25, 2008.
Submissions should not bear the author's name. Please include the following
information as a separate attachment: name, title of paper, department and
university affiliation if applicable, and reliable contact information. Papers
should not exceed 20 minutes in length (8-10 pages) to allow for 10 minutes of
discussion after your presentation. Pending availability, some travel funds may
be available, but participants are strongly encouraged to seek support from
their home institutions.
