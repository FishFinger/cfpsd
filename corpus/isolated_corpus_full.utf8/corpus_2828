Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

We at the Alaska Native Language Center (ANLC), University of Alaska Fairbanks,
are planning an informal workshop on how linguistic knowledge can form a link
between scientific inquiry and indigenous perspectives of climate. Participants
will include linguists, natural scientists, and cultural anthropologists as well
as speakers of indigenous languages. 

Call for Papers

Deadline extended! New deadline: March 31, 2008.

This workshop focuses on the question: How can knowledge of the language (both
speaking expertise and knowledge of linguistic structure) inform natural
science?  Discussion of this question will be facilitated both by paper
presentations and by discussion groups focused on particular topics:

Topic 1: Comparing vocabularies:  How does knowledge of indigenous
classifications (e.g. of land/landforms, ice, water etc.) inform scientific
research? (depending on the number of suggestions, we can break this topic up
into several subtopics)

Topic 2:  What can we learn from Oral Histories?

Topic 3:  Naming systems:  Place names and month/season names. What do these
names tell us about climate change?

We invite abstract submissions for all topics mentioned above. We are open to
your suggestions as we further refine (and add to) the structure of the
workshop; however, native language must be a significant factor in all discussions.

We would especially like to see proposals for ''mixed'' group presentations
including a speaker of a relevant native language.

For questions and abstract submissions, please contact Olga@lithophile.com
