TeMA-2007

Workshop on Text Mining and Applications



TeMA-2007 will be held at the 13^th Portuguese Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence (EPIA 2007), in Guimarães, Portugal, 3-7 December 2007. 
This workshop is organized under the auspices of the Portuguese 
Association for Artificial Intelligence (APPIA).

EPIA 2007 URL: http://epia2007.appia.pt/

This announcement contains:

[1] Workshop description; [2] Topics of interest; [3] Important dates; 
[4] Paper submission; [5] Workshop fees; [6] Organizing Committee; [7] 
Program Committee and [8] Contacts.

[1] Workshop Description:

Pure symbolic methods for Language Processing alone are unable to 
address human languages complexity. Text Mining and Machine Learning 
techniques applied to text, raw or annotated, brought up new insights 
and completely shifted the approaches to Human Language Technologies. 
Both approaches, when duly integrated, bridge the gap between language 
theories and effective use of languages, and enable important 
applications. Our aim, with this workshop, is to bring together 
innovative contributions to fill in this gap.

Authors are invited to submit their papers on any of the issues 
identified below. Papers will be blindly reviewed by three members of 
the Programme Committee. Best papers will be published at Springer, in 
LNAI series. If there are additional papers whose quality is 
sufficiently high for deserving to be presented at TEMA07, those other 
accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

[2] Topics of Interest

Text Mining from raw and/or annotated text:

    - Pattern extraction methodologies.
    - Document Clustering/Classification.
    - Document Summarization.
    - Topic segmentation of documents.
    - Word and Multi-word Sense Disambiguation.
    - Semantic Restrictions extraction.
    - Word and multi-word translation extraction.
    - Algorithms and Data Structures for Text Mining.

Applications:

    - Natural Language Processing.
    - Example-Based/Statistical Machine Translation.
    - Intelligent Information Retrieval.
    - Multilingual access to multilingual information.
    - Question-Answering Systems.
    - E-training and E-learning.

[3] Important dates

30-June-07: Paper submission deadline

28-July-07: Author notification

01-Sept-07: Deadline for final camera-ready papers

[4] Paper submission

    *

      Submissions must be full technical papers on substantial,
      original, and previously unpublished research.

    *

      Submissions must follow the guidelines specified in the conference
      site. Authors must remove their names from the submitted papers,
      and should take reasonable care not to indirectly disclose their
      identity. The Springer LNCS format must be used (instructions in
      _www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
      <http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html>_). 12 pages is the
      maximum length of the papers accepted for this Workshop. Extra
      pages will be charged by the Conference Organization.

    *

      Paper submissions will be made in PDF format, through the
      submission page available in EPIA 2007 website
      http://epia2007.appia.pt/.
