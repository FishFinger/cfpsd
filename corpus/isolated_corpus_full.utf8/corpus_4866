Meeting Description:

'Current Trends in Grammaticalization Research' is a two-day workshop on new
developments in theorizing about grammaticalization and related phenomena. 

Second Call for papers

Current Trends in Grammaticalization Research
University of Groningen, October 8-9, 2009

The study of grammaticalization and related phenomena continues to be a thriving
branch of historical linguistics. Where the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st
century witnessed a special interest in definitional issues, recent theorizing
has been focusing on a synthesis of grammaticalization studies and other
disciplines, such as psycholinguistics, contact linguistics, and Construction
Grammar. These novel perspectives, based on an increasing body of data
(including work from non-Indo-European languages), provoke new and interesting
questions about the very nature of grammaticalization, degrammaticalization, and
lexicalization.

This two-day workshop aims to bring together theoretical and empirical
approaches to grammaticalization, degrammaticalization, and lexicalization, and
we therefore welcome both theoretical and data-oriented submissions. Topics
include (but are not restricted to):

- the grammaticalization-lexicalization interface
- the status of pragmaticalization
- contact-induced grammaticalization
- psycholinguistic approaches to directional tendencies
- grammaticalization, degrammaticalization, and lexicalization within a
constructional framework
- grammaticalization and morphological theory 
- grammaticalization and syntactic theory 

Plenary speakers
We are pleased to announce the following plenary speakers:
- Hans-Olav Enger, University of Oslo
- Nikolaus Himmelmann, University of Münster
- Graeme Trousdale, University of Edinburgh
- Jacqueline Visconti, University of Genova

Abstracts
We invite abstracts for 30-minute papers (including ten minutes discussion
time). Abstracts should not exceed a maximum of 400 words, including references.
Please note that the deadline for abstract submission is April 15, 2009.
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by May 15, 2009. 

Abstracts can only be submitted through the Easy Abstracts facility at Linguist 
List at http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/CTGR2009. You can upload your
abstract as either .doc or .pdf. Please use the latter format if your abstract
contains special fonts.

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
