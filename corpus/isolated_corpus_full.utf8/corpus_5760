â¢       strategies for building online health communities and developing long-term engagement
â¢       motivating information-sharing, content development, and contribution to policy
â¢       health education and policy development: developing trusted content
â¢       tailoring health information
â¢       methods/techniques to provide motivational support
â¢       trust, ethics, and related issues in online health-related communities.
