Reminder: Call for Short Papers for NAACL HLT 2009

May 31  June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado

Deadline for short paper submission  Monday, February 9, 2009
Special sessions: Large Scale Language Processing, and Speech Indexing 
and Retrieval

NAACL HLT 2009 combines the Annual Meeting of the North American 
Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) with the Human 
Language Technology Conference (HLT) of NAACL. The conference 
covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working towards enabling 
intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural language, 
and towards enhancing human-human communication through services 
such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information 
retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction. 
NAACL HLT 2009 will feature full papers, short papers, posters,
demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as well as pre- and 
post-conference tutorials and workshops.

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial, 
original, and unpublished research in disciplines that could 
impact human language processing systems. We encourage the 
submission of short papers that can be characterized as a 
small, focused contribution, a work in progress, a negative 
result, an opinion piece or  an interesting application note. 
A separate review form for short papers will be introduced 
this year.

NAACL HLT 2009 aims to hold two special sessions, Large Scale Language 
Processing and Speech Indexing and Retrieval.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are 
understood to be applied to speech and/or text:

- Large scale language processing
- Speech indexing and retrieval
- Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
- Information extraction
- Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human-robot 
interaction, education and learning systems, assistive technologies, 
digital entertainment)
- Machine translation
- Summarization
- Question answering
- Topic classification and information filtering
- Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/genre analysis)
- Topic clustering
- Text and speech mining
- Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
- Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
- Language generation
- Speech synthesis
- Speech understanding
- Speech analysis and recognition
- Multilingual processing
- Phonology
- Morphology (including word segmentation)
- Part of speech tagging
- Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
- Word sense disambiguation
- Lexical semantics
- Formal semantics and logic
- Textual entailment and paraphrasing
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Dialog systems
- Knowledge acquisition and representation
- Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
- Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, 
annotated corpora)
- Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information structure and 
sources in speech)
- Multimodal representations and processing, including speech and gesture
