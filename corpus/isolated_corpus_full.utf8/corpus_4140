Conference on Semantics and Modelisation, JSM09

Last Call for Papers

The GDR Sémantique et Modélisation (CNRS) and the UMR 7110 (CNRS &
University Paris Diderot-Paris 7) organize the seventh edition of the
Conference on Semantics and Modelisation (JSM09). The conference will
be held in Paris, on April 9-10, 2009.

The goal of the conference is to promote research on the formalisation of
linguistic meaning and interpretation with the help of formal models. In view of
the development of corpus-based research in semantics and related fields,
proposals articulating the use of corpora and representational problems in
semantics and pragmatics are particularly welcome.

Topics
We invite abstracts that address any problem in the modelling of linguistic
meaning and interpretation. This includes but is not limited to the following
topics:
- syntax / semantics interface,
- logical formalization,
- tense and aspect,
- lexical meaning,
- functional words (determiners, pronouns, etc.),
- information structure,
- presuppositions and implicatures,
- speech acts,
- discourse relations in text and dialogue.

Submission Conditions
Abstracts must be anonymous. They should be 2 pages long including references,
examples and figures. They should have a 1 inch margin on all four sides and use
at least a 11 points font. Files may be in plain text, PDF, RTF or MS Word.
Names and affiliations should be indicated in the body of the message. 

Proposals should be sent at jsm09{at}free.fr no later than January 8, 2009.
