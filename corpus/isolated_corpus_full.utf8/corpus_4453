Meeting Description:

The Manchester Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence (JMCE) has recently been awarded
Arts and Humanities Research Council funds to intensify its PhD training
provision. As part of its commitment to postgraduate learning and training, the
Centre is organising on 26 June 2009 a PhD conference on the topic of European
Minorities in Cross-Disciplinary Perspective. 

Call for Papers

PhD Conference on European Minorities in Cross-Disciplinary Perspective 

PhD students researching European minority groups from any disciplinary angle
(e.g. linguistics, law, history, education, cultural studies) are invited to
submit an abstract for the conference. Students from JMCE-affiliated
universities are particularly encouraged to submit an abstract. Questions to be
addressed at the conference could include (but are not limited to):
- What role have minority languages played in state-building?
- What legal provisions are there for minorities and what changes are being
lobbied, why, and by whom?
- How do minority-related issues hamper progress in countries with aspirations
to join the EU (cf. Kurds in Turkey)?
- How do we address issues related to 'transnational minorities' such as Roma,
and what educational and legal provisions are there, or are there planned, for
these linguistic minority groups?
- What support for, and resistance to, linguistic minorities is there within
European space and why?
- What transformations are anticipated in the field for the second decade of the
20th century?

A number of high-profile guest speakers will give plenary talks including
Professor Patrick Stevenson (Southampton) and Professor Dieter Halwachs (Graz).

Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

This Workshop on Head Movement and Locality is organized as part of the
Conference on Minimalist Approaches to Syntactic Locality, to be held in
Budapest on 26-28th August 2009. 

Call for Papers

Invited speakers of the MASL conference:
Adriana Belletti (Siena)
Cedric Boeckx (Harvard>Barcelona) (t.b.c.)
Carlo Cecchetto & Caterina Donati (Milano & Roma)
Marcel den Dikken (CUNY)
Gisbert Fanselow (Potsdam)
Gereon MÃ¼ller (Leipzig)
Norvin Richards (MIT)
Eric Reuland (Utrecht)
Luigi Rizzi (Siena)

Head Movement, a syntactic transformation affecting head-level syntactic
elements, figured prominently in much of the research carried out within the
frame of GB theory as well as within early minimalism. The restrictive character
of the minimalist program, however, prompted a critical re-examination of this
operation, which exhibits several features that make it appear different from
other syntactic movements. Central among these properties is the nature of the
locality that Head Movement appears to be characterized by.

Various alternative approaches to head movement (HM) phenomena are currently
being explored within the minimalist framework, some reducing it to phrasal
movement, some others retaining Head Movement proper in narrow syntax, and again
others treating it at the PF interface. These different approaches put
intriguing new questions on the research agenda, and permit old ones to be
formulated and addressed in novel ways. Of these issues, some outstanding ones 
directly pertaining to the conference theme of syntactic locality will be
discussed at the workshop, to which abstracts are invited for 40-minute
presentations (30'+10'). 

Possible questions for discussion include, but are not limited to, the following:
How do genuine syntactic head movement, phrasal (remnant) movement, and PF
accounts of 'head movement' phenomena fare in capturing their salient empirical
properties, including the nature of their locality? What arguments can be found
that strongly argue in favor of, or against, one of these accounts or another?
How can the general strict locality of head movement, and any (possibly
apparent) exceptions therefrom, be reduced to elementary properties of the grammar?
What symmetries and asymmetries exist between HM and phrasal movement, and what
do they derive from?
How are the locality properties of HM related to its trigger?
In what component of the grammar are 'affix lowering' phenomena to be treated?
Does covert syntactic HM exist?
How do 'head movements' and phrasal movements interact?
Does HM affect (e.g., extend) local domains? If so, how?
How is the 'Mirror Principle' generalization, and any (possibly apparent)
exceptions therefrom, to be properly derived in lexicalist or in 'late lexical
insertion' models?
Are overt incorporation phenomena to be analyzed as syntactic head movement? How
are they to be treated in lexicalist or in 'late lexical insertion' models? 

Deadline for Abstracts: 15 April 2009

Selected papers from the conference and workshop will be considered for
peer-reviewed (book or special journal issue) publication. 
Authors of selected high quality abstracts that do not make it into an oral
presentation will be invited to give their paper as a poster.

Abstract Submission:
An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract (to the main MASL
conference session and to the workshop, taken together). Abstracts must be
uploaded in pdf format through the interface accessible from the conference
website. Abstracts should be anonymous, and at most two A4 pages (including data
and references) in 12-point font with 1-inch margins all around.

Notification of acceptance: 30 April 2009
