Abstract:

This work investigates the form and function of the imperative in the
Rigveda. All of the forms of the imperative are covered from a
morphological, syntactical and semantic standpoint. There is a
comprehensive section on stem-ablaut and accentuation, as well as an
individual treatment of each verb ending. Special forms such as those in
-t?t and -si  have sections devoted to them, as do the modal aorist
injunctives.

The relationship between the present and aorist imperatives is discussed in
a completely new light.  The aorist imperative is shown to be a moribund
archaism at the time of the Rigveda - more so in the late tenth book -
which functions as a metrical variant of the present imperative, with no
functional difference existing between the two forms. An exception to this
is fixed formulae, in which the ancient, pre-Vedic difference between these
forms is preserved.

Finally, in the index of attested forms, there is a treatment of every
attested imperative form in the Rigveda. All attested imperative forms are
noted, their grammatical classification, and their frequency. Many verbs
are discussed in detail, and copious examples from the text are given.

Abstract:

Syntactic Processing in Developmental Dyslexia and in Specific Language
Impairment: A study on the acquisition of the past participle construction
in Dutch 

This dissertation aims to identify linguistic precursors of developmental
dyslexia. Currently, dyslexic children are diagnosed only after they have
tried (and failed) to acquire reading skills.  Ideally, dyslexic children
should be identified before the onset of reading instruction. An early
diagnosis could lead to early intervention which, in turn, could have a
positive effect on dyslexics' reading ability. Since dyslexia is a genetic
disorder, a viable way to identify linguistic precursors of dyslexia is to
study the language development of children with a genetic risk of
developing dyslexia. This dissertation focuses on morphosyntactic
development in children at risk for dyslexia, and more precisely on these
children's mastery of the past participle construction.  The development of
the at-risk children is compared to that of normally developing children
and to children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). 

This thesis shows that children with a predisposition for dyslexia differ
from normally developing children in their morphosyntactic development.
With regard to their perception and production of the past participle
construction, the at-risk children do not exhibit deviant morphosyntactic
development. However, their representation of the morphosyntactic
dependency underlying the past participle construction seems vulnerable. In
complex sentences, the at-risk children generate ungrammatical
constructions and omit functional items such as auxiliaries, determiners
and verbal morphology. The behaviour of the at-risk children is best
accounted for by assuming that they suffer from a limited processing
capacity that affects their control over morphosyntactic dependency relations. 

This dissertation is of relevance to scholars in the fields of reading- and
language disorders as well as to clinicians working with dyslexic and/or
language impaired children.

Abstract:

While ideology has been treated widely in CDA-literature, the role played
by the interaction of text and image in multiplying meaning and furthering
ideological stances has not so far received a lot of attention. 
Mediating Ideology in Text and Image offers a number of approaches to such
analysis, offering students and academics valuable tools for identifying
possible discrepancies between the world and the way it is represented
through various mediational means. The authors' common aim is one of
assisting the audience in reading between the lines, thus offering a
variety of approaches that may contribute to a better understanding of how
ideologies possibly work and how they may be denaturalised from text and
image. 

The articles in part I look at rethorical strategies used in meaning
construction processes unfolding in various kinds of mass media. Part II
focuses on the re-semiotization of meaning and looks at how analysing the
combination of text and image may contribute to a better understanding of
ideological processes brought about by multimodal resources. Foreword by
Ruth Wodak.

Abstract:

Concepts such as dependability/generalization and inferences are dealt with
implicitly or explicitly in any research undertaken in applied linguistics.
This volume provides a well-balanced and cross-disciplinary perspective on
how researchers conceptualize inferences about learner acquisition and
performances as well as dependability and generalizability of findings. 

The book is a collection of chapters by prominent researchers in applied
linguistics, working in diverse domains such as vocabulary, syntax,
discourse analysis, SLA, and language testing. The goal of the book is to
bring attention to these issues, which underpin much of applied linguistics
research and to highlight what is considered good practice so as to
buttress confidence in the research claims made. 

The book represents current thinking on fundamental research concepts in
applied linguistics and can be used as a textbook in courses on research
methodology in applied linguistics. The book is also an excellent source of
in-depth analysis of research conceptualization for applied linguistics
researchers and graduate students.

Subject: Individuality of Novel Usage of Present Perfect 
 


To whom it may concern,

For my dissertation project at the Free University of Brussels I have
chosen a corpus-based study of the forms, functions and distribution of the
Preterite and Present Perfect in American and British English.

I am especially interested in novel uses of the Present Perfect such as ''I
have seen him yesterday''. According to Gachelin this novel usage ''can
even occassionally be already seen at work inside marginal trends of
Standard English''. This novel use is thought of as particularly British
and contrasts with the traditional view that the present perfect cannot
combine with past time adverbials. 

It is my guess that this novel use will occur significantly more if a first
person singular pronoun is the subject of a situation that is described by
a present perfect in combination with a past time adverbial. At some
subconscious level, a shift in perspective like this (reference time being
moved from overlapping with the moment of speaking to a time-span situated
entirely before that moment) is too personal and unorthodox for the speaker
to be imposed upon a hearer or some third party. At least, that is one of
my hypotheses.

Unfortunately, I cannot find anything in the literature on the
grammaticization of the present perfect to a past tense that supports or
relates to this hypothesis. Therefore, any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated. I am also interested in articles relating to the degree of
individuality that is involved in grammaticization of the present perfect
(or grammaticization in general), that is in articles that deal with the
role of the individual language user in the process of grammaticization.

Yours sincerely,

Linguistic Field(s): Writing Systems 

Meeting Description: 

This lustrum workshop offers a forum of discussion between researchers from different fields of writing research (theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics or language education), from different countries and working on different languages. 

Constraints on Spelling Changes 
Fifth International Workshop on Writing Systems 
Center for Language Studies, Interfaculty Research Unit for Language and Speech, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, October 5 - October 6, 2006. 

The aim of this series of workshops is to focus on all aspects of scientific research of written language. In particular, we welcome: 

- Psycholinguistic research on the influence of deep or more surface orthographies on pronunciation and morphological awareness, on learning to read and spell, and on dysfunctions in reading and spelling. 

- Research evaluating alternative spelling methods, within one language, or across languages, taking not only the perspective of the writer, but also addressing the question how (different) writing systems take the reader's perspective into account when representing the sounds of a language. 

- Computational models that shed light on the relation between sounds on the one hand, and letters, diacritics and punctuation on the other hand. 

The topic of the present workshop, constraints on spelling changes, is inspired by the ongoing spelling reforms for languages such as Dutch and German. It will address the (limited) possibilities of optimizing writing systems, such as learnability, and linguistic, psycholinguistic, sociolinguistic, historical and practical constraints. We plan to publish a selection of papers of the workshop as an issue of the journal 'Written Language and Literacy'. 

Submission deadline: May 1, 2006 
Notice of acceptance: June 1, 2006 

FORMAT OF SUBMISSIONS: Authors should submit abstracts of max. 1 page for 30 minute presentations, with 15 minutes discussion. Please submit abstracts electronically (rtf, pdf or Word) to E.Segers@pwo.ru.nl. 

PARTICIPATION: Researchers who want to attend the workshop without presenting a paper are also invited. Such participants should register at the address above, iwtssecr@mpi.nl. Information on lodging and travel directions, the program and the abstracts of the accepted papers will be circulated electronically well before the workshop.
