                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                            Workshop on
       Artificial Intelligence Methods for Ambient Intelligence

      at the European Conference on Ambient Intelligence (AmI'07)
              Darmstadt, Germany, November 7 - 10, 2007
                    http://www.ami-07.org/workshops.html

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is the vision of our future environment.
It will be surrounded by various kinds of interfaces supported by
computing and networking technology providing an intelligent,
seamless and non-obtrusive assistance to the humans. The ambient
environment will be aware of the presence and identity of the
humans, it will be able to communicate in multi-modal form and to
anticipate the humans' goals and needs in order to provide best
possible assistance to them. This broad vision addresses all areas
of human life, such as home, work, health care, travel and leisure
activities.

Within the interdisciplinary research aiming at approaching this
vision, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a rich set of methods
for implementing the "intelligence bit" of the AmI vision. Speech
recognition, image interpretation, learning (from user interaction),
reasoning (about users' goals and intensions) and planning
(appropriate user interaction) are core features of AmI to which AI
can contribute significantly.

The goal of this workshop is to make a step forward towards a common
understanding of how AI can contribute to the AmI vision and how to
align AI research with it. For this purpose we solicit contributions
of the following kind:

Papers describing the application of AI methods in any kind of AmI
scenario. These contributions should clearly describe the
application scenario, the AI method(s) used and their purpose, and
which of the particular difficulties in AmI are addressed in this
work.

Papers addressing the relationship between AI and AmI in general,
including architectures and models for AmI systems based on AI
principles.


Submissions
-----------
We solicit papers of up to 10 pages, written in English language,
which should conform to the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) style. All submitted papers will be reviewed by at
least two members of the program committee and selected according to
their significance to the workshop, their originality, quality, and
potential impact. The accepted papers will be published in a
proceedings volume. We also intend to publish extended versions of
selected papers in a Journal volume.

To submit a paper, please visit the workshop web page.


Workshop Format
--------------
The workshop will take place at November 10, 2007 as a full-day
workshop. It is open to all interested AmI-07 conference
participants. One author from each accepted paper will be required
to attend the workshop to present their work. This implies the
registration at the AmI-07 conference.
