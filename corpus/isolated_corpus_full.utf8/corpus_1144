START OF COMPETITION: FEBRUARY 26
END OF COMPETITION: APRIL 1


The main purpose of this workshop is to analyze and discuss the
results of systems participating in the SemEval-2007 evaluations, to
be held in February-March 2007. Nineteen different tasks are planned
for SemEval, to conduct evaluations of systems that perform automatic
semantic analysis of text, covering a wide range of aspects of
semantics and multilinguality.

Background and motivation
------------------------------------

There are now many computer systems that do automatic semantic
analysis of text. The purpose of SemEval is to evaluate the strengths
and weaknesses of such systems with respect to different words,
relations, types of texts, different varieties of language, and
different languages.

This workshop is a follow-up to the Senseval series of workshops on
semantic evaluation. Senseval-1 took place in the summer of 1998 for
English, French, and Italian, culminating in a workshop held at
Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex, England on September 2-4.  Senseval-2
took place in the summer of 2001, and was followed by a workshop held
in July 2001 in Toulouse, in conjunction with ACL-2001.  It included
tasks for 12 languages. Senseval-3 took place in the spring of 2004,
and was followed by a workshop held in July 2004 in Barcelona, in
conjunction with ACL-2004. More than 55 teams participated with over
160 systems in its 16 tasks.

For this fourth edition, Senseval is changing its name to SemEval (for
Semantic Evaluation). The change of name is motivated by a desire to
broaden the spectrum of accepted works to all aspects of computational
semantic analysis of language. In the call for task proposals we
especially encouraged the proposal of tasks for different languages,
cross-lingual tasks, and tasks that are relevant to particular NLP
applications such as machine translation, information retrieval and
information extraction.

In recent years, the deployment of multiple semantic lexicons and
accordingly tagged corpora (WordNet-SemCor, VerbNet-PropBank, FrameNet
and Prague Dependency Treebank, to name a few) have radically changed
the way semantic analysis is performed, especially at the
disambiguation stage. Some of the proposals at SemEval 2007 are trying
to take this one step further by proposing multiple layers of semantic
annotation of the same corpus (e.g., senses, roles, name-entity
classes), allowing for novel research to be performed.
