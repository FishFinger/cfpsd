Meeting Description

'Perspectives on Slavistics 3' is the third international conference on Slavic
languages and literatures. It will take place in Hamburg, Germany, August 28-31,
2008. The deadline for abstract submission is March 31, 2008. 

Second Call for Papers

The Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Hamburg and the
Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Tuebingen are pleased 
to announce the Third International Conference ''Perspectives on Slavistics''.
The conference will take place in Hamburg, Germany, on August 28-31, 2008. 
The goals of the conference are to encourage the study of Slavic languages 
and literatures and to establish connections among scholars working in these 
areas. 

The following keynote speakers have accepted the invitation to present at 
the conference:

- Patrice Dabrowski, Harvard University (USA)
- Gerd Hentschel, University of Oldenburg (Germany)
- Mikhail Iampolski, New York University (USA)
- Marek Lazinski, University of Warsaw (Poland)
- Karel Oliva, Czech Academy of Sciences (Czech Republic)
- Danko Sipka, Arizona State University (USA)
- Galin Tihanov, University of Manchester (UK)

Submissions from any scholar working on Slavic languages or literatures are
welcomed, including those in Slavic departments, as well as in specialized
linguistics or literature departments. We particularly want to encourage
young scholars to participate in this conference. Papers will be considered
on topics relating to the diachronic or synchronic study of Slavic languages
and literatures from any theoretical perspective. 

There will be a special session on Electronic Resources of Slavic Languages. 
The aim of the special session is to provide a forum for exchange of information
regarding the recent developments in the composition and design, construction
and use of different types of resources for Slavic languages. We encourage
submissions reporting on, but not limited to:

- corpora (large and small, general and genre-specific, annotated and   
non-annotated, single language and parallel corpora, spoken and written language
corpora, treebanks);
- wide-coverage grammars;
- computational lexicons, electronic terminology databases, dictionaries (mono-
and multilingual);
- speech collections;
- wordnets, framenets, ontologies;
- tools for acquisition, construction, annotation and management of language
resources.

Each paper submitted to the conference will be allowed thirty minutes (including
10 minutes for discussion). Presentations should be in English in order to open
the conference up to researchers working on non-Slavic languages and
literatures. Data projectors and overhead projectors will be provided upon
request. The deadline for submissions is March 31, 2008 (submission information
and abstract specifications see below). 

The participation fee will be 80 euros (40 euros for graduate students and
passive participants), to be paid in advance. Detailed information on payment
options and local arrangements will be provided by May 2008. The participation
fee covers the abstract booklet, other conference materials, refreshments and
snacks. 

Submission information and abstract specifications:

Abstracts for 20 minute talks (plus 10 minute discussion) should:

- be anonymous;
- not exceed 500 words (plus an additional page for tables, figures and
references, if necessary);
- use one-column format, Times New Roman, 12pt, single-spacing;
- use the international transcription of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters;
- be in Adobe PDF format (please do include all fonts in PDF documents).

Your abstract should present a hypothesis and outline your plan for defending
that hypothesis, i.e., it should specify research question(s), an approach /
method to the data, and obtained results. Each abstract will be anonymously
reviewed by independent reviewers.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair Conference
Manager at:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pos3

multilingualism. In addition, sociolinguistic accounts in the study of languages
in contact will also be the focus of this event.

recognised experts in multilingualism and language acquisition. Concurrent
sessions will address sociolinguistic or/and acquisitional perspectives in the
study of multilingualism.

Abstracts are invited from interested participants for parallel session papers
and for symposia. We welcome original and previously unpublished papers on
research on acquisition or use of three or more languages and on experiences
dealing with languages in contact. 
There will be one session addressing multilingualism & cross-cultural
communication to fit one of the objectives of the Compostela Group of
Universities - Working group on Multilingualism and Cross-cultural
Communication. This session will focus on the topic: political trends and
existing linguistic policies. Papers on the topic are also welcome.

Topics include: 
 
Acquisition of languages beyond the second one. Focus on specific variables.
Multilingual education.
Education and the promotion of multilingualism. Case Studies.
Sociolinguistic studies of multilinguals in their communities.
