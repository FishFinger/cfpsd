E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: call for submissions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and 
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to 
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and 
Information. Submissions are invited for 2005. The prize will be awarded 
to the best dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. in the year 2005. The 
dissertations will be judged on technical depth and strength, 
originality, and impact made in at least two of the three fields of 
Logic, Language, and Computation.

Who qualifies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree 
in the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st, 
2005 and December 31st, 2005. There is no restriction on the nationality 
of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was granted. After a 
careful consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only dissertations 
written in English. Dissertations produced in 2005 but not written in 
English or not translated will be allowed for submission, after 
translation, also with the call next year (for 2006).

Prize
~~~~~
The prize consists of

* a certificate
* a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
* an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to the 
new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be published 
by Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further information on 
this series is available on the FoLLI site)

How to submit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are 
required:

    1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
    2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
    3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. 
Self-nominations are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by 
the thesis supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely 
describe the scope and significance of the dissertation and state when 
the degree was officially awarded;
    4. two additional letters of support, including at least one letter 
from a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that awarded 
the Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to

                 beth_award@dimi.uniud.it

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.

In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack of 
notification within three working days after submission, nominators 
should write to policriti@dimi.uniud.it or areces@loria.fr
