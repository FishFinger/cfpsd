Meeting Description
2nd Newcastle Postgraduate Conference in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics,
Newcastle University, UK. 

We are pleased to announce the Second Newcastle Postgraduate Conference in
Theoretical and Applied Linguistics on Monday 25 June 2007.

This one-day conference, involving the Schools of English, Modern Languages and
Education, and Communication and Language Sciences, is designed to give
linguistics postgraduates from all research areas an opportunity to present and
discuss their research in an informal and intellectually stimulating setting.

Professor Fassi Fehri (newly appointed as visiting Professor at Newcastle
University) and
Professor Antonella Sorace (Professor of Developmental Linguistics, Edinburgh
University) will be giving the guest lectures at this year's conference.

We invite postgraduate students to submit abstracts for oral and poster
presentations on any area of linguistics, theoretical or applied (see below for
abstract submission guidelines).

Key Dates
The deadline for submission of abstracts is Friday, 23rd March. The conference
itself takes place at Newcastle University on Monday 25th June, with a
conference dinner on Monday evening.

Abstract Submission Guidelines
Abstract submission guidelines are available at
http://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/pglinguistics. Abstracts should be sent to
pgconfling@ncl.ac.uk. Email submissions only, please (Microsoft Word/PDF format
only). 

Presentation Guidelines
Accepted abstracts will be allotted 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes
for discussion. There will be a dedicated poster session on the day of the
conference, but posters will be on display all day. Speakers will also be
invited to submit their paper for publication in the Newcastle Working Papers in
Linguistics.

Further Information
More information can be found, following the URLs given above, at the conference
website: http://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/pglinguistics.
If you have any queries, please email pgconfling@ncl.ac.uk.

An interdisciplinary workshop bringing together researchers in cognitive

Location: University College London
Date: 21 and 22 June 2007, (Thursday and Friday)

Organisers:
Alex Clark, Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway University of London
Nick Chater, Department of Psychology, University College London

Invited Speakers:
John Goldsmith (Linguistics, University of Chicago)
Chris Manning (Computer Science and Linguistics, Stanford University)
Morten Christiansen (Psychology, Cornell University)
Matthew Crocker (Psycholinguistics, Saarland University)
Walter Daelemans (Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence,
University of  Antwerp)
Colin de la Higuera (Grammatical Inference, St Etienne)

Language acquisition and processing has been one of the central research
issues in cognitive science. It is also an area in which the use of cognitive
computational modelling has been especially intense.
Language, and especially language acquisition, has been the key
battleground for nativists and empiricists; and between advocates of rule-based,
probabilistic, and connectionist models of thought. Yet the computational models
proposed by CogSci researchers are often far behind, in scale and accuracy, the
non-cognitively motivated models proposed by computational linguists, which are
heavily based on machine learning techniques.

This workshop asks how far these techniques, and their theoretical
underpinnings, provide tools for building richer theories of cognitive processes. 
For example, can powerful machine learning techniques
(e.g. kernel methods) help build models of the cognitive operations
involved in human language acquisition? Conversely, can insights from cognitive
science help inform and focus computational linguistic and machine learning? Can
evidence concerning the spectacular computational performance of the human
language processor help inspire
new generations of computational linguistic and machine learning tools?

This workshop will bring together participants from all of the disciplines
that address this problem to discuss a range of related topics from
methodological issues in computational modelling of language acquisition,
including evaluation of empirical learning models, to technical problems in
machine learning and grammatical inference.

The workshop includes invited talks by some of the leading researchers in
these fields.

Intended audience:
Cognitive scientists with an interest in language and computational modelling,
Grammatical inference researchers interested in natural language
Computational linguists interested in unsupervised learning of natural language
Machine learning researchers interested in modelling sequential data, or
tree-structured data, using Bayesian, kernel-based or graphical models.
Linguists interested in computational models of language acquisition.
Psycholinguists with unexplained experimental data looking
for computational models.
COLT or ALT style researchers working on formal models of learning language.

Format:
The workshop will consist of a mixture of long invited talks, short talks,
and a poster session.
Please submit a 1 page abstract on a topic related to the meeting by email
to Alex Clark (alexc@cs.rhul.ac.uk) or Nick Chater (n.chater@ucl.ac.uk) by
March 30th 2007;
Please indicate your preference for oral or poster presentation.
Notifications of acceptance will be sent out by 18th April 2007.
