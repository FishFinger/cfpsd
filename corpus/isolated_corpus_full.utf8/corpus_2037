Meeting Description

The 2008 International Professional Communication Conference 

Theme of IPCC 2008:
The 2008 conference will focus on the theme of ''Opening the Information
Economy.'' The idea is that we are all a part of the information economy, and by
participating in it, we both shape and are shaped by the information economy and
its practices. As communication is at the heart of success within this economy,
the conference will explore certain communication-based aspects of the
information economy. These aspects will include:

Information design, usability, and accessibility 
Virtual teams, online collaboration, and distributed models of work 
Cross-cultural communication, globalization, outsourcing, translation, and
localization 
Legal policies and social issues related to the information economy 
Media selection and multimodality 
The role of and perspectives on teaching and training within the information
economy 
Content management, open source software, single sourcing, and XML 
Establishing and assessing the value of knowledge work and knowledge products

Meeting Description

20th European Systemic Functional Linguistics Conference and Workshop
University of Helsinki, Finland, 11th - 13th June, 2008
Conference Theme: Linguistic and Multisemiotic Challenges in Europe and the World 

20th European Systemic Functional Linguistics Conference and Workshop
University of Helsinki, Finland
11th - 13th June, 2008

Conference Theme
Linguistic and Multisemiotic Challenges in Europe and the World

The objective of the congress is to bring together international scholars who
work in the fields of systemic functional linguistics, social semiotics, and
multisemiotic studies. The congress will focus on a central challenge that the
field of linguistics currently faces: on the one hand, as the result of the
expansion of the European Union, Europeans live in a rich multilingual
environment; on the other hand, as Europe and the whole world is becoming
electronically united by the Internet, we are experiencing trends towards
monolingualism, or at least, the domination of certain languages as world
languages. Our daily environment (at work, in education etc.) is changing as the
global and local meet. As a result, modes of meaning-making are constantly
changing and challenging communicators. Moreover, as the Internet allows
multisemiotic expression and virtual presence, language has to compete more and
more with other modes of expression.

Plenary Speakers:
- Caroline Coffin (Open University, UK)
- Gail Forey (Hong Kong Polytechnic University)
- James Martin (University of Sydney)
- Peter Muntigl (University of Salzburg)

Call for Papers

We particularly welcome papers on the theme of the congress (subtopics are given
below). In keeping with tradition, however, papers dealing with current issues
in SFL, but not related to the theme will also be considered. We also invite
papers related to the theme from other functional perspectives.
Presentations will be of 30 minutes duration plus 10 minutes question time.
There will be space for half-day workshops (3 x 40 min slots) and shorter
workshops (2 x 40 min slots). As suggested in the last general meeting, some of
these slots will be reserved for workshops or panels held in EU-languages (other
than English). An additional poster session may be created to accommodate demos
and other suitable presentations.

Subthemes
Global, European and local perspectives on
1. Language and discourse description from a multisemiotic perspective
2. Teaching majority and minority languages
3. Multilingual and multimodal learning
4. Translation
5. Glocalisation
6. EU linguistic policies and practices
7. Language in the workplace 
8. Tourism 
9. Contrasting speech communities
10. Computer tools for multilingual and multimodal analysis
11. Genres & multisemiotic meanings

Submissions
All submissions will be reviewed anonymously by two reviewers. Please send
submissions by e-mail to esflcw-2008@helsinki.fi and provide the following
information, both in the body of the e-mail and as a rich text format attachment: 

- name, title and affiliation for each author/presenter
- title of paper
- abstract (approximately 250 words, 500 words for a workshop proposal)
- presentation equipment requirements.

Your abstract should contain a clear statement of the research question(s), a
brief account of the approach and data used, and an indication of the
conclusions or (expected) results. A bibliography is not essential, but if you
include one, it should contain no more than 5 central references. If your native
language is not English, you should have the English in your abstract checked by
a native speaker.

Venue
The congress will be held in University of Helsinki premises that are right in
the centre of Helsinki, just a 5-minute walk from the central railway station. 

Excursions
We are planning excursions for Saturday, 14th July, and Sunday, 15th July.
Information will be posted on the congress web site in due course.

Accommodation
Participants are requested to do their own bookings for accommodation. However,
we will negotiate some special rates for some hotels. Information will be posted
on the congress web site later.
