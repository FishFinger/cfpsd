CALL FOR PAPERS

                      RANLP-05
  RECENT ADVANCES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

        International Conference RANLP-2005
                  21-23 Sep 2005

Supported by the European Commission as a Marie Curie
Large Conference, contract MLCF-CT-2004-013233.

Further to the successful and highly competitive 1st,
2nd, 3rd and 4th conferences 'Recent Advances in
Natural Language Processing' (RANLP), we are pleased
to announce the 5th RANLP conference to be held this
year. The conference will take the form of addresses
from invited keynote speakers plus individual papers.
All papers accepted and presented will be available
as a volume of proceedings at the conference.
Volumes with selected and revised papers from the
conference are traditionally published by
John Benjamins Publishing (Amsterdam/Philadelphia)
in the "Current Issues in Linguistic Theories" series
(CILT volumes 136, 189, 260). There will also be an
exhibition area for poster and demo sessions.
The conference will be preceded by tutorials
(18-20 September 2005). For the first time,
post-conference workshops will be held (24 Sep'05).

LOCATION
========

The picturesque resort of Borovets is located in
the Rila mountains and is one of the most famous
winter resorts in South-East Europe, a frequent
meeting place for the elite in world skiing.
The resort is 1350 m above sea level, at the foot
of the highest peak on the Balkan Peninsula -
Moussala (2925 m). The resort of Borovets is 73km
from Sofia and 126km from Plovdiv (see the map at
the conference site), which means that both Sofia
and Plovdiv with their international airports can
serve as arrival/departure points. In addition to
regular public transport, the organisers will
provide daily shuttle buses from Sofia airport to
the conference location at an inexpensive rate.
A taxi from Sofia to Borovets is relatively cheap;
it is also possible to take a taxi from the
international airport in Sofia to the conference
venue.
