Meeting Description

Panel on 'Face, Culture and Social Interaction' at the Fourth International
Symposium on Politeness (2-4 July 2008, Budapest, Hungary) 

The notion of face has been used to explain various social phenomena by a wide
range of social science researchers, including social anthropologists,
pragmalinguists, sociolinguists, sociologists and psychologists. Yet while face
has become seemingly indispensable in discussions of various aspects of social
interactions, face has also become increasingly entrenched in the literature as
a kind of pre-existing sociocultural construct, with little acknowledgement of
the fact that face itself emerges through social interaction. This panel focuses
on the ways in which face is jointly constructed and shared through various
social networks, including 'cultures', with a particular emphasis on exploring
new theoretical approaches to analysing face as it arises in naturally-occurring
interactions.
Contributors who are interested in this approach to face are cordially invited
to submit an abstract for this panel which will be held at the forthcoming 4th
International Symposium on Politeness ''East Meets West'' (Budapest, 2-4 July 2008):
http://www.nytud.hu/lprg/

Abstract Submission

The selection of abstracts will be made on the basis of quality and relatedness
to the topic and objectives of the panel. In the abstracts, which may be up to
400 words, authors are expected to provide an overview of the focus of the
paper, and the methodology and data used in their research. The deadline for
abstract submission is 30 November 2007. Notification of acceptance will be sent
out in January 2008. 
Abstracts should be sent to both the organisers at the following e-mail addresses:
Michael Haugh (m.haugh@griffith.edu.au)
Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini (francesca.bargiela@ntu.ac.uk)
