4th Linguistics Summer School in the Indian Mountains

Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 15th December 2008
 
FOSSSIL announces the 4th LISSIM to take place in Kausani June 10-30, 2008, in
the lap of the gorgeous Kumaun Hills, India. Overlooking the highest peak on the
Indian side, Nanda Devi (7820m), and several other peaks including the famous,
Trishul (7120m), the Summer School venue is ideal for communal living and
learning, devoid of the usual distractions of a city, town or even a touristy
hill station.

The themes for the 4th LISSIM are as follows:
- Topics in DP Syntax and Semantics
- Topics in WH/ Relative Clause Syntax and Semantics
- Discourse and Context

The teaching faculty will consist of the following established experts in formal
linguistics topics

- David Adger, University of London, Queen Mary, UK
- Tanmoy Bhattacharya, University of Delhi, India
- Hagit Borer, University of Southern California,  USA
- Guglielmo Cinque, University of Venice, Italy
- M.T. Hany Babu, University of Delhi, India
- Aravind K. Joshi, University of Pennsylvania, USA
- Ayesha Kidwai, Jawaharlal Nehru University, India
- Guiseppe Longobardi, University of Trieste, Italy
- Anoop Mahajan, University of California, Los Angeles, USA
- Sundar Sarukkai, National Institute of Advanced Studies, India
- Philippe Schlenker, Insitut Jean-Nicod, France

Given the above faculty list and popularity of the themes, the admission to the
School is likely to be highly competitive and since the number of student
participants is limited to 20, prospective participants are therefore requested
to apply as soon as possible. Students from India are requested to apply for
membership to FOSSSIL by writing an email of intention to secretary@fosssil.in.
All prospective students for the School are requested to send an email to the
same address with the following information latest by 15th December, 2008:
Name:
Email:
Affiliation:
Qualification in Linguistics:
PhD/ Research Topic:
Reason for Participating in LISSIM: (max 500 words)

The registration fee ($350 for students from outside India, Rs. 9500 for
students from India) will cover accommodation (twin sharing) and food for 20
days of the School.
