Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This session wishes to bring together original contributions on lower class
writing from different languages and will try to convey a view on 18th and 19th
century language history 'from below' (socially speaking). Recurring themes will
therefore include the study of literacy, schooling practices and the evolving
role of language norms for the creation of a specific social identity. 

Papers are invited for the following session at the International Conference on
Historical Linguistics in Montreal, August 6-11, 2007:

Alternative Language Histories from the mid 18th centuries onwards, a view "from
below"

This session on historical sociolinguistics focuses on language use from a group
that is traditionally underrepresented (or ignored) in mainstream studies and
conferences on language history: those writers at the very bottom of the social
ladder. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing interest among
language historians of the (late) 18th and 19th century in the study of
documents from the lower social classes, paupers and working class emigrants. 

It is striking that these unschooled writers present us with a picture of
language use that defeats many traditional accounts of standard languages at the
time. Across language borders, it appears that this group had a relationship to
language norms that was different from the small upper class layer whose
language use has traditionally been the main basis for language histories. 

This session wishes to bring together original contributions on lower class
writing from different languages and will try to convey a view on 18th and 19th
century language history 'from below' (socially speaking). Recurring themes will
therefore include the study of literacy, schooling practices and the evolving
role of language norms for the creation of a specific social identity.
