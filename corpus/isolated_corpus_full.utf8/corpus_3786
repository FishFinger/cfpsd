The development of information network systems enables us to communicate =

with people in remote places "anytime and anywhere", enriching human
knowledge, affection and sensibility. However, there are various =

barriers which stand in our way to using these systems freely and flexibly.
In order to discuss how to overcome these barriers and create a more =

human-centered communication environment, in 2007 the first International
Symposium on Universal Communication was held in Kyoto, Japan featuring =

discussions with well-known researchers from around the world. Following its
success, the Second International Symposium on Universal Communication =

(ISUC 2008) will be held at the Osaka International Convention Center,
5-3-51, Nakanoshima Kita-ku, Osaka 530-0005 Japan on December 15-16, 2008.
