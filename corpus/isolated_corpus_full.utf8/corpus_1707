Meeting Description

Over the last years, three conferences (Potsdam 1999, Amsterdam 2002, Santiago
de Compostela 2005) presented reflections on grammaticalization, adducing new
evidence -- and sometimes counterevidence -- for the concept of
grammaticalization. The fourth NRG conference at the University of Leuven
intends to bring together innovating papers that explore the boundaries of the
current grammaticalization research. 

New Reflections on Grammaticalization 4
Leuven, 16-19 July 2008

Since the 1980s, grammaticalization has held an important place in linguistic
research. Early grammaticalization studies explored morphosyntactic change,
building on Lehmann's ([1982] 1995) seminal study on processes and parameters of
grammaticalization. This type of grammaticalization mainly focuses on the change
of free syntactic units into highly constrained morphemes with a grammatical
function. A more recent tradition, initiated by Traugott (1982) and elaborated,
for example, in Traugott (1989, 1995, 1996), focuses on semantic-pragmatic
change in grammaticalization. 

The purpose of this fourth NRG conference is to bring together innovating papers
that explore the boundaries of the current grammaticalization research. As such,
in addition to contributions on the 'traditional' areas of grammaticalization,
we especially welcome contributions addressing issues in grammaticalization such
as: 
  
- Grammaticalization and constructions; 
- Grammaticalization and the classification of transitional and gradient
linguistic phenomena;
- Micro-processes of grammaticalization;
- Grammaticalization, idiomaticization and lexicalization;
- Grammaticalization and the structure of discourse; 
- Grammaticalization and/versus pragmaticalization and (inter-)subjectification; 
- Formal(-semantic) approaches to grammaticalization;
- Accounts of degrammaticalization

We are also looking for contributions that address the relationship between
grammaticalization and analogy. Furthermore, we are seeking contributions that
highlight the importance of such usage-based factors as frequency and
entrenchment for grammaticalization, and that, in general, devote attention to
quantitative data in support of grammaticalization processes. Finally, we
welcome papers on what computer simulations of the evolution/emergence of human
communication can tell us about grammaticalization.

Plenary Speakers

Laurel Brinton (University of British Columbia)
John W. Du Bois (University of California at Santa Barbara)
Regine Eckardt (University of Goettingen)
Muriel Norde (University of Groningen)
Graeme Trousdale (University of Edinburgh)
Richard Waltereit (University of Newcastle)

Convenors

Bert Cornillie (University of Leuven - FWO-Flanders)
Hubert Cuyckens (University of Leuven)
Kristin Davidse (University of Leuven)
Torsten Leuschner (University of Ghent)
Tanja Mortelmans (University of Antwerp)

Call for Papers/Workshops

Papers are invited on the aspects of grammaticalization within the framework
outlined above. Presentations will be 20 minutes with 10 minutes question time.

Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should state
research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results. Abstracts
will be reviewed anonymously. 

Proposals for workshops are also welcome. Since we would like all conference
participants to be able to attend individual workshop presentations, NRG3
workshops have to be compatible with the main conference programme. This means
that the format of the workshops must be organized around 30 minute
presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). Each workshop should comprise: 
1. An introductory paper by the convenor(s). It should summarize previous
research, specify the approaches to be found in the workshop and explain the
scope of the papers to be given. 
2. Up to 5 papers (20/30 min. + 10 min. discussion). The preference is for
one-day workshops, but other schedules may also be considered. 
3. Final discussion (up to 90 min.) on topics covered by the papers,
methodological issues and questions for future research. 
More detailed information and instructions to all the participants will be
provided in due course by the convenors of the workshops. 

The deadline for the submission of abstracts and workshop proposals (with
abstracts) is 1 December 2007. Notification of acceptance will be given by 30
January 2008. 

Publication of Papers

It is the organizers' intention to publish a selection of the conference papers.

Social Programme

There will be a reception and a conference dinner. One of the four conference
days will be held at the University of Antwerp, and will include an excursion. A
post-conference excursion to Bruges and Ghent will take place on 20 July.

Transport

Brussels National Airport is located a short distance between Leuven and
Brussels. Travelling to and from the airport is easy.

There is a direct train link from Leuven to the airport and from the airport to
Leuven or you can take the Airport City Express to Brussels. Schedules for these
lines, as well as for train service throughout the whole of Belgium (and
international trains), are available on the Belgian National Railways
(SNCB/NMBS) website; enter Brussels Airport as the departure or destination station.

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

Fifty years after the conference at the University of Strasbourg entitled
'Lexicology and Lexicography in French Romance Languages: Directions and Current
Requirements', which has enabled us to launch the project of the well-known
French Dictionary 'Trésor de la Langue Française' (TLF), a new conference is
being held to assess the influence of the TLF and its methodological
innovations, as well as on subsequent lexicographical practices, analysing
advantages, implications, and consequences of such methods. As in 1957, this
conference addresses the future of lexicography, current projects and
forthcoming research.

Conference themes:
- Methodological analyses of past and current practices for the TLF.
- Lexicographical projects inspired by the TLF.
- Major research areas and methodologies in current lexicographical practices.
- The future of lexicography ajd its domain of study.
- The relationship between NLP and computerised dictionaries.
- Emerging lexicographical practices. 

Call for Papers:

Proposals for papers may be in one of the following areas:
- History and epistemology of modern lexicography.
- Different methodologies in lexicography and the creation of dictionary resources.
- NLP and lexicography.
- Language engineering and dictionary studies.
- Lexicography and multilingualism.
- Connections between lexicography and other language disciplines.

The official languages of the conference are French and English

Submissions:
Proposals for papers in French and English should be sent as en e-mail
attachment of 3 to 5 pages; the attached proposals should be anonymous, with
author's name(s) and contact details in the body of the e-mail. All proposals
will be reviewed by at least two members of the scientific committee; proposals
for a poster session will also be considered. Accepted proposals will be
published in the pre-conference proceedings available to conference
participants. Selected articles will appear in a 250/300-page volume published
by a reputable editor.

Important Dates:
1st September 2007: deadline for proposals to the following address:
tlf-csn@atilf.fr
