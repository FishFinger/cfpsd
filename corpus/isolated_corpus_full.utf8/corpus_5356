Call for Papers
Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
2nd UIMA@GSCL Workshop

September 30, 2009
Potsdam, Germany

http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/gscl09/workshops.de.html

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering =

standards causing a limited degree of re-usability of code and =

interoperability of different modules within larger NLP systems. While =

this did not really hamper success in limited task areas (such as =

implementing a parser), it caused serious problems for the emerging =

field of language technology where the focus is on
building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information =

extraction
or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to duplicated =

software
development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions of)
programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules
developed at different sites.

In recent years, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
framework has been proposed as a middleware platform which offers =

integration by
design through common type systems and standardized communication =

methods for
components analysing streams of unstructured information, such as natural
language. The UIMA framework offers a solid processing infrastructure that
allows developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual =

analytics
components. An increasing number of members of the NLP community thus have
adopted UIMA as a platform facilitating the creation of reusable NLP =

components
that can be assembled to address different NLP tasks depending on their =

order,
combination and configuration.

This workshop aims at bringing together members of the NLP community =

that are
users, developers or providers of either UIMA components or UIMA-related =

tools
in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in =

using UIMA
as a platform for modern, well-engineered NLP. In the context of an emerging
NLP-oriented UIMA community, the challenge to create not only reusable, =

but also
interoperable components raises particular interest. From a methodological
perspective, interoperability relies largely on UIMA type systems. =

Technically,
it includes issues related to the packaging and distribution of UIMA =

components.
Also, tools are important, for example to assemble complex processing work
flows, to manage the bodies of data that are to be analysed and to =

visualize,
explore, and further deploy the analysis results. Finally, =

interoperability is
also affected by legal issues, such as potentially incompatible licenses of
components and tools.

The availability of ready-to-use components plays a major role in =

choosing UIMA
over other alternatives. To accentuate this, the workshop puts a focus on
UIMA-based components and tools that are freely available for research.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Participants are invited to present applications realized using UIMA, =

general
experiences using UIMA as a platform for natural language processing, as =

well as
technical papers on particular aspects of the UIMA framework. =

Alternatives to
and comparisons of other frameworks with UIMA are of interest, too. More
specifically, workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

     * UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type-system
       independence
     * repositories of ready-to-use UIMA-based components
     * (generic) type systems for UIMA
     * distribution of UIMA components: documentation, licensing and =

packaging
     * sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing pipelines
     * experience reports combining UIMA-based components from different =

sources,
       as well as solutions to interoperability issues
     * processing of very large data collections: scale-out, =

parallelization, and
       performance optimization
     * analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and
       statistical analysis
     * developing for UIMA: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing, and
       limitations of UIMA

Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We invite submissions of full papers, limited to 8 pages of text, and =

position
papers or papers describing ongoing work as short papers, limited to 4 =

pages.
Both kinds of papers will be orally presented. Double submissions (whether
verbatim or in essence) should indicate this fact and name the workshop or
conference event also addressed. Reviewing will not be anonymous but authors
wishing to keep their anonymity may hide their identity on demand.

All submissions must be in English and follow the Springer LNCS style =

[1] and
should be created using LaTeX. Submissions must be sent in PDF format to
uima.gscl2009@googlemail.com no later than July, 6th.

Accepted submissions will appear in the GSCL conference proceedings.
