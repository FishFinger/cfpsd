Full Title: 19th European SFL Conference and Workshop 
Short Title: ESFLCW 2007 

Date: 23-Jul-2007 - 25-Jul-2007
Location: Saarbruecken, Germany 
Contact Person: Stella Neumann

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

Traditionally, linguists approach their object of research using hermeneutic methods. However, due to the introspective interpretation involved results may be difficult to replicate. In recent years, inductive methodologies have gained some influence on linguistic research. Yet, these methodologies sometimes make us blind to the fact that data need to be interpreted at some point. Moreover, the data itself may already involve interpretation, as in annotated corpora. In terms of its underlying philosophy, Systemic Functional Linguistics allows the combination of both: a genuinely humanities-based approach to interpreting data combined with empirical methodologies taking advantage of electronic corpora together with computational tools and techniques for the study of language in use. The topic of the conference therefore is "Data and interpretation in linguistic analysis". 

Papers on the topics below will be welcomed, though the following is by no means an exhaustive list, and in keeping with tradition, papers not strictly related to the theme or outside of the SFL perspective will also be considered.

1. Corpora and other types of data for analysis
2. Example-based studies and generalizability
3. The role of interpretation in 
    - phonology
    - lexicogrammar
    - semantics
    - discourse
4. Cohesion and coherence - the relative importance of interpretation in both
5. Interpretation in non-linguistic modes (i.e. visual, musical etc.)
6. Socio-cultural positions of power and interpretation
7. Contrast between languages or varieties and the (in)dependence of/on interpretation
8. Context of Situation and Context of Culture as frames for and constraints on interpretation
9. Learning or teaching a new language: new interpretations, or just new ways of expression?
10. Translation: Changing the encoding, and/or changing the interpretation? 
Presentations will be of 20 minutes duration plus question time. An additional poster session may be created to accommodate demos and other suitable presentations. There will be a book of abstracts accompanying the conference. Additionally, we plan to publish selected contributions. 

Workshops:

There will be space for one or two half day workshops covering a specific topic in a hands-on session. We therefore invite proposals of approximately 1000 words describing the topic and approach. 

Submissions:

All submissions will be reviewed anonymously by two reviewers. Please send submissions by e-mail to 
ESFLCW@uni-saarland.de 
specifying ''ESFLCW submission'' in the subject line and providing:
For each author: name, title, affiliation in the body of the mail

Abstract (approximately 400 words) (workshop proposal approximately 1000 words)

Important dates:

Abstract submission: 		31st January 2007
Notification of acceptance:	15th March 2007
Early registration:		30th April 2007
