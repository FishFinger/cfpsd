Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Language and Speech (http://www.asel.udel.edu/lgsp/) will devote a  special
issue on Audiovisual Prosody. Guest editors for the special issue are Emiel
Krahmer and Marc Swerts.
 
Traditionally, the study of prosody has focussed on suprasegmental features
such as intonation (speech melody), rhythm, tempo, loudness,  voice quality
and pausing that are encoded in the speech signal itself. However, when
people speak they generally do more than merely producing suprasegmental
variations, they may also use facial expressions or arm and body gestures
to support what they are saying. In recent years various researchers have
started to explore the contribution of these visual cues to communication.
There is a  growing awareness that auditory and visual prosody are closely
intertwined, and collectively provide utterances with 'extra'  information
that is often not explicitly contained in the lexical and syntactic make-up
of a sentence, such as cues to information structure, feedback,
turn-taking, or emotional or attitudinal aspects  of utterances. This
special issue aims to collect papers on all aspects of audiovisual prosody,
covering work from different disciplines (including speech science,
psychology, computer science and linguistics) to create a better
understanding of how visual and auditory prosody connect, and what the main
outstanding issues are. Here is a non-exhaustive list of topics that would
fit the special  issue:
  
·Functions of audiovisual prosody
·Automatic audiovisual analysis tools 
·Relation between visual and auditory prosody
·Developmental aspects of audiovisual prosody 
·Cross-cultural differences in audiovisual expressivity 
·Audiovisual correlates of mood and emotion
·Psychological models for audiovisual speech processing
  
The time schedule for this special issue is the following:
  
·November 15, 2007: deadline for full paper submission 
·February 15, 2008: reviews and editorial decisions sent to authors   
·June 1, 2008: deadline for revised papers 
·Special issue is scheduled to appear as Vol 52 (1&2) in early 2009
  
Prospective authors should submit their manuscripts online to the Language
and Speech editorial office (see
http://www.asel.udel.edu/lgsp/ForAuthor.html), and should indicate at the
end of their abstract that the manuscript is being submitted for the
special issue. After submitting, authors may also send an email to the
editorial office to confirm that their paper has been correctly assigned.
