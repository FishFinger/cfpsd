Meeting Description:

Beyond Translation Memories: New Tools for Translators
Machine Translation Summit XII, Ottawa, August 29th 2009 

Second Call for Papers

Workshop Purpose and Theme

Since the late 1970s, when research on translation memories began, and the late
1980s, when the first commercial TM products became available, there have been
few major breakthroughs which have led to new tools designed to support the
activity of human translators. Instead, most research in the field has focussed
on improving existing tools, be it translation memories, full machine
translation, terminology databases, alignment editors, monolingual spelling or
grammar checkers, voice recognition, workflow management, etc. The results have
certainly been encouraging, often allowing translators and translation firms to
work more efficiently and effectively. But have all the needs of translation
practioners been fully satisfied? Beyond the recycling of full-sentence
repetitions and their so-called fuzzy matches, are there new avenues left to
explore?

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion - and
perhaps even the demonstration - of such new tools for translators. Researchers,
developers and practioners are invited to share ideas, approaches, perspectives
and experiences that pertain to new technology or new ways of using existing
technology to support and facilitate the translation process. 

Topics of interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- New ways of combining existing tools (ex: hybrid Translation Memory and
Machine Translation systems)
- Text translatability evaluation tools
- Pre-translation authoring tools
- Measuring terminology implantation
- Cooperative translation systems
- Web-based translation tools
- Post-editing tools
- Typing prediction tools
- Speech recognition for translation dictation
- Terminology search in comparable (as opposed to parallel) corpora
- Information retrieval tools for finding background material relevant to the
source text

Submission of papers

Authors are invited to submit a paper (max 8 pages) on the topics mentioned or
related to the workshop theme. All papers should be written in English.
Submissions should follow the MT Summit formatting guidelines. Papers should be
anonymous and submitted with a separate cover sheet including the following
information:

- Paper title;
- Author's name(s), affiliation(s), address(es) and e-mail address(es).

Papers should be sent in PDF format to: Marie-Josée Goulet
