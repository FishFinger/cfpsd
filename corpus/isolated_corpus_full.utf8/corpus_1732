                   Call for Papers:

                  MASTERING THE GAP
  From Information Extraction to Semantic Representation
          http://tev.itc.it/mtg2007.html

   (Workshop to be held in conjunction with ISWC 2007)


... in brief
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Workshop focuses on the interface between the information
extracted from content objects and the semantic layer in which this
information is explicitly represented in the form of ontologies and
their instances. The Workshop will provide an opportunity for
discussing adequate methods, processes (pipelines) and representation
formats for the annotation process.

Automating the process of semantic annotation of content objects is a
crucial step for bootstrapping the Semantic Web. This process requires
a complex flow of activities which combines competences from different
areas.  The Workshop will focus precisely on the interface between the
information extracted from content objects (e.g., using methods from
NLP, image processing, text mining, etc.) and the semantic layer in
which this information is explicitly represented in the form of
ontologies and their instances. The workshop will provide an
opportunity for: discussing adequate methods, processes (pipelines)
and representation formats for the annotation process; reaching a
shared understanding with respect to the terminology in the area;
discussing the lessons learned from projects in the area, and putting
together a list of the most critical issues to be tackled by the
research community to make further progress in the area.

Topics
----------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the possible challenges to be discussed at the workshop are:

    * How can ontological/domain knowledge be fed back into the
      extraction process?

    * How can the semantic layer be extended by the results of
      information extraction (e.g. ontology learning)?

    * What are the steps of an annotation process, which steps can be
      standardized for higher flexibility? Which parts are
      intrinsically application-specific?

    * What are the requirements towards formats for representing
      semantic annotations?

    * Where is the borderline of automation and how can it be further
      pushed?

    * How can the linking with the semantic layer be supported on the
      concept/schema level as well as on the instance level?

    * How can knowledge extracted from different sources with
      different tools and perhaps different reference ontologies
      (interoperability) be merged (semi-)automatically?

    * How can extraction technologies for different media (e.g. text
      and images) be combined and how can the merged extraction
      results be represented in order to create synergies?

The Workshop will be a mixture of short paper presentation and open
discussions on a number of topics related to mastering the gap between
information extraction and semantic representation including (but not
restricted to):

    * Annotation representation formats
    * Approaches to semantic integration
    * Approaches to semantic elicitation
    * From lexical entities to entities in the domains
    * From extracted features to entities in the domain

Submissions
----------------------------------------------------------------
All members of the Semantic Web community are invited to submit papers
(of max 15 pages length) reporting on original work in these and
related areas.  Submissions should be formatted according to the
Springer LNCS style and will be selected for inclusion based on
reviews by domain experts. At least one author of each accepted
submission must attend the workshop and all workshop participants must
pay the ISWC 2007 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference
fee.

The ISWC submission system is open at the following address:
https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ISWC2007/default.aspx Please select
the track "Workshop: Mastering the Gap 2007"
