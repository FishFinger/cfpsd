Call for Course and Workshop Proposals

21st European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2009
Monday, 20 July - Friday, 31 July 2009 
Bordeaux, France 
        
The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around Europe.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics, logic and
computation.  ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as
well as workshops, covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of
interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500
students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into an important
meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested
in the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. 

The ESSLLI 2009 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 21st annual Summer
School in the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics,
computer science and the cognitive sciences. The Summer School program is
organized around the components.

- Language and Computation    
- Language and Logic  
- Logic and Computation

We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these there categories.

Proposal Submission: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than Monday, September 1, 2008 

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision no later than
Wednesday October 15, 2008.  Proposers should follow the guidelines below while
preparing their submissions; proposals that deviate can not be considered.

Guidelines for Submission: Anyone interested in lecturing or organizing a
workshop during ESSLLI-2009, please read the following information carefully.

All Courses: Courses consists of five sessions (a one-week course), each session
lasting 90 minutes.  Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course should
submit two independent one-week courses (for example an introductory course in
the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two proposed
courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submission:

- Sept 1, 2008: Proposal Submission Deadline
- Oct 15, 2008: Notification
- June 1, 2009: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material (by ESSLLI
Local Organizers) 

Foundational Courses: 
These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge. 
They are intended for people to get acquainted with the problems and techniques
of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from other fields
to acquire the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community. Foundational
courses may presuppose some experience with scientific methods in general, so as
to be able to concentrate on the issues that are germane to the area of the course.

Introductory Courses: 
Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School. They
are intended to equip students and young researchers with a good understanding
of a field's basic methods and techniques. Introductory courses in, for
instance, Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component
fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational linguistics should address
an audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and computation.
Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as
compared to standard texts in the
area (if available).

Advanced Courses: 
Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or PhD
students.  Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in
detail.

Workshops: 
The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and
other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a
well defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the theme
of the workshop. It is a strict requirement that organizers give a general
introduction to the theme during the first session of the workshop.  They are
also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop including
inviting the submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc.
In particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a
Call for Papers for the workshop by November 17, 2008.  The call must make it
clear that the workshop is open to all members of the ESSLLI community.  It
should also note that all workshop contributors must register for the Summer School.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions:
Sept 1, 2008: Proposal Submission Deadline
Oct 15, 2008: Notification
Nov 10, 2008: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers (by ESSLLI PC chair)
Nov 17, 2008: Workshop organizers send out (First) Call for Papers
Jan  7, 2008: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers
Feb  2, 2008: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers
Feb 15, 2009: Deadline for Papers
Apr 15, 2009: Notification of Workshop Contributors
June 1, 2009: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of Workshop Proceedings
(by ESSLLI Local Organizers) 

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer
School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate to be
determined by the Local Organizers.

Format for Proposals: The web-based form for submitting course and workshop
proposals is accessible at http://www.folli.org/submission.php.
You will be required to submit the following information:

- Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)
- Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer; where possible,
please include phone and fax numbers)
- Title (title of proposed course/workshop)
- Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory course, or an
advanced course?)
- Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation, Language & Logic or
Logic & Computation? name only one)
- Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed contents and
substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)
- External funding (will you be able to find external funding to help fund your
travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)
- Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above
guidelines should be included here; in particular, indicate here your teaching
experience in an interdisciplinary field as the one addressed by ESSLLI.)

Financial Aspects: 
Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all teaching
and organizing at the summer schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to
keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not
paid for their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up
to a fixed, maximum amount that will be notified to lecturers when courses are
accepted). It should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world
are welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full reimbursement of travel
costs, specially from destinations outside Europe.

Please Note the Following:
In case a course is to be taught by multiple lecturers, a lump sum is reimbursed
to cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer. The splitting of
the sum is up to the lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers and
workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover travel and accommodation
expenses, and such issues might be taken into account when selecting courses.

within all areas of language and cognition studies in Sweden and internationally. 

Call for Papers

Second Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition
SALC
June 10-12, 2009

Arranged by the departments of English, 
Scandinavian Languages, and General Linguistics
Stockholm University
Stockholm, Sweden

First Circular 
We are pleased to announce the second SALC conference, SALC-2009, where we hope
to bring together folks from within all areas of language and cognition studies
in Sweden and internationally. We welcome discussion on a wide variety of issues
within the general area of language and cognition, and we particularly encourage
contributions within the areas of language acquisition and psycholinguistics.
	
We invite the submission of abstracts for oral or poster presentations for the
''Second Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition (SALC)
/ Svenska Sällskapet för Språk och Kognition (SSSK)'' to be held at Stockholm
University between June 10th and 12th, 2009. In addition to individual talks, we
also invite suggestions for theme sessions (see below). Presentations should
involve research based on structures and processes of general cognition (e.g.
perception, memory and reasoning) and social cognition (e.g. joint attention and
imitation), and as affecting such structures and processes. The conference, as
SALC in general, is intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas between
disciplines, fields of study and theoretical frameworks. Topics include, but are
not limited to: 

- psycholinguistic  approaches to language and cognition
- language acquisition/use and cognition
- language structure and cognition 
- language and cognitive development and evolution
- language change and cognition 
- language and gesture 
- language and consciousness 
- linguistic typology and cognition
- linguistic relativity

Proposals for theme sessions should be sent to SALC2009@english.su.se before 30
September 2008.  They should include a title and a short description of the
theme. Theme session organisers will be notified October 15. At the same time, a
call for abstracts for the theme sessions will go out. The deadline for abstract
submission (for both individual talks and theme sessions) is November 30, 2008.
Please send two copies of an abstract of about 400 words (excluding references)
to SALC2009@english.su.se , with your name and affiliation written under the
title in one copy; one copy must remain anonymous. Presentations should last 20
minutes with 5 minutes for questions. After the process of peer-revision, e-mail
notifications will be sent out by March 1, 2009.

Conference fee: 55 Euros for SALC members, 45 Euros for students, 75 Euros for
others. The SALC membership fee is 10 Euros per year and can be paid together
with the conference fee.

The Swedish Association for Language and Cognition (SALC) was formed on June 16
2006 at an international conference at Umeå University involving mostly
linguists, but also psychologists and cognitive scientists working on a variety
of topics and utilising different methodologies. The major goal of the
association is to promote the study of the relationship between language and
cognition, both in Sweden and internationally. This involves any type of
research in which language is not treated in isolation (e.g. as a ''module''),
but both as based on structures and processes of general cognition and social
cognition, and as affecting such structures and processes. The association is
intended to be a forum for cooperation and exchange of ideas between
disciplines, fields of study and theoretical frameworks.
