Full Title: Cross-culturally Speaking, Speaking Cross-culturally 

Date: 06-Jul-2009 - 08-Jul-2009
Location: Sydney, Australia 
Contact Person: Bert Peeters
Meeting Email: Bert.Peeters@humn.mq.edu.au

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

Organised by the Department of International Studies, Macquarie University in
cooperation with the Département des Sciences du Langage, Université Montpellier 3 

Call for Papers

Submission procedure has been updated!

Issues in cross-cultural communication have exercised the minds of thousands of
scholars world-wide and will no doubt continue to do so in the foreseeable
future. Cross-cultural communication is often relatively unproblematic (as
relatively unproblematic, that is, as communication within cultures), but it is
a well-known fact that problems do develop from time to time and warrant the
attention of linguists and applied linguists alike. Cross-cultural pragmatic
failure, as it has been called, occurs because of insufficient knowledge, either
of the formal rules of the language in which an interaction takes place (rules
that relate to its lexicon, its phonetics, its syntax), or of more elusive
aspects related to implicit cultural norms and values, often not adequately
taught in foreign language classrooms. In the absence of appropriate
cross-cultural savoir-faire, it can have disastrous repercussions for
interpersonal relationships and lead to unhelpful stereotyping.

Deadline for Submission of Abstracts
Single-spaced abstracts written in Times New Roman 12 and not exceeding one page
(excluding bibliographical references), with 1 inch margins on all sides, should
be submitted via the Linguist List's Easy Abs website by 15 November 2008. The
URL of the relevant conference page is 

http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/CSSC_July_09 

Abstracts will be anonymously assessed by two or three members of the scientific
committee. Acceptances, either conditional or final, will be communicated by the
end of January 2009, and a provisional conference program will be released by
the end of February. Although the main conference language will be English,
abstracts and presentations in French will be considered.
