Meeting Description:

The Workshop on Content Analysis in Web 2.0 (CAW2.0) is part of the WWW 2009
conference held in Madrid/Spain. 

Call for Papers

Content Analysis in Web 2.0 (CAW2)
Madrid, 21 April 2009 at the WWW conference
http://caw2.barcelonamedia.org

The organizer committee of the first CAW2 (Content Analysis in Web 2.0)
workshop, The Universitat Pompeu Fabra and The Barcelona Media Innovation Center
invites you to participate in this workshop, belonging to the International
World Wide Web Conference WWW-2009 to be held in Madrid.

The general topic of this workshop is the analysis of the content generated by
users in the web 2.0. This first year, the content is restricted to text. Two
different paper modalities will be considered for the workshop:

- General papers:
Papers describing new tasks, evaluation procedures or any other relevant issue
related to mining of user generated contents in the web 2.0 will be considered.

- Shared task papers:
Papers describing research work and results related to any of the following
three shared tasks will be considered:
1. Text normalization
2. Sentiment and opinion analysis
3. Misbehavior Detection

For those teams participating in any of the shared tasks, there will be a set of
data available for training and testing in order to be able to compare the
results produced by different teams. It is important to know that the paper
submission deadline will be previous to the test data release date. In this
sense, the paper should report all the work done with the training dataset.
After paper acceptance, results on test data can be added to the final version
of the manuscript without exceeding the eight page limit. .

Each workshop submission will be evaluated by two or three evaluators. A blind
review process will be followed, so author's names and direct references to
author's previous works should be avoided in the first version of the
manuscript. We are attempting to organize an independent program committee for
each shared task and paper modality.

Papers will be evaluated according to their technical soundness as well as their
originality and innovative contributions to the field. Paper length should not
exceed eight pages. See the submissions page, for the conditions to submit your
papers. http://caw2.barcelonamedia.org/node/16

Important Dates:
01/03/09    Sunday    Deadline for paper submissions
02/03/09    Monday    Test data release
08/03/09    Sunday    Deadline for experimental result submissions
22/03/09    Sunday    Notification of acceptance
29/03/09    Sunday    Deadline for camara ready submissions
21/04/09    Tuesday   Workshop

Meeting Email: carlo.cecchetto@unimib.it

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

This workshop is organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic,
Language and Information ESSLLI 2009 http://esslli2009.labri.fr to be held in
Bordeaux (20-31 July, 2009) and is supported by the Department of Psychology of
University of Milan-Bicocca. 

Call for Papers

Workshop Topics:
The grammars of sign languages are as highly complex as the grammars of spoken
languages and share with them many universal features, despite the difference in
modality between spoken languages (which use the auditory channel) and sign
languages (which use the visual channel). Yet, sign languages also differ from
spoken languages in radical ways: morphological information in sign languages is
often conveyed simultaneously by different articulators rather than linearly;
moreover, certain aspects of their phonological, syntactic and semantic
structures are not commonly found in spoken languages. These differences raise
an interesting challenge for existing formal linguistic frameworks, which are
designed to account for the grammars of spoken languages. By bringing together
formal linguists working on sign languages, the workshop should contribute to
meet this challenge.

Submission details:
Authors are invited to submit an anonymous abstract (personal information should
appear in the text of the e-mail accompanying the abstract). Submissions should
not exceed 500 words. The following formats are accepted: PDF, Word, RTF. Please
send your submission electronically to carlo.cecchetto@unimib.it by the deadline
listed below. The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme
committee and additional reviewers. The accepted papers will appear in the
workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. 

Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second
week of ESSLLI. There will be approximately 10 slots for selected papers (20
minutes for talk + 10 for discussion) and 3 invited talks. 

Invited speakers: 
Mark Aronoff (Stony Brook University) 
Diane Lillo-Martin (University of Connecticut) 
Josep Quer (Pompeu Fabra University) 

Important Dates: 
Submissions: March 31, 2009
Notification: April 15, 2009
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2009
ESSLLI early registration: May 1, 2009
Final papers for proceedings: May 15, 2009
Final programme: June 15, 2009
Workshop dates: 27-31 July, 2009

Local Arrangements:
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register
for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will correspond
to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee. Moreover, a number of
additional fee waiver grants will be made available on a competitive basis and
workshop participants are eligible to apply for those.

There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. Workshop
speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should contact the local
organizing committee to ask for the possibilities for a grant.
