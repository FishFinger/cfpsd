ACL 2008 Student Research Workshop
June 15-20, 2008, Columbus Ohio

Second Call for Papers

URL: http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/srw.html
------------------------------------------------------

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences.  The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants
will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general audience
as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers
who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to
the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask
for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by
an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop
will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come
from any topic area within computational linguistics including, but
not limited to, the following topic areas:

- pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the lexicon
- phonetics, phonology and morphology
- linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of language
- information retrieval, information extraction, question answering
- summarization and paraphrasing
- speech recognition, speech synthesis
- corpus-based language modeling
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation, translation aids
- spoken and written natural language interfaces, dialogue systems
- multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
- message and narrative understanding systems

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished
research. The papers should describe original work in
progress. Students who have settled on their thesis direction but
still have significant research left to do are particularly encouraged
to submit their papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange
ideas with other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for
further development of the work, papers should clearly indicate
directions for future research wherever appropriate. All authors of
multi-author papers must be students. Papers submitted for this
workshop are eligible only if they have not been presented at any
other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Students
who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student Research
Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their
papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper
has been submitted to another conference or workshop.

3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. These files will be
available soon from the student workshop pages of the conference
site. A description of the format will also be available in case you
are unable to use these style files directly. All the submissions must
be electronic. Please use the submission page to submit your paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance
decision will be based on the results of the review. Note that
reviewing of papers will be double-blind; therefore, please make sure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self identifying references anywhere in the
paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed
previously (Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001)
previously showed ...''.

5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than midnight, January 10th,
2008 . No papers received after January 10th, 2008 will be
accepted. Acknowledgment will be emailed soon after
receipt. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors (by email)
on February 28th, 2008. Detailed formatting guidelines for the
preparation of the final camera-ready copy will be provided to authors
with their acceptance notice.

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: January 10, 2008
Notification of acceptance: February 28, 2008
Camera-ready paper submission deadline: April 14, 2008
Conference date: June 15-20, 2008
(The workshop will be held during the main conference)
