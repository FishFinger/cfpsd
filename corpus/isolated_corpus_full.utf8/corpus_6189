Meeting Description:

Meaning and Lexicalization of Word Formation

This workshop is part of the International Morphology Meeting (IMM14) and will
run as a one-day parallel session of this conference. The call for papers and
evaluation of abstracts is separate from IMM14, but speakers and participants in
the workshop will have to register for IMM14: http://www.nytud.hu/imm14. 

Call for Papers

The study of word formation in mainstream generative morphology has always
concentrated on forms. This is due in large part to the central position that
syntax has been assigned in the different grammatical frameworks as devised by
Noam Chomsky. As a consequence of this orientation, aspects of the meaning of
word formation results that do not immediately affect their form have been
neglected. Typically, the focus was on possible words and the account of their
relationship to actual words was relegated to a general process of
lexicalization. As a consequence, many potentially interesting phenomena were
brushed aside.

Recent work by Ray Jackendoff has shown the possibility of an alternative to in
the form of a Parallel Architecture (PA). In PA, phonological, syntactic, and
conceptual structure are generated independently and linked to each other
without being derived from one another as in Chomsky's models. Jackendoff (2009)
shows how PA opens new perspectives for the description of the meaning of word
formation.

At the same time as raising new and interesting questions about the semantics
and lexicalization of word formation, this approach has the potential to connect
with insights gained in alternative frameworks. As described by ten Hacken
(2009), many of the questions studied in generative semantics, in particular
those related to meaning, were not answered but no longer oriented research when
this approach was abandoned. The onomasiological approach, as described by
?tekauer (2005), assigns an important role to the question of the choice of a
form for a concept. This view of lexicalization is also related to the classical
approach in terminology.

Against this background the workshop will concentrate on the following questions:

- How do words formed by word formation get their meaning? What are the factors
involved and what is the balance between them?
- What happens when a word resulting from word formation is lexicalized?
- What is the role of productivity, semiproductivity, and exceptions in the
semantics and lexicalization of word formation?

Papers for the workshop can address these questions either at the level of the
system / architecture of language or concentrate on the analysis of individual
processes that illustrate possibilities and identify problems. The workshop will
take place over one full day as a parallel session of IMM14. Individual papers
will be assigned 30 minute slots including discussion. 

Speakers and participants at the workshop will have to register for IMM14 and
pay conference fees. It will be attempted to publish proceedings as a special
issue of a journal or as a volume with a major publisher.

In order to be considered, abstracts should indicate clearly how the paper will
approach an issue related to the workshop and be sent as an email attachment to
the workshop organizer at the following address:
