Call for Papers

Siouan and Caddoan Languages Conference
June 11-14, 2009
Lincoln, Nebraska
Hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Department of Anthropology

Papers and presentations are invited on topics from any Siouan or Caddoan
language. This includes all areas of linguistics (e.g., phonetics, phonology,
syntax, grammar, semantics), cultural linguistics (e.g., code-switching,
language & identity, language revitalization, language ideology, language
shift), and language instruction (e.g., teaching methods, immersion activities,
assessment & outcomes, community outreach). 

Student papers are welcome.

We are a congenial group of linguists, scholars, students, community members, 
and native language instructors. We schedule a single session at a time so 
everyone is able to attend all presentations and join in the discussions. 

General paper sessions will follow the traditional 20 minute presentation
followed by a short question/answer period. At the end of each session there
will be additional time for questions and discussion. Appropriate technology
support is available.

Send a working abstract of your paper or presentation by Friday May 1st, 2009 
to the local conference organizer:

available. See the attached registration forms.
