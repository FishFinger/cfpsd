~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CALL For Papers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special Issue on Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP)
http://talip.acm.org/
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arabic is a Semitic language spoken by over 250 million people, in an area
extending from the Arabian Gulf in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the
west. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is
also the language in which some of the world's greatest works of literature,
science, and history have been written.

Arabic is a strongly structured and highly derivational language. Arabic
language processing requires the treatment of the language constituents at
all levels. Each level requires extensive study and exploitation of the
associated linguistic characteristics. Over the last few years, Arabic
natural language processing (ANLP) has been gaining increasing importance,
and has found a wide range of applications including: machine translation,
information extraction, and tutoring systems. These applications require
developing innovative approaches and techniques for natural language
analysis, natural language generation, and linguistic resources.

Various forums have been dedicated to ANLP:
* Special track on Natural Language Processing, The  International
Conference on Informatics and Systems (NLP-INFOS 2008), Cairo Univ., Egypt.
* Workshop on HLT & NLP within the Arabic world: Arabic Language and local
languages processing: Status Updates and Prospects, LREC, 2008
* Computational Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages, workshop series
(04, 07).
* International Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools (NEMLAR
2004), Cairo Egypt.
* ACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages (2005, 2007)

This special issue of the ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information
Processing (TALIP) is intended to present the state-of-the-art in research
on Arabic natural language processing, Arabic computational linguistics,
applied Arabic linguistics and related areas. This call is intended to be as
broad as possible. We solicit original research papers on topics including,
but not limited to:

* Linguistic resources (corpora, electronic dictionaries, treebanks, etc.)
* Transliteration, transcription and diacritization
* Part of speech tagging
* Morphological analysis and generation
* Shallow and deep parsing
* Machine translation
* Word sense and syntactic disambiguation
* Semantic analysis
* Information extraction and retrieval
* Question answering
* Text clustering, and classification
* Text summarization
* Text and web content  mining
* Named entity recognition
* Colloquial-based language processing

>>>> Important Dates <<<<<
* Submissions due for review: 1 April 2009
* Notification of 1st decision: 1 July 2009
* Revisions due: 15 August 2009
* Notification of acceptance: 1 October 2009
* Final version submitted: 1 November 2009
* Issue publication: March 2010

>>>>> Submission Guidelines <<<<<
Papers should be formatted following the style guidelines for the ACM
Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (http://talip.acm.org).
The instructions for preparing manuscripts for submission can be found at
http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions. Please submit papers in PDF
format using the web-based submission system Manuscript Central (
