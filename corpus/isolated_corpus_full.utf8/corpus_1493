1st Call for Papers for OntoLex07 - From Text to Knowledge: The 
Lexicon/Ontology Interface
Workshop at ISWC07 (6th International Semantic Web Conference)

http://olp.dfki.de/OntoLex07/

November 11th , 2007
Busan, South-Korea

Endorsed By ACL SIGSEM (http://www.aclweb.org/sigsem) and the NEON 
project (http://www.neon-project.org/)

The OntoLex workshop series is concerned with the interface between 
knowledge representation in ontologies and the representation and use of 
linguistic knowledge as encoded in (multilingual) lexicons. Previous 
OntoLex workshops were held in Sozopol (2000), Las Palmas (2002), Lisboa 
(2004), Jeju (2005), Genoa (2006). The extraction of ontology elements 
from textual data is a pre-requisite for many Semantic Web applications. 
Hence the interface between ontologies (describing objects in a domain) 
and the lexicon (describing the linguistic features of terms that refer 
to such objects) is becoming increasingly important. We invite 
submission of papers on the following topics in this interdisciplinary 
research area:

The lexicon/ontology interface
* Design principles for the integrated representation of lexical and 
ontological knowledge
* The lexicon/ontology interface in multilingual and cross-cultural 
aspects of ontologies

The lexicon in Semantic Web applications
* The role of (multilingual) lexicons in knowledge markup and ontology 
population, i.e. in ontology-based information extraction from text
* Lexical aspects in ontology learning from text, i.e. in (multilingual) 
term extraction, relation extraction, etc.
* Lexical approaches to ontology matching, i.e. in the extraction, 
representation and use of synonyms for mapping between class/property 
labels
* Reengineering lexicons as ontologies, e.g. porting wordnets and 
framenets to the Semantic Web

Ontologies in knowledge-based Natural Language Processing
* Ontological constraints on lexicon development for knowledge-based NLP
* Ontologies as resources for NLP-based tasks (question answering, 
document classification, text mining, expert search, etc.)
