SPECIAL ISSUE ON SEMANTIC DESCRIPTIONS OF MEDICAL WEB RESOURCES:
TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT THEIR CREATION, MAINTENANCE AND ACCESS,
HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL (http://jhi.sagepub.com)

Guest Editors: V. Karkaletsis, P. Karampiperis, M.A. Mayer


Description
===========
The increasing amount of freely available health-related web content
generates, on the one hand, excellent conditions for self-education
of patients as well as physicians, but on the other hand entails
substantial risks if such information is trusted irrespective of low
competence or even bad intentions of its authors.

Patients continue to find new ways of reaching health information on
the web and more than four out of ten health information seekers say
the material they find affects their decisions about their health.
However, it is difficult for health information consumers, such as
the patients and the general public, to assess by themselves the
quality of the information because they are not always familiar with
the medical domains and vocabularies.

This is why medical web resources accreditation by renowned authorities
is of high importance. However, various health web content surveys
show that the proportion of accredited web resources is insufficient
because of the difficulty labeling authorities face in coping with the
amount and dynamics of the medical web. The content of medical web
resources is very variable and difficult to assess.

The development of tools to support the process of describing the
content of medical web resources with meta-data that facilitate their
retrieval, and with content labels by certified labeling authorities,
is crucial for the delivery of content of better quality to health
information consumers. Moreover, end-usersï¿½ description of
health-related web resources with opinions and comments has the
potential to provide a useful additional source of information to both
end-users and labeling authorities.

To this end, the scope of this special issue is to assess the current
status and technologies, as well as to outline the major challenges
and future perspectives, related to the description of medical web
resources.

This special issue continues the 1st International Workshop on
Describing Medical Web Resources - DRMed 2008 (www.medieq.org/drmed2008),
held in conjunction with the 21st International Congress of the
European Federation for Medical Informatics (MIE 2008), May 27, 2008,
Goteborg, Sweden.


Subject Coverage
================
Topics for the special issue include, but are not limited to:

 * Knowledge representation and management technologies (e.g. OWL, RDF,
   annotation schemas, etc.) that enable the creation of
   machine-processable descriptions of medical web resources, either
   by experts or simple users.

 * Challenges related to content collection and information extraction
   techniques that allow the retrieval of unclassified/unlabeled web
   resources or the continuous monitoring of already classified/
   labeled ones.

 * Applications of medical Web content certification, utilizing Semantic
   Web technologies/tools.

 * Tools/technologies facilitating end-usersï¿½ description of
   health-related web resources in social networks.


Notes for Authors
=================
Submitted papers should not have been previously published nor be
currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

All papers are refereed through a peer review process. A guide for
authors is available on the Manuscript Submission Guidelines page of
SAGE Publications:
