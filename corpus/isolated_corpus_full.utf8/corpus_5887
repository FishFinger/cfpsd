Meeting Description:

Human Technology Centre (HumTec)
RWTH Aachen University in collaboration with
Berlin Gesture Center (www.berlingesturecenter.de)
VW-project 'Towards a Grammar of Gesture' at the European University Viadri=
na (www.togog.org)

Organizers:

Irene Mittelberg, HumTec, RWTH Aachen University
Cornelia M=FCller, European-University Viadrina & Berlin Gesture Center

This workshop is the third event in a series of workshops dedicated to Meth=
ods of Gesture Analysis (MGA). Previous locations include European-Universi=
ty Viadrina and VU University Amsterdam. The workshop brings together exper=
ts in gesture research and doctoral students, post-docs, and faculty who wi=
sh to receive hands-on training in the analysis of spontaneous coverbal ges=
tures.

MGA takes a semiotic, semantic, and micro-analytic stance. The workshop spa=
ns both formal and semantic aspects of gesture analysis. While participants=
 will be introduced to the core concepts that are central to this approach,=
 the focus will be on analyzing speech and gesture data bottom-up. We will =
move from a fine-grained gestural form analysis (form features, gesture pha=
ses, and gesture combinations) to mimetic modes and finally to some of the =
central semantic processes in concrete and abstract referential gestures (i=
ncluding iconicity, indexicality, metaphor, and metonymy). Special attentio=
n will be paid to the distribution of semantic features across speech and g=
estures.

In addition, there will be a joint plenary talk (title tba) by:

Alan Cienki, VU University Amsterdam, and
Cornelia M=FCller, European University Viadrina.

Workshop fees: =80 40 for students and =80 80 for non-students (covering re=
gistration, tea/coffee breaks, and the welcome reception). Attendance is li=
mited to 20 participants.=20

Call for Papers:

If you are interested in participating, please email your CV and a one-page=
 description of your experience with and/or interest in gesture analysis by=
 September 7, 2009 to mga2009@humtec.rwth-aachen.de

Further details concerning the program will soon be made available at www.h=
umtec.rwth-aachen.de (under ''Natural Media & Engineering'').
