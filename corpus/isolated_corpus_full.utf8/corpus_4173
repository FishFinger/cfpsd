Call for Papers: Special Issue of English for Specific Purposes

ESP Research in Europe

Guest editor: Inmaculada Fortanet-Gomez, Universitat Jaume I, Spain

Europe is at the moment going through major changes. The European Union has
expanded to include 27 countries, many of them earlier members of the USSR
which, for decades, had very few contacts with Western Europe. 
One of the principles of the EU is that all citizens should be able to
live, work or study in any country of Europe. As a consequence, in recent
years great efforts have been made to facilitate the mobility of citizens,
both workers and students. Additionally, greater emphasis has been given to
multilingualism. A directive has been made for EU citizens to have a good
command of at least two European languages other than their own mother tongue.

All these policies have had an impact on the teaching and researching of
languages for specific purposes, especially English, which has reinforced
its role as a 'lingua franca' in Europe in professional and academic
communications. The aim of this special issue is to present examples of
empirical ESP research being carried out in this context.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

A 600 word abstract should be submitted which represents previously
unpublished work on ESP research in Europe. On a separate page, include
each author's name, affiliation, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone
and fax numbers, and a 50-word biographical statement. 

The deadline for abstracts is 31 March 2009.

Decisions will be made on the basis of these abstracts to invite authors to
submit a full paper for consideration for publication. Full papers will be
due on 30 November 2009 and will follow the normal peer-review process for
the journal.

Abstracts should be submitted to:
