Meeting Description

The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories will be
held on December 7-8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway. Submissions are invited for
papers, posters and demonstrations. The workshop invites submissions that
discuss relevant innovative work in treebanking, including the relations and
links between, and possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological,
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic annotation; furthermore, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation schemas,
on the relation between linguistic theory and the practice of annotation, and on
applications of information in treebanks are encouraged as well.

First Call for Papers

The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories will be
held on December 7-8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway. Submissions are invited for
papers, posters and demonstrations presenting high quality, previously
unpublished research in the topics described below. Contributions should focus
on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel
approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical,
formal or computational. Papers and poster abstracts will be published in paper
as well as online proceedings.

Workshop motivation and aims

Treebanks are language resources that include annotations at levels of
linguistic structure beyond the word level. They typically provide syntactic
constituent or dependency structures for sentences and sometimes functional and
predicate-argument structures. Treebanks have become crucially important for the
development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human
language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general.
There are a number of ongoing projects aiming at compiling representative
treebanks for specific languages. In addition, there are projects that develop
tools or explore annotation beyond syntactic structure and beyond a single language.

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown that there is
a relation between formal linguistic theory and the practice of syntactic
annotation. Therefore the connection between treebank development and linguistic
theories and paradigms merits attention.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced
students working in these areas. We encourage interested potential participants
to read the proceedings of the previous workshops. See the webpage for links to
previous workshops.

Workshop topics

The workshop invites submissions that discuss relevant innovative work in
treebanking, including the relations and links between, and possibly merging of,
various aspects of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic annotation;
furthermore, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks and/or
cross-language annotation schemas, on the relation between linguistic theory and
the practice of annotation, and on applications of information in treebanks are
encouraged as well.

Invited speaker

An invited lecture will be presented by Julia Hockenmaier (University of
Pennsylvania).
