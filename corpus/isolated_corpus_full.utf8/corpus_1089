Subject: 2007 NooJ Conference 

	

Full Title: 2007 NooJ Conference 
Short Title: NooJ Conference 

Date: 07-Jun-2007 - 09-Jun-2007
Location: Barcelona, Spain 
Contact Person: Xavier Blanco
Meeting Email: lab.flexsem@uab.es
Web Site: http://seneca.uab.es/jsastre 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 02-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

NooJ is a linguistic development environment that includes tools to
construct and maintain large-coverage lexical resources, morphological and
syntactic grammars. Dictionaries and grammars are applied to texts in order
to locate morphological, lexical and syntactic patterns, remove ambiguities, tag
words, extract semantic entities, perform Automatic Machine Translation, etc.

NooJ can build lemmatized concordances of large texts from Finite-State
Automata and Transducers, Context-Free grammars and Recursive Transition
Networks, and can accordingly perform transformation operations on texts in
cascade to recursively annotate texts, which gives it the power of a Turing machine.

NooJ is based on the Object Oriented 'Component Programming'  NET
framework. Its most exclusive characteristics are:

NooJ's linguistic engine uses an annotation system synchronized to the text,
that allows morphological, syntactic and semantic grammars to be applied to
texts without modifying the original text; this allows linguists to describe
various phenomena independently, and apply the corresponding grammars in cascade.

Its integration of its inflection & derivation engine into its syntactic
engine allows linguists to program Harris-type transformations.

NooJ includes processes texts and corpora in over 100+ file formats,
including all variants of UNICODE, ASCII, HTML, MS-OFFICE, etc.; its
linguistic engine is multilingual; it can import information from, and
export its annotations back to XML documents; NooJ command-line program
and direct Object Oriented API make it much easier to integrate any of its
functionalities into other applications, etc.

NooJ is used as a linguistic development platform, an information retrieval
system, a terminological extractor, as well as to teach linguistics and
computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ: www.nooj4nlp.net.

As in previous INTEX/NooJ conferences, this meeting will be the opportunity
for NooJ users, as well as other researchers interested in NLP, to meet and
to exchange their experience of development, research or teaching,
including computational morphology, lexicon and quantitative linguistics.
It will also be the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of
NooJ. 

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 2, 2007 to
lab.flexsem@uab.es. The abstract, in French or in English, should contain the
title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail and electronic address
of each co-author.

    All papers will be reviewed by the program committee. Authors will be
notified whether their papers are accepted or rejected by the end of April, 2007. 
The timeslot is 30 minutes for presentations, including 5 minutes for discussion.
