Symposium ''The Management of Multilingualism : Which Future for Indigenous
Minority Languages?''

Conveners:
Philippe Hambye, hambye@rom.ucl.ac.be
Teofilo Laime, telaime@hotmail.com
Silvia Lucchini, lucchini@rom.ucl.ac.be 

Symposium description:
The symposium intends to address questions about the actual management of
indigenous minority languages. This management plays a fundamental role for
indigenous people, to the extent that it determines their access to economic and
symbolic resources. The different aspects of this matter may be approached by a
large set of disciplines which are interrelated. Comparative analysis with
minority languages in European contexts are also welcome.

We expect papers addressing:
- sociopolitical matters, in relation with different political measures aiming
to promote minority languages and determining language use in public
institutions, including the school system;
- sociolinguistic matters, such as those linked to attitudes towards languages,
the relation between language and identity, or the spread of languages (and
their varieties) in the social space considering notably the dynamic generated
by internal migration movements;
- linguistic matters, referring for example to normalization or standardization
issues;
- psycholinguistic matters, related to the acquisition of spoken and written
languages in multilingual and diglossic contexts;
- educational matters, such as the management of multilingualism in school
curriculum and within the daily interactions in the classrooms, to ensure the
teaching/learning of a schooling language.

Languages of the symposium:
Spanish and English. An oral presentation in French with a written abstract in
Spanish or English would also be accepted.

Organization and dates:
- The symposium will take place on April 12th and 13th 2007 and will consist of
2-4 one hour and a half sessions, including 8 to 16 papers (each talk will be 15
min long).
- The conveners are responsible for the selection of the papers.
- Abstracts for papers should be sent to the symposium's conveners by November
30th 2006. The program of the symposium will be announced by December 10th 2006.
- The full text of accepted papers should be sent to the Congress' Organizing
Committee (ceisal@ulb.ac.be) before the conference in a way to publish them online. 
- Abstracts not accepted in the symposium may be presented during the Congress'
poster session.
