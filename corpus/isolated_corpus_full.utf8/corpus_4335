The 21st European Systemic Functional Linguistics Conference and Workshop
8-10 July, 2009
 Cardiff, Wales

Submission deadline: February 14 2009

First Call for Papers & Workshops


Theme: *Choice* =


      *The grammar is based on the notion of choice* (Halliday, 1969)  =


Choice could be considered the most important core concept in Systemic Func=
tional Linguistics. It
is perhaps the most controversial or challenging. What do we mean by choice=
?  Although choice is a
central notion in Systemic Functional Linguistics, it is rarely the explici=
t topic of research.  The
goal of ESFLCW09 is to consider the role of *choice* as a core concept in t=
heoretical and
applied work. =


We strongly encourage paper submissions to ESFLCW09 to address the theme of=
 *choice* in one of
the following ways.  Its role in:
* Systemic Functional Linguistic theory.
* Human language production and/or understanding.
* Computational language generation and/or parsing.
* Code-switching and multilingualism - one system or many?
* The practical analysis of the clause, text, and/or discourse.

We would also like to encourage submissions which link SFL with related lin=
guistic theories where
choice also plays an important role (for example, other functional approach=
es, psycholinguistics,
cognitive linguistics, etc.).  =


Papers focussing on other core concepts in SFL will also be accepted.  Rese=
arch on languages other
than English is strongly encouraged.  We also welcome submissions represent=
ing work in progress.

Presentations may be organised according to the following strands:


* lexicogrammar =

* phonology and intonation  =

* computational models
* language disorders
* corpus linguistics
* formulaic or mulitword expressions
* language production and understanding
* choice for the analyst
* code switching and multilingualism
* language acquisition
* language evolution
* historical linguistics
* other (please specify) =



Plenary Speakers: =


* Chris Butler, Swansea University
* Geoff Thompson, University of Liverpool
* Elke Teich, Technische Universit=E4t Darmstadt =

	=



Submissions

Papers: We invite submission of abstracts of papers for presentation at the=
 conference. Papers
directly relevant to the conference theme will be preferred but we will con=
sider other topics within
Systemic-Functional Linguistics. Presentations will be 20 minutes long plus=
 10 minutes for
questions. =


Workshops: We will be able to hold a small number of 1.5 hour workshops. Wo=
rkshops will need to be
directly relevant to the theme. Please send a description of the workshop.

For each submission, please provide:
* For each author: name, title, affiliation.
* Title of paper.
* Abstract (not more than 300 words).
* The strand or strands appropriate for your submission (if *other*, please=
 specify)
* State whether the submission is for a paper or workshop presentation.

Please send abstracts by email to: esflcw@cf.ac.uk =


Closing Date: 14 February 2009
