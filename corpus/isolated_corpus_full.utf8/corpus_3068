Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 11-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

'Subjectivity in Discourse' will be proposed as theme for a one-day at the 11th
IPra. Its aim will be twofold, consisting firstly in the detailed investigation
of expressions of subjectivity in one language (English), and secondly in the
search for universal aspects of the expression of subjectivity in a
cross-linguistic approach to the topic. 

Call for Papers 

Call deadline: 11-June-2008

Subjectivity in discourse - Proposed panel at the 11th International Pragmatics
Conference (IPra) to be held in Melbourne, Australia, 12-17 July 2009

Submissions are invited for abstracts for presentations on the topic of
''Subjectivity in discourse''. Papers should be 20 minutes in length. 10 minutes
will be provided for comments, questions and discussion.

Panel Description
In addition to propositional content speakers express - very often in the same
utterance - meanings which convey their personal feelings, attitudes, values
judgements, and assessments. These expressions of subjectivity are associated
with a number of particular linguistic structures, which have received
considerable attention during the past decade - especially in relation to native
speaker discourse in major genres and registers in American English (e.g.
conversation and academic discourse). It is the purpose of this panel to bring
together contributions which a) help to take stock of the diversity of
subjectivity markers and the function of encoding subjectivity in discourse in
one language, namely English, and b) help to search for universal aspects of the
expression of subjectivity by considering different languages. The combination
of both perspectives is intended to give us a better idea of language-specific
and language-independent aspects of the linguistic encoding of the speaker's
subjective perspective in discourse.

For the part focusing on English, we especially welcome contributions which
cover 'off-beat' data, i.e. texts and discourse analyses which, ideally, differ
at least in one respect from the 'standard fare' of American English native
speaker conversation or academic discourse in a synchronic perspective. Thus, we
are looking for descriptions of subjectivity in English from across the board -
including all international, regional and social varieties, registers, genres,
spoken/written modes, historical stages, speech communities, communities of
practice, speaker types, interaction types and also L2 English and lingua franca
communication.

For the part focusing on cross-linguistic comparison, we invite contributions
that focus on any one language, investigating its means for conveying
subjectivity. In particular, however, we would be interested in research that
takes a comparative or a typological approach in the quest for possible
universals, allowing us to see where cross-linguistic differences and
similarities are to be found in the field of subjectivity.

Linguistic Field(s): History of Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 2009 annual meeting of the SHESL* (Société d'Histoire et d'Epistémologie des
Sciences du Langage) will be dedicated to the history and epistemology of
Cognitive Linguistics. The conference is co-organized by the CNRS Research Group
on the History of Linguistic Theories (HTL Group, UMR 7597 - University of Paris
VII). 

The expression 'Cognitive Linguistics' designates theories which base their
analysis of linguistic structure on meaning and on general-purpose cognitive
processes, and which identify meaning with mental representations and operations. 

The conference aims to advance the understanding of the historical development
of cognitive linguistics and of its relation to other theories. It also seeks to
provide a forum for expounding and critically examining the theoretical notions
and descriptive tools which have been elaborated or adopted by Cognitive
Linguistics, and which are characteristic of the way it envisages language. 

Call for Papers

Proposals are invited for papers which might consider one or more of the
following themes (the list is not exhaustive):
- Grammaire Générale (e.g. Beauzée's ideas)
- Psychologizing theories of the meaning / form relation
- Cognitive Linguistics in the French tradition (e.g. Bréal, Guillaume)
- Contemporary history of Cognitive Linguistics (Pottier, Culioli, Fillmore,
Talmy, Lakoff, Langacker...) - the second ''cognitive revolution''
- History of the ''cognitive turn'' (in the 60s-70s) - its consequences for
linguistic theories
- Structuralism and Cognitive Linguistics
- The relation of Cognitive Linguistics to formal / generative theories of language
- The relation of Cognitive Linguistics to functional linguistics
- Descriptive tools and theoretical concepts of Cognitive Linguistics

Abstracts of 300 - 400 words should be submitted by e-mail, preferably in MS
Word format, both to fortis.jean-michel@neuf.fr and
stijn.verleyen@kuleuven-kortrijk.be by 15 July 2008. 

Abstracts should include (in this order): name and affiliation, e-mail address,
title of paper, abstract (if possible on one side of an A4 in a typeface no
smaller than 10). Please also indicate the following additional information:
scheduling restrictions or other special requests for your presentation;
audiovisual needs; need for written letter of acceptance (or indicate if an
acceptance by e-mail is sufficient). 

Abstracts are refereed by the conference committee (notification of acceptance:
15 October 2008).

There is no registration fee. All speakers will be reimbursed for travel
expenses and accommodation costs. Booking of accommodation in the conference
hotels will be arranged by the local organizers.
