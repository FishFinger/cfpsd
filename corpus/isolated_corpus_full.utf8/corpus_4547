CALL FOR PAPERS
The First IEEE International Workshop on
Multimedia Computing and Communications (MCC=9209)

Story continued on
The First IEEE International Workshop on IP Multimedia Communications (IPMC=
)
and
The Second International Workshop on Multimedia Analysis and Processing
(IMAP)

August 2 - 6, 2009
San Francisco, CA, USA
In conjunction with IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication=
s
and Network (ICCCN) 2009

The explosively growing momentum behind worldwide broadband deployment and
the emerging convergence of voice, image, video and data services offer the
base for various modern multimedia applications and services such as mobile
TV, multimedia messenger and blog, social networking, video conferencing,
Internet gaming, interactive TV, IPTV, and multimedia visualization,
navigation, management, search and retrieval. The advances of computing and
communication over wired and wireless networks and new technologies ranging
from multimedia coding, network infrastructure, content distribution
protocols, quality of service (QoS) management to post-processing and
analysis, have stimulated more diversified multimedia applications and
services.

In recent years, the emerging new techniques have been employed to
effectively integrate context and content for multimedia mining, management=
,
indexing and retrieval. The semantic and sensory gaps, which are difficult
or even impossible to bridge using traditional approaches, have been
narrowed to facilitate many real-world multimedia applications. Popular
applications and services such as youtube, facebook, Google, Windows Live
messenger, myspace, and variations are breaking the media monopoly of big
content and distribution companies, new multimedia based social networking
applications demand even more efficient and intelligent multimedia search
and mining capabilities. The increasing service requirements by multimedia
consumers inspire the rapid developments of interface design, interactive
models, communication infrastructure, mobile devices, etc. In addition, the
advances of video coding make many bandwidth-hungry video communication
applications possible. Novel video source and channel coding techniques suc=
h
as multiple description codes, transcoding, and network coding can certainl=
y
improve the efficiency of video transmission over the Internet. New
communication protocols such as peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies further
significantly improved the video broadcasting quality due to its distribute=
d
architecture that is capability to provide scalability, inherent robustness
and fault tolerance to the best effort-based Internet. On the other hand,
IPTV, built on managed IP network, is growing rapidly, targeting at
providing high quality video viewing experience that is at least as good as
what is offered by today's cable/satellite TV. At the same time, advances i=
n
wireless network technologies and video delivery mechanisms such as IEEE
802.11 (Wi-Fi) and the 3G and 4G cellular systems provide alternatives to
their wired peers, allowing users to access and produce video at any time
from anywhere.

The challenges for those applications and services to be successfully
deployed range from limited computation power considering the rich media
content, difficulty in content analysis and understanding, to the state of
the transport network. Besides, better video viewing experience always call=
s
for better compression algorithm, data rate adaptation, adaptive error
control, and error concealment technologies. A central theme in all these
efforts is novel approaches and solutions for multimedia computation and
communications. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a professional
forum for industry and academic researchers from around the world to presen=
t
their state-of-the-art accomplishments, exchange latest experiences, and
explore future directions for multimedia computing and communications.
Topics covered include, but are not limited to, the following:

Multimedia content analysis, representation, and understanding
Content, user, computation, and network aware media engineering
