Call for Papers

In recent work on grammaticalization and language change in general, it has
often been stressed that change does not affect individual lexemes, but ent=
ire
constructions (see Bybee et al. 1994: 11; Croft 2000:62, 156, 163; Heine 20=
03:
575; Bybee 2003: 602-3, 2007; Traugott 2007). However, although most case
studies on diachronic language change now recognize the importance of the s=
ource
construction as a whole, they generally focus on just one such construction=
,
drawing gradual, yet straight lines from one particular source construction=
 to
one specific syntagm. Using the metaphor proposed in Croft (2000: 32-37),
constructions form diachronic lineages as they are replicated in usage, and
change is typically conceived of as occurring within a lineage through alte=
red
replication. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that innovations in langu=
age
change may derive not just from one, but from different sources at once. Th=
at
is, change often seems to involve some interaction between lineages or betw=
een
the branches of a lineage.=20

Multiplicity of source constructions can be witnessed on two levels. On the
macro-level, the involvement of multiple source constructions entails a mer=
ger
of clearly distinct lineages. One linguistic item or construction can then =
be
traced back to two independent items or constructions, each with its own pr=
ior
history. Several types of merger can be discerned, which are however not
mutually exclusive:=20
- Syntactic blends ('intraference' in Croft 2000): the formal and functiona=
l
features of different lineages are recombined into a new construction. For
example, the Lunda passive has been argued to combine two source constructi=
ons,
a left-dislocated object construction and an impersonal construction (Giv=
=F3n &
Kawasha 2006). The history of English gerunds and present participles seems=
 to
be a protracted series of mergers, with exchange of formal, semantic and
distributional features (Fanego 1998; Miller 2000), to the point that the t=
wo
clause types are now believed to have merged completely (Huddleston & Pullu=
m 2002).=20
- Contact-induced change ('interference' in Croft 2000): the function of a
foreign construction is merged with a 'home-bred' form. Examples are the us=
e of
the locative preposition 'bei' instead of 'von' to mark the agent of passiv=
es in
Pennsylvania Dutch under the influence of English (Heine & Kuteva 2003: 538=
), or
the emergence of a periphrastic perfect in Silesian Polish, calqued on the
German perfect (Croft 2000: 146).
- Two lineages produce paradigmatic alternates in a single construction. He=
re
lineages merge on a functional level, but their different forms are retaine=
d and
integrated in a new paradigm. The clearest case is morphological suppletion=
, as
in English 'go/went' or Classical Greek 'trekh-/dram-' 'run'. However, the
phenomenon also occurs in syntax, as illustrated by the alternation of Dutc=
h
'hebben/zijn' or German 'haben/sein' as perfect auxiliaries. As is well kno=
wn,
the choice for one auxiliary or the other depends on the semantics of the v=
erb:
transitives and unergatives take 'hebben/haben'; unaccusatives take 'zijn/s=
ein'.
Though currently functioning as alternates within a single grammatical cate=
gory,
the 'hebben/haben'-perfect and the 'zijn/sein'-perfect can be traced back t=
o
different source constructions (Van der Wal 1992:152-153).
- A constructional slot attracts new items: it has been proposed that when
functional domains recruit new items through grammaticalization, this may i=
n
part be due to analogical attraction by a more abstract syntactic construct=
ion
(Fischer 2007). This seems particularly plausible when, in the extreme case=
, an
abstract slot recruits productively from a single source domain. For instan=
ce,
the English evidential 'be-Ved-to-V'-construction has become productive for
verbs of perception, communication and cognition (No=EBl 2001). But the iss=
ue is
more complicated when items from different source domains are involved.
Prepositions, for instance, may be derived from very different sources yet
converge on a single new category, as illustrated by German 'statt' and 'we=
gen',
deriving from nominal constructions, as opposed to 'w=E4hrend', deriving fr=
om a
participle (Kluge 2002).
=20
On the micro-level, innovation can take place within what is historically a
single lineage, but under the influence of different uses of the same item.=
 =20
- In lexical semantics, Geeraerts (1997) proposes that two senses of a
polysemous lexical item may conspire to produce a third.=20
- The same seems to happen in grammar. New uses of a grammatical or
grammaticalizing item may be triggered by pragmatic implicatures arising
(seemingly?) independently in a number of its collocations. For example, th=
e
aspectual meanings of the English phrasal verb particle 'out' arose in seve=
ral
specific collocations at once (De Smet forthc.). The development of the
emphasizing meaning of 'particular' was influenced by two other sense strai=
ns of
the adjective - a descriptive and a determining one - each associated with =
its
own specific collocational set. (Ghesqui=E8re 2009).=20
- The most dramatic cases are certain examples of degrammaticalization. For
example, Fischer (2000) has argued that, long after it had been reanalysed =
as an
infinitive marker, English 'to' has developed back in the direction of the
preposition 'to'.=20

The recurrent involvement of multiple source constructions in language chan=
ge
raises a number of questions, from methodological/descriptive to theoretica=
l:
1. How do we prove that different source constructions have a genuine impac=
t?
Clearly, mere resemblance of constructions does not necessarily imply that =
they
actually interact as sources of an innovation.=20
2. How should we typologize the various changes involving multiple source
constructions? For a start, involvement of multiple sources may be more lik=
ely
in some domains of grammar than others (semantics, morphology, syntax) and =
is
certainly more conspicuous in some cases than in others (macro-level vs.
micro-level). It is not entirely clear, then, whether in all cases we are
dealing with a similar phenomenon, triggered by fundamentally similar mecha=
nisms.=20
3. How common is the involvement of multiple source constructions in langua=
ge
change? It is possible that the involvement of multiple source construction=
s is
a significant catalyst for change, which could even imply that 'uncontamina=
ted'
lineage-internal changes form the exception. Alternatively, the involvement=
 of
multiple sources could be merely apparent or accidental and have no great i=
mpact
on change.=20
4. How can developments involving multiple source constructions be modelled=
 in a
theory of grammar and language change? Especially if change canonically inv=
olves
multiple sources, this has implications for how constructions are represent=
ed in
speakers' minds and how language change takes place (Joseph 1992). Proper
theoretical modelling of different changes is also necessary to determine t=
o
what extent multiplicity of source constructions in change is a homogeneous
phenomenon.=20

We invite papers that address one or more of the above questions, to be
presented in a one-day workshop, bringing together scholars interested in
language change, from the domains of grammar, grammaticalization, morpholog=
y and
typology. Particularly welcome are papers that are based on corpus and/or
historical data and that aim to contribute to existing theorizing.
