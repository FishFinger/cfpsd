                CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
               =20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=


The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI)
is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around
Europe.

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics,
logic and computation.  ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and
advanced courses, as well as workshops, covering a wide variety of
topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation,
Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
500 students from Europe and elsewhere.  The school has developed into
an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information.

The ESSLLI 2008 Program Committee invites proposals for
foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops
for the 20th annual Summer School on a wide range of timely topics
that have demonstrated their relevance in the following fields:

  - Logic and Language
  - Logic and Computation
  - Language and Computation

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than

               ******* Monday July 2, 2007. *******

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision no
later than Monday September 10, 2007.  Proposers should follow the
guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that
deviate can not be considered.

GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION: Anyone interested in lecturing or
organizing a workshop during ESSLLI-2006, please read the following
information carefully.

ALL COURSES: Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers. They
consists of five sessions (a one-week course), each session lasting 90
minutes.  Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course should
submit two independent one-week courses (for example an introductory
course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during
the second).  The ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only
one of the two proposed courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submissions:

  July 2, 2007: Proposal Submission Deadline
  Sep 10, 2007: Notification
  June 2, 2008: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course
                material (by ESSLLI Local Organizers)

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not
assuming any background knowledge.  They are intended for people to
get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them.
Ideally, they should allow researchers from other fields to acquire
the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community.
Foundational courses may presuppose some experience with scientific
methods in general, so as to be able to concentrate on the issues that
are germane to the area of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the
activities of the Summer School.  They are intended to equip students
and young researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic
methods and techniques.  Introductory courses in, for instance,
Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component
fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational linguistics
should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of
linguistics and computation.  Proposals for introductory courses should
indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the
area (if available).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students.  Proposals for advanced courses
should specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced
Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their
work.  Workshops should have a well defined theme, and workshop
organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. It is a
strict requirement that organizers give a general introduction to the
them during the first session of the workshop.  They are also
responsible for the organization and program of the workshop
including inviting the submission of papers, reviewing, expenses of
invited speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be
responsible for producing a Call for Papers for the workshop by
November 11, 2007.  The call must make it clear that the workshop is
open to all members of the LLI community.  It should also note that
all workshop contributors must register for the Summer School.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions:

  July 2, 2007: Proposal Submission Deadline
  Sep 10, 2007: Notification
  Nov 11, 2007: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers
                (by ESSLLI PC chair)
  Nov 18, 2007: Workshop organizers send out (First) Call for Papers
  Mar 17, 2008: Deadline for Papers (suggested)
  Apr 28, 2008: Notification of Workshop Contributors (suggested)
  June 2, 2008: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of Workshop
                Proceedings (by ESSLLI Local Organizers)

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the
Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced
rate to be determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: The web-based form for submitting course and
workshop proposals is accessible at=20
http://www.folli.org/submission.php.  You will be required to submit the =

following information:

  * Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)

  * Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer;
    where possible, please include phone and fax numbers)

  * Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

  * Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory
    course, or an advanced course?)

  * Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation,
    Language & Logic or Logic & Computation? name only one)

  * Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed contents =
and
    substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)

  * External funding (will you be able to find external funding to
    help fund your travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

  * Further particulars (any further information that is required by
    the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, =
indicate
    here your teaching experience in an interdisciplinary field as the
    one addressed by ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer schools
is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as
low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for their
contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to a
fixed, maximum amount that will be notified to lecturers when courses
are accepted).  It should be stressed that while proposals from all
over the world are welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full
reimbursement of travel costs, specially from destinations outside
Europe.

Please note the following: In case a course is to be taught by two
lecturers, a lump sum is reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation
expenses for one lecturer. The splitting of the sum is up to the
lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, and such issues might be taken
into account when selecting courses.
