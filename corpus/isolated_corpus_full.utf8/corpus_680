Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

LASSO 2007: Linguistic Legacies 

Abstracts for papers in any area of linguistics including language acquisition are welcome, as are proposals dealing with language issues of special interest in the Southwest. Proposals for complete panels with 2-4 speakers are also welcome. Early submission of panel proposals is desirable.

Presentation time for papers will be twenty minutes plus ten minutes for discussion. Abstracts may be in English or Spanish. Presentations should be given in the same language as the abstract. Only one abstract as single author and a second as co-author will be accepted from any one individual. Submissions by graduate students are welcome, and students are eligible for the Helmut Esau Prize, a $250 cash award.

Abstracts should be 250-500 words, single-spaced in 11 point Times New Roman font.  Abstracts should summarize the main points and indicate key aspects of the data and methodology.  Use of special font items should be kept to a minimum. In general, omit the bibliography.

At the conference, abstracts will be distributed as received. At the beginning of the abstract, write the title of the paper. At the end of the abstract, repeat the title and also list the author's name (if more than one author, list names in the order they should appear in the program), academic affiliation, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail. If the author will not be available at his/her usual address or e-mail during the summer, provide summer contact information in the cover e-mail. Also note whether any audio visual equipment will be needed.

Abstracts should be e-mailed to lasso2007@byu.edu as a PDF, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, RTF, or text file attachment. Special font items travel best as a PDF. In addition to sending the abstract as an attachment, please paste the text of the abstract into the e-mail message itself.

Authors without access to e-mail may mail a disk copy accompanied by a paper copy to:

David Eddington
Dept. of Linguistics and English Language
Brigham Young University
4064 JFSB
Provo, UT 84602

Authors will receive a reply notifying them that their abstracts are under consideration. If such notification has not been received within one week, the abstract did not reach its destination and should be resent. Authors will be notified in July as to whether their papers have been accepted.

Participation in LASSO is a privilege of membership; this means that an individual must be a current member in order to be listed in the conference program.

For membership information, contact LASSO Executive Director Patricia MacGregor-Mendoza at pmacgreg@nmsu.edu.
