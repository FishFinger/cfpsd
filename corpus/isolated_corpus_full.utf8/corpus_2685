    SIGDIAL 2008 9th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue
COLUMBUS, OHIO; June 19-20 2008 (with ACL/HLT 2008)
       http://www.sigdial.org/workshops/workshop9


      =3D=3D> NOTE: EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE! <=3D=3D
** Submission Deadline: Mar 14 2008 **
2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

Continuing with a series of successful workshops in Antwerp, Sydney,
Lisbon, Boston, Sapporo, Philadelphia, Aalborg, and Hong Kong, this
workshop spans the ACL and ISCA SIGdial interest area of discourse and
dialogue. This series provides a regular forum for the presentation of
research in this area to both the larger SIGdial community as well as
researchers outside this community. The workshop is organized by
SIGdial, which is sponsored jointly by ACL and ISCA. SIGdial 2008 will
be a workshop of ACL/HLT 2008.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementation or analytical work on
discourse and dialogue including but not restricted to the following
three themes:

1. Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems

Discourse semantic and pragmatic issues in NLP applications such as
text summarization, question answering, information retrieval
including topics like:

- Discourse structure, temporal structure, information structure
- Discourse markers, cues and particles and their use
- (Co-)Reference and anaphora resolution, metonymy and bridging
   resolution
- Subjectivity, opinions and semantic orientation

Spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems including
topics such as:

- Dialogue management models;
- Speech and gesture, text and graphics integration;
- Strategies for preventing, detecting or handling miscommunication
   (repair and correction types, clarification and under-specificity,
   grounding and feedback strategies);
- Utilizing prosodic information for understanding and for
   disambiguation;


2. Corpora, Tools and Methodology

Corpus-based work on discourse and spoken, text-based and multi-modal
dialogue including its support, in particular:

- Annotation tools and coding schemes;
- Data resources for discourse and dialogue studies;
- Corpus-based techniques and analysis (including machine learning);
- Evaluation of systems and components, including methodology, metrics
   and case studies;


3. Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling

The pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e. beyond
a single sentence) including the following issues:

- The semantics/pragmatics of dialogue acts (including those which are
   less studied in the semantics/pragmatics framework);
- Models of discourse/dialogue structure and their relation to
   referential and relational structure;
- Prosody in discourse and dialogue;
- Models of presupposition and accommodation; operational models of
   conversational implicature.


SUBMISSIONS

The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers for full
plenary presentation as well as short papers and demonstrations. Short
papers and demo descriptions will be featured in short plenary
presentations, followed by posters and demonstrations.

- Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title,
   examples, references, etc. In addition to this, two additional pages
   are allowed as an appendix which may include extended example
   discourses or dialogues, algorithms, graphical representations, etc.
- Short papers and demo descriptions should aim to be 4 pages or less
   (including title, examples, references, etc.).

Please use the official ACL style files:
     http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~djh/acl08/stylefiles.html

Submission/Reviewing will be managed by the EasyChair system. Link to
follow.

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information (see submission
format). SIGdial 2008 cannot accept for publication or presentation
work that will be (or has been) published elsewhere. Any questions
regarding submissions can be sent to the co-Chairs.

Authors are encouraged to make illustrative materials available, on
the web or otherwise. For example, excerpts of recorded conversations,
recordings of human-computer dialogues, interfaces to working systems,
etc.
