workshop on the topic of Music, Language and Movement. The aim of the meeting is
to consider the interaction between these different forms of human communication
and artistic expression. The meeting will include lectures, discussions,
workshops and performances and will take place in the beautiful environment of
Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex. 

Deadline for proposals: Friday 18th May 2007

Date: 11-Nov-2007 - 11-Nov-2007
Location: Busan, Korea, South 
Contact Person: Paul Buitelaar
Meeting Email: paulb@dfki.de
Web Site: http://olp.dfki.de/OntoLex07/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 01-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

The OntoLex workshop series is concerned with the interface between knowledge
representation in ontologies and the representation and use of linguistic
knowledge as encoded in (multilingual) lexicons. Previous OntoLex workshops were
held in Sozopol (2000), Las Palmas (2002), Lisboa (2004), Jeju (2005), Genoa
(2006). The extraction of ontology elements from textual data is a pre-requisite
for many Semantic Web applications. Hence the interface between ontologies
(describing objects in a domain) and the lexicon (describing the linguistic
features of terms that refer to such objects) is becoming increasingly important. 

1st Call for Papers for OntoLex07 - From Text to Knowledge: The Lexicon/Ontology
Interface
Workshop at ISWC07 (6th International Semantic Web Conference)

http://olp.dfki.de/OntoLex07/

November 11th, 2007
Busan, South-Korea

Endorsed By ACL SIGSEM (http://www.aclweb.org/sigsem) and the NEON project
(http://www.neon-project.org/)

We invite submission of papers on the following topics in this interdisciplinary
research area:

The lexicon/ontology interface
- Design principles for the integrated representation of lexical and ontological
knowledge
- The lexicon/ontology interface in multilingual and cross-cultural aspects of
ontologies

The lexicon in Semantic Web applications
- The role of (multilingual) lexicons in knowledge markup and ontology
population, i.e. in ontology-based information extraction from text
- Lexical aspects in ontology learning from text, i.e. in (multilingual) term
extraction, relation extraction, etc.
- Lexical approaches to ontology matching, i.e. in the extraction,
representation and use of synonyms for mapping between class/property labels
- Reengineering lexicons as ontologies, e.g. porting wordnets and framenets to
the Semantic Web

Ontologies in knowledge-based Natural Language Processing
- Ontological constraints on lexicon development for knowledge-based NLP
- Ontologies as resources for NLP-based tasks (question answering, document
classification, text mining, expert search, etc.)
