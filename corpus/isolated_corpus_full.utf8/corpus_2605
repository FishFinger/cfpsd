                       2ND CALL FOR PAPERS

        Natural Language Processing resources, algorithms
                   and tools for authoring aids

                        LREC 2008 Workshop
                        Marrakech, Morocco
                      Sunday, June 1st 2008


  http://perso.limsi.fr/amax/recherche/lrec2008-authoring-aids


              DEADLINE EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 19



Workshop Aims
-------------

Writing is a very complex task, involving many subtasks and constraints,
including goal setting, content determination, outline planning,
linguistic expression, discourse flow, and emphasis control. Finally,
formal output aspects (spelling, layout choices, etc.) need to be
checked. In sum, writers are juggling many, possibly even contradictory
constraints; without proper control, they might be overwhelmed, losing
orientation.

The aim of this workshop is to attract participants from both academia
and industry interested in this topic and to address questions such as
the following:

- How can we get a clearer picture of the writers=92 processes, strategies
and needs (for example, by looking over their shoulders, or asking them
to annotate text or make their needs explicit via the use of verbal
protocols)?

- Which components of the overall task could be and should be supported?

- What specific resources, algorithms and tools exist that could be used
to improve existing authoring aids or to build new ones?

- How do we evaluate such tools ?

One potential outcome of the workshop would be a roadmap for future
research in the field, as well as some awareness-raising with regard to
the needs and potential of authoring aids.


Workshop Topics
---------------

The topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited
to:

- writing processes, and computational tools to support the writer;
- resources to assist in writing;
- NLP techniques that can be used or have been used for assisting in
writing, including: grammar checking, document structuring, thematic
segmentation, and information retrieval for the writer;
- development of practical tools and resources for assisting writers and
their evaluation.

Submissions
-----------

Submissions of papers on original work are invited on any aspect
(empirical research and theoretical/methodological issues) of the topics
of the workshop, and should address the relevance for the development of
tools. Submitted papers should not exceed 6 pages (style files will be
provided later by LREC for camera-ready versions of accepted papers). As
reviewing will be blind, submitted papers should be anonymized.

Please use the following webpage for submitting:
