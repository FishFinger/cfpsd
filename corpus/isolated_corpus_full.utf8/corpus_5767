3rd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009

November 8-10, 2009, Hyatt Regency, Jeju Island, South Korea
http://lbm2009.biopathway.org

[Important: LBM 2009 has been brought forward to November 8-10, 2009 to enable participants to travel in due time to the AMIA annual conference, after having enjoyed research talks on the Jeju Volcanic Islands (UNESCO World heritage).]

LBM is an interdisciplinary forum that brings together researchers in biology, chemistry, medicine, public health and informatics to discuss and exploit cutting edge language technology.  Language, in its many forms, is the universal means to represent, question, and convey knowledge. Likewise applied technologies such as information extraction, summarization, and translation are key technologies for advancing biomedical research and healthcare provision. The automation of all these solutions empowers our ability to discover new knowledge.

All the available technologies are constantly being challenged by user demands in interdisciplinary research work leading into sustained growth in quantity and quality of existing language technologies.  The involved communities profit from information exchange about recent progress to efficiently exploit the available solutions and to improve interdisciplinary work.  This has led to the continued interest in the LBM symposium series, which offers a forum for synergistic interdisciplinary interactions as a rich source for significant advancements.  After all, to efficiently manage data and knowledge requires the meeting of specialists in all relevant domains.  

The International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2009 is the next opportunity for interdisciplinary interaction. LBM was established in 2005 and the remit of this event remains highly relevant today. The symposium focuses on the languages that are in active use for biology and medicine. We call for outstanding contributions to, but not limited to, the topics listed below:

    * Natural language: text mining, retrieval and managements;
    * Ontology language: semantic indexing, ontology construction, induction and management;
    * Logic language: knowledge representation;
    * Sequence language: RNA structure prediction, protein domain prediction;
    * Database language: database interface, query language;
    * Visualization language: information visualization, molecular visualization;
    * Image language: image indexing and retrieval

 
Important dates:
 

    * Paper Submission Deadline: August 31, 2009
    * Paper Acceptance Notification: September 30, 2009
    * Camera Ready Version Due: October 18, 2009
    * Symposium Dates: November 8-10, 2009 

 
Papers focusing on application aspects of languages in biology, chemistry, medicine, public health as well as theoretical aspects are welcome.

LBM 2009 will offer a diversity of high quality presentations: keynote and invited speeches, research presentations on ongoing scientific work (short and long papers), poster presentations and a panel discussion. Research presentations will be selected by peer review from the Programme Committee.

We intend to publish the best submissions to the symposium in special issues of peer reviewed journals.  We have selected the Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (JBCB <http://www.worldscinet.com/jbcb/jbcb.shtml>) for publications with a strong focus on biomedical informatics and the Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS <http://www.jbiomedsem.com>) for publications with a strong focus on semantic resources and their use in applications.  Upon submission of a manuscript, authors should indicate their preference.  All selected papers will receive at least one additional review from the respective journal.  All remaining manuscripts will be published in the online proceedings after the symposium.  

This year's symposium will be held on the beautiful volcanic resort island of Jeju in South Korea, a short 1 hour flight from Seoul. The island is well known for its scenic beaches, waterfalls, cliffs and caves that lie in harmony, as well as the mild temperature throughout the year. It also contains the UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site entitled Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes.
 
Program Chairs: Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann and Nigel Collier
General Chairs: Jong C. Park and Limsoon Wong
