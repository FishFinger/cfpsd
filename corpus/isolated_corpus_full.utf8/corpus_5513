International Conference
MACHINE TRANSLATION
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS ON
21-22 November 2009
Organised by: The Natural Language Translation Specialist Group of The
British Computer Society (BCS-NLTSG)
CALL FOR PAPERS
The Conference
The first Cranfield International Conference on Machine Translation,
jointly organised by the BCS-NLTSG and Cranfield University, was held in
1984.  A second Cranfield conference was held in 1994.
Machine Translation is now some 60 years old and in view of the success of
the previous Cranfield conferences, we are marking the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the first conference at Cranfield by holding another this
November.
The title for the Conference is:
Machine Translation: Twenty-Five Years On
Papers are invited which centre on any aspect of translation by machine or
aided by machine.
We are particularly interested in what has been achieved in Machine
Translation (MT) and Machine Assisted Translation (MAT) in the twenty-five
years from 1984, and also what is expected to happen in R & D in MT and
MAT in the next twenty-five years. =

Other aspects of translation are welcome too =96 for it is by the
interchanging of ideas that progress is made.
We invite papers reporting on recent advances in  all aspects of Machine
Translation, Computer-aided translation and Multilingual Natural Language
Processing in general, including (but not limited to): terminology
extraction and terminology  management; electronic dictionaries;
corpus-based language processing; word-sense disambiguation; machine
translation;  machine-aided translation; translation memory systems;
translation aids and tools; cross-lingual information retrieval; text
alignment; CALL; language resources; evaluation.
Emphasis at the Conference will be given to the latest research in MT and
MAT, illustrated wherever possible by computer demonstrations of working
systems.
Since the last conference, the influence of the Web cannot be ignored.
It is expected that the Conference will help to give an impetus for
further research and development in MT and MAT in the coming years.
We think everyone agreed how successful and enjoyable both the '84 and =9294
Cranfield Conferences were. We are expecting the 2009 Cranfield Conference
to be even better.
