Call for Journal of Universal Language (8:2)

Honorarium: As a token of our gratitude, the contributors will be awarded
the $500 honorarium (subject to taxation). 

The Journal of Universal Language provides a forum for discussions of
theoretical or practical research that pays close attention to language
usage, so as to provide a channel of communication between researchers of
various viewpoints. The primary aim of the journal is to encourage work
that makes people recognize the importance of the better communication tool
to those unfamiliar with linguistic knowledge, as well as work that makes
the complex nature of language more accessible to those working outside the
linguistic framework under review. 

The journal is structured to include: 

- work on artificial language, communication & culture in language usage,
typology, and universality in language; 
- interdisciplinary contributions written with applied linguists in mind; 
- brief notes, comments or observations concerning official languages; 
- reaction/replies to recent papers; 

Notes to contributors Format: 

1. The length of a manuscript should not exceed 40 pages. 

2. A 200-word abstract and keywords should be given at the beginning of
