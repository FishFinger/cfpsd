Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 22-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
This ESSLLI 2007 workshop aims at bringing together linguists working to expand
their exemplar-based models by computational modeling, and computational
linguists interested in extending exemplar-based models to aspects of language
cognition. 

Second Call for Papers
Revised Deadline for Submissions; 22nd March
Exemplar-Based Models of Language Acquisition and Use
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~davec/workshop.htm
13 - 17 August 2007 

Organized as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organizers: 
Rens Bod		rb@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
Dave Cochran		davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk  

Workshop Purpose: 
Exemplar-based models conceive of linguistic representations as being directly
shaped by speakers' memories of specific tokens of linguistic items. Such models
are being considered by a growing number of researchers in virtually all areas
of linguistics, from language acquisition and psycholinguistics to computational
linguistics and statistical natural language processing. The workshop is open to
all members of the Language, Logic and Information community, and is in
particular intended as a forum for advanced PhD students and more senior
researchers to share their research.

Workshop Topics: 
- Unsupervised exemplar-based systems for parsing and other NLP tasks;
Statistical grammar induction; bootstrapping in exemplar-based models of
language, in computers and infants. 
- The interaction between language and other cognitive modalities in
exemplar-based systems; exemplar based semantics and pragmatics.
- The nature of linguistic knowledge and representations in exemplar-based systems.
- Distributional learning; Pattern matching and language acquisition
- Statistical, item-based and corpus-based language acquisition
- Exemplars, recency and priming.
- Cognitive consequences of the problems of computational complexity in
exemplar-based algorithms and their solutions.
- Computational approaches to exemplar-based construction grammar; computational
approaches to usage-based linguistics.
- Comprehension and generation in exemplar-based systems.
- Learning as abstraction vs. learning as storage; or, proposals for integration.
- General theoretical/philosophical considerations regarding the relation of
computational models to experimental cognitive research

We are particularly eager to receive submissions of an interdisciplinary nature,
especially those bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.

Submission details: 
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 1000-2000 words. The
following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Submissions must be
suitable for anonymous review; reviewing will be double-blind. Please do not
include name, contact details, affiliation, or any self-identifying references
(eg: ''We proved in Smith 2003?'', rather than ''Smith 2003 proved?'') in the
text of the submission; please include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment)
containing the title of your submission, your name, contact details and
affiliation. Please send your submission electronically to
davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk by the deadline listed below. The submissions will be
reviewed by the workshop's programme committee and additional reviewers. The
accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The
format for the final versions will be MS Word.  

Workshop format: 
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second
week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper presentation (30 minutes) and
discussion (15 minutes) per session. On the first day the workshop organizers
will give an extended lecture to familiarize the audience with the topic.

Workshop dates: 13 - 17 August, 2007

Local Arrangements: 
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register
for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will correspond
to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee. Moreover, a number of
additional fee waiver grants will be made available by the OC on a competitive
basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those. 

There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. Workshop
speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should contact the local
organizing committee to ask for the possibilities for a grant.

Subject: Comparative Romance Linguistics Discussion Group 

	

Full Title: Comparative Romance Linguistics Discussion Group 

Date: 27-Dec-2007 - 30-Dec-2007
Location: Chicago, IL, USA 
Contact Person: Matthew Juge
Meeting Email: mattjuge@txstate.edu

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Language Family(ies): Romance 

Call Deadline: 07-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

Minority aspects of the Romance languages. 

We solicit abstracts on minority aspects of the Romance languages 
in any subfield of linguistics (e.g., phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax,
semantics, sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, etc.),  including
philological studies. 'Minority' refers (a) to the approach--non-Chomskyan, (b)
to minority groups speaking Romance, or (c) to the language itself--languages
other than the dominant languages of major nation-states (i.e., Portuguese,
French, Spanish, Italian, and Romanian), although abstracts on varieties of
these languages falling well outside the mainstream will be considered.
Abstracts with a comparative approach will be given special preference.
Presentations are 20 minutes.
Abstracts should be no more than one page (12 point font, 1-inch margins).

Deadline for receipt of abstracts: March 1, 2006.

Electronic submissions (as .pdf files) are preferred. Please send electronic
submissions to the e-mail address below.
