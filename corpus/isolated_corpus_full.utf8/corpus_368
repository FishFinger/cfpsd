Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2006 

Meeting Description:

This stream is part of a conference called Critical Management Studies. The
stream explores the role of English, other languages, discourses and
professional languages on processes of international management. 

The field of organisation and management studies has taken a linguistic turn,
which has placed language and language use at the centre of research and
enquiry. Language is seen as systems of meanings, which are central to the
process of constructing organisational, social and increasingly global
realities, and which are a performative, creative force. In this regard language
can be said to be the first and foremost means and source through which the
'connecting' of different socio-cultural, institutional and individual worlds
occurs. Organisational actors draw upon such systems of meaning to negotiate,
change, shape and reproduce their respective social contexts. These systems of
meanings act as powerful ordering forces in organisational contexts through the
way they bring about objects of knowledge, categories of social subjects, forms
of self, social relationships and also conceptual frameworks.
 
Critical discourse/language studies have contributed to a deepened understanding
of the role of power, privilege and worldview in the construction of identities,
of access to and exclusion from resources, of processes of globalisation, of
construction and enactment of gender and/or professional roles.  Concomitant
with this interest in such themes, the field has developed a rich methodology to
explore and analyse the use of language as it manifests itself in the use of
discourses, of rhetoric, of metaphors and other tropes, of stories and
narratives, of conversations and talks. 

However, the field nevertheless overlooks an 'odd absence'. In the light of the
interest in language and its use, it seems strange that there is no discussion
or consideration of the role and influence of languages (e.g. the French
language, the Japanese language) in general and the role of English as the
global 'lingua franca' in particular on processes of managing and organising in
an international context. While related fields, such as international business
and management studies, have made some progress in integrating the role of
languages into their research agendas, the field of organisation and management
studies has not even begun to explore the rich field of 'languages' and their
nexus of ties with the use of discourses, stories, conversations and tropes.

The overall purpose of this steam is therefore to begin to integrate the study
of the role of languages with the study of discourses, jargons, tropes and
stories. The convenors want to work within a critical tradition, by which we
understand that language is used in a context which is not neutral, but which
rather reflects differences in status and power. 

Translating these ideas into potential thematic contributions to the stream
papers might explore (either theoretically, conceptually and/or empirically):

- use and role of English in processes of organising and management

- use and role of 'other' languages in processes of organising and management
(and their interaction with English)

- the impact of languages (both as language and/or as specific discourses,
stories etc) on careers and identity construction

- the privileging of particular discourses and languages

- linguistic and discursive convergence of management knowledge and practices

- the use of English in management education - the non-use of other language
systems in management education

- the role and meaning of 'translation' in (international) organisational contexts

- language strategies  and language in use in international companies

- methodological papers engaging with the above topic areas, including
considerations of epistemological and ontological positions

- language/s and transfer of management knowledge
