The aim of the SIG Writing conferences is to promote interaction among researchers (linguists, cognitive and social psychologists, educational and developmental specialists) interested in understanding the cognitive, social, and developmental processes involved in writing, including the design of writing instruction in various educational settings and the exploration of the functions of writing in different social and institutional contexts. 

Call for Papers:

The EARLI Special Interest Group on Writing invites proposals to the 12th SIG Writing Conference to be held from 8th to 10th of September 2010 at the University of Education, Heidelberg, Germany.We welcome submissions of individual papers, posters, symposia and technical demonstrations on the various topics of writing research.

We look forward to seeing you in Heidelberg!
