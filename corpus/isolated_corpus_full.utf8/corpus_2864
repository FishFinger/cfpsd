BAAL 2008 will be held in Wales' second city of Swansea, situated on the South Wales coast. The University campus is located in coastal parkland, between the five-mile-long beach of Swansea bay and 100 acres of parks and gardens. In 2005, Swansea University received the Times Higher Education Supplement Award for the UK's Best Student Experience. The Department of Applied Linguistics at Swansea is a dynamic research centre, and has had a long association with BAAL. The vibrant city centre, with its new cultural and culinary waterfront developments, is within reach of the campus by foot or by bus. The nearest airport, outside Cardiff, is served by regular flights with low-cost airlines from cities across Britain and Europe, including Belfast, Glasgow, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cork, and Dublin.

Call for Papers

Abstracts are welcome in any area of Applied Linguistics that fits within the theme of the conference - ''Taking the Measure of Applied Linguistics''. This theme is deliberately intended to be inclusive and might include papers which take stock of Applied Linguistics generally, consider attempts to quantify language and language learning which is one important element of Applied Linguistics, or make the case that non-quantified language descriptions can be equally valid and useful in linguistic applications. 

Deadline for receipt of Abstracts: 31 March 2008

Please send one electronic copy to BAAL08@ling.ed.ac.uk in an email entitled ''BAAL08_oneinitialsurname'', e.g. ''BAAL08_dsmith'', in an attachment also entitled ''BAAL08_oneinitialsurname''. An e-mail confirmation of receipt of abstract will be sent within a week.

If you prefer to submit your abstract by post, please send four copies of your abstract to: Erik Schleef, Linguistics and English Language, 40 George Square, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9LL, Scotland, UK.

Label and format your abstract like this:
- Title in bold
- Name, affiliation, address, telephone number and email (if sending paper copies, put this information on only one copy)
- Text 300 words maximum (including the title and references)
- Single-spaced
- Justified
- Times New Roman 12 

Indicate the type of abstract that you are submitting: individual presentation, poster, SIG presentation, or colloquium.

- 20-minute individual presentation for the parallel sessions.

- Poster. We strongly encourage the submission of abstracts for posters. We aim to raise the profile of posters at our conference since we value them as equal to other forms of presentation and we believe that they tend to receive more feedback than individual papers. All posters will be listed in the book of abstracts and there will be a dedicated area and time slot for discussion of poster presentations. There will also be a prize for best poster displayed at the conference. The winner will receive £ 50 and a book.

- Presentation for a Special Interest Group (SIG) track. If you believe your paper is of interest to a SIG track, please clearly annotate it: 'of interest to X SIG'. The SIG may then wish to include your paper in a track at the annual meeting. This may or may not lead to your paper being included in a SIG track and has no impact on acceptance of your abstract. BAAL has eight Special Interest Groups. They are UK Linguistic Ethnography Forum, Corpus Linguistics, Psycholinguistics, Multimodality, Language Learning and Teaching, Language in Africa, Gender and Language, Assessment

- Proposed colloquium paper (this is submitted along with the other papers in the colloquium, and the title of the colloquium on the conference theme).

Guidelines:
1. Individual papers have 25 minutes: 20 for the presentation, 5 for questions.
2. SIG tracks and colloquia have half a day and a minimum of four papers. 
3. Colloquia proposers should plan their half day in four slots, in step with the individual paper slots. If they wish to have a larger number of papers, they may fit two papers into what would normally be a single slot. Colloquia papers should cohere. The order of the papers should not be changed after acceptance.
4. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously.
5. Each individual paper, colloquium and poster is rated by three reviewers: one Executive Committee and two Local Organising Committee members.
6. SIG track papers are also rated by three reviewers: two from the SIG and one Executive Committee member.

Indicate whether you want a scholarship: 
Send your scholarship application along with your abstract by 31 March 2008. Forms are available here: http://www.baal.org.uk/join_funding.htm.

BAAL offers ten UK student scholarships to postgraduate students based in the UK. The scholarships cover registration and accommodation. BAAL also offers two International scholarships, one of which is the Chris Brumfit International Scholarship. These are worth £1,000, which goes towards registration, accommodation, meals and travel.
