 22nd European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 

ESSLLI 2010, 9-20 August, 2010, University of Copenhagen, Denmark 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS 

The European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) is organized every year by the Association for Logic, 
Language and Information (FoLLI, http://www.folli.org) in different sites around Europe. The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface 
between linguistics, logic and computation. ESSLLI offers foundational, introductory and advanced courses, as well as workshops, 
covering a wide variety of topics within the three areas of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic and 
Computation. Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to 500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The 
school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the 
interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. 
For more information, visit the FoLLI website, as well as ESSLLIâ2009 website: http://esslli2009.labri.fr/. 


The ESSLLI 2010 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational, introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 
22nd annual Summer School on important topics of active research in the broad interdisciplinary area connecting logic, linguistics, 
computer science, and the cognitive sciences, structured within the 3 traditional ESSLLI streams:


-Language and Computation 
-Language and Logic 
-Logic and Computation 
We also welcome proposals that do not exactly fit one of these categories. 

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: All proposals should be submitted, using a prescribed form that will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 
website www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010, through EasyChair on http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2010, not later than

******* Monday, September 7, 2009 ******* 

Proposers must hold PhD or equivalent degrees and should follow the guidelines below while preparing their submissions; proposals that 
do not conform with these guidelines may not be considered. 

GUIDELINES FOR COURSE AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS: 

ALL COURSES: Courses are given over one week (Monday-Friday) and consist of five 90 minutes sessions, one per day. Course 
proposals should give a brief overview of the topic and a tentative content and structure of the course, as well as state the courseâs 
objectives and clearly specify prerequisites, if any. Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course, should submit two independent 
one-week courses (for example an introductory course in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced course during the second). The 
ESSLLI program committee has the right to select only one of the two proposed courses. 

TIMETABLE FOR COURSE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:

 Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

 Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

 Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material by the ESSLLIâ2010 local organizers 

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not assuming any background knowledge. They are intended for 
people who wish to get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow researchers from 
other fields to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary 
research community. Foundational courses should require no special prerequisites, but may presuppose some experience with scientific 
methods and general appreciation of the field of the course. 

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the activities of the Summer School. They are intended to provide an 
introduction to the (interdisciplinary) field for students, young researchers, and other non-specialists, and to equip them with a good 
understanding of the course field's basic methods and techniques. Such courses should enable experienced researchers from other fields 
to acquire the key competencies of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research 
community. Introductory courses in, for instance, Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component fields; e.g., 
an introductory course in computational linguistics should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of linguistics and 
computation. Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the area (if any). 

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for 
advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in detail. 

WORKSHOPS: Workshops run over one week and consist of five 90-minutes sessions, one per day. The aim of the workshops is to 
provide a forum for advanced Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their work. Workshops should have a well 
defined theme, and workshop organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. The proposals for workshops should justify 
the choice of topic, give an estimate of the number of attendants and expected submissions, and provide a list of at least 15 potential 
submitters working in the field of the workshop. The organizers are required to give a general introduction to the theme during the first 
session of the workshop. They are also responsible for the organization and program of the workshop including inviting the submission of 
papers, reviewing, expenses of invited speakers, etc. In particular, each workshop organizer will be responsible for sending out a Call for 
Papers for the workshop and to organize the selection of the submissions by the deadlines specified below. The call for workshop 
submissions must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of the ESSLLI community and should indicate that all workshop 
contributors must register for the Summer School. 

TIMETABLE FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS:

 Sep 7, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline

 Oct 19, 2009: Notification Deadline

 Nov 02, 2009: Deadline for submission of the Calls for Papers to ESSLLIâ2010 PC chair

 Nov 09, 2009: Workshop organizers send out First Call for Papers

 Jan 25, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Second Call for Papers

 Mar 08, 2010: Workshop organizers send out Third Call for Papers 

 Apr 12, 2010: Suggested deadline for submissions to the workshops 

 May 24, 2010: Suggested deadline for notification of workshop contributors

 Jun 30, 2010: Deadline for submission of camera-ready copy of workshop proceedings to the ESSLLIâ2010 Local Organizers. 

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced rate 
to be determined by the Local Organizers. 

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: A form for submitting course and workshop proposals will be available soon on the ESSLLI 2010 website 
www.hum.ku.dk/esslli2010. 

The proposers are required to submit the following information:

* Name(s) of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s), at most two per course or workshop 
* Contact addresses, homepages, phones, and fax numbers (if available), of proposing lecturer(s)/ workshop organizer(s); 
* Title of proposed course/workshop; 
* Type (workshop, foundational, introductory, or advanced course) 
* Stream (one of: Language & Computation, Language & Logic, Logic & Computation) 
* Description (in at most 300 words, provide justification, relevance to ESSLLI, proposed contents and structure of the courses, resp. 
  expected participation in the workshops) 
* External funding (whether the proposers will be able to obtain external funding for travel and accommodation expenses) 
* Further particulars (any further information that is required by the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, course 
  objectives and prerequisites, as well as the lecturers teaching experience relevant to the proposed course, and generally in the 
  interdisciplinary field scope of ESSLLI.) 

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer 
schools is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for 
their contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to fixed maximum amounts, that will be communicated to the 
lecturers upon notification). It should be stressed that while proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the School cannot guarantee 
full reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations outside Europe. Please note that in case a course or workshop is to be 
taught/organized by two lecturers, a lump sum will be reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation expenses for one lecturer; the 
splitting of that sum is up to the lecturers. 

The local organizers would highly appreciate it if, whenever possible, lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover 
travel and accommodation expenses, as that would help us keep the cost of attending ESSLLIâ2010 lower.
