        The Third Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW III)

             Held in conjunction with ACL-IJCNLP 2009
                              Suntec, Singapore
                               6-7 August 2009

        http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/LAW-09.html

Linguistically annotated corpora play a major role in parsing,
information extraction, question answering, machine translation and
many other areas of computational linguistics, and provide an
empirical testbed for theoretical linguistics research. This has led
to a proliferation of annotation systems, frameworks, formats, and
schemes. Recognition of the need to harmonize annotation practices and
frameworks has become increasingly critical, as witnessed by numerous
workshops dealing with different aspects of linguistic annotation over
the past few years. The Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW)
provides a forum for discussing these different aspects. Specifically,
the goals of this workshop include:

(1) The exchange and propagation of research results with respect to
the annotation, manipulation and exploitation of corpora, taking into
account different applications and theoretical investigations in the
field of language technology and research;

(2) Working towards the harmonization and interoperability from the
perspective of the increasingly large number of tools and frameworks
that support the creation, instantiation, manipulation, querying, and
exploitation of annotated resources;

(3) Working towards a consensus on all issues crucial to the
advancement of the field of corpus annotation.

The workshop will include presentations of long (8 page) and short (4
page) papers, a poster session, and demonstrations of annotation
tools, databases, and the like. Long papers should reflect work in an
advanced state, but short papers and posters may describe more
preliminary work and pilot studies. Posters and proposals for a system
demonstration are to be submitted in the form of a short (4 page)
paper. A demonstration proposal should provide an overview of the
system to be demonstrated, including functionality, supported
input/output formats or structures, supported languages and
modalities, etc. Accepted proposals will also appear in the
proceedings and are intended to provide background for the
demonstration.

The topics of all contributions may cover any aspect of linguistic
annotation including:
- New annotation schemes for linguistic phenomena at any level, or
   proposals for significant improvements to existing schemes
- Evaluation of emerging or existing standards for linguistic annotation
- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus
   annotation
- Linguistic considerations for merging of annotation of distinct
   phenomena
- Evaluation considerations for corpus annotation
- Comparison and/or evaluation of existing annotation systems, including
   functionality, common/missing features, accommodation of different
   input/output formats and resource types (lexicons, knowledge bases,
   ontologies, etc.)
- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation
   structures and annotated data
- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different
   phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them
- Assessment of, and potential means to achieve, interoperability of
   annotation formats/frameworks among different systems as well as
   different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages


Submissions
---------------
Long paper submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length. Short
papers, posters and demo descriptions should not exceed 4
pages. Format requirements are the same as for full papers of ACL
2009.  See http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/index.html
for style files.  Submission will be electronic, using the Workshop's
submission webpage at START: https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/LAW/

Please indicate on the front page:
- long paper, short paper, poster, or demonstration proposal;
- all applicable paper categories from the following list (indicate
   multiple categories if appropriate): annotation frameworks and/or
   physical formats, annotation scheme design (on linguistic grounds),
   annotation tools and systems, corpus annotation, syntax, semantics,
   predicate-argument structure, morphology, anaphora, discourse,
   opinion/sentiment;
- language(s) your work applies to, as well and those you plan to
   handle in the future. If your work is language independent, indicate
   this as well;
- any non-standard equipment needed for your paper or demonstration.

All papers must be written and presented in English.


Reviewing
-------------
The reviewing of the papers will be blind. The paper should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-citations and other references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or
software) that could reveal the author's identity should be
avoided. For example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)
...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".


Important Dates
-------------------
Papers due: April 3, 2009
Acceptance/rejection notification: April 30, 2009
Final version due: May 15, 2009
Workshop Dates: August 6-7, 2009
