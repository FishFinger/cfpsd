Call for Papers

IWPT 2009

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
11th International Conference on Parsing Technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponsored by ACL/SIGPARSE

October 7 - 9, 2009

Paris, France

~~~
http://alpage.inria.fr/iwpt09
~~~

ACL/SIGPARSE will host the 11th International Conference on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'09) on October 7 - 9, 2009 in Paris, France, at
the University of Paris 7.

IWPT'09 continues the tradition of biennial workshops on parsing
technology organized by SIGPARSE, the Special Interest Group on
Parsing of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The
first workshop, in Pittsburgh and Hidden Valley, was followed by
workshops in Cancun (Mexico) in 1991; Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy
(Belgium) in 1993; Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) in 1995;
Boston/Cambridge (Massachusetts) in 1997; Trento (Italy) in 2000;
Beijing (China) in 2001; in Nancy (France) in 2003; in Vancouver
(Canada) (2005); and in Prague (Czech Republic) in 2007.


Topics of interest for IWPT'09
------------------------------
Topics of interest for IWPT'09 include, but are not limited to:

theoretical and practical studies of parsing and transduction
algorithms for natural language sentences, texts, fragments,
dialogues, ill-formed sentences, speech input, multi-dimensional
(pictorial) or signed languages, multimedia (web) documents; parsing
issues arising or viewed in a multimodal and multilingual context;
parsing in relation to semantic and pragmatic information and
communication; cognitive aspects of grammar and their impact on
parsing.
Knowledge-based and data-driven approaches are equally welcome.


Time schedule: (short paper deadline has been extended to the 22 July,  =

2009)
--------------
Deadline for full paper submission: 29 May, 2009
Full papers notification of acceptance: 1 July, 2009
Deadline for short paper submission: 22 July, 2009
Short papers notification of acceptance:  20 August, 2009
Final papers due: 1 September, 2009
Conference: 7 - 9 October, 2009


Submitting Papers
-----------------
Two types of submissions are invited:
- full papers, to be presented as such during the conference and to
be published in the conference proceedings (maximally 12 pages);
- short papers, to be presented at the conference in the form of a
poster plus a summary oral presentation in a short-paper session;
four-page summaries will be published in the conference proceedings.

Submissions of either type should describe original work. Full papers
should be concerned with completed work or intermediate results of
ongoing work, rather than with intended work, and should indicate
clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Short papers
may describe planned or starting research or untested ideas.

A paper accepted for presentation at IWPT 2009 cannot be presented or
have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available
published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other
conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must
papers that contain significant overlap with previously published
work.

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. The paper should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-citations and other references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or
software) that could reveal the author's identity should be
avoided. For example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)
...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".


Instructions for authors
------------------------
Prospective authors are invited to send their submissions
through the electronic submission page of the conference. The only
accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Full papers should not
exceed 12 pages; short papers should not exceed 4 pages.


Detailed formatting and submission instructions for authors will be
available through the IWPT'09 home page at:

http://alpage.inria.fr/iwpt09
