Call for Papers

Language change has been a central research area in linguistics for at leas=
t 200
years. In retrospect, the field has seen questions being asked and answered=
, but
still many questions have not received a satisfactory answer, and others ar=
e
barely being asked. Also, new theoretical approaches are leading to fresh
questions being posed, a situation that in turn results in constantly shift=
ing
research frontiers. Moreover, novel research topics are being brought to th=
e
fore as a consequence of processes of globalisation. In our time, the conta=
ct
between people across borders and between different societies is constantly
getting broader and deeper, and at the same time, the challenges posed by
migration and integration are becoming more pressing. Language is a crucial
ingredient in these challenges. Thus, problems of  language contact and cha=
nge,
language interaction and mixture, language  development and acquisition, an=
d
language birth and language death, are urgently in need of illumination.

Given this background, the aim of our conference Language Contact and Chang=
e -
Grammatical Structure Encounters the Fluidity of Language is to bring toget=
her=20
researchers from different camps in linguistics in order to elucidate
theoretical questions as well as the seeming vagaries of a broad range of
phenomena of language contact and change. In particular, we wish to bring
together grammarians and sociolinguists, i.e. linguists doing research on t=
he
structure and system of language and linguist doing research on the use and
function of language, in order to try to bring new perspectives into the fi=
eld.
By bringing together researchers from different theoretical and methodologi=
cal
camps in this way, we wish to contribute to meaningful scientific interacti=
on
between researchers with different perspectives, thus facilitating fruitful
dialogue and cross-fertilisation that may lead to fresh insights and scient=
ific
advances. We sincerely believe that a satisfactory understanding of the dyn=
amic
and often extremely complex processes of language contact and language chan=
ge
requires a joint effort by both grammarians and sociolinguists.

The following linguists have already agreed to attend the conference as inv=
ited
speakers: Peter Auer, University of Freiburg; Derek Bickerton, University o=
f
Hawaii; Leonie Cornips, Meertens Institute; Frans Gregersen, University of
Copenhagen; Salikoko Mufwene, University of Chicago; Frederick J. Newmeyer,
University of Washington.

We invite submission of abstracts on the theme of the conference. Preferenc=
e
will be given to abstracts that have the potential of arousing the interest=
 of
both grammarians and sociolinguists, but more "one-sided" contributions are=
 also
welcome. Please send your 1 page abstract to gsfl2010@hf.ntnu.no no later t=
han
10 April 2010.=20
