Applications of Semantics, Opinion and Sentiments in eLearning=20
                        (ASOS)=20

         Workshop organized under the joint aegis of=20
             ELSNET and the LT4eL FP6  project=20
                To be held at EUROLAN 2007=20
              July 23-27 2007 Iasi, Romania=20

          http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/ASOS=20

        Paper submission deadline: May 21st, 2007=20


The  workshop  will  address  the main themes of the EUROLAN-2007=20
Summer School, that is  Semantics, Opinions and Sentiments (SOS),=20
in relation with eLearning.=20

One  of  the  main  benefits  of  education is that it allows the=20
student  to  come  into  direct  contact  with  the  lecturer. In=20
face-to-face  classroom  education,  a  significant  part  of the=20
formation is based on this activity, in which the student listens=20
to  the  lecturer,  and  is  supposed  to be conquered by her/his=20
eloquence,  by  her/his  vocabulary  and  style, by the charm and=20
charismatic presence of a human  being. The role of a lecturer is=20
to transmit not only knowledge, but also passion, discipline, and=20
moral values. Very  often, sentiments, as  let to be perceived by=20
the lecturer and the  student, influence crucially the quality of=20
education.  Emotions  and  their  expression  should be perceived=20
either  as  a  feedback  in  the  reaction of the student or as a=20
component of the didactic activities.=20

Within technology  enhanced learning,  interaction is mediated by=20
the  computer  and  the  role  of  the human lecturer seems to be=20
diminished.  However,  a  new  generation of eLearning systems is=20
being developed,  in which  the human  component will play a much=20
more  relevant  role.  The  challenge  is  to  make  the learning=20
activities,  in  which  the   computer  gains  a  more  and  more=20
significant position, as natural as possible.=20

The intent of the workshop  is to present new work and innovating=20
ideas for the development  of eLearning systems that will exploit=20
opinions and  sentiments in  the communication  between the tutor=20
(real  or  virtual)  and  the  student.  The following topics are=20
relevant for the ASOS event:=20

* molecules of emotion, sentiment classification and modeling=20
* automatic and semi-automatic discovery of subjectivity=20
  indicators in education=20
* signaling and controlling sentiments in learning objects=20
* separation of subjectivity and objectivity in educational=20
  materials=20
* automatic generation of learning objects by integrating=20
  opinions and sentiments into content=20
* humor recognition and generation in educational media=20
* tracking themes and opinions over time=20
* annotation for deep semantics, sentiment, and subjectivity in=20
  eLearning=20
* subjectivity/sentiment and analysis of discourse and dialogue=20
  in chats, blogs, forums and interactive educational systems=20
* educational interfaces involving avatars displaying emotion=20
* communicating emotion in intelligent educational systems=20
* sentiments, opinions and rational behaviors in educational=20
  environments=20
* relationship between intelligent systems and emotional systems=20
* novel intelligent learning structures for emotional function=20
  and eLearning=20
* implementation of emotional systems and e-learning systems=20
* expressivity communicated in learning environments through=20
  speech and text=20
* applications of SOS to improve personalized and adaptive=20
  learning, adaptive information filtering and retrieval,=20
  intelligent tutoring=20
* behavior, emotions and sentiment ontologies=20
* evaluation of SOS in eLearning environments=20
* evaluation of emotional eLearning systems=20
* multilingual aspects in all the above=20

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished work=20
within the workshop themes.  All submissions  (even if they focus=20
on  only  one a spect  of  the mentioned topics)  should show how=20
eLearning  could  benefit  from  the  results.=20

We  encourage  submissions  by  young  researchers  even if their=20
research is in its initial stage since the workshop will give the=20
chance to presenters to shape their ideas and receive feedback.=20

The workshop will run  for three-four consecutive evenings during=20
the EUROLAN-07 Summer School.  Selected proposals will be invited=20
for a 30 minutes presentation  which will be followed by one hour=20
discussion moderated  by a  member of  the Program Committee. The=20
papers presented,  together with  a text summarizing the recorded=20
discussions following  the presentations,  will be published in a=20
volume in the "Al.I.Cuza" Publishing House.=20

The best reviewed  submission will be  granted a scholarship from=20
the  LT4eL  European  Project (http://www.lt4el.eu/) to cover the=20
EUROLAN registration fee.=20

Proposals should be no  longer than 8 pages, references excluded,=20
and should be structured as follows:=20
- title, authors and affiliations=20
- short   presentation   of   the  domain  and  related  work/and=20
  achievements=20
- your own previous work in this area (if existent)=20
- the main idea of the proposal=20
- your expected feedback from  the audience, including some major=20
  questions that you want to address=20
- the potential and feasibility of the idea=20
- the foreseen dangers=20
- references=20

In order  for your  proposal to  be selected, you should convince=20
the Program Committee that it is SMART (Specific to the mentioned=20
field,  the  effort  encumbered  be Measurable, its objectives be=20
Achievable, the outcome be  Relevant, and its realization be well=20
Time-framed).=20

Submissions will be electronic. The  papers will be uploaded on a=20
special  page,  to  be  announced  on  the  web  page of the ASOS=20
workshop. Important dates:=20
