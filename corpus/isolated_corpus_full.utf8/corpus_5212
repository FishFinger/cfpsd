18th International Conference on Pragmatics & Language Learning

The 18th International Conference on Pragmatics and Language Learning (PLL18) 
will take place at Kobe University, Kobe, Japan from 16th to 19th of July, 2010.

The PLL conference aims to foster an exchange of views on language use from a 
variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives and will address a broad 
range of topics in pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and discourse analysis, 
including conversation analysis, critical discourse analysis, narrative 
analysis, and interactional sociolinguistics.

We are particularly interested in how language is used in
- Second and foreign language learning
- Educational settings
- Intercultural interaction
- Work place interaction
- Pragmatics of academic talk and text
- Multimedia discourse
- Computer-mediated communication
- Multilingual talk, and
- Other similar situations

The conference provides an international forum for language educators who are 
interested in issues of pragmatics and discourse analysis.
