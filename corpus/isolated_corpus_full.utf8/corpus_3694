About ICTAC 2009
----------------

ICTAC 2009 is the 6th  International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects
of  Computing, the latest  in  a series  founded by the  International
Institute for  Software  Technology of  the  United Nations University
(UNU-IIST).  The    main purpose  of  ICTAC   is    to bring  together
practitioners and researchers  from academia,  industry and government
to present research and  to  exchange ideas and  experience addressing
challenges  in  both theoretical  aspects  of   computing and in   the
exploitation   of   theory  through  methods   and  tools   for system
development. The previous four   ICTAC  events were held  in  Guiyang,
China (2004), Hanoi,   Vietnam (2005),  Tunis, Tunisia (2006),   Macau
(2007) and Istanbul (2008).
