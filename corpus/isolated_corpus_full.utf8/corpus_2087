Meeting Description

A Workshop on Reference to Abstract Objects in Natural Language will be
held at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, March 28-29, 2008. 

Final Call for Papers

Workshop on Reference to Abstract Objects in Natural Language 

Natural language is full of references to abstract objects - what we intuitively
call facts, propositions, questions, and situation types. Though there is a
substantial philosophical literature on the nature of such abstract objects, and
numerous linguistic studies on individual classes of expressions which may refer
to them (infinitives, nominalizations, neuter pronouns, or different types of
embedded clauses, for example), there is still surprisingly little work which
affords a global vision, either for a given language or cross-linguistically, of
the mapping between different types of expressions and a complete ontology of
these objects, or of how referents for abstract objects are constructed and
maintained across discourse. Still less work has been devoted to comparing and
evaluating existing theories of the mapping between natural language and an
ontology of abstract objects. The goal of this workshop is to work towards such
a global vision.

We invite abstracts for 40 minute papers (including 10 minutes for discussion)
which: 
- Focus on the semantics of the predicates that expresses properties of or
relations involving ''abstract objects'': perception verbs, propositional
attitude verbs, verbs of saying, resolutive predicates, factive-emotives,
nominalizations, etc.; 
- Seek generalizations concerning the semantics of the various types of phrases
and clauses that appear as subjects/complements to these predicates, and which
investigate their implications for a theory of natural language ontology;
- Address the question of the division of labor between semantics and pragmatics
in the modeling of notions such as ''fact'', ''proposition'', ''question'', etc. 
- Investigate anaphoric reference to abstract objects and the range of
expressions used for this reference;
- Explore techniques/strategies for collecting better data in this area;
- Report on psycholinguistic or acquisition research on human understanding of
such abstractions and the expressions we use to talk about them.

Invited speakers: 
Nicholas Asher (CNRS, Toulouse)
Jonathan Ginzburg (King's College, London)
Michael Hegarty (Louisiana State University)
Graham Katz (Georgetown)

Submission guidelines: Abstracts should be anonymous, at most 2 pages in length,
including references, using a 12 pt. font with 2,5 cm margins on all sides. They
should be sent in the form of a pdf file by e-mail to abstract.objects@upf.edu.
In the body of the e-mail please include the name, affiliations, and contact
information for all authors, as well as the title of the abstract.

Deadline for abstract submission: October 31, 2007.
Notification of acceptance: December 1, 2007
Workshop dates: March 28-29, 2008

Organizers: This workshop is part of a research collaboration between the
Institute of Cognitive Science, U. Osnabrueck); CNRS UMR 8163 (Savoirs, Textes,
Langages), U. Lille 3; and the Departament de Traducció i Filologia, U. Pompeu
Fabra. 
Scientific committee: Antonio Balvet, Peter Bosch, Lisa Brunetti, Stefan Evert,
Louise McNally, Philip Miller, Rafael Marín, Carla Umbach.

Workshop location: Departament de Traducció i Filologia, Universitat Pompeu
Fabra, Barcelona.

Meeting Description

Speech Prosody 2008 will be the fourth conference of a series of international
events of the Special Interest Groups on Speech Prosody (an ISCA group),
starting by the one held in Aix-en Provence, France, in 2002. The conferences in
Nara, Japan (2004), and in Dresden, Germany (2006) followed the proposal of
biennial meetings, and now is the time of changing place (and hemisphere!). It
is a great pleasure for our labs to host the Fourth International Conference on
Speech Prosody in Campinas, Brazil, the second major city of the State of São
Paulo.
