FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on NLP for Educational Resources

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
September 26, 2007
Borovetz, Bulgaria

Workshop site
http://ixa.si.ehu.es/NLP_ER2007

RANLP 2007 site
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

In this workshop we will discuss how using NLP techniques in the 
automatic treatment of texts
can support pedagogic goals. There are well over 100 documented projects 
at the use of NLP in
Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) (Heift & 
Schulze, 2007); however,
there are significantly fewer publications about the use of NLP 
techniques in educational areas
other than language learning.
This workshop will bring together NLP and ICALL researchers with 
colleagues who are
investigating NLP treatment for other educational purposes. Our main aim 
is to discuss how we
can use NLP in the automatic treatment of corpora for pedagogical 
purposes as well as in the
analysis of learner corpora (students free responses).
The contributions of this workshop will share at least two keywords: NLP 
and Education. We
especially seek contributions about the adaptation and integration of 
NLP techniques in the
following areas:

* Automatic exercise and task generation
* Controlled language
* Error diagnosis and remediation
* Essay assessment
* Fostering language awareness
* Automatic generation of didactic resources
* Analysis of learners interlanguage
* NLP for processing texts in ICALL environments
* Learner corpora
* Learning of textual analysis (in linguistics, literature, 
anthropology, )
* Student modelling
* Text production tools (e.g. grammar and spell checkers)
* Translator training
