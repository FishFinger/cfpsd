Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Phonology; Typology=20

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2009=20

Meeting Description:

The study of prosody is traditionally concerned with suprasegmental feature=
s such as stress, tone, intonation and quantity. More recently, its scope h=
as been expanded to include any phonological phenomenon sensitive to the do=
mains of the prosodic hierarchy (ranging from the syllable to the utterance=
). In the course of this development, a number of theoretical frameworks ha=
ve been developed which make strong claims about possible prosodic systems =
and their architecture. While the predictions are clear, the cross-linguist=
ic evidence is often less so, especially since too often generalizations ar=
e based on a narrow language sample from better-known European languages.=
=20

Call for Papers:

Phonologists, typologists, and experts on individual languages are invited =
to submit abstracts addressing, among others, the following key questions i=
n prosodic typology:

1) Which phenomena should be subsumed under the term 'prosodic'? E.g. is it=
 reasonable to treat stress domains on a par with segmental assimilation pr=
ocesses? (cf. Bickel et al. 2009)
2) Can existing descriptive frameworks capture the attested diversity in pr=
osodic systems? E.g. does ToBI provide an adequate means for cross-linguist=
ic comparison? (cf. Jun 2005)
3) Are phonological theories capable of handling typological variation? E.g=
. can derivational approaches which assign metrical grids before intonation=
al pitch-accents account for cases like Kuot? (cf. Lindstr=F6m & Remijsen 2=
005)

Abstracts should be anonymous and should not exceed 1 page in length (an ad=
ditional page for data and/or references can be added). Please send your ab=
stracts electronically in pdf- and doc- or rtf-format to rene@punksinscienc=
e.org. Include your name, affiliation and the title of the abstract in the =
body of the e-mail.

The workshop is organized by Gabriele M=FCller and Ren=E9 Schiering (Westf=
=E4lische Wilhelms-Universit=E4t M=FCnster). It takes place as part of the =
annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f=FCr Sprachwissenschaft (Germa=
n Linguistic Society, DGfS) in Berlin between February 24th and 26th, 2010:=
 http://www2.hu-berlin.de/dgfs/. Presentations at multiple workshops during=
 DGfS are generally not approved of.
