Linguistic Field(s): Language Documentation 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The theme of the Conference is the documentation, description and revitalization of endangered languages as well as the role of tradition and culture for the maintenance and promotion of such languages. The Kalasha language and tradition have been chosen as a case study regarding both its linguistic and cultural links to Ancient Greece. Moreover, practical suggestions concerning language documentation processes (e.g. fieldwork projects) and language revitalization methods (e.g. Dictionary/Grammar formats, textbooks, etc.) will be most welcome.

The Conference will have two sections, (a) the Linguistics and (b) the culture and tradition section of endangered languages, with the main focus on the Kalasha as a case study. Therefore the audience will be academics from both the linguistics and the Anthropology and Culture Departments.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
