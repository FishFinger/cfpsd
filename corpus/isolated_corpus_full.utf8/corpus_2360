The 5th International Workshop on "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND
COGNITIVE SCIENCE"
(NLPCS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/workshops/nlpcs/nlpcs2008-cfp.html

12-13 June, 2008 - Barcelona - Spain

In conjunction with the 10th International Conference on Enterprise 
Information Systems (ICEIS 2008), http://www.iceis.org/


Co-Chairs
Bernadette Sharp, Staffordshire University, United Kingdom, 
B.Sharp@staffs.ac.uk
Michael Zock, CNRS, LIF, Marseille, France, michael.zock@lif.univ-mrs.fr


BACKGROUND

Realising that no single discipline will ever suffice to reveal the
functioning of the human mind, cognitive science was born. The idea
was to analyse complex behaviour (speaking, thinking, problem-solving)
from different angles or levels and to build models that could account
for them.


GOALS

While ambitious and intriguing, the idea looked promising enough to
attract numerous researchers, and there were plenty of opportunities
then to present this kind of work. Alas, the situation has changed,
the discipline has lost speed during the last decade. And if the
reasons for this are multiple, ranging from lack of results to unkept
promises (« cognitive science » remaining wishful thinking rather than
a widely shared way of doing research), the fact is that funding has
become more and more scarce, and so have the opportunities to present
work done within this framework.

In the meantime statistical approaches have gained in popularity, and
evaluation has become an obligatory feature for presentation of work
in the arena of computational linguistics. While there is no doubt
that evaluation has certain qualities, it does not guarantee progress
or insights per se. A broader perspective is needed. To get the
necessary insights and to get the big picture, we probably need to get
back to the framework in which we worked in those days, which means,
we should adopt and integrate multiple viewpoints, that is, take a
cognitive science approach. This is the goal of this workshop.


JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEW NAME AND RELATION TO THE TOPICS

The workshop used to be called NLUCS (Natural Language Understanding
and Cognitive Science), yet, realising that this is too restrictive,
we decided to rename it NLPCS (Natural Language Processing and
Cognitive Science), as NLP is obviously more than just natural
language understanding. Information Retrieval, Information Extraction,
Machine Translation, Question Answering, Text Summarization, Text
Generation, etc. are all part of NLP or HLT (Human Language
Technology), and they all go clearly beyond language
understanding. This being so, it might be a valuable proposition to
integrate them into the debate. In other words, we would like to widen
the scope and provide a forum for all researchers of NLP working
within the CS paradigm.

Also, while certain components (dictionaries, grammars, or ontologies)
are very general, the way they are used varies considerably with the
task. Hence it is important to show how the task reflects in the use
of a given resource.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers
working within the paradigm of cognitive science

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:

- Computational Models of NLP
- Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
- Evolutionary NLP
- Situated (embodied) NLP
- Multimodality in speech / text processing
- Text Summarization and Information Extraction
- Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
- Computer Assisted Language Learning
- Multi-Lingual Processing
- Pragmatics and NLP
- Speech Processing
- Tools and Resources in NLP
- Ontologies
- Text Mining
- Electronic Dictionaries
- Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives:
full automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT),
semi-automated processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs
assisting people in their tasks), simulation of human cognitive
process.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation
in any of the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be
accepted, and the length of the paper should not exceed 10 pages (5000
words). Instructions for preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex
format) are available at the ICEIS web site.
http://www.iceis.org/paper_template.htm Postscript/RTF versions of the
manuscript should be submitted through ICEIS web-based paper
submission procedure: http://www.iceis.org/paper_submission.htm


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations of
previously submitted papers that went through a double peer review
process. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the form
of a book.
