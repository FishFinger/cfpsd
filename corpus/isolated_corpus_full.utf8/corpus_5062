Science Society, COGSCI 2009 
(http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference2009) 

Call for Papers

Aspects of the Self in Virtual Reality: Implications for Design

Information on the primary location of the conscious self is typically derived
from information about one's body and one's actions. However, VR technology
enables virtual presence elsewhere, creating multiple simultaneous locations of
the self. This full day workshop intends to open a discussion on how the most
recent theoretical approaches and empirical findings pertaining to the self may
help with practical design challenges related to improving our sense of self in VR. 

The main goal of the workshop is to explore how the self functions when it is
virtually displaced and how these different locations/ aspects of the self
function together to create the defining feature of VR - presence. The workshop
is open to researchers working on aspects of the self in any field as well as to
VR designers who are interested in communicating their experiences on the role
of the self in achieving presence in VR. 

We invite researchers on the self from disciplines such as philosophy of mind, 
cognitive neuroscience, psychiatry, social psychology, and related disciplines,
and VR designers to take part in the workshop. There are three possible
categories for participation at the workshop: 
(1) 20 minutes talk, 
(2) poster, 
(3) 5 minutes report or demo-presentation.

Abstract submissions should be prepared as a 500-word pdf file with a clearly 
stated topic of the work to be presented. The authors should indicate the
desired category of presentation (talk, poster, brief report, or demonstration).
The authors' names and affiliations should be included. Submissions should be
sent by email to selfinvirtualreality@gmail.com, with the subject line: Workshop
Abstract Submission. Selected papers will be published by an internationally
recognized publisher.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
