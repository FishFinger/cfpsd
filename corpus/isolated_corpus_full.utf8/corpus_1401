				 Pacling-2007


     Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics


			   University of Melbourne

				  Australia

			    September 19-21, 2007

	      <http://mandrake.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pacling2007/>



* NEWS

- submission deadline extended to Apr 30, 2007

- submissions now open



* SCHEDULE

Submission deadline:             Apr 30, 2007  *EXTENDED*
Notification of acceptance:      Jun 15, 2007
Camera-ready copy due:           Jul 22, 2007
Conference dates:                Sep 19--21, 2007



* AIMS

Pacling 2007 is a high-quality, workshop-style conference whose aim is
to promote friendly scientific interaction relating to computational
linguistics among Pacific Rim countries.  The emphasis of the
conference is on interdisciplinary scientific exchange demonstrating
openness towards high-quality research falling outside current
dominant schools of thought, and on technological transfer within the
Pacific region.  The conference represents a unique forum for
scientific and technological exchange, being smaller than ACL and
COLING, and more regional with extensive representation from the
Pacific region.


* THEME AND INVITED SPEAKERS

In addition to general computational linguistics, Pacling-2007 will
have a major theme:

        Deep processing: Abstracting away from the surface

We are delighted to announce that three invited speakers will address
this theme:

 * Ann Copestake （University of Cambridge, UK）
 * Robert Dale （Macquarie University, Australia）
 * Yuji Matsumoto （Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan）



* TOPICS

Submissions relevant to the theme of deep processing are encouraged.  However,
substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any topic in
computational linguistics, including, but not limited to, the following:

 * Phonology and Phonetics
 * Morphology and Morphological Analysis
 * Syntax and Syntactic Analysis
 * Semantics and Semantic Analysis
 * Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis
 * Spoken Language and Dialogue
 * Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing
 * Text and Message Understanding
 * Text and Message Generation
 * Machine Translation
 * Text Summarization
 * Information Extraction
 * Information Retrieval and Question-Answering
 * Language Learning
 * Natural Language Interfaces
 * Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontologies



* SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors should prepare anonymous submissions, in English, of up to 8 pages
including references.  Guidelines and style sheets （based on the ACL
styles） are available at the web site:

 http://mandrake.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pacling2007/

Papers that are being submitted to other conferences, whether verbatim or in
essence must declare this fact. If a paper appears at another conference, it
must be withdrawn from Pacling-2007. Papers that violate these requirements
are subject to rejection without review.

All papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format, through a web-based
submission system available at:

 http://www.softconf.com/start/pacling07/
