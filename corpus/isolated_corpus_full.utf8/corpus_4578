Hong Kong Journal of Applied Linguistics 

Call for papers 

The Hong Kong Journal of Applied Linguistics is an international, refereed
journal which will be of interest to all persons professionally concerned
with issues related to the learning and use of English as a second or
foreign language by Chinese first language background learners. It aims to
promote the development of principled links between theoretical
linguistics, educational research, language planning and the implementation
of practical teaching programmes within, or relevant to, a Chinese context. 

HKJAL invites submissions of previously unpublished articles that address
language issues in Hong Kong or the surrounding region and language related
issues in other Chinese contexts, including Chinese students studying
overseas. Book reviews and brief reports or summaries of work in progress
which address similar issues are also welcome. 

Notes for contributors 

Submission of a manuscript implies that it has not been published and is
not being considered for publication elsewhere, either in the submitted
form or in a modified version. 

General requirements 
1. Authors should include a cover page which includes the author's name,
full title of the paper, mailing address, contact telephone numbers and,
where possible, an email address and a fax number. The author's name should
_not_ appear elsewhere in the manuscript. 
2. Full-length manuscripts should not exceed a maximum of 20 typed,
double-spaced pages inclusive of all references and appendices. An abstract
of not more than 200 words and biographical data in not more than 50 words
should be included. 
3. Brief reports or summaries of work-in-progress should be between 4-6
pages (including references and notes). 
4. Book reviews should range between 400-600 words. 

For submission of manuscripts as an e-mail attachment, and questions about
general editorial policy, please visit the website
http://www2.vec.hku.hk/hkjal/ or contact the Editor at hkjal@hku.hk.

Call Deadline: 31-May-2009
