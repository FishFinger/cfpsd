The Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational
Linguistics (PACLING-2007 ) will be held in Melbourne, Australia

Abstracting away from the Surface', but substantial, original, 
unpublished research is welcome on any topic in computational linguistics. 

Third Call for Papers
Pacling-2007
Conference of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics
University of Melbourne
Australia
September 19-21, 2007
http://mandrake.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pacling2007/

News
- submission deadline extended to Apr 30, 2007
- submissions now open

Schedule
Submission deadline: Apr 30, 2007  extended
Notification of acceptance: Jun 15, 2007
Camera-ready copy due: Jul 22, 2007
Conference dates: Sep 19-21, 2007

Aims
Pacling 2007 is a high-quality, workshop-style conference whose aim is to
promote friendly scientific interaction relating to computational linguistics
among Pacific Rim countries. The emphasis of the conference is on
interdisciplinary scientific exchange demonstrating openness towards
high-quality research falling outside current dominant schools of thought, and
on technological transfer within the Pacific region. The conference represents a
unique forum for scientific and technological exchange, being smaller than ACL
and COLING, and more regional with extensive representation from the Pacific region.

Theme and Invited Speakers
In addition to general computational linguistics, Pacling-2007 will
have a major theme:

Deep processing: Abstracting away from the surface

We are delighted to announce that three invited speakers will address
this theme:

- Ann Copestake (University of Cambridge, UK)
- Robert Dale (Macquarie University, Australia)
- Yuji Matsumoto (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan)

Topics
Submissions relevant to the theme of deep processing are encouraged.  However,
substantial, original, and unpublished research is welcome on any topic in
computational linguistics, including, but not limited to, the following:

- Phonology and Phonetics
- Morphology and Morphological Analysis
- Syntax and Syntactic Analysis
- Semantics and Semantic Analysis
- Pragmatics and Discourse Analysis
- Spoken Language and Dialogue
- Corpora and Corpus-based Language Processing
- Text and Message Understanding
- Text and Message Generation
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval and Question-Answering
- Language Learning
- Natural Language Interfaces
- Electronic Dictionaries, Thesauri and Ontologies

Submission of Papers
Authors should prepare anonymous submissions, in English, of up to 8 pages
including references.  Guidelines and style sheets (based on the ACL styles) are
available at the web site:

http://mandrake.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pacling2007/

Papers that are being submitted to other conferences, whether verbatim or in
essence must declare this fact. If a paper appears at another conference, it
must be withdrawn from Pacling-2007. Papers that violate these requirements
are subject to rejection without review.

All papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format, through a web-based
submission system available at:

http://www.softconf.com/start/pacling07/

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
