Subject: Survey Participants Needed 
 


I am conducting a survey on women's surnames and on the use of courtesy
titles such as Miss, Mrs., and Ms.  This survey follows from my two
previous surveys, conducted 10 and 20 years ago, and the results will form
part of a retrospective of patterns of women's naming over the past 40 years.

Who can participate?  Males and females from 16 to 116 years of age.  The
more people who answer the better.  I welcome responses from fellow
academics, but I also particularly urge you to circulate this call to your
friends, neighbours, colleagues, and relatives, and to post it on any blogs
or website you may think appropriate.

Please complete the survey at the link below.

Since many people do not have internet access and/or prefer to answer
surveys on paper, I would ask for volunteers to circulate paper copies to
as many individuals as possible.  If you are willing to circulate one or
more paper copies of the survey, or if you wish any further information
about this study, please contact me at the email address below.
