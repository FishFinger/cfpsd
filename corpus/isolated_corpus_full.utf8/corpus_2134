Meeting Description:
The Japanese Society for Language Sciences (JSLS) invites proposals for our
Tenth Annual International Conference, JSLS 2008. JSLS2008 will be held at
the University of Shizuoka, in Shizuoka, Japan. We welcome proposals for
oral presentations and poster presentations. Our plenary speaker will be
Dr. Bernard Comrie (Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) 

The Japanese Society for Language Sciences aims ''to promote the language
sciences and contribute to a better understanding of the human mind through
theoretical and experimental research on language'' (Article 2, JSLS
Regulations). The scope of this endeavor covers a wide area, including
linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics), first
language acquisition, second language acquisition, psycholinguistics,
language production, mother tongue education, foreign language instruction,
natural language processing, brain science, bilingualism, sociolinguistics,
discourse research, and linguistic philosophy, among others. This society
hopes that researchers working on these widely diverse topics reach beyond
their own areas of specialization by supporting the active exchange of
opinions and ideas between researchers working in related fields.

Qualifications for Presenters:
