Meeting Description:

ABC, the Association for Business Communication, is an international
organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication
scholarship, research, education, and practice. ABC Europe was established in
November 1996 and has been organizing conventions on a regular basis. The 10th
edition is organized by Lessius University College.

GABC is a Tricontinental Rotating Conference series focusing on Global Advances
in Business Communication and Practices. GABC is affiliated with ABC and is
co-organized by the University of Antwerp, Eastern Michigan University and Macau
University of Science and Technology

Conference theme: Researching business communication - perspectives from
scholarship, education and practice 

Call for Papers

In recent years business communication has come of age as a field of scientific
inquiry in its own right. Written, oral and on-line interaction within and among
profit as well as non-profit organizations is now being studied from a wide
range of perspectives and using a great many different methods. 

This convention is aimed at presenting a state-of-the-art survey of what the
field has accomplished so far and where it is heading. In particular, papers,
posters and panels are welcomed that present new research on business
communication or that address the question of how such scholarship is relevant
to education and practice, i.e. how business communication teachers and
professionals draw on research findings in going about their daily activities in
the field. 

Contributions are welcomed on a wide spectrum of business settings, including
leadership and management situations, on gatekeeping encounters in a variety of
institutions and organizations and through a range of media and cultures, on
oral interaction in the workplace, on marketing and PR discourse, on on-line
communication, on management, organizational and corporate communication, on
global aspects of integrated marketing communications, etc. 

Methodologically, the convention is open to wide-ranging efforts, including work
in discourse analysis and ethnomethodology, rhetoric and document design,
intercultural pragmatics and writing studies, genre analysis, e-semantics and
sociolinguistics. Studies from the perspective of marketing or management
research are also welcomed.

Papers
Submissions are invited for 30-minute slots (including 10 minutes of discussion
and question time). Please submit an abstract of 300 words at
www.businesscommunication.org Add up to 5 keywords and indicate whether the
proposal should be included in the research, teaching or practice sections of
the convention. In case of a research paper, detail research question, method,
data and conclusions.

Deadline: 1 December 2009. Contributors will be informed of the decision by 15
January 2010.

Posters
Please submit an abstract of 300 words at www.businesscommunication.org.
Deadline: 15 December 2009. Contributors will be informed of the decision by 15
January 2010.

Panels
Submissions are invited for thematic panels spanning one or more 90-minute
slots. Please submit an outline of 500 words at www.businesscommunication.org.
Indicate whether the proposal should be included in the research, teaching or
practice sections of the convention. List any contributors that are anticipated
to be involved in the panel.  Deadline: 15 October 2009. Panel convenors will be
informed of the decision by 1 November.

Please note that not all panels need to take the same form: some may emphasize
discussion while others may want to fit in more oral presentations. Panels
should include a min. of 4 contributions per 90-minute slot. Please note that,
after a panel has been accepted, all abstracts for panel contributions are to be
submitted before the 15 December deadline following the procedure spelled out above.

The convention language is English, but abstracts in other languages (such as
French, German or Spanish) will be considered as well.

Meeting Description:

Linguistic & Psycholinguistic Approaches to Text Structuring 

Call for Papers

The aim of the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary forum to present
and discuss recent work on markers of discourse structure: adverbials,
connectives, discourse particles, etc. How can we categorize these markers? What
kind of relations do they express? Can they combine several functions at the
sentence level and/ or at the discourse level and, if so, which ones? What
impact do discourse structure markers have on comprehension? When and how are
they acquired? From what age are children able to master their use in oral and
written discourse?

The goal of the conference is more specifically to advance research into the
relationship between the position of the markers concerned and their ability to
play a role in discourse organization. Do these markers have a privileged
position? We know that sentence initial position is a strategic position in
terms of information structuring/packaging and memory. But can these factors
override the word order constraints of each language? Are there also observable
variations between discourse genres and between written and oral modes? 

We invite papers using cognitive and functional approaches, based on corpora in
different languages at different stages of their evolution, as well as papers
that report on psycholinguistic approaches based on behavioural data.

Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Segmentation and linearization
- Initial positioning
- Saliency and Information Structure
- Grammaticalization and evolution of structure markers 
- Typological approach to structure markers 
- Spatial and temporal discourse structure
- Effects of discourse organization markers on comprehension
- Acquisition and mastery of their use in discourse production 
- Role of text structuring devices in acquiring knowledge
