!!! New Deadline for Submission: Sunday 1st July 2007 !!!

"Towards Genre-Enabled Search Engines: The Impact of NLP"
Workshop held in conjunction with RANLP 2007

Workshop Location: Borovets, Bulgaria
Workshop Date: 30 September 2007 
Workshop website: http://www.sics.se/use/genre-ws/ 
RANLP 2007 website: http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/  

Organizers: Marina Santini and Georg Rehm
  

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 
Broadly speaking, genres are textual categories that streamline communica=
tion by relying on acknowledged conventions and raising predictable expec=
tations. For instance, the conventions underlying the BLOG genre are repr=
esented by a sequence of daily entries that contain narratives, opinions,=
 as well as the feelings of the blogger, an individual who wishes to part=
icipate in a discussion on a certain subject. These entries are public an=
d other bloggers can directly comment on them by sending their own postin=
gs. These conventions are different from those underlying the EDITORIAL g=
enre, where a single person presents an argumentative statement of views =
that are considered to be representative of a newspaper as a whole. In br=
ief, genres convey the context of communication. This context is essentia=
l when determining the relevance of the information contained in a text.

The concept of genre has great potential for Information Retrieval (IR). =
One application is its integration in a search-engine architecture, enabl=
ing the user to combine topic-based search with genre-based search. 

The distinction between topical and non-topical textual dimensions is cru=
cial when it comes to features. Traditionally, topics and domains rely on=
 features based on content words (e.g. in the bag-of-words approach), whi=
le genre classes appear to be more easily identified through the use of g=
rammatical features (like function words, POS tags, and syntactic feature=
s). As Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides methods to retrieve gra=
mmatical features, an investigation of the influence of NLP on automatic =
genre identification appears of primary importance. For this reason, we w=
ish to investigate to what extent NLP can help identify genre in an IR sc=
enario. 

The main aims of the workshop are as follows: 

* To identify the key features that help classify documents by genre, and=
 their efficiency and effectiveness within an IR framework. 
* To explore how genres can improve search engines, and in particular how=
 it can be integrated with topic-based retrieval. 
* To bring together researchers working on genre in different communities=
 =96 such as Computational Linguistics, NLP, Information Retrieval and Ex=
traction, Text and Web Mining, or Summarization =96 in order to investiga=
te the extent to which NLP can assist or enable automatic genre identific=
ation. 


TOPICS 
The topics of interests include but are not limited to: 

- Computational modelling of genres for web applications; 
- Implementation of genre-based applications for retrieval; 
- The impact of lexis, morphology and syntax on automatic genre identific=
ation; 
- Genre-revealing features and their automatic extraction; 
- Genre-driven NLP tools, such as genre-driven taggers, parsers, or disco=
urse annotation; 
- Genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and no-genre do=
cuments; 
- Test collections and evaluation metrics for genre-enabled applications;=
 
- Clustering and visualization of results based on genre. 


CATEGORIES OF PAPERS 
Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: REGULAR PAPER and POSTE=
R. Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time. REG=
ULAR PAPERS are full-length papers and must NOT exceed 8 pages. POSTERS a=
re submitted as extended abstracts (MAX 4 pages). If accepted, a poster i=
s presented in the workshop poster session. Both regular papers and poste=
r papers are included in the workshop proceedings. 


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
Format. Authors are invited to submit papers and posters on *original and=
 unpublished* work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers and posters=
 should be submitted as PDF files, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 =
stylefiles, without author name(s) and affiliation(s). Papers and posters=
 should not exceed the length indicated above. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles =
are available at: http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm 

Please, send papers and posters to both MarinaSantini.MS@gmail.com and ge=
org.rehm@uni-tuebingen.de 

Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by three members of =
the Program Committee. Reviewing will be blind. Reviewers will be asked t=
o provide detailed comments, and to score submissions on the following fa=
ctors: 

- Relevance to the workshop 
- Significance and originality 
- Technical/methodological accuracy 
- References to related work 
- Presentation (clarity, organisation, English) 

Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers (regular papers and posters) will=
 be published in the workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the w=
orkshop the authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publica=
tion, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop =
participants are expected to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration fee=
s. 

Dual submissions to the main RANLP 2007 conference and this workshop are =
allowed; if you submit to the main session, please DO indicate this when =
you submit to the workshop. If your paper or poster is accepted for the m=
ain session, you should withdraw it from the workshop upon notification b=
y the main session.

ference website (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/).
