International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media:
The International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media (German acronym IGEL) is aimed at the advancement of empirical literary research through international and interdisciplinary cooperation (http://igelweb.org). IGEL was founded in 1987. Biennial meetings of the society have been hosted in Siegen (Germany), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Memphis, Budapest (Hungary), Nakoda (Canada), Utrecht (Netherlands), Toronto (Canada), PÃ©cs (Hungary), Edmonton (Canada) and Munich (Germany).

11th IGEL Conference
The 11th International Conference of the Society will be held in the FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis July 8-11, 2008. Keynote speakers include Douglas Biber and Roz Picard. 
Doug Biber (http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~biber) is internationally known for his computational techniques to analyze the linguistic characteristics of spoken and written genres and registers. 
Roz Picard (http://web.media.mit.edu/~picard) is the international authority on affective computing. 

The IGEL Conference will follow the IGEL Summer Institute, July 5-7. The Program of the Summer Institute is concerned with the cooperation of Humanities and Social Science students in order to develop adequate methods for the empirical investigation of literature and the media.

The IGEL Conference will precede the Society for Text and Discourse workshop (July 11-12) and the 18th Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse (July 12-15), also held in the FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis (http://www.societyfortextanddiscourse.org). 

Second Call for Papers

Presentations of the 11th International Conference can be in the form of posters or spoken papers. The deadline for submitting proposals for both presentation formats is February 15, 2008. A Review Committee will review the proposals, and authors will be notified regarding acceptance by the end of March 2008.
 
Please submit proposals in English using our electronic submission system (http://aeon.psyc.memphis.edu/igel08) or see http://igelweb.org/igelweb/IGEL2008 for further details.
 
Papers will be scheduled for 20 minutes, with an additional 5 minutes for questions and discussion. Posters are scheduled for a poster session on the second night of the conference.
 
Proposals for symposia (sessions with multiple papers on one particular topic) should be discussed with the conference organizers prior to submission and follow the same procedure as proposals for papers (conference@igelweb.org). Their review process is the same as that or full papers.
 
Topics for papers, posters and symposia examples of topics for papers, posters, symposia and workshops include: 
- Literary reading processes (emotion, cognition, personality, etc.) 
- Computational linguistic and corpus linguistic methods of research on literature and the media (text analysis, corpus studies, hypertext models, etc.) - The social role of literature and related media (e.g. film, theatre, Internet, multimedia, virtual reality) 
- Pedagogical and educational aspect of literature and the media 
- The processes of literary/media production, distribution and reception 
- The role of literary and other cultural institutions: past, present and future 
- The empirical study of historical reception and historical readers 
 
Submission Format:
Proposals should be submitted online in English using our electronic submission system (http://aeon.psyc.memphis.edu/igel08). Instructions how to use the system are provided at http://igelweb.org/igelweb/IGEL2008/instructions.htm. 
 
Submissions should include a 75-word abstract and a summary of the presentation (max. 1000 words, including bibliographic references). A typical format of the paper is: Introduction leading up to a research question, method (e.g. , materials, participants, procedure), results (including statistical results), discussion and conclusion. This is of course a sample format and the sections do not have to be labeled as such.
