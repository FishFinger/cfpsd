SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS
  Workshop on Symmetric calculi and Ludics for the semantic
interpretation (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~quatrini/ESSLLI2008.html)
August 4-8, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008 (http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 4-15
August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany



Workshop Organizers:

Alain Lecomte (SFL - Paris 8),  Alain.Lecomte@upmf-grenoble.fr
Myriam Quatrini (IML Marseille), quatrini@iml.univ-mrs.fr

Workshop Purpose and topics:

  In recent years there have been some important new developments of
methods of dealing with semantic and pragmatic phenomena in
Linguistics, inspired by developments in Logic and Theoretical
Computer Science. Among these developments, Continuation Theory,
Symmetric calculi and Ludics play an important role. Continuation
theory dates back from the early seventies (cf. Reynolds, 93) and was
at the heart of Programming Languages like Scheme. More recently, a
logical account was given to it, by extending the Curry-Howard
homomorphism (Griffin, 1990),. This led to several calculi like such
as Parigot's lambda-mu-calculus, Curien-Herbelin's
lambda-mu-mu-tilde-calculus, Wadler's dual calculus and so on. These
calculi are based on the core idea that programs and contexts are dual
entities and this is reflected in the symmetry of the "classical"
sequents. These systems were prefigured by the so called
Lambek-Grishin calculus (Grishin, 83), a calculus extending the Lambek
calculus by taking classical sequents into account. Following
Curien-Herbelin (Bernardi and Moortgat, 2007) focuses on the
connection between Lambek-Grishin calculus with
lambda-mu-tilde-calculus and hence with continuation semantics.

  Classical linear logic (Girard, 87, 95) gives another viewpoint,
where the co-product is realized by an authentic parallelisation
connective.  Linguistic applications have been given since around
2000, particularly by C. Barker (Barker, 2002), K. Chung-chieh Shan
(Chung-chieh Shan, 2002) and P. de Groote (de Groote, 2001) who
exploited the advantages of these systems in the task of giving
several readings of an ambiguous sentence. De Groote (de Groote, 2007)
also shows that we gain a new dynamical logic which enables us to
elegantly treat phenomena of discourse like anaphora
resolution. M. Moortgat and R. Bernardi (Moortgat & Bernardi, 2007)
shows how moving to a symmetric categorial grammar, namely Lambek
Grishin calculus, helps accounting for discontinous phenomena that are
not captured by the asymmetric Lambek calculus. Independently, linear
logic was intensively studied in particular by Girard himself who
invented "Ludics" as a new conception of logic, where the dualism
between syntax and semantics is abolished : the meaning of rules is in
the rules themselves. This conception has some similarities with more
traditional "Game Semantics" (Lorenz, Lorenzen, Hintikka...) but it is
dynamic, in the sense that "strategies" are replaced by interacting
processes. Moreover, a new step in abstraction is provided, which
consists in stating rule schemata which are only expressed in terms of
loci (that we may see as memory cells).

  The two approaches in this workshop are connected, basically because
of their common root : explorations in the meaning of Logics and in
particular reflections on one of the symmetrical systems, namely
linear logic. Linguistic applications of Ludics remain very embryonic,
but some authors have already emphasized that it is suitable for
giving a framework in which it is possible to study speech acts and
dialogue (Livet, 2007, Troncon, 2006). Other authors have pointed out
similarities of the Ludics' philosophy with Wittgenstein's views on
language games (Pietarinen, 2006). This workshop will provide an
opportunity to study these questions. It will accept several kinds of
contributions : theoretical works on continuation theory, symmetric
calculi and ludics, applied works of these theory concerning
linguistic topics (semantics, pragmatics) and philosophical
investigations.


Submission Details:
  Authors are invited to submit an anonymous, extended abstract.
Submissions should not exceed 7 pages, including references.
Submissions should be in PDF format. Please send your submission
electronically using the interface EasyChair. The submissions will be
reviewed by the workshop's programme committee.

  The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI
participants.  It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over
five consecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2
