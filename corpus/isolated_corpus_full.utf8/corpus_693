Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; Ling & Literature 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 30-Dec-2006 

Meeting Description:

In February 2007, the Philippines plays host, through the Ateneo de Manila University, to Reading Asia, Forging Identities in Literature:  Policy, Research, and Practice.  This international conference locates the ground where literature and the region's concern for plural yet pronounced Asian identities interact as concurrent discourses.  It looks at the reading experience across AsiaÂ—what Asia reads, the languages and forms in which its literatures flower, the collective interests that the region projects on the literary screen, and intriguing analogues of culture, politics, and the postcolonial struggle that Asia gleans from literature.  

Through cultural encounters in literature, the conference pursues how Asia manages new expressions of ethnic diversity while closely guarding its mainstreams of tradition, belief, and practices.  Panel presentations focus on examining the role of language and translation, forms of spoken and written English in the classroom, emerging genres and new voices in the region.  Special attention to Asian approaches to the principled practice of literature makes Reading Asia the apt venue for policy makers, researchers, educators, and artists in exchanging notes on how literary studies leads to the responsible management of Asia's many cultures. 

Topics:
-	Examining the politics of representation;
-	Exploring principled practices in literature teaching;
-       Integrating Asian cinema and theater traditions in the literature classroom;
-	Designing and developing the literature curriculum;
-	Managing culture and setting agenda for Southeast Asian Studies;
-	Interrogating Asian Englishes in the literature classroom;
-	Applying information technology in literary education;
-	Engaging emerging forms of literature (i.e. creative writing) in Asia;
-	Investigating the role of literary translation in conveying meanings.

Featured Speakers include: 
-	Suchen Christine Lim, Singapore
-	Nobuko Takagi, Japan
-	Romesh Gunesekeera,  Sri Lanka
-	Soledad Reyes, Philippines
-	Bienvenido Lumbera, Philippines
