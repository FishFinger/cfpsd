Meeting Description:

Risk Management and Computational Linguistics Workshop 
at the 5th International Conference on 
Intelligent Information Processing (IIP2008) 
October 20, 2008

Call for Papers

With the growth of electronic documents and the development of technologies to
ease their access in different languages, risk management is becoming a major
application for information processing and as a consequence for computational
linguistics.

Managing risk has to do with:
- Recognition of risk which for computational linguistics translates as
extracting sentences or piece of documents expressing a risk. As expression of
risk can be carried by different types of medias such as images, videos or data,
it means also being able to unify all pieces of knowledge in different format
that express a risk
- Risk assessment and developing strategies to manage risk which means to be
able to qualify the extracted risk, as for instance to be able to say if this
risk is factual or not. It also means to develop methods being able to affect a
weight to the different pieces of information extracted and this, across media.
In other words it means, among other to define methodologies that will help to
assess the gravity of a given risk so that ''the risks with the greatest loss
and the greatest probability of occurring are handled first, and risks with
lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order''.

Because risk may refer to numerous types of threats caused by environment,
technology, humans, organizations and politics, applications are numerous among
different vertical markets such as finance, health or homeland security.  

This workshop invites papers addressing the issue of how natural language
processing can help to support risk management in general this includes:

- discourse analysis 
- language understanding
- identification and representations of events
- identification and representation of threats
- identification and sources' validation
- taxonomies
- parsing
- knowledge representation 
- reasoning
- relations between different concepts such as event and time
- modality (e.g. factuality)
- fusion text data
- risk management systems and tools with emulated language competence
 
Instructions for submissions are: 
Papers should be no longer than 8 pages including all tables, figures, and
references.
Papers should respect the format of the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence
series (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0)

All papers should be sent electronically in PDF to the two organizers at the
following addresses: segond@xrce.xerox.com, vetulani@amu.edu.pl. All paper
submissions will be acknowledged and peer reviewed. 
At least one of the authors of an accepted paper must register at the conference
and present the paper at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings and delivered at the workshop. 
Deadlines for conference paper and panel submissions are:
