Call Deadline: 01-Aug-2008 

Meeting Description:

Aiming at bringing together researchers who engage in the trans-disciplinary
study of cognitive phenomena, this conference intends to investigate the
bi-directionality, that is, the mutual heuristic applicability of diverse (and
possibly complementary) research topics and methodologies in the cognitive
sciences. 

Call for Papers

While the application of methods used in cognitive linguistics and psychology to
literary texts, for instance, has enriched our interpretations of literature -
e.g., Peter Stockwell's Cognitive Poetics (London and New York: Routledge, 2002)
- how could cognitive phenomena reflected in literature help to uncover similar
manifestations and refine their study in more traditional cognitive sciences
such as linguistics and psychology? To what extent can techniques used in
cognitive approaches to linguistic and literary analysis be beneficial to
studies in language acquisition and teaching - and how does the latter affect
the former? How do different mapping processes - for example, metaphors of
embodiment in non-Western cultures - contribute to our understanding of
seemingly universal metaphorical mappings? And how can applied cognitive
linguistics benefit from potential parallels in cross-cultural mappings?

We would like to encourage the submission of papers from scholars working in the
fields of linguistics, language acquisition and teaching, literary and cultural
studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and others, that explore how
cognitive approaches within these disciplines can enrich and illuminate one another.

Selected papers will be published in a peer-reviewed volume.

Organizers: Astrid Loh√∂fer, Marcus Callies, and Wolfram R. Keller

Please send abstracts (as pdf-attachments) of no more than 300 words (excluding
references) by 1 August 2008 to Wolfram Keller (kellerw AT staff.uni-marburg.de)

Meeting Description:

The Ghent University CONTRAGRAM research team is proud to announce an
International Conference on Verb Typologies to be held at Ghent, 5-7 February
2009. The meeting is organized in collaboration with the French, English and
Dutch department of Ghent University and is to be positioned against the larger
background of the research project Meaning in between structure and the lexicon.
Papers presented will be from both a theoretical as well as a practical point of
view with the goal of achieving cross-fertilization and new insights on verb
typologies. 

Second Call for Papers

Verb Typologies revisited : A Cross-linguistic Reflection on Verbs and Verb Classes

Description of the conference's topic:

Existing verb typologies have gone a long way in systematically categorising
verbs into verb classes, be it on syntactic grounds, semantic grounds, or a
combination of both, by capturing the relationship between lexical properties,
semantic roles and syntactic behaviour in more or less refined verb
classifications (cf. Dixon, 1991, Levin 1993; Dubois and Dubois-Charlier 1997,
Verbnet, etc.,). There, are, however, still many aspects which require further
attention. 

A first problem is situated at a theoretical level with respect to terminology
and definitions. Not only do the 'same' verb classes often receive different
labels, the same labels are often conceptualised in a different way (based on
different parameters) both within and across languages. A more systematic and
uniform treatment and conceptualisation of these labels and classes is called for.  

Secondly, existing typologies vary consistently in terms of granularity going
from very general (Vendler) to very specific (Levin and subsequent extensions).
The choice of semantic categories and the level of granularity depend of course
on the theoretical assumptions of the researchers, but there is need of
redressing the balance and finding a compromise between what is actually
possible on the one hand and what is actually desirable in terms of linguistic
description on the other hand. Once such a compromise is found, one can look
into the specificity and similarities of different verb typologies from a
cross-linguistic perspective. 

Thirdly, data analysis shows that classifications which are mainly
intuition-based are not free from mistakes or do not capture all patterns or all
verbs. Research within computational linguistics (Korhonen et al. 2003, Lapata
and Brew 2004, Kipper-Schuler 2005, Merlo 2005, Schulte im Walde 2006,
forthcoming etc.) has shown that existing classifications can easily and
(semi)-automatically be upgraded with more verbs, more verb classes and more
refined subcategorisations (based on other complementation patterns). However,
there are methodological issues at stake and automatic induction itself is not
without limits or shortcomings. 

Fourthly, there is the important question of the status of verb classes and verb
classifications in speakers' mental grammars and/or lexicons, and the interplay
between lexical and constructional semantics, or, put differently, the division
of labour between verbs and constructions (issues brought to the fore with the
rise of Construction Grammar and related frameworks). To what extent do theories
of argument realization and the syntax/semantics-interface need to refer to
(detailed) verb classifications?     

We therefore invite papers from both a theoretical as well as a practical point
of view with the goal of achieving cross-fertilization and new insights on verb
typologies from a cross-linguistic and contrastive perspective. We particularly
welcome papers on the following topics:
- contrastive analyses of verbs, verb classes and typologies
- corpus-based studies on verbs and verb classes 
- reflections on classification systems and criteria (and related terminology) 
- the relation between verb classes and polysemy which raises issues such as the
possibility of multiple class membership and/or fuzzy class boundaries    
- the interplay between meaning, grammar and the verbal lexicon 
- the status of verb classes in grammatical theory and in speakers' mental
grammars.

Call for Papers

Abstracts are invited for 30-minute talks (20'+10') in English on any topic
related to the semantics, morphosyntax, or typology of verbs, especially from a
cross-linguistic perspective. We invite papers addressing general typological
questions as well as papers taking the viewpoint of one (or more) particular
language(s), preferably Germanic or Romance languages. 
Abstracts should have between 500 and 800 words (exclusive of references) and
should state research questions, approach, method, data and results. Abstracts
will be reviewed anonymously.

The deadline for the submission of abstracts is 1 June 2008. Notification of
acceptance will be given by 31 August 2008.

The body of your email message should include your name, affiliation and contact
information. 

More information will periodically appear on the Conference website:
