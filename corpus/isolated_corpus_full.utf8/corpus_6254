Final Call for Papers: HCSNet Workshop on Aphasia Rehabilitation and Neuroplasticity: Translating Principles into Practice

SPECIAL NOTE: WHILE THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS WILL FOCUS ON NEUROPLASTICITY, SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS ON ANY TOPIC RELEVANT TO APHASIA IS ENCOURAGED, AS ARE REPORTS ON PHDS IN PROGRESS.

The primary focus of this interdisciplinary workshop will be on aphasia rehabilitation. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of how the brain responds and recovers from injury and how re-training of skills may be optimised depending on a range of neurobiological and environmental factors. While much of this work has been carried out in animal models or with a focus on motor function, it has been proposed that significant benefits will result if the field of aphasia rehabilitation can harness and translate this new foundational knowledge in neuroplasticity. The governing principles of neuroplasticity may also provide a unifying framework for combining impairment based and social based approaches to aphasia rehabilitation.
 
Professor Leslie Gonzalez Rothi (University of Florida) is a leader in translating principles of neuroplasticity to aphasia and will give a keynote presentation around this theme. In addition to focusing on neuroplasticity, the workshop will focus on other future interdisciplinary directions in this field including interactions between speech pathology and social psychology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, neuroscience, and psychology.
 
The workshop will be held in Sydney at the MGSM city campus at Circular Quay on the 16th November.  HCSNet will fund a number of travel grants of up to $500 to help cover the costs of travel and accommodation for Australian-based HCSNet members from outside the Sydney area who present a paper at the workshop.
