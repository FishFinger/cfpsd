*********************************************************


Workshop Description

The Fourth ACL-SIGSEM Workshop on Prepositions will be=20
hosted in conjunction with ACL 2007, the 45th Annual=20
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,
and will take place on June 28th in Prague, Czech Republic.=20


Background

Prepositions, postpositions and other adpositions have=20
received a considerable amount of interest in recent=20
years, due to their importance in computational tasks.=20
For instance, in NLP, PP attachment ambiguities have=20
attracted a lot of attention, and different machine=20
learning techniques have been employed with varying=20
success. Researchers from linguistics, artificial=20
intelligence and psycholinguistics have examined spatial=20
and temporal aspects of prepositions,their cross-
linguistic differences, monolingual and cross-linguistic
contrasts, the role of prepositions in syntactic=20
alternations and their semantics in situated dialog. In=20
languages like English and German, phrasal verbs have=20
also been the subject of considerable research, ranging=20
from the development of techniques for their automatic=20
extraction from corpora to methods for determining their=20
semantics. In other languages, like Romance languages or=20
Hindi, the focus has been either on the incorporation of=20
the preposition or its inclusion in the prepositional=20
phrase. All these configurations are important both=20
semantically and syntactically in natural language=20
understanding and processing.=20

Building on the success of three previous workshops on=20
prepositions (held in Toulouse, 2003, Colchester, 2005=20
and Sydney, 2006), the aim of the fourth ACL-SIGSEM=20
Workshop on Prepositions is to bring together researchers
from a variety of backgrounds to discuss the syntax,=20
semantics, description, representation and=20
cross-linguistic aspects of prepositions. We intend this=20
workshop to promote collaboration among researchers=20
interested in different aspects of prepositions, and hope
that it will advance understanding of these important=20
components of language.


Topics

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following=20
topics:=20

+ Multilingual & crosslinguistic aspects of prepositions:
 - multilingual and contrastive descriptions (mismatches,
   incorporation, divergences)=20
 - prepositions in human and machine translation (for=20
   example, issues of automatic word alignment)=20
 - prepositions in parallel corpus annotation (for=20
   example, sense disambiguation using parallel texts)
 - prepositions in cross-language information retrieval=20

+ Description and representation of prepositions:=20
 - prepositions in lexical resources (including WordNet,=20
   Framenet, and other ontologies)=20
 - prepositions in syntactically annotated corpora =20
   (Treebanks), productive versus collocation uses,=20
   prepositions and thematic roles=20
 - Word-sense disambiguation of prepositions (as in the=20
   SemEval preposition task to run at ACL-2007)=20

+ Applications:=20
 - using prepositions in applications such as machine
   translation, grammar and style checking systems=20
 - information extraction or language generation,=20
   situated dialog systems (robot interfaces, embodied
   conversational agents)
=20
+ Cognitive dimensions of prepositions:=20
 - how different kinds of prepositions are=20
   acquired/interpreted/represented in human cognition=20
 - how different kinds of preposition provide distinct=20
   challenges to a reasoning system and how they can be=20
   handled

=20
Submissions

Authors are invited to submit either full papers or=20
short papers on original, unpublished work in the topic=20
area of this workshop. Full papers should be up to 8=20
pages in length; they should emphasize completed work=20
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly=20
the state of completion of the reported results. Where
appropriate, concrete evaluation results should be=20
included. Short papers should be up to 6 pages in length;
they can describe work in progress rather than completed
work, or smaller-scale implementation/experimentation.=20
Presentations for short papers will be proportionally
shorter than presentations for full papers. Submissions=20
will be judged on correctness, originality, technical=20
strength, significance and relevance to the workshop, and
interest to the attendees.=20

Submissions should be formatted using the ACL 2007=20
stylefiles without overt author and affiliation=20
information and not exceeding 8 pages. The ACL stylefiles
are available at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/=20

The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe=20
PDF. Submission will be electronic, using the START paper
submission website. The submission deadline is March=20
26th, 2007. The START submission page for this workshop=20
is http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS11/submit.html =20


Important Dates

Paper Submission deadline: March 26th, 2007=20
Notification of acceptance: April 20th, 2007=20
Camera-ready papers due: May 9th, 2007=20
