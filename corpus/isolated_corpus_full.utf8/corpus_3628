Meeting Description:

Call for papers for a Theme Session at ICLC 11, Berkeley, CA (July 28-August 3,
2009)
Title: Cognitive and construction-based approaches to syntactic evolution
Organizers: Jóhanna Barðdal & Gard B. Jenset (University of Bergen) 

Call for Papers

Deadline for submitting abstracts has been extended to October 28th!

Aim: 
The theme session focuses on cognitive or construction-based approaches to
changes in syntactic structures, in spoken, written and/or signed languages. It
aims at bringing together researchers working on syntax in different modalities
and with different methodological approaches, ranging from corpus-based methods,
statistical modeling, sociolinguistic, or psycholinguistic methods.
This may include a discussion on larger systemic changes (cf. Haig 2008),
individual case studies, or a discussion on how cognitive and constructional
approaches contribute to the study of syntactic evolution.

Discussion: 
The study of diachronic data and evolutionary perspectives of syntax in
different modalities presents unique challenges to the research community (cf.
e.g. Comrie and Kuteva 2005 and Croft 2000). Studying diachronic syntax often
requires the use of corpora, thus forcing researchers to face the questions
discussed in Gries (2006) and Grondelaers et al. (2007) on how to incorporate
empirical corpus-based methods in the various cognitive-functional approaches to
linguistics. A number of problems present themselves when turning a
cognitive-oriented research program towards diachronic questions, as discussed
in e.g. Stefanowitsch (2006). However, there are also a number of statistical
methods available to overcome some of these difficulties (cf. McMahon and
McMahon 2006) and Pagel et al. 2007).
With its special emphasis on empirical methods, diachronic cognitive linguistics
and diachronic construction grammar are particularly well suited for
participation in the further development of empirical methodology in cognitive
linguistics, as discussed in Geeraerts (2006). As such, the workshop will
contribute to a commencing discussion on how to develop and refine empirical
methods for the study of syntactic evolution.

Submission Procedure:
- Abstract to be sent as .pdf or .rtf file
- Maximum 500 words
- Please include your name(s), title of paper, affiliation and contact
information in the body of the email
- E-mail to Johanna.Barddal@uib.no and Gard.Jenset@uib.no, with the heading
"ICLC theme session"
- No later than October 28th, 2008.

Please note that all submitted abstracts as well as the proposed theme session
itself will undergo an independent review by the ICLC program committee.
Participants are therefore required to also submit their abstracts through the
ordinary submission channels of the conference which has a deadline in the
beginning of November.
