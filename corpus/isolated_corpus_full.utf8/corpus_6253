Meeting Description:

Panel: Multilingual communication in binational families: negotiating languages, 
identities and everyday tasks. 

Call for Papers

The growing geographical mobility of the past decades has increased migration 
and facilitated the formation of binational couples and multilingual families. 
Migrating to another country means leaving behind one's accustomed way of 
living, family members and friends, and entering a new social, cultural, and 
linguistic environment. While many of the migrants move to another country 
together with their families and keep using their native language(s) at home,
some start a new life with a partner from the host country. Partners in such
binational relationships are confronted with the 'other' (person, language,
culture) on a more personal and intimate basis, in their homes.

Binational families can be regarded as a type of 'laboratories' (Varro 1998:
109) for studying language choice (maintenance or loss), the formation of
(hybrid) identities, the development of multilingual speaking practices, or
intercultural communication (Piller 2002). At the same time, these families have
to deal with everyday activities, to negotiate tasks, chores and roles, which
involves accommodating and overcoming linguistic and cultural differences. 

In this thematic panel we would like to bring together researchers working on
everyday communication in multilingual families and thus create a platform for 
exchanging ideas and discussing data collected in different multilingual
settings. We would like to focus on binational families where a) one of the
partners has migrated into the country of the other, or b) two partners with
different linguistic backgrounds have migrated into a third country. Since only
audio or video recordings of conversations enable us to conduct detailed
analyses of the multilingual realizations of everyday practices, we are
particularly interested in contributions taking a qualitative and interactional
approach to the topic and using methods such as Discourse and Conversation
Analysis. 

Such an approach allows us to study not only the use of multiple languages, but
 also aspects of construction and negotiation of linguistic resources, everyday
activities and identities. We therefore welcome papers on a range of topics,
including aspects of language use, identity construction and performance as well
as the accomplishment of tasks and chores in different languages. The
investigation of multilingual families offers a deep insight into communication
in multilingual environments and it highlights the social and cultural
significance of multilingual language use. Against the background of the current
political discussions in many European countries about (linguistic) integration
of different migrant groups, we would like to show how different linguistic
resources can be activated and combined to solve communicative tasks in everyday
family activities across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
