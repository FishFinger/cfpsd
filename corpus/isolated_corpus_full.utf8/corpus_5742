Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to invite you to submit a paper to the Language and
Technology Conference 2009, Pozna=C5=84, Poland, in November 6-8.
Please do notice that the Conference is extended to November 5 by=20
Less-Resourced Languages Workshop (LRL 2009) co-organised by FlaReNet
and Elra/Elda (see below).

We hope to see you in Pozna=C5=84.
Best regards
Zygmunt Vetulani, LTC 2009 Chair

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language
Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC
2009), a meeting organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer
Science of Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna=C5=84, Poland in cooperation
with the Adam Mickiewicz University Foundation (co-organizer), will
take place on November 6-8, 2009.

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for
computer science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become
an ever more essential element of our everyday technological
environment. Since the very beginning of the Computer and Information
Age these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. The
European Union strongly supports HLT under the 7th Framework
Program. These efforts as well as technological, social and cultural
globalization have created a favorable climate for the intensive
exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across initially
distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange
and invite you to join us at LTC in November 2009, as well as at the
FlaReNet workshop (LRL 2009) on the theme "Getting Less-Resourced
Languages on-Board!".

Zygmunt Vetulani
LTC 2009 Chair
vetulani@amu.edu.pl

PAPER SUBMISSION

The conference accepts papers in English. Papers (5 formatted pages)
are due by July 31, 2009 (midnight, any time zone) and should not
identify the author(s)in any manner. In order to facilitate submission

1. Accepted fonts for texts are Times Roman, Times New Roman. Courier
   is recommended for program listings. Character size for the main
   text should be 10 points, with 11 points leading (line spacing).

2. Text should be presented in 2 columns, 8,42 cm each with 0,95 cm
   between columns (gutter).

3. The paper size is 5 pages formatted according to (1) and (2) above.

4. The use of PDF format is strongly recommended, although MS Word
   will also be accepted.

Detailed guidelines for the final submission of accepted papers will
be published on the conference Web site by September 10, 2009
(acceptance notification date).


All submissions are to be made electronically via the LTC 2009 web
submission system. Acceptance/rejection notification will be sent by

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 =E2=80=93 18h00) + cocktail

Theme:

Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the
challenge of Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is
necessary to have access to Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT
performances. To this regard, the situation is very different across
the different languages. Little or sparse data exist for languages in
countries or regions where limited efforts have been devoted to such
issues in the past, also known as Less-Resourced Languages (LRL). The
workshop aims at reporting the needs, at presenting achievements and
at proposing solutions for the future, both in terms of LR and of LT
evaluation, especially in the European, Euro-Mediterranean and
regional frameworks. This will allow to identity the factors that have
an impact on a potential and shared roadmap towards supplying LR and
LT for all languages.

Topics:

- Experience in the production, validation and distribution of LR for
  less-resourced languages

- Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced languages

- Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in less-resourced
  languages

- Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages,
  language clustering...)

- To be completed...

Co-Chairs: Joseph Mariani (LIMSI-CNRS & IMMI-CNRS), Khalid
Choukri(ELRA & ELDA), Zygmunt Vetulani (Adam Mickiewicz University,
Poznan)
