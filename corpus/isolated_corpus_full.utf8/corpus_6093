</div>
The Societas Linguistica Europaea and the Vilnius Local Organizing
Committee invite you to submit workshop, poster and paper proposals for
the next annual SLE meeting. SLE meetings give a forum to high-quality
scientific research from all (sub)domains of linguistics. Every year
local organizers pay special attention to one specific topic. Though the
next annual meeting particularly welcomes papers on =93Language contact: at
the crossroads of disciplines and frameworks=94, workshops, posters and
individual papers are invited on topics belonging to all fields of
linguistics.<br><br>

&nbsp;<br>
<b>WORKSHOPS<br><br>
</b>Since SLE 2009, more than half of the presentations take place within
the framework of thematic workshops. Proposals for workshops are hence
particularly welcome. They should contain <br>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a description of the topic (including research questions to be addressed)
and<br>
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;
a provisional list of workshop participants and a three line description
of their topics<br>
We encourage workshop convenors to distribute an open call for papers on
the LinguistList and other fora. The deadline for the submission of
workshop proposals is 15 November 2009. Notification of acceptance will
follow by 15 December 2009. All abstracts of workshop papers have to be
registered and sent to us by 1 January 2010.<br><br>
Since we want all conference participants to be able to attend individual
workshop presentations, SLE workshops have to be compatible with the main
conference programme. This means that the format of the workshops must be
organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion).
Each workshop ideally comprises:<br><br>
1. An introductory paper by the convenor(s) or by a key-note speaker. It
should summarize previous research, specify the approaches to be found in
the workshop and explain the scope of the papers to be given.<br>
2. Seven or eight papers. The preference is for one-day workshops, but
two-day workshops may also be considered.<br>
3. A slot for final discussion on topics covered by the papers,
methodological issues and questions for future research.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
More details can be discussed with the SLE conference manager.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>POSTERS<br><br>
</b>The next SLE meeting will hold two poster sessions of an hour for
both senior and junior researchers. Posters and oral presentations will
be evaluated according to the same quality standards. In order to foster
interaction, all other sessions will be suspended during the poster
session. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The maximum size of the poster is 1,10 m x 1 m. For more information
about how to make a good poster,
<a href=3D"http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/posterpres.html">click
here</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The deadline for the submission of poster abstracts is 1 January
2010.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>
</b>Workshops, posters and individual papers are invited on all topics
belonging to the field of linguistics. Presentations will be 20 minutes
plus 10 minutes question time.<br><br>
Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and
should state research questions, approach, method, data and (expected)
results. The abstract will also contain three to five key words
specifying the (sub)domain, the topic and the approach. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by three people. Due to the good
efforts of the SLE 2009 SC, the acceptance rate of the Lisbon conference
was 57% for the general session. (More information on SLE 2009 can be
found
<a href=3D"http://www.societaslinguistica.eu/meetings/conference%20lisboa/Li=
sboa%202009.htm">
here</a>)<br><br>
The deadline for all abstracts (for the general session, the poster
session and the workshops) is 1 January 2010. Notification of acceptance
will be given by 31 March 2010.<br><br>
Submit your title through the
<a href=3D"http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/conference/admin/SubmitAbstractSL=
E">
Submit Abstract form</a> and email your abstract as an attachment to
<a href=3D"mailto:sle@arts.kuleuven.be">sle@arts.kuleuven.be</a>. The
abstract should not mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or
addresses. Abstracts are preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your
abstract contains special symbols, please include a pdf version as
well.<br><br>
<b>Prize for the best presentation and the best poster<br>
</b>&nbsp;<br>
On the basis of the ranking of the abstracts, the Scientific Committee
will set up an internal shortlist with nominees for the prize of best
oral presentation and the prize for best poster. Members of the Executive
Committee and the Scientific Committee will decide on the last day of the
meeting who will receive the prizes, which consist of 500 euros.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nominees are PhD students or postdocs who finish their dissertation in
the academic year of 2009-2010. <br><br>
