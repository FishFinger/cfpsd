Full Title: 12th Lexcial Functional Grammar Conference 
Short Title: LFG07 

Date: 28-Jul-2007 - 30-Jul-2007
Location: Stanford University, California, USA 
Contact Person: Aoife Cahill
Web Site: http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/lfg07.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 12th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be
hosted by Stanford University, California from July 28th to 30th 2007,
just after the LSA summer linguistic institute.

LFG 2007 welcomes work within the formal architecture of
Lexical-Functional Grammar as well as typological, formal, and
computational work within the 'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to
language employing a parallel, constraint-based framework. The conference
aims to promote interaction and collaboration among researchers interested
in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar is seen as the
interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple levels of
structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical
relations, semantics and discourse. 

First Call for Papers: LFG 2007

Abstract submission receipt deadline: 15 February 2007
Submissions should be submitted using the online submission system at
http://www.easychair.org/LFG07/. Submissions will not be accepted in any
other way.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the
following sites:

http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/

http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/lfg/

Submissions: Talks and Posters:

The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15
min. discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions should
focus on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an
emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether
descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Presentations should
describe original, unpublished work.

Dissertation Session:

As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will
give students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other
student research dissertations).  The dissertations must be completed by
the time of the conference, and they should be made publicly accessible
(e.g., on the World Wide Web). The presentation can either summarise the
thesis or focus on some salient issue dealt with in it. When preparing,
the presenter should keep in mind the strict time limit for the
presentation.

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to
student submissions but that these will then be judged by the same
criteria as any other submission. The International LFG Association
(ILFGA) will provide a small subsidy for all student presenters at the
conference.

Timetable:

Deadline for abstracts: 15 February 2007
Acceptances sent out: 31 March 2007

Conference: July 28-30 2007

Submission Speicifications:

Abstracts for talks, posters/demonstrations and the dissertation session
must be received by February 15, 2007. All abstracts should submitted
using the online submission system. Submissions should be in the form of
abstracts only.  Abstracts can be up to two A4 pages in 11pt or larger
type and should include a title. Omit name and affiliation, and obvious
self-reference.  Note: we no longer ask for a separate page for data and
figures (c-/f- and related structures).  They can be included in the text
of the abstract, obeying the overall two-page limit. Please submit your
abstract in .pdf, .ps or .doc format. If you have any trouble converting
your file into this format, please contact the Program Committee at the
addresses below.

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people.
Papers will appear in the proceedings, which will be published online by
CSLI Publications.

Organisers and Their Contact Addresses:

If you have queries about abstract submission or have problems using the
EasyChair submission, please contact the Programme Committee.
