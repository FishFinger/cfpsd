Meeting Description:

Remember how strangely out of place and frustrated you used to feel when
attending conferences, with no specific sections to fit in, no appropriate
proceedings chapters to accommodate your contribution and, worst of all, no
kindred-spirited fellow-scholars to share your interests in comparative research
with? We know that feeling only too well. We've been there too. But, chin up! No
need to feel like a 'cuckoo in the nest' any more. We are all 'birds of a
feather'. You are among your peers. It's time you shared and shared alike. Join
us on our cross-cultural attempt at reconciling disparities under the 

Motto: Concordia Discors 

Call for Papers

First Circular

Join us on the first edition of our 

Inter Litteras et Terras
International Conference on Comparative Literature, 
Contrastive Linguistics, Translation and Cross-cultural Studies 
Organized by 
Inter LitterasResearch Centre 
Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava, Romania 
21-23 September 2007 
We invite you all, fellow-academics with a comparative streak, to reflect as
seriously as ever on the great possibilities of tracking down fascinating bonds
as yet unrevealed between European, Asian, American, Australasian or/and African
literatures, languages and cultures, and then contact us as soon as possible. We
are waiting for your timely feedback. If interested, kindly read carefully the
information below. 

Topic Range:

Papers are invited for the sections covering the four major topics announced in
the conference subtitle. With the exception of Section 4, the topic range of
this first edition is extremely generous, in that there are practically no
restrictions as to what your wayward imagination might prompt you to turn your
hand to, naturally, as long as you keep within the bounds of comparativism. 

However, since in 2007 the entire scholarly world will be celebrating Mircea
Eliade's Centenary, the conference organizers thought it fit to dedicate the
proceedings of the section on Cross-cultural Studies to the memory of the
prominent Romanian philosopher and writer . 

Language Choice: 

The language choice of submitted contributions is equally generous: English,
French, German, Italian, Romanian, Spanish. Participants are consequently
invited to join one of the six Language Sections listed. 

Nevertheless, since the organizers aim - as is only natural - at enhancing the
accessibility of thought-provoking information provided by individual
contributions, participants will kindly present their papers in English, French
or Romanian. 

Online Submission of Registration Form:
Deadline: December 31, 2006 

Title and Asstract of the contribution, as well as specification of Topic
Section and Language(s) in which the paper will be submitted and presented
respectively, are to be included in the Registration Form. 

For reasons of improved data base visibility, the organizers reluctantly had to
narrow down the language choice of abstracts to two: a Germanic language and a
Romance one. Participants are therefore kindly invited to choose between English
and French when submitting their abstracts, as well as title and keywords. 

Proceedings:

A selection of contributions will be published in a volume which the organizers
intend to bring out no later than September 2007. 

Registration and Conference Fee: 50 Euro 

The fee covers registration, academic programme, opening reception, all
coffee-break refreshments and, in addition, a copy of the proceedings
(accommodation and meals excluded). 

Further details concerning accommodation, meal types, payment procedure, etc
will be provided in the Second Circular which will be launched no later than
January 2007.
