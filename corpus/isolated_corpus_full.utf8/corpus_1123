Meeting Description
The University of the Basque Country is organizing a Workshop on Argument
Structure and Syntactic Relations where recent developments of
morphology-syntax-semantics articulation in the VP-domain will be discussed. 

Last Call
Call Deadline: February 23, 2007.
Workshop on Argument Structure and Syntactic Relations
University of the Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain.
May 23-25, 2007.

Various issues emerge from looking at the broad theme of argument structure in
grammar: the role and the nature of thematic hierarchy, the relation between
case and configurationality, the relation between argument structure, case and
agreement, ergativity, the structure of the VP/vP, internal aspect, etc. In
other words, the 'lower' part of the syntax is probably the one of which we have
the most unclear understanding and important discrepancies in the literature of
the last years constitute evidence of that. There are quite a lot of theoretical
questions concerning the architecture of the verbal domain and these questions
need to be answered. Some of the questions are the following: do we need more
than vP and VP, like VoiceP, ApplP, CausP, AktP, PathP, EventP etc.? Is there
anything like UTAH in syntax, or do we need a more elaborate understanding of
thematic roles? How should the operation Agree be defined, and which features
are necessary for the description of argument structure? How is morphological
case related to argument structure?, and many more.  

To discuss the recent developments of morphology-syntax-semantics articulation
in the VP-domain, scholars working on different aspects are invited to share
their results in a 3-day workshop and discuss the current state of affairs in
this field. Also, a special focus will be put on the Basque language and its
implication on the topic of this workshop, argument structure. Two of our
invited speakers will contribute to this debate on Basque, which will give us a
more complete general scenario of the argument structure cross-linguistically.

This Workshop on Argument Structure and Syntactic Relations will take place at
the University of the Basque Country from May 23-25, 2007 at Vitoria-Gasteiz,
Spain. There are 12 slots of 40 minutes for selected talks. The workshop will
also feature six invited speakers.

- John Bowers (Cornell University) 
- Gillian Ramchand (University of Tromsø)
- Hamida Demirdache (University of Nantes)
- Jaume Mateu (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona)
- Javier Ormazabal (University of the Basque Country) 
- Beñat Oyharçabal (IKER-CNRS) 

We welcome submission of up to 3 page abstracts, anonymous, PDF-format, 12pt
font, one column, references and examples included on any topic related to
argument structure.

Please send your abstracts to argumentstructure@yahoo.com with ''Abstract'' in
the header of the message. The deadline for abstract submission is February 23.
Notification will be late March.

Organizers: Maia Duguine, Susana Huidobro and Nerea Madariaga.

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description
Workshop ''Romance intonation'' within the scope of the 30th Deutscher
Romanistentag (Biannual Meeting of the German Society for Romance Studies),
University of Vienna, 23 Sep 2007 - 27 Sep 2007

The systematic use of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a crucial role in the
phonological component of most languages' grammar and closely interacts with
other components such as syntax and pragmatics. While classical structuralist
work on intonation mainly concentrated on the description and systematization of
recognizable tonal patterns, recent research focuses on the relationship between
an abstract level of tonal representation and a surface level, i.e. the F0
contour produced by the speaker. The autosegmental-metrical (AM) model of
intonational phonology, for example, which has been fruitfully adapted to the
analysis of several Romance languages during the last 20 years, assumes an
inventory of only two underlying tonal elements, a high tone (H) and a low tone
(L). Both can associate with different levels of the prosodic hierarchy thereby
representing various types of either pitch accents (LH*, L*H etc.) or boundary
tones (H-, L etc.).
The aim of the workshop is to assess recent developments in intonational
phonology from a Romanist's point of view, revealing similarities between
Romance languages as well as typological differences. We would like to approach
the issue from a theoretical as well as from an empirical point of view, thereby
taking into account data from both spontaneous and laboratory speech. One point
of interest is the pragmatic foundation of intonation and its interaction with
word order, sentence mode and information structure, including the role of
emphasis. Furthermore we intend to discuss the interdependencies between F0 and
other aspects of prosodic and segmental phonology, which manifest themselves in
rhythm, syllable structure and certain segmental correlates, among others. A
third topic should be the perception of intonation: A successful use of
intonational devices requires that the produced F0 contours are perceived and
interpreted in an appropriate way by the hearers. Insights from perceptional
studies thus constitute useful correctives for phonological theory.
We invite papers on any aspect of Romance intonation, based on different
theoretical frameworks. Presentations are allotted 30 minutes (20 min for talk,
10 min for discussion). According to the guidelines of the DRV, contributions
may be presented in any Romance language, in German or in English. Abstracts
should include title of contribution, name(s), affiliation(s) and e-mail
address(es) of author(s) and must not exceed one page, including references.
Please submit your abstract as an e-mail attachment (both word and pdf files) to
the following two addresses:

tmeisenb@uos.de
cgabriel@uos.de

Deadline for abstract submission: 28 February 2007

The following scholars have already confirmed their participation (in
alphabetical order):
Lluïsa Astruc (Cambridge), Brechtje Post (Cambridge), Ingo Feldhausen (ZAS
Berlin), Caroline Féry (Potsdam), Martine Grice (Köln), Conxita Lleó (Hamburg),
Serge Pahaut (Bruxelles), Stefan Rabanus (Verona), Martin Rakow (Hamburg), Maria
Selig (Regensburg)

The workshop forms part of the XXX. Deutscher Romanistentag. All participants
are requested to register for the conference (online registration is possible
through the conference website http://www.romanistentag.de/040_anmeldung.htm).
Please note that in accordance with the DRV guidelines no speaker is allowed to
give a talk in more than one workshop during the conference.
