Meeting Description:

Natural Language Engineering of Legal Argumentation 

Call for Papers

The topic of this workshop is the language, logic, and computation of legal
argumentation:  linguistic analyses of legal argumentation show the lexical
items, syntactic patterns, and discourse structures; logics of argumentation
represent the argument abstractly and enable one to infer justified claims;
computational models support implementations of the logic allowing for automated
inference.  The workshop not only promotes research towards understanding legal
argumentation, but more importantly promotes the development of interactive
prototype systems; such a system allows automated parsing and semantic
translation of arguments; comparison of statements input in natural language
relative to an existing complex argument; calculation of relationships between
statements; inference to justified conclusions in large networks of arguments;
and generation of natural language output or argument graphs.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
