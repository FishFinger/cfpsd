<http://www.sigslate.org/> =20

SLaTE 2009 is the second ISCA Workshop on Speech and Language Technology =
in Education.  It follows SLaTE 2007, held in Farmington, Pennsylvania, =
USA, and has its origins in the STiLL meeting organized by KTH in =

accessed from the SLaTE website, or directly at =
http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/SLaTE2009=20

The workshop will focus on research issues, applications, development =
tools and collaboration.  It will be concerned with all topics which =
concern speech and language technology for education. Papers will =
discuss theories, applications, evaluation, limitations, persistent =
difficulties, general research tools and techniques.  Papers that =
critically evaluate approaches or processing strategies will be =
especially welcome, as will prototype demonstrations of real-world =
applications.

The scope of acceptable topic interests includes but is not limited to:=20

The workshop fee will include all accommodation and meals at Wroxall =

unique setting amidst the peace and tranquillity of the Warwickshire =
countryside. Once the country seat of Sir Christopher Wren, Wroxall =
boasts a magnificent collection of listed buildings and private grounds, =
which made it an ideal venue for the workshop. Wroxall is situated just =
10 miles from Birmingham International Airport, 13 miles from =
Stratford-upon-Avon and 6 miles from Warwick. It is anticipated that =
visits to Stratford and Warwick will be included in the social =
programme.
