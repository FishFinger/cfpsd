IEEE Symposium on Web Society (SWS2009)
August 23-24, 2009, Lanzhou , China 
Paper Submission: May 15, 2009 (extended) 

Call for paper 

Nowadays, people spend more and more time on the Web, and according to the latest CNNIC report, there are about 298M network users in China until the end of 2008. Web has become a virtual world for most people. The WWW does not exist without the participation of people and organizations. To improve the effectiveness of consuming Web information, thus help people use the Internet more safe and effective, it is a must to learn more about the web society, i.e., the users and 
interactions among them. 

What the characteristics/personalities of Web users? How do people behave on the Web? How people search on the Web, and can we identify their intention? How can the web behavior and interactions to be understood? And how can we design the Web of the future ensure that it remains stable and pro-human'? 

Those challenges require understanding of both human personalities and their behavior on the Web. So the Web society is a field that requires the attention of computer scientists, psychologists, social scientists, etc. The aim of this symposium is to bring these scientists together across the disciplinary divide for perhaps the first time, exploring the development of the Web across different areas of everyday life and technological development. We welcome papers from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including computer science, sociology, 
psychology, economics, health, etc. Papers which incorporate more than one discipline will be particularly welcomed. The detail of the areas for particular attention of the conference has been given in the attachment. 

Successful applicants will be asked to produce a full paper to be presented at the conference in a plenary session. These papers will automatically be indexed by EI. Selected papers will be published by an International journal which is indexed by SCIE.
