This HCSNet workshop focuses on current research investigating the behavioural, cognitive, and neural basis of communication impairments affecting individuals with autism spectrum disorders, as well as research evaluating the efficacy of various intervention strategies. Topics include (but are not limited to) speech perception and production, grammatical skills, semantics, conversation and pragmatics, nonverbal communication, reading, and alternative forms of communication. It is being funded by HCSNet and by the University of Sydney.

Audience

The workshop is aimed at all Australian researchers and practitioners with a direct or indirect interest in autism and related communication disorders. We anticipate 35 attendees. The workshop will take place in Sydney shortly after the Asia Pacific Autism Conference (APAC), which will attract researchers and practitioners from across Australia. In contrast to APAC, the HCSNet workshop will offer a much smaller, more intimate meeting with a relatively narrow scientific scope. Our workshop will also target students who are currently conducting research in the area. If we receive enough submissions we will hold a poster session (ideal for research students and others who may have work in progress).

Event Format

The workshop will take place over two days. There will be five invited keynote speakers (national and international researchers), each speaking for up to an hour about complementary research topics. Keynote addresses will be interspersed with shorter presentations submitted by Australia-based researchers. Submissions for these short presentations will be solicited via HCSNet and via the Autism Research Alliance Australasia mailing list. There will be a poster session (providing we receive at least 5 submissions for posters). A workshop dinner will be organised.

Five keynote speakers have confirmed their availability.

1) Patricia Howlin is Professor of Clinical Child Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. Her research interests focus on the evaluation of different intervention programmes targeted at individuals on the autism spectrum, including control trials of communication training programs. She has been involved in longitudinal studies of language processing in individuals with autism. Professor Howlin's visit is being funded by the University of Sydney.
2) Prof Morton Ann Gernsbacher from the University of Madison-Wisconsin has conducted research in a number of areas of language processing using methods drawn from psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Recently she has been investigating motor planning in autism and how this relates to speech deficits in this population.
3) Dr Lesley Stirling, a linguist from the University of Melbourne, researches narrative writing skills in children with autism using innovative techniques.
4) Dr Jacqui Roberts, a speech pathologist and autism researcher at the University of Sydney, has worked on early intervention and parent education programs. She has conducted a systematic review of the evidence relating to the programs that are currently available to assist communication skills in children with autism.
5) Dr Andrew Whitehouse has worked on developmental disorders with researchers at the University of Western Australia and at the University of Oxford. He has examined inner speech and other language processes in autism.

Event Outcomes

Apart from the networking opportunities available to all who attend this conference we will approach journals to publish at least one special issue (eg journals such as Autism or the Journal of Communication Disorders).
Submission Format

Submission deadline: Friday 24th July 2009

Travel Bursaries

A number of bursaries are available for Australian-based student members of HCSNet traveling from outside the Sydney metropolitan area. Bursaries will be awarded on a competitive basis, with priority given to students submitting an oral or poster presentation. Successful applicants will be notified shortly after the workshop registration deadline and will be able to claim back up to $500 for (economy) travel and accommodation costs upon presentation of receipts. If you would like to be considered for a student bursary, please contact Jon Brock (jon.brock@mq.edu.au). If you do not intend to give a presentation at the workshop, you should provide a brief background to your research and your reasons for attending the workshop.
