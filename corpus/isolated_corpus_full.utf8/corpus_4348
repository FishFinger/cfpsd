African Linguistics.  UIUC is proud to host this year's ACAL in April of 2009

Languages and Linguistics Today: 40th Anniversary Celebration.

This is a notification that the deadline for abstract submissions for the 40th
Annual Conference on African Linguistics has been extended by one week.  The
original deadline was January 31st 2009 but it is now February 7th.  Abstracts
can be uploaded at the ACAL 40 Easychair site:
https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=acal40

Anonymous abstracts for 20-minute individual paper or 30-minute forum/panel
presentations on any indigenous and/or transplanted African language(s) (viz.,
English, French, and Portuguese) are invited. Each abstract, including the title
and illustrative data (wherever necessary), must not exceed 500 words, and must
be submitted online as a portable (i.e., PDF) or Microsoft Word document.
Priority consideration will be given to papers that address the substance of the

contribution of these languages to linguistic theory and description.

Meeting Description:

Visual and Verbal Rhetoric of the Media 

Call for Papers

The Aims of the Conference: 
To discuss the rhetorical devices, techniques, and strategies used by the
authors and illustrators of media messages to achieve their goals of moving or
frightening their audiences, effectively shaping their perception and
conceptualization of events, and/or changing their attitudes. We will welcome
the papers analyzing examples of the use of linguistic and visual imagery and
tropes in both the traditional and the new media, but also discussing such
issues as media bias, stereotyping, the ways of tackling "delicate" topics, the
use of irony and parody, intertextuality. We also invite the authors who take up
contrastive analyses; and especially those who would like to focus specifically
on the interaction of the visual and the verbal aspects of the media messages. 
                  
The language of the Conference is English.
The length of the presentation: 30 minutes.
The conference proceedings will be published by the Lodz University Press. 

The conference fee will be approximately 75 ?  . Detailed information about the
costs of accommodation will follow in the next circular. 

The deadline for the initial statement of interest and a general outline of the
paper is 5 March 2009.
