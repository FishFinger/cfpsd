The Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN-6)
(In conjunction with IJCNLP 2008)
11-12 January 2008
Hyderabad, India
http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/sighan6

Final Call for Papers

Background and Goals

Growing interest in Chinese language processing is leading to the=20
development of resources such as annotated corpora, word segmenters,
part-of-speech taggers, and parsers. As more resources have become =
available=20
recently, it is crucial to create a platform that allows easy exchange =
of=20
information and data and the comparison of different approaches to =
various=20
NLP tasks. The SIGHAN workshops provide a forum where the latest =
research in=20
these areas can be shared.

This series of workshop is organized under the auspices of the Special=20
Interest Group on Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN) under the =
Association=20
for Computational Linguistics.  SIGHAN was established in 2001 to =
realize=20
and promote the widespread interest in Chinese language processing.

Following the success of previous SIGHAN workshops, IJCNLP 2008 in =
Hyderabad=20
will provide yet another ideal opportunity to bring together again=20
influential as well as aspiring researchers from Asia Pacific, and those =

from many others from Europe and USA, to deliberate and interact on a =
range=20
of research issues.

Papers are invited on substantial, original and unpublished research on =
all=20
aspects of Chinese language processing, including but not limited to:

word segmentation
part-of-speech tagging
parsing
lexical semantics
word sense disambiguation
lexicon acquisition
corpus development
discourse processing
generation
cross-lingual information retrieval
machine translation
Submission Method

Papers should be written in English and may not exceed 8 pages =
(including=20
all illustrations, references and appendices, and using 11pt for the =
main=20
text). We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or MS Word =

document template provided by IJCNLP 2008, available at
http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/callforpapers.htm. Since reviewing will be =
blind,=20
manuscripts should not include authors' names and affiliations. Papers=20
should be submitted via our SIGHAN-6 electronic submission site.

Important Dates

Paper Submission Deadline: 21 September, 2007
Notification of Paper Acceptance: 26 October, 2007
Camera Ready Submission Deadline: 16 November, 2007
Workshop Dates: 11-12 January 2008 (full day on 11 January and half day =
