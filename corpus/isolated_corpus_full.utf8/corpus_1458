Meeting Description:

The theme of the 5th International Conference of Cushitic and Omotic languages
will be recent developments in all linguistic aspects of Cushitic and Omotic
languages, preferably from a descriptive point of view. Twenty-two years after
the first conference, contributions on the state of the arts in one language, or
a branch, or a sub-branch of these languages, will be also most welcome. 

Colleagues wishing to present a paper at the conference are asked to send a
one-page abstract to the program committee no later than October 1, 2007. A
one-page sheet for examples can be added to the abstract. English and French are
the preferred language at the conference.
Students in Masters and PhD programs are particularly encouraged to present
their researches.
The committee strongly encourages submissions by e-mail (preferably with the
abstract in pdf format, or doc, and author information as part of the e-mail
text), but abstracts may also be sent by fax or by snail mail. Authors are asked
to check their pdf files carefully to ensure that special characters are
embedded properly - or attach the appropriate fonts.
The time allotted for presentation is 20 minutes, plus a 10 minute-discussion.
