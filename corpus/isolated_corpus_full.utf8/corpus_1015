Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 7, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity for gra=
duate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) investigating topi=
cs in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present =
their current work and receive constructive feedback and guidance on future=
 research, both from the general audience and the invited lecturers at the =
Summer School. =


The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4 consecutiv=
e evenings (1.5 hour slots) in one of the two weeks of the EUROLAN 2007 Sum=
mer School. The final version of the accepted papers will be published in t=
he Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. During the Summer S=
chool the students will present their work, will receive constructive comme=
nts wrt. to current and future research directions from a panel of establis=
hed researchers, and will benefit from the collaborative climate establishe=
d among all participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Stud=
ents will also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the Sum=
mer School. =


We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the Cons=
ortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to receive fe=
edback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within Computationa=
l Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, however students working in =
the areas related with the theme of this year's Summer School like:
- computational semantics, =

- ontology enriched NLP applications
- opinion and sentiment analysis, =

- role of  sentiment analysis in multimodal human computer interaction =

are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lectures of the sch=
ool and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

ssions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST be students=
. =

- the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field; =

- the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the methodolog=
y adopted;
- the future research plan. =



3. Submission Procedure
