2nd Call for Papers

LREC 2008 Workshop on

"Multimodal corpora:
 From Models of Natural Interaction to Systems and Applications"

** NEW SUBMISSION DEADLINE: February 19th **

Tuesday, 27 May 2008
Marrakech (Morocco)
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/

-------------------------------------------------------------------


DESCRIPTION

A 'Multimodal Corpus' targets the recording and annotation of several =

communication modalities such as speech, hand gesture, facial =

expression, body posture, etc. Theoretical issues are also addressed, =

given their importance to the design of multimodal corpora.

This workshop continues the successful series of similar workshops at =

LREC 00, 02, 04 and 06 also documented in a special issue of the Journal =

of Language Resources and Evaluation due to come out in spring 2008. =

There is an increasing interest in multimodal communication and =

multimodal corpora as visible by European Networks of Excellence and =

integrated projects such as HUMAINE, SIMILAR, CHIL, AMI, CALLAS. =

Furthermore, the success of recent conferences and workshops dedicated =

to multimodal communication (ICMI, IVA, Gesture, PIT, Nordic Symposia on =

Multimodal Communication, Embodied Language Processing) and the creation =

of the Journal of Multimodal User Interfaces also testifies to the =

growing interest in this area, and the general need for data on =

multimodal behaviours.

The focus of this LREC'2008 workshop on multimodal corpora will be on =

models of natural interaction and their contribution to the design of =

multimodal systems and applications.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
=95 Multimodal corpus collection activities (e.g. direction-giving =

dialogues, emotional behaviour, human-avatar interaction, human-robot =

interaction, etc.)
=95 Relations between modalities in natural (human) interaction and in =

human-computer interaction
=95 Application of multimodal corpora to the design of multimodal and =

multimedia systems
=95 Fully or semi-automatic multimodal annotation, using e.g. motion =

capture and image processing, and its integration with manual annotations
=95 Corpus-based design of systems that involve human-like modalities =

either in input (Virtual Reality, motion capture, etc.) and output =

(virtual characters)
=95 Multimodal interaction in specific scenarios, e.g. group interaction =

in meetings
=95 Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal corpora
=95 Evaluation and validation of multimodal annotations
=95 Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition, creation, =

management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and multimodal =

corpora
=95 Interoperability between multimodal annotation tools (exchange =

formats, conversion tools, standardization)
=95 Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora
=95 Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated =

speech, gaze, gesture, facial expressions)
=95 Analysis methods tailored to multimodal corpora using e.g. statistical =

measures or data mining
We expect the output of this workshop to be:
1) deeper understanding of theoretical issues and research questions =

related to verbal and non-verbal communication that multimodal corpora =

should address,
2) larger consensus on how such corpora should be built in order to =

provide useful and usable answers to research questions,
3) shared knowledge of how the corpora are contributing to multimodal =

and multimedia system design, and
4) an updated view of state-of-the-art research on multimodal corpora.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT DATES

- February 19th: *new deadline* for submission (full paper)
- March 16th: Notification of acceptance
- March 30th: Camera ready version of papers
- May 27th: Workshop

-------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBMISSIONS

The workshop will consist primarily of paper presentations, posters, =

demos and discussion/working sessions.

The .pdf file should be submitted
on the workshop web site: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/MMC/submit.html
*and* via email to MARTIN@LIMSI.FR and PATRIZIA@CST.DK

Submissions should be 4 pages long, must be in English,
and follow the submission guidelines and MS Word .doc template to be =

available from
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/

Demonstrations of multimodal corpora and related tools are encouraged as =

well (a demonstration outline of 2 pages can be submitted).

As soon as possible, authors are encouraged to send to MARTIN@LIMSI.FR =

and PATRIZIA@CST.DK
a brief email indicating their intention to participate, including their =

contact information and the topic they intend to address in their =

submissions. Proceedings of the workshop will be printed by the LREC =

Local Organising Committee.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
TIME SCHEDULE AND REGISTRATION FEE

The workshop will consist of a morning session and an afternoon session.
There will be time for collective discussions.
