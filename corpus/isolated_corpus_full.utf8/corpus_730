Meeting Description:

IWAPR2007 follows on from the success of previous international conferences in this area (ICAPR'98, ICAPR'2001, and ICAPR'2005). The aim of the workshop is to bring together some of the latest advances in pattern recognition applied to a diverse range of applications. IWAPR2007 is being organised in conjunction with the 5th International Summer School on Pattern Recognition (ISSPR), which is being organised at the same venue between 22-27 July, 2007. The Call for Paper submission is open to anyone, whether they are attending or not attending ISSPR. There are obvious benefits of attending both events and this is strongly encouraged.

IWAPR is supported by a range of organisations. It will be published exclusively by Springer in the form of a book, and electronic proceedings will also be available. It should be noted that at least one author must register for the workshop for the paper to be published, and an author can register the first paper at full registration, and all subsequent papers at 50% of full registration per paper. 

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Statistical Parametric Approaches (Probability-based) - Statistical Non-Parametric Approaches - Structural and Graph-based Approaches - Neural Networks - Supervised, Unsupervised and Re-inforcement learning - Data Mining - Time-Series Analysis - Evolutionary Computation - Fuzzy Pattern Recognition - Knowledge and Case-Based systems - Performance Evaluation of Pattern Recognition Systems - Data Visualisation.
