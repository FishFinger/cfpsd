Full Title: 16th Manchester Phonology Meeting 
Short Title: 16MFM 

Date: 22-May-2008 - 24-May-2008
Location: Manchester, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Patrick Honeybone
Meeting Email: patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/16mfm.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 03-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The MFM is the UK's annual phonology conference, with an international set of organisers; it is held in late May every year in Manchester (central in the UK, easily accessible from the whole of the country, and with excellent international transport connections). The meeting has become a key conference for phonologists from all corners of the world, where anyone who declares themselves to be interested in phonology can submit an abstract on anything phonological in any phonological framework. In an informal atmosphere, we discuss a broad range of topics, including the phonological description of a wide variety of languages, issues in phonological theory, aspects of phonological acquisition and implications of phonological change. 

Call for Papers

- Special Session
There is no conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on anything, but, following the success of such sessions in previous years, a special themed session has been organised, entitled 'Phonology and the mental lexicon.' This will feature invited speakers and will conclude in an open discussion session when contributions from the audience will be very welcome.

Special Session Speakers (in alphabetical order):
- Abby Cohn (Cornell University)
- Sarah Hawkins (University of Cambridge)
- Aditi Lahiri (University of Oxford)

Abstract Submission:
- NB: This is a summary - please consult the website for full details
http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/16mfm.html

- There is no obligatory conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on anything. Abstracts should be sent to Patrick Honeybone as attachments to an email (patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk) by 3rd March 2008 [NB: this is slightly later than previously advertised].

- Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm or one inch margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal character spacing.

- Please send two copies of your abstract - one of these should be anonymous and one should include your name, affiliation and email address at the top of the page, directly below the title. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by members of the organising committee and advisory board.

- Please use one of these formats for your abstract: pdf, Word, or plain text. If you need to use a phonetic font in your abstract, either embed it in a pdf file, or use the Doulos SIL font

- Full papers will last around 25 minutes with around 5 minutes for questions, and there will be a high-profile poster session lasting one and a half hours. Please indicate whether you would prefer to present your work as an oral paper or a poster, or whether you would be prepared to present it in either form.

- If you need technical equipment for your talk, please say so in the message 
accompanying your abstract and we will do our best to provide it, although this cannot be guaranteed.

- We aim to finalise the programme, and to contact abstract-senders by around the end of March, and we will contact those who have sent abstract as soon as the decisions have been made.

- Further important details concerning abstract submission are available on the conference website - please make sure that you consult these before submitting an abstract: www.englang.ed.ac.uk/mfm/16mfm.htm

Short Title: SIGMORPHON 2008 

Date: 19-Jun-2008 - 20-Jun-2008
Location: Columbus, Ohio, USA 
Contact Person: Jeffrey Heinz
Meeting Email: sigmorphon2008@udel.edu
Web Site: http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Morphology; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 17-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of the SIGMORPHON workshop is to bring together researchers interested in applying computational techniques to problems in morphology, phonology, and phonetics. Papers will be on substantial, original, and unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong work in progress. See the Call for Papers for more detail and submission guidelines. The workshop is held as part of the ACL's annual conference, this year at Ohio State University on June 19 or 20. This is SIGMORPHON's first workshop whose scope reflects the SIG's new charter, which has expanded with ACL's approval to include morphology and phonetics as well as phonology. 

Call for Papers 

This is SIGMORPHON's first workshop whose scope reflects the SIG's new charter, which has expanded with ACL's approval to include morphology and phonetics as well as phonology.

Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to) the following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:
- New formalisms, or computational treatments of existing linguistic formalisms - Probabilistic models and machine learning
- Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning of linguistic knowledge
- Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or diachronic data 
- Algorithms, including finite-state methods
- Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology
- Instructional technologies for second-language learners
- Psycholinguistics and speech science (both production and comprehension)
- Machine transliteration and back-transliteration
- Corpus linguistics
- Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP tasks
- Tools and resources

One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical and empirical linguistics. Our recent meetings have been successful in this regard, and we hope to see this continue in 2008.  Many mainstream linguists studying phonetics, phonology, and morphology are now asking and answering computational questions. We hope that this workshop will allow the CL community to consider their problems, tools, and models.

This workshop will be the tenth meeting of SIGMORPHON (formerly called SIGPHON). We will hold a full-day workshop consisting of approximately 10 half-hour presentations.

The workshop will be held on June 19 or 20, immediately after the ACL 2008 meetings at Ohio-State University in Columbus, Ohio.

The workshop website is: http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/

Important Dates:
- Submission Deadline: March 17, 2008, 23:59 EST
- Notification: April 16, 2008
- Camera-ready Copy Due: April 30, 2008
- Workshop: June 19 or 20, 2008

Paper Submission: 
Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work is preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should clearly indicate the state of completion of the reported results. Authors are encouraged to study the actual form used by reviewers
(http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/review-form.html) to assess papers.

Submission Format: 
The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and should not exceed eight (8) pages. One additional page is allowed for the References section.  Thus, your PDF file may be 9 pages. However, all material other than the bibliography must fall within the first 8 pages!  We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template that are available on the ACL conference web site (http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html). We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles, including font size restrictions.

Anonymous Review: 
The paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Conflicts of Interest: 
Authors should mark on the submission page any program committee member with whom they have a conflict of interest, such as a recent collaborator, a recent colleague at the same institution, or a close personal friend.

Double Submitting: 
Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information on the START online submission page. Papers may not be submitted to SIGMORPHON 2008 if they are currently or will be submitted to other meetings or publications and that other meeting or publication prohibits multiple submission. If SIGMORPHON 2008 accepts a paper, authors must notify the program chairs *immediately* indicating which meeting they choose for presentation of their work. SIGMORPHON 2008 cannot accept for publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

Submission Procedure: 
Authors must submit papers online here: https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS06/submit.html

The submission deadline is Monday March 17, 2008 23:59 EST. Papers submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed.
