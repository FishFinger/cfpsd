====================================

The 21st International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research
Society Conference (FLAIRS-21) will be held 15th-17th May 2008 at the
Grand Bay Miami Hotel in Coconut Grove, Florida, USA. FLAIRS-21 will
feature technical papers, special tracks, and invited
speakers. Coconut Grove is a few miles south of downtown Miami. It is
known for its historic waterfront location on Biscayne Bay, and
vibrant central district. The conference is hosted by the Florida
Artificial Intelligence Research Society, in cooperation with the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and
with the support of the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Miami.

Submission of papers for presentation at the conference is now
invited. Topics of interest are in all areas of artificial
intelligence, including:

- Foundations
  o Knowledge representation
  o Cognitive modeling
  o Perception
  o Reasoning and programming
  o Search
  o Learning

- Architectures
  o Agents and distributed AI
  o Intelligent user interfaces
  o Natural language systems
  o Information retrieval
  o Robotics

- Applications
  o Aviation and aerospace
  o Education
  o Entertainment
  o Medicine
  o Management and manufacturing
  o World Wide Web

- Implications
  o Philosophical foundations
  o Social impact and ethics
  o Evaluation of AI systems
  o Teaching AI

--------------------------
 Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a
journal or another conference. Full papers may be up to 6 pages, and
poster papers up to 2 pages. Papers must be in AAAI format, and
submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system which can be
accessed through the main conference web site:

Authors are encouraged to submit to papers to special tracks when
appropriate for the paper topic.

The proceedings of FLAIRS will be published by the AAAI. Authors of
accepted papers will be required to sign a form transferring copyright
of their contribution to AAAI. An author of each accepted paper is

 Special Tracks
-----------------

The FLAIRS special tracks are held in parallel with the general
conference. A special track consists of a group of papers in a
sub-discipline of artificial intelligence. Special tracks are an
integral part of each FLAIRS conference: their papers are required to
meet the same standards and are published in the conference
proceedings.  Special tracks provide researchers in focused areas the
opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for
interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence
researchers.  FLAIRS-21 special tracks include:

- Design, Evaluation, and Refinement of Intelligent Systems (DERIS)
- Games and Entertainment
- Uncertain Reasoning
- Data Mining
- Applied Natural Language Processing
- Artificial Intelligence Education
- Case-Based Reasoning
- Spatio-Temporal Reasoning
- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- AI Planning and Scheduling
- Logics, General Ontologies, Categorization and Semantic Annotation
- Smart Humans in Smart Environments (SHISE)

 Invited Speakers
-------------------

- Bruce Buchanan, University of Pittsburgh, USA
- Alfred Kobsa, University of California, Irvine, USA
- Candy Sidner, BAE Systems, USA
