We are pleased to announce the 2007 BIDE (Bilbao-Deusto) Student Conference in
Linguistics, BIDE'07. The aim of BIDE is to serve as rendezvous for new
generations of academics from all areas of linguistic research (Theoretical,
Experimental, Applied & Computational Linguistics). BIDE provides students a
welcoming atmosphere where they can present their own work and get feedback from
peers as well as senior researchers.  

Abstracts are due by May 10, 2007. Your proposal should describe original,
unpublished work that may be in progress. Authors are limited to a maximum of
one individual and one joint submission (papers co-authored with faculty will
not be accepted). Send your abstract as a PDF or WORD file to bide@fil.deusto.es
with 'abstract submission' in the subject field. The abstract should be
anonymous and abide by the following specifications: do not exceed two pages
(examples and references included); use 1 inch ( 2.54 cm) margins on all sides;
and a 12 point size font (preferably Times New Roman). Include your name(s),
title of the paper, affiliation(s) and contact information in the email body,
and indicate what area of linguistics your contribution fits in best, e.g.
morphology, phonetics, phonology, syntax, etc. English is the official language
of the conference and all abstracts must be written in this language.  

Notification of acceptance will be sent around by the end of May. Accepted
papers are allotted 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for discussion.  

The papers presented at BIDE'07 are eligible for publication in the conference
proceedings. The deadline for submitting papers will be announced at the
conference.

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 10-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

A growing trend in L2 programs and classrooms in North America, Europe and
Australia is the increasing presence of immigrants or their children who wish to
learn, relearn, or preserve their native language and culture. These are
heritage speakers of minority languages who come to L2 classrooms with different
degrees of command of the language depending on a variety of sociolinguistic
circumstances. In many ways, their linguistic abilities are comparable to those
of L2 learners with no exposure to the language and culture. Yet, these speakers
also possess distinctive linguistic strengths due to the fact that they have
received early exposure to the language, albeit limited in some cases.  To date,
there is very little systematic research which seeks to understand the complex
linguistic profile of these speakers. This colloquium seeks to begin to fill
this gap by extending current SLA theories and empirical methods to the study of
this population. Questions that this colloquium will address are: 1)What
theoretical approaches within first, second or bilingual acquisition can best
account for the linguistic competence and performance of these speakers? 2) What
are the linguistic strengths and deficits that these learners possess in
comparison to typical postpuberty L2 learners? 3) How are these strengths and
gaps explained? 4) Is formal instruction successful to help these speakers
overcome linguistic deficits and become full speakers of the heritage language?
5) If so, what type of instruction is most effective to help heritage learners
acquire or bring back aspects of the heritage language grammar acquired early in
childhood? We hope that some of the answers to these questions can be found in
the variety of approaches available within the general field of language
acquisition. 

To have a paper considered for inclusion in this colloquium, please submit your
abstract through the SLRF 2007 website (www.slrf-2007.uiuc.edu).  Click on the
''Abstracts'' link on the left, and follow the instructions there.

co-authored abstract.

Submission Deadline: May 10, 2007 (new deadline)
