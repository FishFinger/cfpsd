Call Deadline: 15-Aug-2009 

Meeting Description:

The American Name Society (ANS), an academic, professional organization devoted

Call for Papers

The American Name Society (ANS), a professional organization devoted to the
study of names and their role in society, invites précis and abstracts for
papers for its annual meeting to be held in conjunction with the Linguistic
Society of America (LSA) and other allied, professional organizations. 

Papers in any area of onomastics are appropriate, and a précis of not more than
500 words, along with a 100-word abstract for publication in both the LSA and
ANS meeting programs, should be submitted no later than August 15, 2009.  In the
précis, the subject of the proposed paper should be stated in a simple, topic
sentence, which is then effectively supported by substantiating information and
specific examples.  

The preferred mode of transmission, for both the précis and accompanying
abstract, is by an introductory e-mail with attachment sent to
ANS1stVP@yahoo.com with "ANS Proposal" in the subject line.  All précis will be
evaluated anonymously, and authors will be notified by September 1, 2009. 

Membership in ANS is a requirement of all presenters, who must also pay the LSA
conference registration fee.  This fee allows one access to all LSA and other
allied organizations' sessions, the plenary sessions, the book exhibits, and the
job placement service.  It also makes one eligible for a reduced rate at the
conference hotel.  Presenters will also be expected to pay an
additional,incidental registration fee to ANS to cover expenses for any items
not provided by LSA.  Papers that are accepted must be read by their author.  If
the author is unable to attend the meeting, the paper will not be presented or
read by another individual.

Further information concerning the Linguistic Society of America may be obtained
from the LSA homepage at www.lsadc.org.  Additional information about the
American Name Society may be accessed at www.wtsn.binghamton.edu/ANS/.  Complete
information regarding the 2010 annual meeting, including all fees, will be
available on the ANS website by late summer. 

American Name Society Emerging Scholar Award (ANSESA)

In 2007 the American Name Society established the ANS Emerging Scholar Award, in
the amount of $250, to be awarded to the undergraduate or graduate student who
submits the best paper that is accepted for presentation at the annual meeting.
 In addition to the cash prize, the student will also receive a two-year
membership in ANS, as well as assistance in preparing the paper for publication.
 To receive complete information and instructions for submission, write the ANS
first vice president at ANS1stVP@yahoo.com.
