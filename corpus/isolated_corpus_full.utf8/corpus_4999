The 14th conference on Formal Grammar

Bordeaux, France. July 25-26, 2009

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

Aims and Scope

FG provides a forum for the presentation of new and original research on =

formal grammar, mathematical linguistics and the application of formal =

and mathematical methods to the study of natural language. Themes of =

interest include, but are not limited to, =


    * formal and computational phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics
      and pragmatics;
    * model-theoretic and proof-theoretic methods in linguistics;
    * logical aspects of linguistic structure;
    * constraint-based and resource-sensitive approaches to grammar;
    * learnability of formal grammar;
    * integration of stochastic and symbolic models of grammar;
    * foundational, methodological and architectural issues in grammar;
    * mathematical foundations of statistical approaches to linguistic
      analysis.


Previous conferences in this series have welcomed papers from a wide =

variety of frameworks.

Proceedings

Submissions will be reviewed anonymously by at least three reviewers. =

Accepted papers will be published after the conference as volume number =

5591 in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (under the =

FoLLI LNAI subline).

Submission Details

We invite electronic submissions of original, unpublished 30-minute =

papers (including questions, comments, and discussion). Papers should =

report original work which was not presented in other conferences. =

However, simultaneous submission is allowed, provided that the authors =

indicate other conference to which the work was submitted on the paper =

submission form. Note that accepted papers can only be presented in one =

of the venues.


Authors are invited to submit anonymous papers presenting original and
unpublished research. Papers should not exceed 16 pages and should be
formatted according to the usual LNCS article style. Submissions. The =

needed style files are available at
ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/llncs2e.zip.


The submission deadline is April 26th, 2009. Papers must be submitted
electronically at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfg09.
