Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGY, KNOWLEDGE AND SOCIETY     
Huntsville, Alabama, USA     
30 January to 1 February 2009     
http://www.Technology-Conference.com     

This Conference will address a range of critically important themes in the various fields that address the complex and subtle relationships between technology, knowledge and society. The Conference is cross-disciplinary in scope, meeting points for technologists with a concern for the social and social scientists with a concern for the technological. The focus is primarily, but not exclusively, on information and communications technologies.

Huntsville, the Conference host city, has long played a key role in technological development. The Saturn V rocket used by NASA in their Apollo moon missions and Skylab program, was developed at the Marshall Flight Center in Huntsville. The Saturn V remains the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status from a height, weight and payload standpoint. There will be an option to attend the Conference Dinner at the Space and Rocket center, where there will be time to see the Saturn V rocket and visit the museum (available online soon).

As well as impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal, as well as access to the electronic version of the Conference proceedings.

Whether you are a virtual or in-person presenter at this Conference, we also encourage you to present on the Conference YouTube Channel. Please select the Online Sessions link on the conference website for further details.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 25 December 2008.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, are to be found at the Conference website - http://www.Technology-Conference.com.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Huntsville in January 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Jeffrey Sands, Ph.D.     
Vice President for University Advancement     
University of Alabama in Huntsville     
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Technology, Knowledge and Society
