The conference will also propose a hands-on CHILDES training workshop especially designed for those using or interested in using the program and its tools to analyse French L2 data.

Abstract Submission Information:
Proposals for further papers are invited on the above themes, and/ or on any other aspect of the nature and development of French as an L2. Individual papers will be 30 minutes (20 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion).
