Pre LREC-2008 Workshop:







Building and evaluating resources for biomedical text mining







Marrakech, Morocco



Monday, 26 May 2008



http://www.nactem.ac.uk/workshops/lrec08_ws/

***********************************************************************

Building and evaluating resources for biomedical text mining





We invite papers reporting on biomedical resources specifically used  
to facilitate biomedical text mining and the process of designing,  
building, updating, delivering, evaluating and disseminating them. A  
focus of the workshop is on lexical and knowledge repositories  
(e.g.controlled vocabularies, terminologies, ontologies, factual  
databases) and annotated corpora. Another focus is on design  
guidelines, standards for building resources, storage and exchange  
format, interoperability of resources and last, on exploring new  
directions for their dissemination.



Topics of interest include but are not limited to:





-           Building biomedical resources: controlled vocabularies,

terminologies, ontologies, corpora

-           Guidelines and annotation schemas, challenges,

interoperability

-           Building task-specific resources

-           Reengineering existing biomedical or general language

resources

-           Augmentation of resources with biomedical features

-           Update and evolution of resources

-           Lightly annotated and noisy resources

-           Tools for exploration of resources

-           Data exchange formats

-           Standards for building resources

-           Documenting and disseminating resources

-           Evaluation of resources





Organisers:



Sophia Ananiadou, National Centre for Text Mining, University of  
Manchester,UK



Monica Monachini, Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale, Pisa, Italy



Goran Nenadic, University of Manchester, UK



Jian Su, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore





Important Dates:



February 24, 2008     Paper submissions due

March 28, 2008        Paper notification of acceptance

April 11, 2008        Camera-ready papers due

May 26, 2008          Workshop



Submissions:



Submissions must describe original, completed or in progress, and  
unpublished work.  Your paper (up to 8 pages) should be formatted  
according to the stylesheet provided at LREC 2008. Please upload your  
electronic submissions in PDF format to EasyChair at  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=berbmtm08 
  .



Each submission will be reviewed by three program committee members.

Paper review will be double blind, so papers should not include  
authors' names and affiliations. Self-references are to be avoided- 
instead of "As we showed in Smith et al. 1999...", say "As Smith et  
al. 1999 showed....".



Accepted papers may be presented either as a poster or an oral  
presentation in the workshop, being published in the workshop  
proceedings. Besides, selected papers will be published in a special  
issue of the Language Resources and Evaluation (http://www.springerlink.com/content/1574-020X 
) journal  with further expansion.
