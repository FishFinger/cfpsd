Meeting Description:

Following the success of the conferences in 2005 and 2006, we are pleased to
announce the third Lancaster University Postgraduate Conference in Linguistics
and English Language. Last year, 27 speakers from both UK and foreign
universities presented on a wide range of topics over the course of the day. The
conference will be opened by Professor Anna Siewierska. In addition, we are
pleased to announce Professor Mick Short and Professor Martin Bygate as the

postgraduate students, from Lancaster, and other UK or international
universities, with an opportunity to present their work and share their ideas in
Lancaster's dynamic research environment. There is also the possibility for
students to do poster presentations on request.

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2008

Conference talks are expected to focus on various points on the continuum in the
cognitive linguistic agenda, ranging from the study of the universal to the
study of variation in space and time, between the individual and the society.

Cognitive Linguistics 
between Universality and Variation 

Dubrovnik (Croatia)
September 30 - October 1, 2008

organized by
University of Zagreb
University of Osijek

Key-Note Speakers:
Antonio Barcelona (University of Murcia)
Hubert Cuyckens (Catholic University of Leuven)
Zoltán Kövecses (Loránd Eötvös University, Budapest)
Ronald Langacker (University of California at San Diego)
Klaus-Uwe Panther (University of Hamburg)
Günter Radden (University of Hamburg)
Francisco José Ruiz de Mendoza Ibáñez (University of La Rioja)
Linda Thornburg (University of Hamburg)

Organizing Committee:
Milena ?ic Fuchs (University of Zagreb)
Mario Brdar (University of Osijek)
Hubert Cuyckens (Catholic University of Leuven)
Zoltán Kövecses (Loránd Eötvös University, Budapest)
Ronald Langacker (University of California at San Diego)
Klaus-Uwe Panther (University of Hamburg)
Günter Radden (University of Hamburg)
Linda Thornburg (University of Hamburg)

The Scope of the Conference:
One of the core assumptions of cognitive linguistics is that large areas of
language are motivated by the facts of human embodiment (physical, cognitive and
social), i.e. by how these are reflected in cognitive structures, primarily
through mechanisms such as conceptual metaphors and metonymies. So far,
cognitive linguists have ''naturally'' exhibited more interest in demonstrating
cross-linguistic similarities. If much of what we consider to be the central
facts of human embodiment is shared by humans, and is therefore universal, we
should expect human languages to be, if not the same, then at least extremely
similar. In actual fact, the cognitive linguistic success in uncovering all that
''hidden'' systematicity and universality was long (and often still is)
advertised as one of its major comparative advantages over other approaches. It
seems that this bias towards stressing the universal aspects of language, often
based on conscious introspection and decontextualized data, may have been
necessary while the cognitive linguistic movement was profiling itself against
the background of the formal-generative framework from which it emerged and
emancipating itself from the then prevalent objectivist philosophical atmosphere
in and around linguistics. However, it has now gradually come to be felt that
this bias is a potential obstacle to the development of cognitive linguistics.
Attempts to readdress this situation, heralded by the rise of usage-based models
as envisaged by Langacker, are now becoming more and more conspicuous. Witness
thus the theme session at ICLC 2001 organized by Panther and Thornburg (How
universal are conceptual metonymies?), which resulted in a special issue of the
journal Jezikoslovlje in 2003; or the special issue of the International Journal
of English Studies (edited by Rojo & Valenzuela) in 2003, devoted to the
interaction between cognitive linguistics and contrastive linguistics; or
Kövecses's 2005 monograph entitled Metaphor and Culture, Universality and
Variation. Similarly, cognitive linguistics undergoes a test by fire as it now
meets corpus linguistics and sociolinguistics (cf. theme sessions at ICLC in
Logroño 2003, and Krakow 2007).

The organizers invite papers reporting substantial, original, and unpublished
research in the following areas:
- cognitive corpus linguistics
- usage-based and constructional approaches to linguistic phenomena
- cognitive approach to language contrasts and contacts (and linguistic typology)
- cognitive sociolinguistics and discourse analysis
- diachronic cognitive linguistics

Abstract Submission:
Apart from the key-note speeches, the conference programme will consist of
20-minute papers followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer session. The
organizers invite proposals addressing issues within the scope of the
conference. The deadline for submitting abstracts (maximum 500 words) is April
15th, 2008. Abstracts should be submitted online using the online submission
system, available at http://www.ffzg.hr/cogling/. All abstracts will be subject
to a blind refereeing process. 

Registration, Conference Fees and Practical Information:
The conference fee will be 50. Modes of payment to be announced. The fee includes:
- conference pack
- coffee break refreshments
- welcoming party
The second circular, which will contain further information on the conference
venue, accommodation, transportation, as well as the provisional program of the
conference, will be sent out by mid July 2008.
