I don't mind calling it off, although the paper does raise some interesting 
topics that it would have been neat to think about before ALTA submission (e.g. 
logistic regression, which seems to pop up everywhere; explicit feature 
combination in using machine learners).  Then I can (1) go and visit my dad in 
hospital, and (2) go home to bed, cough a lot, drink lots of tea, and feel sorry 
for myself.
