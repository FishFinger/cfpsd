                           * * * Proposal deadline: Oct 30, 2009 * * *

The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the
International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) invite
proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with one of the three
2010 flagship conferences in computational linguistics: NAACL HLT 2010,
ACL 2010 and COLING 2010. We solicit proposals on any topic of interest
to the ACL/ICCL community. Workshops will be held at one of the
following conference venues:

    * NAACL HLT 2010 is the 11th annual meeting of the North American
chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. It will be
held in Los Angeles, June 1-6, 2010. The dates for the NAACL HLT
workshops will be June 5-6. The webpage for NAACL HLT 2010 is:
http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/.
    * The 48th annual meeting of the ACL (ACL 2010) will be held in
Uppsala, July 11-16, 2010. The ACL workshops will be held July 15-16.
The webpage for ACL 2010 is http://acl2010.org/.
    * The 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics
(COLING 2010) will be held in Beijing, August 23-27, 2010. There will be
pre-conference workshops on August 21-22, and post-conference workshops
on August 28. The webpage for the conference is:
http://www.coling-2010.org/.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

As in 2009, we will coordinate the submission and reviewing of workshop
proposals for all three ACL/ICCL 2010 conferences.

Proposals for workshops should contain:

    * A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic
and content.
    * The desired workshop length (one or two days), and an estimate of
the audience size.
    * The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research
interests and areas of expertise.
    * A list of potential members of the program committee, with an
indication of which members have already agreed.
    * A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.
    * A description of special requirements for technical needs.
    * A venue preference specification.

The venue preference specification should list the venues at which the
organizers would be willing to present the workshop (NAACL HLT, ACL, or
COLING). A proposal may specify one, two, or three acceptable workshop
venues; if more than one venue is acceptable, the venues should be
preference-ordered. There will be a single workshop committee,
coordinated by the three sets of workshop chairs. This single committee
will review the quality of the workshop proposals. Once the reviews are
complete, the workshop chairs will work together to assign workshops to
each of the three conferences, taking into account the location
preferences given by the proposers.

The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find the ACL's
general policies on workshops at
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshop-support-general-po=
licy.html,
the financial policy for workshops at
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshop-conf-financial-pol=
icy.html,
and the financial policy for SIG workshops at
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/Workshops/workshops-Sig-financial-pol=
icy.html.

This year we will be using the START system for submission and reviewing
of workshop proposals. Please submit proposals to
https://www.softconf.com/a/ACLWorkshops2010 no later than 12 Midnight,
Pacific Standard Time, October 30, 2009.

Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no later
than November 20, 2009. Since the three ACL/ICCL conferences will occur
at different times, the timescales for the submission and reviewing of
workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be
different for the three conferences. Suggested timescales for each of
the conferences are given below.
