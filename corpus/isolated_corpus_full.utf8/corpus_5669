Call For Papers - HCSNet Workshop on Movement and Motion Capture

This two-day workshop will be held on 25th-26th September 2009 at Macquarie University, Sydney, and will focus on the science of human movement, motion capture and cognition in action. The workshop will also provide opportunity for participants to engage in demonstrations and tutorials using Vicon facilities housed in Macquarie University's Music, Sound and Performance (MSP) Laboratory and Optotrak equipment in the Action and Cognition Laboratory housed in the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science (MACCS). Potential themes of the workshop include: perception/action (how perceptual systems interact with motor systems); decision processes and action (how analysing movements can inform our understanding of decision processes); expert performance (movement used in skilled performance, e.g., athletic/musical/driving/surgery); social aspects of movement (gestures in social interaction; facial expressions; emotional communication); language and movement (visual speech research); a!
 
 nd methods for data acquisition and analysis; (Functional Data Analysis; Principal Component Analysis and guided PCA; tools for visualizing captured data; rigid and non-rigid motion).

There will be keynote presentations by Professor Michael J. Spivey from the University of California (Merced) and Professor Petri Toiviainen from the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤. We aim to bring together researchers, students, educators and clinicians from the disciplines and sub-disciplines of perception, speech, neuroscience, neuropsychology, developmental psychology, music technology, music perception, music cognition, music production, theatre and gesture studies, movement, gait, visual cognition and statistics, to investigate movement as a way of informing our understanding of human cognition.
