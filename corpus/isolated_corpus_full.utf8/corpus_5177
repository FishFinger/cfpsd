Call for Papers
Workshop on Use of Context in Vision Processing (UCVP)

http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/ucvp09  

in conjunction with
Eleventh International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces and
Workshop on Machine Learning for Multi-modal Interaction (ICMI-MLMI
2009)

http://icmi2009.acm.org/ 
Boston, USA, November 2-6, 2009
 

Background. The Workshop on Use of Context in Vision Processing (UCVP)
offers a timely opportunity for the exchange of recent work on
employing contextual information in problems of Computer
Vision. Recent efforts in defining ambient intelligence applications
based on user-centric concepts, the advent of technology in different
sensing modalities, as well as the expanding interest in multi-modal
information fusion, situation-aware and dynamic vision processing
algorithms have created a common motivation across different research
disciplines to utilize context as a key enabler of
application-oriented vision. Improved robustness, efficient use of
sensing and computing resources, dynamic task assignment to different
operating modules, as well as adaptation to event and user behavior
models are among the benefits a vision processing system can gain
through the utilization of contextual information.

Aims and scope. UCVP aims to address the opportunities in
incorporating contextual information in algorithm design for single or
multi-camera vision systems, as well as systems in which vision is
complemented with other sensing modalities, such as audio, motion,
proximity, occupancy, and others. The objective of the workshop is to
gather high-quality contributions describing leading-edge research in
the use of context in vision processing. The workshop further aims to
stimulate interaction among the participants through a panel
discussion.

Topics of interest to the workshop include:

* Sources of context (multi-camera networks, multi-modal sensing
  systems, long-term observation, behavior models, spatial or temporal
  relationships of objects and events, interaction of user with
  objects, internet resources as knowledge-base for context
  extraction)

* User-centric context (demographic information, activity, user's
  emotional state, stated preferences, explicit and implicit
  interfaces, interaction between users)

* Uses of context (context-driven event interpretation, active vision,
  multi-modal activation, service provision and switching based on
  context, response and interaction with user, detection of abnormal
  behavior, active sensing, task assignment to different sensing
  modules, guided vision based on high-level reasoning, user behavior
  modeling, applications in smart environments, human-computer
  interfaces)

The workshop aims to encourage collaboration between researchers in
different areas of computer vision and related disciplines. In
addition, by introducing topics of emerging applications in smart
environments, multi-camera networks, and multi-modal sensing as
sources of context in vision, the workshop aims to extend the notion
of context-based vision processing to include high-level and
application-driven information extraction and fusion.

Paper submission. The workshop solicits original and unpublished
papers that address a wide range of issues concerning the use of
context in vision processing. Authors should submit papers not
exceeding six (6) pages in total in ACM format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html). Submissions must
be sent in PDF to the following email address: ucvp@cs.utwente.nl.

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and will appear in
the ACM Digital Libraries. A hardcopy proceedings will be available
during the workshop. At least one author of each paper must register
and attend the workshop to present the paper.

Important dates.
Paper submission: July 15, 2009
Author notification: September 1, 2009
Camera-ready due: September 25, 2009
Workshop: November 5, 2009

Registration. Please note that registration is needed in order to
include an accepted paper to the proceedings. Please refer to the main
ICMI 2009 website for more details.
