                          Workshop on 
          Empirical Challenges and Analytic Alternatives 
                  to Strict Compositionality 
 
        URL: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~fr/esslli/05/ 
 
                       August 8-12, 2005 
 
                     organized as part of 
      European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information 
          ESSLLI 2005 http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/ 
                  8-19 August, 2005 in Edinburgh 
 
 
                     Workshop Purpose 
 
Compositionality has been a key methodological theme in natural 
language semantics. Recently, a number of innovative systems for 
combinatorial semantics have been proposed which seem not to obey 
compositionality at first sight. Such systems are based on 
unification, underspecification, linear logic or categorial grammar, 
to name the most prominent research areas. The motivation behind these 
systems is often computational, but the mechanisms they employ also 
provide new insights and analytical alternatives for outstanding 
problems in the combinatorial semantics of natural languages. These 
include scope ambiguities, multiple exponents of semantic operators, 
cohesion, ellipsis, coordination, and modifier attachment ambiguities. 
 
The workshop aims to provide a forum for advanced PhD students and 
researchers whose interests lie in empirical issues or logic. It will 
give them the opportunity to present and discuss their work with 
colleagues and researchers who work in the broad subject areas 
represented at ESSLLI. We wish to invite papers discussing linguistic 
data which pose a challenge to compositionality as well as papers 
presenting new mechanisms for defining a compositional semantics which 
can address well-known challenges in innovative ways. 
 
                       Workshop Topics 
 
Topics for submission may include but are not limited to: 
 
    * presentations of certain empirical phenomena which seem to challenge  
      strict compositionality. Empirical papers should point out precisely  
      why the discussed phenomenon poses analytical problems. 
    * presentations of semantic formalisms. This type of presentation should  
      stress the potential usefulness of the proposal for the analysis of  
      empirical challenges. 
    * papers which combine the empirical and formal aspects directly. 
 
                     Submission Details 
 
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract for a 30-minute 
presentation (followed by 15 minutes of discussion). 
 
Submissions should 
 
    * not exceed 8 (eight) pages, including all figures and references. 
    * be in pdf (preferred), ps or ASCII. 
    * be sent electronically to manfred.sailer@phil.uni-goettingen.de  
      by March 9, 2005 (see the deadlines listed below). 
    * be anonymous and, therefore, accompanied by a separate 
      information sheet containing: author name(s), affiliation(s), 
      e-mail and postal address(es), and the title of the paper. 
 
The submissions will be reviewed anonymously by the workshop's 
programme committee and additional reviewers. The accepted papers will 
appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The final 
versions will be 15 pages, in pdf format. Details will be specified on 
the workshop homepage 
(http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~fr/esslli/05/). 
 
                        Workshop Format 
 
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI 
participants. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over 
five sonsecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 
slots for paper presentation and discussion per session. On the first 
day the workshop organizers will give an introduction to the topic.

                    Local Arrangements 
 
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to 
register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a 
paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker 
registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants 
will be made available by the Organization Committee on a competitive 
basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those. 
 
There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and 
accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding 
funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for the 
possibilities for a grant.
