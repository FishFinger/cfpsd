Full Title: CORPUS 


Linguistic Field(s): Morphology;Syntax;Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2009 

Call for papers for the next issue of CORPUS: 'Corpus Syntax'.

CORPUS is an international journal, published once a year in a paper
version as well as in a free online version (six months later). Its
articles are reviewed by a scientific committee.
CORPUS investigates all the aspects of corpus linguistics: theoretical,
epistemological, and methodological, whatever linguistic field and language.
The successive issues of the journal aim at developing an in-depth
reflection on the role corpora hold in contemporary linguistic research
along with a reflexive analysis on the collection and implementation of the
mentioned corpora.
Concomitantly, the heuristic processes uniting the gathering and the
structuring of empirical data on the one hand, and the emergence or the
validation of the linguistic hypotheses on the other hand, are also sought
to be evaluated and made explicit.

The previous issues are available at: http://corpus.revues.org/

The articles can be written in French, English, and possibly in Spanish or
Italian.

The aim of this issue is to promote syntactic and morpho-syntactic research
based on the study of corpora (whatever field of application), to highlight
its peculiarities and to consider its consequences on the theory
(confirmation or invalidation of certain hypotheses, new proposals).

Deadlines:
- Submission (title + abstract): 15th November 2009
- Committee's conditional notification to the authors: December 2009
- Full length (however provisional) version of the article: 1st March 2010
- Committee's final notification (acceptance/rejection): 30th April 2010
- Final version: 30th June 2010
- Publication of the paper version: October 2010

Submissions should be sent to: olivieri@unice.fr
