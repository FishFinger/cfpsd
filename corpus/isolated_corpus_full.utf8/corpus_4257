The Italian Department of the University of Cambridge is happy to announce that
the 4th Cambridge Italian Dialect Syntax Meeting will take place at the
University of Cambridge on 29th-30th June 2009. The meeting aims to bring

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes for discussion) on
any aspect of the syntax or morphology of the dialects of Italy. The conference
languages are English and Italian. Authors are asked to send their abstracts as
e-mail attachments (pdf or rtf formats) to Adam Ledgeway at anl21@cam.ac.uk. The
abstract should include the title, but not the author's name(s). The title of
the paper, name of the author(s), affiliation(s), address, phone number, and
e-mail address should be included in the e-mail message. Abstracts should be no
longer than two pages in length (including examples and references), in 12-point
type. Abstracts should arrive no later than 20 March 2009. Speakers will be
notified of the results of their abstract review during April 2009.

Date: 23-Apr-2009 - 25-Apr-2009
Location: York, N. Yorkshire, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Helen Goodluck
Meeting Email: synwork@events.york.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): Psycholinguistics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

A workshop meeting on the role of processing capacity in shaping syntactic
systems and formal vs. processing explanations of syntactic phenomena. 

Call for Papers

Workshop on syntactic parsing capacity, and formal vs. processing explanations
of syntactic phenomena

Confirmed presenters include:  Alan Baddeley, Lyn Frazier, Ted Gibson, Philip
Hofmeister, Colin Philips, Ivan Sag and Laurie Stowe.

One page abstracts are invited for papers and posters for a meeting at York
University, UK, April 23-25 2009. Abstracts on any area of the relationship
between   capacity limitations (linguistic memory capacity, etc), parsing and
syntactic theory are welcome.  We want to attract abstracts that address topics
such as:  How does parsing capacity shape syntactic systems? Are particular
syntactic phenomena better explained in processing terms than formal theoretical
terms, and vice versa? We are particularly interested in abstracts in the areas
of pronoun interpretation, the processing of long distance dependencies and
language typology.  

Please indicate if you wish to present as a paper or poster, or as either.  Send
two copies, one anonymous and one with name and affiliation, in PDF format.
Send abstracts/queries to:  synwork@events.york.ac.uk. Deadline: March 1 2009
