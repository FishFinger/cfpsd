Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

SECOND GLOBAL STUDIES CONFERENCE      
Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates      
30 May to 1 June 2009      
http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com

The Global Studies Conference and Global Studies Journal are devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization - from many points of view, many locations in the world, and in a wide-angle kaleidoscopic fashion.

As well as an impressive line-up of international main speakers, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed Global Studies Journal. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic Journal.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 11 September 2009.  Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date.  Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Conference website - http://www.GlobalStudiesConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Dubai in 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Jan Nederveen Pieterse      
University of Illinois, Urbana, USA      
For the Advisory Board, Global Studies Conference and Journal
