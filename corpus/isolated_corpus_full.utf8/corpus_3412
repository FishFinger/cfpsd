=====================================================================

We invite you to attend the 2008 International RuleML Symposium on Rule
Interchange and Applications (RuleML-2008) to be held during October 30-31,
2008 in Orlando, Florida. As this is a relatively new event, being only its
2nd year, participants can make a difference about shaping the future
direction and structure of the field, including about rule standards
supporting their own approaches and about their own possible involvement in
the organization of future events.

Co-located with the 11th International Business Rules Forum, RuleML-2008
provides a unique opportunity to exchange your ideas about practical
distributed rule technologies and rule-based applications. Meet the Web 
rules
experts and discuss with them status and progress of the rules technology.
Discuss your recent work with colleagues in the informal atmosphere of the
symposium. You should not miss the high-quality technical presentations, the
innovative applications presented in detail and the state of the art reports
of the plenary speakers. RuleML-2008 is a must for all people active in 
rules
technologies or entering the field.

The scope of RuleML-2008 covers all topics relevant to rule-based
technologies, rule interchange formats and rule-based applications as 
well as
discussions of lessons learned that have to be taken into account when
employing rule-based technologies in distributed, (partially) open,
heterogeneous environments.


=======================
Technical Program
=======================

The symposium will feature a strong, single-track technical program
consisting of:

* Keynote speakers:
  o Michael Kifer (State University of New York at Stony Brook), on "Rule
    Interchange Format: Not Just Syntax".
    Joint keynote between RuleML-2008 and RR2008.
  o David Luckham (Stanford University, USA) on "The Power of Events: An
    Introduction to Complex Event Processing in Distributed Enterprise
    Systems".
  o Paul Haley (Haley Systems, Inc) on "Event and Process Semantics will
    Rule".
  o Benjamin Grosof (Vulcan, Inc.) on the SILK KRR system of the
    HALO project.
* Joint Lunch Panel held in conjunction with the co-located Business Rules
  Forum on "Rules on the Web".
* Lightning talks/Highlight talks
* A RuleML-2008 Challenge with prizes to demonstrate tools, use cases, and
  applications.
* Industry, demo and scientific research & development papers and
  presentations advancing and assessing the state of the art in event and
  rule-based systems selected in a peer-reviewed fashion by an
  international program committee.
* Papers will be published as a Springer LNCS proceedings. A special issue
  (IEEE TKDE pending) will be forthcoming.
* Social events to promote networking among the symposium delegates in an
  informal setting.
