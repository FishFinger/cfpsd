                              2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

  Special Issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing
(IJSC)
                        on Ambient Semantic Computing

Guest Editors:
- Iryna Gurevych   (Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab,
                    Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany)
- Max Muehlhaeuser (Telecooperation Division,
                    Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany)

This special issue of the International Journal of Semantic Computing
(IJCS
www.worldscinet.com/ijsc) is concerned with novel methods, algorithms,
and
concepts which fruitfully combine ambient intelligence and semantic
technologies, called ambient semantic computing.

By 'ambient intelligence', we refer to distributed, mobile, and
ubiquitous
computing approaches that emphasize the dawning era of networked anytime
-
anywhere computers, which users wear and encounter in everyday life -
without perceiving them as computers. Context-aware computing,
multimodal
and tangible interaction, and smart environments are examples for
relevant
research fields in ambient intelligence.

By 'semantic technologies', we refer to natural language processing
(NLP),
knowledge related research, and computer perception approaches (e.g.
handwriting and speech recognition, computer vision, multimedia
analysis,
situation detection, etc.) that target human understanding of the
perceived media. Examples of relevant NLP technologies are spoken
dialogue interfaces, natural language information search, question
answering, and NLP-based methods in service or software discovery,
composition or maintenance.

We are convinced that the vision of ambient intelligence, i.e., a world
of
omnipresent, hidden computers that truly aid human beings can only be
achieved if these computers can deal with concepts that reflect human
understanding and common sense. Therefore, the _smartness_ of ambient
intelligence must be combined with the _naturalism_ of semantic
technologies.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
* language-based and multimodal human-computer interfaces for
  ambient intelligence
* combinations of distributed systems and natural language processing
  technologies to support knowledge work
* unstructured information management methods for semantically
  enabled software
* next generation public security based on ambient intelligence and
  semantic technologies
* situational context used to improve information management and NLP
  context used for context-sensitive ubiquitous computing
* combining human and computer-based trust, privacy, reliability etc.
* concepts and methods, resources and tools for the development of
  ambient semantic computing systems.
