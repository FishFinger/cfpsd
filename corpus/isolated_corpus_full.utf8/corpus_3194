Subject: CFP for Video Mining 2008

Call for Papers
With cameras become pervasive in our daily life, vast amounts of videos are
generated in different aspects of our

society every day. The popularity of YouTube-like websites is one of strong
evidences for this. How to effectively

analyze and use the already huge, rapidly growing video data is one of main
challenges we are facing. Video

processing and analysis techniques become more and more important in the
field of computer vision and image

understanding and other related areas. There are wide-rage potential
video-based applications in many areas

including multimedia, human computer interface, security and surveillance,
copyright protection, personal

entertainment, to name a few.

Video mining is to discover and describe interesting patterns in video data=
,
which has become one of the core

problem areas of the data mining research community.  Compared to the minin=
g
of other types of data (e.g., text),

video mining is still in its infancy, and an under-explored field. There ar=
e
many challenging research problems

facing video mining. For example, how to discover knowledge from
spatial-temporal data, how to infer high-level

semantic concepts from low-level features extracted from videos, how to mak=
e
use of unlabeled data. Applying

general data mining techniques for video data will face a number of
difficulties as well, because of the need to

analyze large amount of high-dimensional data. To address these challenges,
we have to adapt the existing data

mining theory or algorithm for video data, or find new techniques and
approaches suitable for video data.

This one-day workshop seeks to present and highlight the latest development=
s
in video data mining and video-based

applications. It aims to bring together worldwide researchers from related
disciplines, to provide a forum for the

dissemination of significant research work and innovative practice, and to
encourage exchanges, interactions and

possible collaboration between participants.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to,
=95 Video clustering and categorization
=95 Video based object recognition
=95 Video segmentation and summarization
=95 Video feature extraction and representation
=95 Video indexing and retrieval
=95 Video search engines
=95 Video editing and browsing systems
=95 Visual event and activity detection
=95 Statistical techniques for video analysis
=95 Semantic video content analysis
=95 Video processing for HCI
=95 Video surveillance (person identification, abnormal activity labeling =
=85)
=95 Consumer video applications (sports highlight detection, commercial
message extraction =85)

Important dates
Submission deadline:   August 1, 2008
Notification of acceptance: September 15, 2008
Camera-ready due:   October 7, 2008
Workshop:    December 19, 2008

Paper Submission
=95 In submitting a manuscript to this workshop, the authors acknowledge th=
at
no paper substantially similar

in content has been submitted to another conference, workshop, or journal.
=95 As tradition at ICDM, a "forward to workshops" mechanism will be adopte=
d
this year, where a paper not

accepted for the main ICDM conference can be (at the author's request)
"fast-tracked" to this workshop, preserving

reviews.
=95 The format of the paper is the same as the ICDM main conference paper.
Please follow the instructions on

the website http://icdm08.isti.cnr.it/. The review process will be
double-blind.
=95 For the paper submission, please follow the link (To be announced by IC=
DM
2008).

Review and publication
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three reviewers from program
committee members and external reviewers

for originality, significance, clarity, soundness, relevance and technical
contents. Accepted papers will be

published by IEEE in the workshop proceedings of ICDM 2008, and will be
invited to submit in the extended form to

an edited book (Springer) by the organizers and/or a journal special issue
after conference.

Registration
At least one author for each paper needs to register to ICDM 2008.  There i=
s
no separate registration for the

workshop. The main conference registration covers everything.

Contact
Any information or inquiries regarding the workshop can be forwarded to:
<caifeng [dot] shan [at] gmail [dot] com> or
<dacheng [dot] tao [at] gmail [dot] com>.
