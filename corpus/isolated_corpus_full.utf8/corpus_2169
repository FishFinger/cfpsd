Call for Chapters
(Manuscript Proposal Submission Deadline: January 15, 2008)

Testing and Assessment in Translation and Interpreting
Editors: Angelelli, Claudia  and Jacobson, Holly E. 


Introduction
Translation and interpreting (T&I) are fields of inquiry supported by
substantial scholarship. The notion of quality, whether at initial
acquisition levels (e.g. translation and/or interpreting classrooms) or at
more advanced ones (e.g. professional interpreting or translation), is
central to T&I. A great deal of research has focused on quality in
theoretical terms, such as adequacy and acceptability. However, little
empirical research has been conducted on measuring translator and
interpreter competence and performance, assessing the translation process,
or determining the quality of final target language products. This book
will include a collection of papers which explore issues of testing and
assessment in translation and interpreting across languages and settings
(including university classrooms, research settings, the private sector,
and professional associations), with a focus on both processes and products. 

Overall Objectives
The main purpose of this collective volume is to provide insights into
translation and interpreting measures currently being researched and
implemented in educational and professional settings. Contributing authors
will provide high-quality research, industry, and practice manuscripts on
testing and assessment. Topics will deal with measures that have been
produced and implemented in educational settings, such as process
evaluation approaches, achievement testing, testing for program admission,
and testing for classroom placement. Authors will also explore translation
and interpreting assessment as used by consumers (e.g. field testing and
translation quality control), and by professional associations that offer
certification.

Intended Audience: Researchers and academicians; translator and interpreter
trainers and educators; translation and interpreting professional
organizations; professionals in the private and public sector.

Recommended Topics and Themes

This book will host original papers on all aspects of translation and
interpreting testing and assessment. Submissions must not duplicate work
that any of the authors has published elsewhere or submitted in parallel to
any other conference or workshop with proceedings.
Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

- The construct of translation/interpreting competence and its measurement
- Assessment of translation/interpreting performance
- Assessment of translation/interpreting products
- The development of measurement tools
- Validity/reliability in T&I testing
- Materials development/selection for T&I testing
- T&I rubrics
- Grader selection/training
- The role of graders
- Grader training

Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit a 2 to 3 page proposal
abstract (approximately 500 words) on or before January 15, 2007. The
abstract will clearly explain the mission and concerns of the proposed
chapter, as well as detail the main argument, theoretical/analytical
framework, data collection, study site, etc.
Authors will be notified by January 31, 2008 about the status of their
submissions and will be sent chapter organizational guidelines. Complete
manuscripts are expected to be submitted by April 30, 2008. This book will
be published by John Benjamins Publishing Company in the ATA Monograph series.
