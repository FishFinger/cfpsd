Call for Papers

Elsevierâs Information Systems Journal

Special Issue on âVocabularies, Ontologies and Rules for Enterprise
and Business Process Modeling and Managementâ

http://www.sfu.ca/~dgasevic/cfps/IS_VORTE/

Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules are key components of a
model-driven approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy.
Enterprise vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules do not exist
in isolation but serve to support business processes. While many have
recognized the importance of vocabularies, ontologies, and business
rules in business process modeling and management, there are many open
research challenges to be addressed. These challenges can be
approached from different perspectives. Fundamental research explores
ontological foundations and languages and methods for enterprise and
business process modeling. It also covers ontological evaluation of
enterprise systems and their interoperability, and ontological
analysis of business process modeling. Applied research looks into
enhancing business rule engines and business process management
systems by ontologies. Business process modeling research aims to
define how process modeling and execution languages, such as Business
Process Modeling Notation and Business Process Execution Language,
relate to business ontologies and rules. Enterprise integration and
collaboration research addresses ontology-based service description
technologies for inter-enterprise collaboration. This special issue
solicits papers focussed on the described research areas. The topics
to be covered by submissions include but are not limited to the
following:

Â· Conceptual modeling

o Ontological foundations for enterprise and business process modeling
o Languages and methods for business vocabularies, terminologies, and
  taxonomies
o Modeling of enterprise information integration and interoperability
o Languages for conceptual modeling (for example, OWL and UML)
o Agent-oriented conceptual modeling

Â· Business rule and business process modeling

o Analysis of and experiences with OMGâs Semantics of Business
  Vocabularies and Rules (SBVR)
o Rule modeling and rule markup
o Rule-based approaches to Web service policies and choreographies
o Agent-based business rule and process management
o Integrating business rules with business process modeling and
  execution languages (for example, BPMN and BPML)

Â· Ontologies for enterprise systems

o Ontological approaches to content and knowledge management
o Ontologies for e-business registries/repositories
o Web service ontologies
o Ontological evaluation of enterprise systems
o Ontology-based enterprise architectures
o Ontology-based software engineering for enterprise solutions

Â· Model-driven engineering approaches in enterprise systems

o Modeling and architecture frameworks
o Domain engineering
o Domain-specific business information and system engineering
o Model transformations in enterprise and business process modeling
