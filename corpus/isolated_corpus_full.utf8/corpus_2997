Call for Papers

International Conference on Quotation and Meaning (ICQM) 

Date: 16-Oct-2008 - 18-Oct-2008

Location: Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS), Berlin, Germany

Local Organisation: Hans-Martin Gärtner, Elke Kasimir, Manfred Krifka, Uli
Sauerland, Mathias Schenner  

Contact : icqm2@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Description:
Quotation phenomena have attracted the attention of linguists, philosophers,
logicians and literary scholars for many years since they touch elementary
issues of our understanding of language, including the semantics-pragmatics
distinction, compositionality, the language-metalanguage distinction, context
dependency and expressive meaning. But only recently a broader interdisciplinary
discussion about the nature of quotation phenomena has emerged. This Second
International Conference on Quotation and Meaning will have a focus on ''context
shift'' as a theoretical construct for the analysis of various quotation and
quotation-related phenomena. If a context is ''shifted'', information relevant
for the interpretation of an utterance which is usually extracted from the
circumstance of the utterance is instead extracted from a merely hypothetical or
even counterfactual circumstance, the classical example being shifted first
person pronouns. We call for high-quality papers which address aspects of
quotation phenomena, aspects of context shift, or both. Since the aim of the
conference is to bring together philosophers and linguists, we call for papers
on all aspects of the conference topic, which will be reviewed anonymously.
Submissions: Authors should submit an abstract of at most 500 words, 12 font
size, in PDF format (for talks with a duration of 30' plus 10' discussion) via
e-mail to icqm2@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Pranav Anand (UC Santa Cruz)
Ann Banfield (UC Berkeley)
Angelika Kratzer (University of Massachusetts, Amherst)
Francois Recanati (Institut Nicod, Paris)
Thomas Ede Zimmermann (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt/M)

Barbara Partee (University of Massachusetts, Amherst)
