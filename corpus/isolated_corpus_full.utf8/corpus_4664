Meeting Description:

Conferences of the series 'Cognitive Modeling' have been held with success since
1998. In 2000 the direction was specified as 'Cognitive Modeling in 
Linguistics' (CML). In 1998 and 2000 CML conferences were held as a part of the 
Russian National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI), in 2001 as a part 
of the International Congress on Artificial Intelligence (ICAI-2001), which took
place in Divnomorskoe (Russia). In 2002 the CML conference was held in 
Divnomorskoe, as a part of the IEEE International Conference 'Artificial 
Intelligence Systems' (IEEE AIS'02). From 2003 to 2007 CML conferences took 
place in Bulgaria (Varna and Sofia), while in 2008 the Conference was conducted 
in Bechichi, Montenegro. The new, XI-th Conference (CML-2009) is planned at the
Black Sea Resort in the hotel Golden Tulip Mamaia 4* (Fantasy Beach) near 
Constantza in Romania.

Lomonosov's Moscow State University), an Exhibition of Cognitively-Oriented 
Computer Applications and Linguistic Resources (organized by the National

Institute (Technological University).

The aim of the conference is to integrate the work of specialists in cognitive 
science, cognitive psychology, learning theory, neural network theory, cognitive
linguistics, knowledge engineering, semiotics, psycholinguistics, etc. The
