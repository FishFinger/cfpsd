Meeting Description:

IPCITI 2009
5th International Postgraduate Conference in Translation and Interpreting
http://www.sml.hw.ac.uk/events/ipciti/
=20
We are pleased to announce the Fifth International Postgraduate Conference =
in Translation and Interpreting (IPCITI 2009) which will take place at Heri=
ot-Watt University, Edinburgh, on 21-22 November 2009.

IPCITI 2009 is the fifth in a series of postgraduate conferences which mark=
s the consolidation of a series of international conferences organised in c=
ollaboration between the University of Edinburgh, Dublin City University, t=
he University of Manchester and Heriot-Watt University. The aim of IPCITI 2=
009 is to promote greater participation in translation and interpreting res=
earch and address salient issues in the field, and to promote a supportive =
environment in which young researchers can exchange ideas on current themes=
 and issues in Translation Studies. =20

Because our event is intended for all students from the discipline of trans=
lation and interpreting studies, we have chosen to keep it widely focused s=
o that delegates are invited to submit abstracts from all areas relating to=
 translation and interpreting studies.

Keynote Speakers:

-Dr. Cecilia Wadensj=F6 Associate researcher at Link=F6ping University in L=
ink=F6ping, Sweden.=20
-Prof. Christina Schaeffner Professor of translation studies at Aston Unive=
rsity in Birmingham, UK. She is the Aston representative on the National Ne=
twork for Translation, and a member of the EMT expert group set up by the D=
irectorate General for Translation (DGT) of the European Commission. For se=
veral years, she has also been a member of the international CETRA staff (a=
nnual summer school for PhD students in translation studies).

Call for Papers:

Abstract Submission Guidelines:

As with most conferences, it is inevitable that more abstracts will be subm=
itted than may ultimately be accepted. Here are a few guidelines to those o=
f you wishing to submit abstracts so that you maximise your chances of acce=
ptance:=20
=20
Bear in mind that there is a 300-word limit for abstracts being submitted f=
or consideration by the organising committee. Thus abstracts which exceed t=
his limit will be less likely to be accepted. Abstracts should be sent to i=
pciti2009@gmail.com

If you are not a native speaker of English, it might be a good idea to have=
 someone who is proficient in written academic English read your abstract b=
efore submission. Abstracts which are poorly or unclearly written are obvio=
usly more likely to create a negative impression.=20

Try to avoid providing irrelevant background detail with your abstract. If,=
 for example, the paper you are proposing is concerned with analysing Frenc=
h translations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, avoid opening by emphasis=
ing how important and difficult literary translation is - just get straight=
 into providing a brief and succinct account of the analysis of the Romeo a=
nd Juliet translation which will be the subject of your paper. Bear in mind=
 that the people who will be reading your abstract will all be very familia=
r with the main trends and terminology in Translation Studies.=20

By all means you may include footnotes and bibliographic references with yo=
ur abstract.=20

To save us contacting you again later, it would be a good idea for you to i=
nclude your name, e-mail address, institutional affiliation (i.e. details o=
f the school or department at the college or university where you are study=
ing) and a brief account (up to about 100 words) of your research interests=
, projects you are working on, and notable publications.
=20
Abstract should include only:

1. The title of the paper
2. A list of 3-5 key words describing the area and focus of the paper
3. The research focus
4. The research methodology
5. A brief summary of findings (if applicable)
6. A short list of key references
Please note: 300-word limit does not include points (1), (2) and (6).

Key Dates:

Abstracts must be received by Friday, 31st July 2009
Notification of acceptance: Tuesday, 15th September 2009
=20
Fee:

TBA (payable on registration day)
