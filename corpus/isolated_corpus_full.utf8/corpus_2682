    FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

   LREC 2008 Workshop on

   PARTIAL PARSING
   Between Chunking and Deep Parsing

   Marrakech, Morocco
   1 June 2008

   http://langtech.jrc.it/PaPa2008/

   *Extended* submission deadline: *1 March 2008*

  MOTIVATION
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  Partial parsing has become a standard means of integrating syntactic
  knowledge into high level applications such as information retrieval,
  machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and
  robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep
  parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer
  than chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses:
  partial parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike
  simple chunking) without creating the full parse of a
  sentence. However, partial parsing is not a single concept but rather
  an area ranging from chunking to almost full parsing. This workshop
  will bring together researcher who work on partial parsing in its
  different interpretations.

  SCOPE:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not
  restricted to):

  . linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications:
   syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical
   structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);

  . development methodologies for partial parsers: manual,
   machine learning, hybrid;

  . the usability of language resources for the development of
   partial parsers;

  . multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;

  . experience and utilization of existing tools for building
   partial parsers for new languages;

  . technical aspects of partial parsers:
   . robustness, scalability;
   . time and space complexity;
   . expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs.
   context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);

  . applications of partial parsers: information extraction,
   question answering, machine translation, web text mining,
   acquisition of lexical information, etc.;

  . evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
   application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for
   different partial parsing tasks, etc.;

  . ways of combining multiple partial parsers;

  . comparsion (classification) of partial parsers.

  SUBMISSIONS:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers
  should indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In
  particular, any overlap with previously published work should be
  clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
  novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, and
  significance/relevance to the workshop.

  Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages and they should follow
  the detailed guidelines at the LREC 2008 web page:
  http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/-Submissions-.html.  Submission is
  via the START system, a link to the submission page can be found at
  the workshop page.

  The publication of selected papers in a special issue of a journal is
  planned.
