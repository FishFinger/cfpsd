Emerging Topics in Translation and Interpreting
Nuovi percorsi in traduzione e interpretazione

International conference hosted by the Dipartimento di Scienze del Linguagg=
io,
dell'Interpretazione e della Traduzione (DSLIT) in collaboration with the S=
cuola
Superiore di Lingue Moderne per Interpreti e Traduttori (SSLMIT) University=
 of
Trieste, 16-18 June 2010=20

First Call for Papers


To celebrate the launch of our new Ph.D. programme in Scienze
dell'Interpretazione e della Traduzione (Interpreting and Translation Studi=
es)
and the first thirty years of the Scuola Superiore di Lingue Moderne per
Interpreti e Traduttori as a fully-fledged university faculty, we invite pa=
pers
for an International Conference on Emerging Topics in Translation and
Interpreting / Nuovi percorsi in traduzione e interpretazione. The conferen=
ce
will take place in Trieste on 16, 17 and 18 June 2010 and is organised in f=
ive
sessions. Each corresponds to the main areas of research interest of the me=
mbers
of the DSLIT department and has its own keynote speaker. The sessions are t=
he
following:

1 Translation and interpreting as a human right
In Europe there are hundreds of language communities made up of people who =
often
have little or no knowledge of the language(s) of their country of residenc=
e and
who, in most cases, speak non-indigenous languages, i.e. languages that do =
not
benefit from the protection generally granted to regional and minority
languages. Furthermore, every year thousands of immigrants and asylum-seeke=
rs
come to Europe. All these people have needs and rights. If meeting their ne=
eds
is perhaps just a matter of language mediation, protecting their rights, fr=
om
the point of view of languages, is above all a matter of democracy. Papers =
are
invited on this topic, with particular reference to institutional aspects a=
nd
the role of universities.

2 From interpreting theory to the interpreting profession
Since the Trieste Conference in 1986, the range of conference interpreting
studies has greatly expanded but has not always been accompanied by
investigation into and discussion of research methodologies and techniques.=
 This
session calls for papers on simultaneous and consecutive interpreting resea=
rch
which - besides highlighting methodologies - are aimed at the professional =
world
and the way findings can be applied to conference interpreter training.

3 Translation teaching: bridging theory and the profession
Despite the efforts by scholars to increase the common ground between
translation theory and practice and professionalism becoming a major trend =
in
translation teaching, the idea of theoretical models being of little use to
practitioners persists. Thus between the areas of Translation Studies as an
academic area and professional translation there is still only minimal cont=
act.
Likewise, translator training institutions have often come under attack by
practitioners looking for some theoretical support for the increasing chall=
enges
of their profession. This session aims to bring together translators, trans=
lator
trainers and translation scholars to discuss ways to extend the currently
limited area where their three domains overlap. Contributions should contai=
n
theoretical and empirical perspectives on any theme relevant to bridging th=
e gap
between theory and practice. These may include studies on:
- Issues of ideology, power, culture, quality or ethics in translation prac=
tice
and teaching
- The role of translation theory in motivating and justifying translation s=
trategies
- The role of technology in translation teaching
- Areas of competence of translation teachers vs. professional translators
- Training courses for trainers
- Involvement of academics in translators' associations
- Norms in translation teaching

4 Interpreting corpora
Empirical research on Interpreting is overwhelmingly based on case studies,
which fail to describe regularities in the interpreters' translational and
interactional behaviour. In order to determine what in Descriptive Translat=
ion
Studies are known as "norms", a large body of data is needed. This session
intends to outline the state of the art in the creation of corpora in the f=
ield
of Interpreting, focussing on issues such as collection, transcription, tag=
ging,
querying, usability and comparability of data.

5 The right to see through words: audiodescription
Among the various emerging and challenging topics in the field of audiovisu=
al
translation, audiodescription (a technique that gives access to people who =
are
blind or visually impaired to the visual media) is gaining ground rapidly. =
This
session aims to map the current status of research in this area, and to dra=
w
attention to its social, cognitive, cultural, political and technological
aspects. We are therefore inviting presentations focusing on such issues an=
d
investigating them from either a theoretical or empirical point of view.
