Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

The 16th Annual University of Texas at Arlington Student Conference in
Linguistics and TESOL, March 5 and 6, 2009.

The UTASCILT is a student-run conference in Arlington, TX that provides student
scholars and their colleagues the opportunity to present and share their
linguistic and TESOL research with the larger linguistic community. Students
from all institutions with research in either Linguistics or TESOL are
encouraged to submit an abstract. 

Call for Papers 

Call Deadline: Extended to 31-October-08 
Papers for this conference are invited in all areas of linguistics, including
the area of TESOL and the area of endangered languages.  Our keynote speaker
will be Dr. Colleen Fitzgerald.  Dr. Fitzgerald is the Chair and Associate
Professor of Linguistics at University of Texas at Arlington, and has her Master
of Arts and Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Arizona.  Her work
includes phonological research on the Tohono O'odham language, and most recently
she has been working on documentation and revitalization of the language, using
unpublished archival materials and legacy recordings. This recent research will
drive her keynote lecture, entitled "Language Activism and Revitalization in the
Tohono O'odham Community."  

Students from any educational institution are strongly encouraged to submit
their research and share insights they have discovered in the field. Presenters
can choose between oral and poster presentations. Oral presentations will last
20 minutes with 5 minutes for discussion and questions. An allotment of time
will be set aside for poster presentations and discussion. This is a great
opportunity to develop professional skills! The three best presentations will be
awarded the Yumi Nakamura Memorial Prize in Linguistics (up to $400.00 USD). 
Poster and oral presentations are considered, accepted, and judged as equal
counterparts. 

The deadline for submission of abstracts is Friday, October 31, 2008.
Notifications of acceptance will be distributed in mid November, 2008. Abstracts
should be written on a single page (500 words or less) in Times New Roman, font
12, with one additional page for graphs and/or references. Electronic
submissions are preferred and the text of the e-mail (or title page) should include:
1) your name, 2) affiliation, 3) address, phone number, e-mail address, 4) title
of paper, and 5) type of presentation: oral or poster.  
Please do not include your name on the abstract pages.  

Abstracts should be sent as an attachment in MS Word to utascil@ling.uta.edu.
Please do not submit using an .html or PDF format, as we will need to format the
abstract for inclusion in the abstract booklet.  If you use fonts or symbols
that are unusual, please submit both MS Word and PDF, and we will make sure the
correct symbols appear.  Late submissions will not be accepted.
