Meeting Description: 

Annual Conference of European Association for Computer Assisted Language
Learning (EUROCALL) 

EUROCALL 2009 will take place at Universidad Politécnica de Valencia at their
Gandia Campus, Spain from 9 to 12 September 2009.

Conference Theme: 

New Trends in Computer Assisted Language Learning with a special emphasis on
innovative ways of collaborating and working together in the advancement of
language learning and teaching. 

Sub-themes are an example of the numerous branches that have grown out of the
CALL tree and is an illustration, we think, of the roots that this area has
planted in a collective will to actively contribute towards better understanding
and improving language learning with the assistance of information and
communications technologies. CALL researchers, developers and practitioners are
therefore invited to submit proposals relating to any of the following subthemes
which, we think, summarise current interests and concerns in CALL: 

Curriculum development for CALL 
Assessment, testing, feedback and guidance in CALL 
Pedagogical change in technology integration 
Catering for Less Widely Used and Taught Languages in CALL 
Research in new language learning environments 
Innovative e-learning solutions for languages 
Building national/international partnerships for networked language learning 
New role of writing as a tool for communication 
New developments in multimedia courseware design 
Networked language learning in adult education 
Learning Management Systems 
Mobile Learning 
Virtual Worlds 
Corpora 
CALL supported Content Integrated Language Learning (CLIL) 
Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) 
Computer Assisted Translation 
Formal and informal language learning 

We look forward to welcoming you to the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia at
our Gandia Campus!!
