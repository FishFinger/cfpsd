LTC 2009 - Call for papers and important information

Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to invite you to submit a paper to the Language and=20
Technology Conference 2009, Pozna=C5=84,

Poland, in November 6-8.
I hope to see you in Pozna=C5=84.
Best regards
Zygmunt Vetulani, LTC 2009 Chair

************************************************************************

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language
Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC
2009), a meeting organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer
Science of Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna=C5=84, Poland in cooperation
with the Adam Mickiewicz University Foundation, will take place on
November 6-8, 2009.

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for
computer science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become
an ever more essential element of our everyday technological
environment. Since the very beginning of the Computer and Information
Age these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. The
European Union strongly supports HLT under the 7th Framework
Program. These efforts as well as technological, social and cultural
globalization have created a favorable climate for the intensive
exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across initially
distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange
and invite you to join us at LTC in November 2009, as well as at the
planned FlaReNet workshop (details soon) that will be co-located with
the LTC'09.

Zygmunt Vetulani
LTC 2009 Chair
vetulani@amu.edu.pl

significative):
   - electronic language resources and tools,
   - formalisation of natural languages,

   - language-specific computational challenges for HLTs (especially
     for languages other than English),
   - HLT standards,
   - HLTs as a support for foreign language teaching,

VISAS

Participants from some non-EU countries may need visas to enter
Poland.  Visa delivery is exclusively in competence of the appropriate
Visa Authorities (of Poland or other Schengen countries). If you have
any doubts, we recommend you to check your situation with the nearest
Polish Consulate in your country of residence. If necessary, we can
confirm that we have accepted your paper for presentation at the
conference and that you are expected to present your paper
personally. Upon request, we may also write a confirmation letter (in
Polish) directly to the Polish Consulate indicated by you. To do this
we will need a request letter (e-mail) from you in which you will
provide us with the address of the Consulate you wish us to
contact. To get information about countries whose citizens are not
required to have a visa when entering Poland and to find important
telephone numbers you may also visit the web site of the Polish
Ministry of Foreign

Affairs http://www.msz.gov.pl/index.php?document=3D2 (see Consular
