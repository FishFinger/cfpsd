Overview:
The aim of this workshop is to draw together researchers around the issues of
the empirical analysis, formalisation, and implementation of legal argumentation
in natural language. Such a system would be a decision-support tool which
translates natural language arguments into and out of an argumentation framework
or logic which supports reasoning and inference. As the interface is in natural
language, the tool would be accessible to a wide range of end-users. The
workshop builds on recent advances in natural language engineering and
argumentation including: controlled languages, predictive editors, text mining
and corpus analysis, natural language parsing, ontology construction,
translation of natural language sentences into first order logic, logical
inference, linguistic analysis of argumentation, and computational theories of
argumentation. It draws on an interdisciplinary community in Computer Science,
Linguistics, and the Law.

While argumentation can be addressed in a broad range of areas, the workshop
focuses  particularly on the language, logic, and computation of legal
argumentation such as that found between lawyers arguing a case before a court
or found in legal briefs and decisions where justifications are given for and
against a decision.

Topics of Interest:
Corpus development
Corpus analysis and text mining
Logical analysis of legal language
Automated parsing and translation of natural language arguments into a logical
formalism
Legal argument schemes
Pilot implementations of tools
Defeasible reasoning systems for the law with natural language interfaces
Burden of proof in argumentation
Consistency, inconsistency, and compatibility of statements in the law
Coherence in legal argumentation
The identification of enthymemes (missing premises due to presupposition with
respect to common knowledge and shared knowledge)
Legal argument modification
The generation of legal arguments
Linguistically-orientied XML mark up of legal arguments
Dialogue protocols for argumentation
Legal argument ontology
Legal Ontologies with associated lexical information
Computational theories of argumentation that are suitable to natural language

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
