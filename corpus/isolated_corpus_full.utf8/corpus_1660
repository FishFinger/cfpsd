Hi, Annie,

>       are there  Chinese or English corpora suitable for research on domain
> adaptation for named entity recognition ?

The biomedical NLP community is very interested in issues of domain
adaptation.  There are many NER corpora for a wide range of biomedical
domains and subdomains available at

http://compbio.uchsc.edu/ccp/corpora/obtaining.shtml

You might also be interested in an upcoming session on text mining and
"BioNLP" at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.  One of the foci of
the CFP is portability and domain adaptation--in particular, domain
adaptation by end users, without the requirement that an NLP expert be
involved.  You can view the CFP here, if you'd like more information:

http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-nlp.html

Best wishes,

Kevin Cohen
