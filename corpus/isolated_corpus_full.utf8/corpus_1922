*LREC 2008 -  6th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference*

* SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS*

 

Palais des Congrès Mansour Eddahbi, MARRAKECH - MOROCCO

MAIN CONFERENCE: 28-29-30 MAY 2008

WORKSHOPS and TUTORIALS: 26-27 MAY and 31 MAY- 1 JUNE 2008
Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/  
<http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/>

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation 
(LREC) will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide 
range of international associations and organisations, including AAMT, 
AMTA, ACL, ALTA, COCOSDA and Oriental COCOSDA, EACL, EAMT, ELSNET, 
EURALEX, GWA, IAMT, KnowledgeWeb, LDC, NEMLAR Network, SIGLEX, TEI, 
Technolangue French Program, WRITE and with major national and 
international organisations including the European Commission - 
Information Society and Media, Unit E.2 "Content and Knowledge".

 

*CONFERENCE AIMS*

In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has 
become the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for 
Human Language Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an 
overview of the state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and 
emerging trends, exchange information regarding LRs and their 
applications, evaluation methodologies and tools, ongoing and planned 
activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements coming from the 
e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and 
organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding 
agencies from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and 
opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for 
international cooperation, in support to investigations in language 
sciences, progress in language technologies and development of 
corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

 
*CONFERENCE TOPICS*

 Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): 
text, speech, multimodality

 
- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for LRs

- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation

- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge

- Ontologies and knowledge representation

- Terminology

- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web 
technologies

- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications

 

- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, 
mobile communication, machine translation, summarisation, web services, 
semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.

- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, 
natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice 
activated services, etc.

- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. 
e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile applications, 
etc.

- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

 

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation

- HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures

- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs

- Benchmarking of systems and products

- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and 
dialogue systems

- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

 

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

- National and international activities and projects

- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international 
policies for LRs

- Open architectures

- Organisational, economical and legal issues

 

*_Special Highlights_*

 
LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken, 
written, and other modalities - and of the respective communities. To 
this end, LREC encourages submissions covering issues which are common 
to different types of LRs and language technologies.

 
LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of 
applications and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass all 
those data that interact with language resources in an attempt to model 
more complex human processes and develop more complex systems, and 
encourages submissions on topics such as:

- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces, 
Human-Human interactions, and content processing

- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, 
including emotions

- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for 
robotic systems

 

 *PROGRAMME*

 
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, 
poster and demo presentations, and panels.
*There is no difference in quality between oral and poster 
presentations. Only the appropriateness of the type of communication 
(more or less interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.*

 

*ABSTRACT SUBMISSION*

 

On-line submission form for abstracts is now available: please go to the 
"Abstract submission" section on the LREC2008 web site

procedure instructions.

Submitted abstracts of papers for oral and poster or demo presentations 
*must* consist of about 1500-2000 words.
