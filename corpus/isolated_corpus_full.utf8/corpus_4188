Formal Approaches to Celtic Linguistics

The focus of this conference is on modern theoretical approaches to the Celtic
languages, with an emphasis on the following questions:
i) How does data from the Celtic languages, with their unique typological
properties, inform formal theories of grammar? What challenges does this data
pose to current understanding and how should theories of grammar be modified to
deal with the data from Celtic languages?
ii) How do current advances in formal theories improve our understanding of the
grammar of Celtic languages?
iii)  How can formal theoretical linguistics inform the documentation of the
endangered Celtic languages?

Confirmed Invited Speakers at the conference include: 
David Adger, Queen Mary University, London
Anna Bosch, University of Kentucky
SJ Hannahs, Newcastle
Randall Hendrick, University of North Carolina
Mélanie Jouitteau, Université de Paris 7
James McCloskey, University of California, Santa Cruz
Máire Ní Chiosain, University College Dublin

... and others to be announced.

(which runs March 23-29, 2009). Details of this mini-course will be made in a
separate announcement.
