Meeting Description:

Florida International University (USA), the Center for International Business
Research (CIBER) at Florida International University (USA), and the European
Association of Languages for Specific Purposes (AELFE) hosted in Spain are
jointly organizing the 1st International Seminar on Languages for Business: A
Global Approach, and invite papers from a variety of fields, including applied
linguistics, discourse analysis, pragmatics, sociorhetoric, intercultural
rhetoric, genre studies, and language pedagogy. 

Call for Papers

The seminar will take place on 5-6th June 2009, and will be hosted by the School
of Education and Tourism at the University of Salamanca in Ávila (Spain).
The seminar intends to be a meeting point for academics carrying out research on
languages for business from multidisciplinary fields. It aims at sharing
scholarly views and perceptions on the use of languages for business
communication with the purpose of enriching the integration of LSP with
professional practices and raising issues related to the discursive practices of
business professionals.

We welcome 15-minute papers on textual and discoursal analyses of languages for
business, pragmatic, intercultural and cross-cultural aspects on business
communication, socio-rhetorical and genre views of professional practices, as
well as pedagogical implications and applications of languages for business. 

A 300-word proposal, together with information on the complete affiliation of
author(s), paper title, authors' telephone, fax and e-mail addresses, should be
submitted before 15th February 2009 to llantada@unizar.es. Proposals, which can
be presented either in English or in Spanish, will be evaluated by an
international scientific committee and authors will be informed of their
acceptance by 1st March 2009.

Contact Person: Annika Herrmann

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The conference wants to 
- discuss recent research on nonmanual features in sign languages from a
theoretical and typological perspective
- bring together deaf and hearing linguists and junior researchers working in
the sign language research field
- establish a platform for exchange and cooperation with linguists and institutions 

Call for Papers

Abstract about research on the following topics are encouraged:
- Forms and functions of nonmanuals in sign languages
- Prosody in sign languages: rhythm, prominence and intonation patterns
- Interaction between syntax and prosody
- Information structure in sign languages
- Interrelation of agreement and role shift with nonmanuals
- Marking of sentence types
- Marking of expressive meaning 
- Acquisition and processing of nonmanuals
- Typological variation with respect to form and function of nonmanuals

In all Sign Languages, nonmanuals play an important role on all levels of
grammar. Sign Languages have lexical facial expressions, nonmanual morphological
marking, and various kinds of nonmanual markings on a syntactical level (i.e.
negation, topicalization, sentence types, and role shift). In addition,
semantic-pragmatic functions are often realized nonmanually. 
Recent research has focused on two interesting aspects of nonmanuals, namely
multifunctionality and simultaneity. Firstly, a specific nonmanual feature can
express various grammatical functions. This multifunctionality seems to be an
inherent property of all kinds of nonmanuals. Secondly, simultaneous layering of
different articulatory channels exhibits a complex interplay between manuals and
nonmanuals on the one hand and between different kinds of nonmanuals on the other. 

The workshop aims at addressing the questions of how these components of sign
language grammar can be formally and functionally distinguished, categorized,
and analyzed. 

Invited Speakers:
Dany Adone (University of Koeln)
Onno Crasborn (Radboud University Nijmegen)
Roland Pfau (University of Amsterdam)
Christian Rathmann (University of Hamburg)

Please send a one-page abstract by email to
herrmann[at]lingua[dot]uni[minus]frankfurt[dot]de no later than 1. February 2009
(submission deadline). 

The abstract should be anonymous and can be sent in .doc, .pdf or .tex format.
The email should contain the author(s)' name(s), affiliation(s), and postal
address(es). 

Notification of acceptance: 15. February 2009

Workshop: 04.-05. April 2009
