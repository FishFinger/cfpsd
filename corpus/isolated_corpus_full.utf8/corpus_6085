Meeting Description:

English education has changed dramatically over the past decade, be it in
language policy such as ELF (English as a Lingua Franca) and EIL (English as  an
International Language), in teaching purpose such as EMI (English as a  Medium
of Instruction) and ESP (English for Specific Purposes), or in teaching mode
such as CMC (Computer-mediated Communication) and SALC (Self-access Language
Center). While many students, teachers and administrators are still  struggling
to fully absorb and implement those changes required by constantly evolving
societies and globalized markets and afforded by sophisticated technologies and
newly forged synergies, new developments are looming on the horizon. It is thus
the purpose of this conference to attempt a critical survey of the current state
of ELT across its subdisciplines, identify promising concepts, practices and
tools, and sketch out the road ahead that needs to be charted in order to truly
prepare the learner for challenges and opportunities that will present
themselves in the years to come.
