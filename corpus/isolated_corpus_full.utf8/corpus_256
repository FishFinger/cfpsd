CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
	      
Stylistics for Text Retrieval in Practice
SIGIR 2006 Workshop
Seattle, WA, August 10, 2006
 
http://www.lingcog.iit.edu/style2006
style2006@sics.se
 
Recent years have seen an increased attention to various aspects of
automatic analysis and extraction of stylistic aspects of natural
language texts.  Style may be roughly defined as the 'manner' in which
something is expressed, as opposed to the 'content' of a message. 
Modelling, representing, explaining, and utilizing variation
in the manner of expression is the business of stylistic analysis.
 
This workshop follows four previous successful exploratory events
on stylistic analysis and will focus on the practical craft of
stylistic analysis in natural language texts.
 
THIS YEAR: BRING A DEMO!
 
Potentially useful applications of stylistic analysis abound,
including systems for genre-based information retrieval, authorship
attribution, plagiarism detection, context-sensitive text or speech
generation systems, organizing and retrieving documents based on their
writing style, attitude, or sentiment, quality or appropriateness
filters for messaging systems, detecting abusive or threatening
language, and more. This year, participants are expected to bring with
them a method for applying stylistic analysis to information access
tasks.
 
Before lunch, methods will be discussed in session; after lunch,
demonstrated in practice.
 
DISCUSSION QUESTION
 
Participants should address the following key challenge question
in their participation proposals:
 
WHAT IS A MEANINGFUL "KILLER APP" FOR STYLISTIC TEXT ANALYSIS? 
 
and consider the following questions for discussion in session:
 
1. How does style relate to other forms of non-topical textual variation?
2. What features are best for different style analysis tasks?
3. Is cross-lingual or 'universal' style analysis possible, and if so, how?
4. How might we develop useful shared resources for moving style research
   forward?
 
SUBMISSION FORMAT
 
Send us a statement (in PDF) of up to five pages describing your
research or application with a short description (and screenshots if
possible) of the demonstration you plan to show. At the workshop we
will discuss and decide on an appropriate forum for a more permanent
record of the proceedings. If you would like a speaking slot in the
discussion session, you should indicate this in your statement of
interest.
