Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description

The metacommunicative lexicon is defined as that section of the general lexicon
of a language which consists of terms relating to human communication itself. Of
special interest are terms referring to concrete communicative acts and
sequences, either generically or with a particular focus. Such lexical
expressions may be regarded as a key to folk models of communication providing
access to the culture-specific conceptualizations of communication. In this
sense, they build a bridge to the pragmatics of commmunication. The application
of an historical approach to the metacommunicative lexicon should, consequently,
give insights into historical forms of communication and their underlying
ideologies, and thus contribute directly to historical pragmatics. 

The conference aims to bring together scholars with a common interest in aspects
of the continuum leading from the metacommunicative lexicon to historical
pragmatics. We aim to discuss both empirically well-grounded and/or more
theoretically-minded aspects of the topic and envisage a program of
contributions taking shape around the following major areas of concern:

Lexical items/ sets/ fields referring to, e.g. speaking and being silent,
communicative genres, interaction sequences, single aspects of the utterance and
its constituents (verbal mode, nonverbal modes).

Single metaphors pertaining to (particular) classes of communicative events and
patterns or entire metaphorical concepts and their structural networking.

Codified communicative values (e.g. politeness, wit).

Codified communicative qualities of humans (e.g. taciturn, talkative).
