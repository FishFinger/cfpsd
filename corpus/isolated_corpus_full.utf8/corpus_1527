Location: Seoul, Korea, South 
Contact Person: Henry Y. Chang

Web Site: http://cil18.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2007 

Meeting Description

Although substantial progress in argument realization has been achieved within
Indo-European languages (Levin 2005, Goldberg 2006, among others), it is
relatively less known how semantic arguments realize in syntactic structures in
Asian languages. It also remains to be seen what impacts the findings from the
study of Asian languages have on the theory of argument realization. This
workshop aims to fill this gap by bringing together researchers who work on
Asian languages. The workshop will be focused on but not limited to the
following issues: 
1. What are the principles and the constraints governing argument realization?
Specifically, what role does the Thematic Hierarchy play in determining argument
realization (Jackendoff 1990, Bresnan and Kanerva 1989, Grimshaw 1990, Van Valin
and Lappola 1997, and others)? 
2. How does argument realization vary across languages? How is the variation
captured in principled way? 
3. How are peripheral semantic arguments such as location, time, and beneficiary
grammatically represented? 
4. How are causer and causee grammatically represented? 

An abstract (.pdf or .doc file) should be up to 3 pages long, including data and
references. 
The abstract should start with the title of the paper, followed by the text of
the abstract.
Please do not include the author's name in the abstract. On a separate page,
please give the author's name, affiliation, e-mail address, telephone number,
mailing address, the paper title and the session number (title).
Please send the abstract and the author's information to both cil18@cil18.org
and henryylc@gate.sinica.edu.tw.

Meeting Description

The Western Conference on Linguistics 2007 (WECOL 2007) 

Second Call for Papers

The 2007 Western Conference on Linguistics (WECOL) will be held November 30 -
December 2, 2007 at the University of California, San Diego. This year's
conference will include a general session, a poster session, and two special
sessions described below.

General Session: expanding the depth and width of empirical data

While the general session will cover all areas of linguistic interest and
welcome papers from all major linguistic subfields and frameworks, as well as
from related cross-disciplinary areas, special consideration will be given to
experimental and corpus studies which challenge existing linguistic data and
generalizations or bring previously unnoticed data to discussion.

Invited Speaker
TBA

Special session I: What can L1 and L2 research tell us about Language Universals?

Special session I will focus on language acquisition studies from any of the
sub-disciplines in linguistics and related fields which contribute to our
understanding of universal characteristics of language.

Invited Speaker
TBA

Special session II: Challenges to linguistic generalizations from understudied
languages

Special session II invites papers that investigate linguistic generalizations
with data from under-studied languages. Submissions from all theoretical and
empirical perspectives are welcome.

Invited Speaker
TBA

Poster Session:

Submissions are also welcome for a poster session featuring posters on any of
the above topics or any other area of linguistic interest.

Submission Guidelines:

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion) or for
the poster session. Abstracts can be submitted through the Abstract Submission
page (http://ling.ucsd.edu/events/wecol07/abstract.html). You may submit your
abstract for one of the three presentation sessions, for the poster session, or
for both.

Only online PDF submissions through the Abstract Submission page will be
accepted. Abstracts should be anonymous, and limited to two pages (using 1''
margins on all sides and 12pt font size). Data and examples must be given within
the body of the text rather than at the end. Any non-standard fonts should be
embedded in the PDF document.

Please include up to four keywords within your abstract (immediately below the
title) to help us match your abstract to relevant reviewers. These could include
the subfield and relevant languages for your paper. If you are submitting your
abstract to both a presentation session and the poster session, please include
your preferred session as a keyword.

Presented papers will be published in the online WECOL proceedings.

Submission deadline: July 1st, 2007
Notification of Acceptance: September 30th, 2007

Please contact the organizers at wecol2007@ling.ucsd.edu with any questions.
