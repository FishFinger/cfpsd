Meeting Description:

Chronos 9 - International Conference on Tense, Aspect and Modality. University
of Paris 7, 2 - 4 September 2009 

Call for Papers

Deadline updated: March 20, 2009

Chronos is a series of biannual conferences dedicated to current research on the
morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense, aspect and
modality. The conferences welcome presentations from scholars who approach
linguistic research from different perspectives and embrace different
theoretical frameworks.

Main Session: morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense,
aspect and modality. 
Parasession: Endangered & less-documented languages.
Special associated Workshop: Scalar structure and event structure

The thematic parasession of Chronos 2009 will be dedicated to the
tense/aspect/modality systems of endangered and less-documented languages. Not
only do such languages often face a serious danger of rapid extinction; they are
also a relatively intact source of fecund data, which might shed some new light
on the empirical generalizations and theoretical/formal constructs currently
prevalent within the community - indeed, these have generally been elaborated
through observations bearing on a handful of well-documented languages.

In addition to this special theme, Chronos 2009 will also include a host
workshop dedicated to the relationship between scalar structure and event
structure (co-organized by U. Paris 7 and U. Chicago): this particular empirical
field has proved very fruitful over the past few years, by nourishing a wealth
of new formal and theoretical approaches to aspectual meaning. The Chronos 2009
host workshop will constitute a unique opportunity of bringing together and
confronting different recent approaches to the connection between aspect and
scalarity.

Submissions to the conference are not restricted to the special topics here
listed. We welcome proposals relating to any area in the linguistics of tense,
aspect and modality.

Invited Speakers: 
- Alan Dench, University of Western Australia
- Denis Creissels, Université de Lyon 2
- Leora Bar El, University of Montana
- Martina Faller, University of Manchester
- Chris Piñón, Université de Lille 3

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for
discussion). Abstracts must be anonymous and written in French or in English.
They should be no longer than two pages in length using 1 inch/2.5 cm margins on
all sides and in 12pt font size (Times New Roman preferred). Any non-standard
fonts should be embedded in the PDF document. Submissions are limited to one
individual and one joint abstract per author.

Abstract submission deadline: March 20, 2009.
Notifications of acceptance: mid May, 2009.
Conference dates: 2-4 September 2009
