Meeting Description:

KOTESOL invites presenters on various topics in the ELT field to speak to English teachers working in Korea at the 16th annual international conference in Seoul, October 25-26, 2008. 

Call for Papers

Korea TESOL encourages teachers and scholars to consider what it is about the contemporary ELT environment that drives change in the classroom, and to present their responses before 900 of their colleagues at our 16th annual international conference in Seoul, October 25-26, 2008.

The changing world reflects change in learners, social issues, educational settings, and even in language itself. This is not to say that the principles and values of 50 years ago are no longer valid, but that teachers have much more to consider in selecting their teaching approach. Sub-themes for this year's conference include:
- Global Englishes 
- Content-Based Instruction
- English for Specific Purposes 
- Technology-Enhanced Instruction
- Genre Studies 
- Facilitating Learning in the Classroom
- Internet English 
- Intercultural Communication
- Global Issues for Language Learning 
- Innovative Methodologies & Approaches
- 21st Century Learning Preferences/Styles 
- Others related to the general theme

Presentation proposals that address the above sub-themes will be given preference in the vetting process. Presentations should also fit one of these target audiences:
A. ''How-to Basics'' Sessions (Building the basics for beginning teachers; practical sessions)
B. ''How-to Plus'' Sessions (Building on the basics for experienced teachers; practical sessions)
C. ''Research and Theory'' Sessions (Research-based and theoretical sessions)

International participation encouraged.

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

We welcome submissions that address problems of East Asian linguistics from a theoretical perspective. A special session on 'Word-order variation and universal grammar - areal, dialectal and information-structural perspectives' will be held on the first day of the workshop. Each paper will be allotted 30 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for discussion. 

Call for Papers

General Session:
Submissions from any domain of grammar are welcome.

Special Session:
'Word-order variation and universal grammar - areal, dialectal and information-structural perspectives'.

Selection of papers is based on anonymous review of abstracts. A selection committee will be formed to review the submitted abstracts which are considered by the reviewers to be of high interest to the development of theoretical East Asian linguistics and linguistic theory in general. 

Please follow these guidelines to submit your abstracts:
All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two single-spaced pages, complete with examples and bibliography. All texts should fit within a US letter-size or A4 page, with 1-inch/2.5-cm margin all around. Each abstract should start with the title (centered) at top, followed by 3 single-spaced blank lines, above the main text. Use font size 12 throughout, preferably in Times or Times New Roman. Romanize all Asian texts, and avoid Asian character fonts unless absolutely necessary.

The body of your email message should include the following information:
- paper title
- name(s) of the author(s)
- affiliation(s)
- (a single) e-mail address for correspondence
- general session/special session [choose one]

Abstract submission is by email-attachment only. We cannot accept submissions by postal mail. Save your abstract as a PDF, DOC, or RTF file. Documents in other formats must be converted before submission. Name your abstract with your last name followed by the suffix pdf, doc, or rtf (e.g., huang.pdf, kim.doc, or watanabe.rtf). Send your abstract to:

teal5@ling.uni-potsdam.de 

Abstract selection is based on anonymous review. Please leave your name and affiliation out of the abstract (but keep 3 blank lines between title and text). At most one single-authored work and one joint-authored work per person will be accepted for presentation.

The TEAL Workshop was first launched in 1990 at the University of California, Irvine as a mid-size workshop intended to foster research on East Asian linguistics. It has been an important forum for presenting new theories and exchanging novel ideas that bear on East Asian languages with theoretical interests. Since 2002, the TEAL Workshop has been an international event. It was held at Doshisha University, Japan in 2002, at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan in 2004, and at Harvard University, USA in 2005. Last year TEAL was held in conjunction with the Sixth GLOW in Asia.

Importantant Dates:
Deadline for abstract submissions: April 30th 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 15th 2008
