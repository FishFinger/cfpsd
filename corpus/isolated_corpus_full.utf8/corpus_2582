                             Call for Papers

                                ACL 2008

                           Tenth Meeting of the =

                        ACL Special Interest Group
                        in Computational Morphology =

                               and Phonology

                          Ohio State University
                              Columbus, Ohio
                           June 19 or 20, 2008

This is SIGMORPHON's first workshop whose scope reflects the SIG's new
charter, which has expanded with ACL's approval to include morphology
and phonetics as well as phonology.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested
in applying computational techniques to problems in morphology,
phonology, and phonetics.  Papers will be on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on these topics, potentially including strong work
in progress.  Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to) the
following as they relate to the areas of the workshop:

* New formalisms, or computational treatments of existing linguistic
  formalisms
* Probabilistic models and machine learning
* Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning of linguistic knowledge
* Analysis or exploitation of multilingual, multi-dialectal, or
  diachronic data =

* Algorithms, including finite-state methods
* Speech technologies relating to phonetics or phonology
* Instructional technologies for second-language learners
* Psycholinguistics and speech science (both production and
  comprehension)
* Machine transliteration and back-transliteration
* Corpus linguistics
* Integration of morphology, phonology, or phonetics with other NLP
  tasks
* Tools and resources

One of the missions of SIGMORPHON is to encourage interaction between
work in computational linguistics and work in theoretical and empirical
linguistics. Our recent meetings have been successful in this regard,
and we hope to see this continue in 2008.  Many mainstream linguists
studying phonetics, phonology, and morphology are now asking and
answering computational questions.  We hope that this workshop will
allow the CL community to consider their problems, tools, and models.

This workshop will be the tenth meeting of SIGMORPHON (formerly called
SIGPHON). We will hold a full-day workshop consisting of approximately
10 half-hour presentations.

The workshop will be held on June 19 or 20, immediately after the ACL
2008 meetings at Ohio-State University in Columbus, Ohio.

Important Dates
---------------
* Submission Deadline: March 17, 2008, 23:59 EST

* Workshop: June 19 or 20, 2008


Paper Submission =

---------------- =

Content: Papers should be original, topical, and clear. Completed work
is preferable to intended work, but in any event the paper should
clearly indicate the state of completion of the reported results.
Authors are encouraged to study the actual form used by reviewers
(http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/sigmorphon2008/review-form.html) to
assess papers.

Submission Format: The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings, and should not exceed eight (8) pages. One additional page
is allowed for the References section.  Thus, your PDF file may be 9
pages. However, all material other than the bibliography must fall
within the first 8 pages!  We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX
style files or Microsoft Word document template that are available on
the ACL conference web site
(http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html).  We reserve the
right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles,
including font size restrictions.

Anonymous Review: The paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be
rejected without review.

Conflicts of Interest: Authors should mark on the submission page any
program committee member with whom they have a conflict of interest,
such as a recent collaborator, a recent colleague at the same
institution, or a close personal friend.

Double Submitting: Papers that have been or will be submitted to other
meetings or publications must provide this information on the START
online submission page. Papers may not be submitted to SIGMORPHON 2008
if they are currently or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications and that other meeting or publication prohibits multiple
submission. If SIGMORPHON 2008 accepts a paper, authors must notify the
program chairs *immediately* indicating which meeting they choose for
presentation of their work. SIGMORPHON 2008 cannot accept for
publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published
elsewhere.

Submission Procedure: Authors must submit papers online here:
https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS06/submit.html

The submission deadline is Monday March 17, 2008 23:59 EST. Papers
submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed.
