Dear Jean-Philippe Prost:

We invite you to submit a paper/abstract to The 6th International =
Conference on Education and Information Systems, Technologies and =
Applications: EISTA 2008 (http://www.socioinfocyber.org/eista2008). It =
will take place in Orlando, Florida,USA, on June 29th to July 2nd, 2008.

The deadlines are the following:

Submissions: November  14th, 2007
Acceptance: January 14th, 2008
Camera-ready: March 5th, 2008

We are emphasizing the area of Education in Science, Technology, =
Engineering and Mathematics which, we think, is related to your specific =
academic or professional area.

Submitted papers or extended abstracts will have three kinds of reviews: =
double-blind (by at least three reviewers), non-blind, and participative =
peer-to-peer reviews.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have =
access to the reviews made to their submission so they can accordingly =
improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors may =
not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

Awards will be granted to the best paper of those presented at each =
session. From these session's best papers, the best 10%-20% of the =
papers presented at the conference will be selected for their =
publication in Volume 6 of JSCI Journal (www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI) and =
sent free to over 220 research libraries. Libraries of journal author's =
organizations will receive complimentary subscriptions of at least one =
volume (6 issues).

Also, we would like to invite you to organize an invited session related =
to a topic of your research interest. If you are interested in =
organizing an invited session, please, fill out the respective form =
provided in the conference web page. We will send you a password, so you =
can include and modify papers in your invited session.

More details about the reviewing process, the acceptance policy, =
organizing invited sessions, and submission deadlines can be found at =
our web site.

If the deadlines are tight and you need more time, let us know about a =
suitable time for you and I will inform you if it is feasible for us.

Best regards,

Professor Andr=E9s Tremante
EISTA 2008 General Chair
