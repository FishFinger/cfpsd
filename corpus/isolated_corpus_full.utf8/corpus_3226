CONFERENCE  OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CISSE 2008 provides a virtual forum for presentation and discussion of the
state-of the-art research on computers, information and systems sciences
and engineering. CISSE 2008 is the fourth conference of the CISSE series of
e-conferences. CISSE is the World's first Engineering/Computing and Systems
Research E-Conference. CISSE 2005 was the first high-caliber Research
Conference  in the world to be completely conducted online in real-time via
the internet.  CISSE 2005 was the first high-caliber Research Conference in
the world to be completely conducted online in real-time via the internet.
CISSE 2005 received 255 research paper submissions and the final program
included 140 accepted papers, from more than 45 countries. CISSE 2006
received 691 research paper submissions and the final program included 390
accepted papers, from more than 70 countries. CISSE 2007 received 750
research paper submissions and the final program included 406 accepted
papers, from more than 80 countries.


The virtual conference will be conducted through the Internet using
web-conferencing tools, made available by the conference. Authors will be
presenting their PowerPoint, audio or video presentations using
web-conferencing  tools without the need for travel. Conference sessions
will be broadcast to all the conference participants, where session
participants can interact with the presenter during the presentation and
(or) during the Q&A slot that follows the presentation. This international
conference will be held entirely on-line. The accepted and presented papers
will be made available and sent to the authors after the conference both on
a DVD (including all papers, powerpoint presentations and audio
presentations) and as a book publication. Springer, the official publisher
for CISSE, published the 2005 proceedings in 2 books and the CISSE 2006 and
CISSE 2007 proceedings in four books.


Conference participants - authors, presenters and attendees - only need  an
internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be
able to contribute and participate in this international ground-breaking
conference. The on-line structure of this high-quality event will allow
academic professionals and industry participants to contribute their work
and attend world-class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed
submissions, live, without the need for investing significant travel funds
or time out of the office.


The concept and format of CISSE is ground-breaking.  The PowerPoint
presentations, final paper manuscripts and time schedule for live
presentations over the web had been available for weeks prior to the start
of the conference for all registrants, so that the participants can choose
the presentations they want to attend and think about questions that they
might want to ask. The live audio presentations were also recorded and are
part of the permanent CISSE on-line archive - accessible to all
registrants- which also includes all the papers, PowerPoint and audio
presentations.


Potential non-author conference attendees who cannot make the on-line
conference dates are encouraged to register, as the entire joint
conferences  will be archived for future viewing.


The CISSE conference audio room provides superb audio even over low speed
internet connections, the ability to display PowerPoint presentations, and
cross-platform compatibility (the conferencing software runs on Windows,
Mac,  and any other operating system that supports Java). In addition, the
conferencing system allowed for an unlimited number of participants, which
in turn granted us the opportunity to allow all CISSE participants to
attend all presentations, as opposed to limiting the number of available
seats for each session.


Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in
Microsoft Word format through the website of the conference at
http://www.cisse2008online.org.  Accepted papers must be presented in the
virtual conference by one of the authors. To submit your paper,please visit
