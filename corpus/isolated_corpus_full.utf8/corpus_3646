                                    CALL FOR PAPERS

 II International Workshop on the Semantic Representation of Spoken Language
                                             EACL2009
                      Athens, Greece; March 30 or 31, 2009

                     http://www.ofai.at/~manuel.alcantara/SRSL2009

                       Submission Deadline:  December 19, 2008
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in 
the semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous 
speech. On one hand, the semantic gap between contents conveyed by 
natural languages and their formal representations is a burning aspect 
in tasks such as information extraction and corpus annotation. The 
current state-of-the-art supports solutions from very different 
backgrounds and perspectives, but still remain important and complex 
issues to deal with, such as the accurate segmentation of speech in 
semantic units. The discussion of those aspects are one of the main 
reasons for this workshop. On the other hand, spoken language is a 
pending issue in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence, 
both traditionally focused on written language, although semantic 
processing of speech is necessary for the understanding of both natural 
and human-machine interaction. Finally, the problems found when trying 
to linguistically structure spontaneous speech are leading to works 
focused on its semantic representation. In-depth research on the 
semantic representation of speech can provide us with a suitable basis 
for further analysis of related linguistic levels, like prosody or 
pragmatics.


Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research 
concerning the semantic representation of spoken language. Possible 
topics include:

    * Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, 
etc.) and concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
    * Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
    * Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
    * Dialogue and discourse structures.
    * Topic Detection and tracking.
    * Multimodal Representations including speech.
    * Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue 
systems.
    * Speech in embedded systems.
    * Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic 
representations.
    * Standardization work.
    * Interoperability/Comparison work of spoken and written corpora.


Submissions must be written in English and should follow the EACL2009 
style format. They can be full (6-8 pages including references) or short 
papers (3-4 pages including references). As reviewing will be blind, the 
paper should not include author's names and affiliations. Furthermore, 
self-references that reveal the author's identity should be avoided. 
Submissions that do not conform to these styles will be rejected.

The only accepted format for submitted papers is PDF. Please remember 
that the paper submission deadline is December 19th, 2008. Papers that 
are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must 
indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain significant 
overlap with previously published work. Accepted papers will appear in 
the proceedings of the SRSL-2009.

Both full and short papers (3-4 pages) will have an oral presentation at 
the workshop within the framework of the EACL2009 conference in Athens 
(Greece). For this reason, at least one author has to register for the 
workshop.
