Meeting Description

West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics (WCCFL) 27 

The 27th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics 

May 16 - 18, 2008
University of California-Los Angeles
Los Angeles, California, USA

Invited Speakers
Hagit Borer - USC
Elliott Moreton - UNC
Liina Pylkk√§nen - NYU

General Session
Abstracts from all areas of formal linguistics and from any theoretical
perspective are invited for 20-minute talks in the general session.

Special Session I: Experimental Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics
Support for formal linguistic theories can often be found in empirical study.
Abstracts that use objective measures to address issues in syntax, semantics, or
pragmatics are invited for 20-minute talks in this special session.

Special Session II: Explaining Phonological Typology: Channel or Analytic Bias?
One problem in addressing phonological typology has been the compatibility of
data with both cognitive and phonetic predispositions. This session solicits
papers which address and attempt to tease apart the effects of such biases.

Instructions for Abstract Submission
Abstracts must be at most one page long on a letter-size sheet (8''1/2 by 11'')
with one-inch margins and typed in at least 11-point font. An optional second
page is permitted for data and references. Abstracts must be anonymous.

Submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author, or 2
joint abstracts per author.

Abstracts must be submitted in one of the following formats:
PDF attachment

Hardcopy (only if absolutely necessary)

We strongly encourage electronic submissions, which should be submitted at the
website:

Meeting Description

The 'Movement and Word Order in Bantu' Conference aims to bring together
linguists with different theoretical perspectives to discuss word order and
morphology and their links to information structure. 

Movement and Word order in Bantu 

Date: 7 and 8 March 2008

Organisers: Kristina Riedel and Jenneke van der Wal, Bantu Syntax Project, LUCL 

Word order and information structure have increasingly attracted attention in
both empirical and theoretical research. Bantu languages provide a rich testing
ground for the investigation of how information structure is encoded because
they employ a variety of morphological, syntactic and intonational markings of
information structure. Our aim with this conference is to bring together
Bantuists working from different theoretical perspectives to discuss among
others the following issues: 

Is there movement in wh-questions and/or in topic and focus constructions? 

Is there a direct correlation between particular morphemes - such as for example
subject and object markers, conjoint/disjoint markers and focus particles - and
information structure? If so, what are the theoretical implications? 

What is the structure of the left and right periphery and the middle field in
Bantu? Are there designated focus and/or topic projections? 

What is the typology of focus and wh-positions in Bantu? Do different positions
correlate with any systematic interpretational differences? 

Which topicalization positions and/or strategies are available in Bantu? Do they
show any systematic differences in interpretation?

Call for Papers

We invite abstracts for presentations dealing with these and related questions.
Time for presentations is 30 minutes including discussion. Abstracts should be
no longer than one page A4, including data and references, with 2.5 cm margins
and 12 point font size. Please send two copies of your abstract. One of these
should be anonymous, and one should include your name, affiliation and email at
the top of the page, directly below the title. Abstracts should be submitted
electronically, in PDF, RTF, DOC format. Email abstracts to:
bantu_conference@let.leidenuniv.nl by 1 November 2007.

Katherine Demuth (Brown University)
Laura Downing (ZAS)
Lutz Marten (SOAS)
Jochen Zeller (University of KwaZulu-Natal)
