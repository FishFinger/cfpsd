The Sixth Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC-09)

MCLC offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics
researchers to get together and present ideas and research results. It
is intended to be primarily for researchers from the Midwest region,
but applications from all regions are welcome.  We particularly
welcome work in progress from graduate students and other young
researchers.  The first meeting of MCLC was successfully held at
Indiana University, Bloomington in 2004, and we're pleased to bring it
back to Indiana.

=3D=3D=3D=3D Submission Guidelines =3D=3D=3D=3D

   style files.
- The abstract should be anonymous.
- Abstracts should be emailed to mclc09@indiana.edu no later than
   March 27, 2009. The abstract should be in .pdf format.

Each abstract will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. The major
criteria of evaluation will be the originality, soundness, and clarity
of the research idea presented and the relevance of the topic to the
colloquium.
