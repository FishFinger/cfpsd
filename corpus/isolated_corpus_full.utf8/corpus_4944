-psycholinguistics and language processing
-language change and grammaticalization

longer or shorter papers will be considered on a case-by-base basis
(contact the editorial board)

-font size 12, Times New Roman or Doulos SIL
-if another font is necessary for linguistic symbols, please contact the

maintain anonymity in the review process, the author's name must not appear
anywhere in the document.

-a complete list of cited references must appear at the end of the paper;

is presented, it should be accompanied by interlinearized glosses and a
free translation.

separate file

     -if you use LaTeX, please contact rls@rice.edu before submitting your
paper
  (2) In addtion to the Word or LaTeX submission, you must send a PDF
version. This is so that we can see how it is supposed to look in case

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
