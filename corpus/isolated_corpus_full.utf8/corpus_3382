The development of information network systems enables us to
communicate with people in remote places "anytime and anywhere",
enriching human knowledge, affection and sensibility. However, there
are various barriers which stand in our way to using these systems
freely and flexibly. In order to discuss how to overcome these
barriers and create a more human-centered communication environment,
in 2007 the first International Symposium on Universal Communication
was held in Kyoto, Japan featuring discussions with well-known
researchers from around the world.  Following its success, the second
International Symposium on Universal Communication will be held in
Osaka, Japan.

Topics of interest are as follows, but not limited to
ã- Information retrieval and information analysis
ã- Information credibility
ã- Knowledge processing
ã- Language resources
ã- Speech recognition and synthesis
ã- Machine translation and speech translation
ã- Natural language processing
ã- Spoken language processing
ã- Multilingual information processing
ã- Super high-resolution image technology
ã- 3D visualization, imaging and display technologies
ã- 3D sound processing
