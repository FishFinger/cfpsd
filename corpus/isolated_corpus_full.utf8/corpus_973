                             FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on Building Frame Semantics Resources for Scandinavian and =20
Baltic Languages


DATE AND LOCATION
Date: Thursday 24 May 2007
Location: University of Tartu, Estonia
Part of the NODALIDA 2007 conference
Workshop web page: http://www.lucas.lth.se/frame2007/
Conference web page: http://math.ut.ee/nodalida2007/


OBJECTIVES
Annotated data with role-semantic information are becoming an ever =20
more important resource for many semantic systems. They form the core =20
element to develop large coverage, high-performance, and reusable =20
semantic parsers, classifiers as well as applications that include =20
lexicography, term and information extraction, semantic processing of =20
the web, text-to-scene conversion systems, etc.

Existing examples of role annotated corpora/resources include for =20
English: FrameNet, PropBank, and VerbNet, for German: Salsa, and for =20
Spanish: Spanish FrameNet. However, the two main initiatives outside =20
English take FrameNet as a semantic pivot and attempt to derive or =20
adapt frames to the target language using manual work or =20
semiautomatic systems.

As frequently observed, the itemization of frames and lexical units =20
and their manual annotation in a corpus is an expensive task that =20
requires a relatively long-term and dedicated commitment. Such an =20
effort is currently beyond the reach of most research teams in the =20
Nordic area, which could impair the quality, and possibly the =20
existence, of future semantic applications in these languages. This =20
makes the construction of a role-semantic annotated corpus and the =20
design of automatic or semi-automatic transfer methods a challenge as =20
well as an opportunity.

This workshop intends to be a forum for the research community to =20
review current initiatives and methods as well as ideas to start the =20
construction of a role annotated corpus and possibly share it across =20
a families of related languages. Topics of interest include (but are =20
not limited to):

-- Transfer and adaptation of frames and role annotation from English =20
and German
-- Pilot annotation/projection studies
-- Lexical inheritance mechanisms: crosslingual similarities and =20
differences, protoframe design, variation and variant annotation
-- Frame alignment and projections from English/German and across =20
target languages
-- Transfer of collocations, subcategorization, and grammatical =20
functions to role annotation
-- General methods for multilingual corpus alignment and structure =20
transfer/projection
-- "Upgrade" of existing resources: dependency annotation, small =20
corpora, and bootstrapping using nonsemantically annotated data
-- Shared annotation platforms
-- Experience from other initiatives: Salsa, Romance FrameNet
-- Applications of frame semantics
-- Evaluation

IMPORTANT DATES
Deadline for submitting an extended abstract: February 15
Notification of acceptance: March 1
Deadline for submitting final papers, short, max. 4 pages or full, =20
max. 8 pages: April 20
Workshop: May 24


SUBMISSION AND ORGANIZATION
Participants are invited to submit a one to two page extended =20
abstract of their research or position statements using the NODALIDA =20
styles (http://math.ut.ee/nodalida2007/author.html). Submissions must =20
include author names, affiliation, and contact address. The workshop =20
submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee.

If their abstract is accepted, authors will be invited to submit a =20
short paper (max 4 pages) or a full paper (max. 8 pages) according to =20
the authors' own choice that will be published in the workshop =20
proceedings.

Submissions are to be sent to frame2007@cs.lth.se

The workshop will take place in the NODALIDA 2007 conference and will =20
include a round table where participants will be able to discuss and =20
try to propose an agenda to build frame semantic resources for the =20
Scandinavian and Baltic languages. Active participation and/or =20
commitments from the presenters or the public to set up this agenda =20
will be welcome.

TARGET GROUPS
All the people interested in building frame semantic resources as =20
well as frame semantic analyzers for the Scandinavian and Baltic =20
languages.
