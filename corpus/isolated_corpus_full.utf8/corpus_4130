conference, to be held from 3 to 5 September, 2009 at the Department of

language-specific or cross-linguistic perspective. Contributions are expected to
be based either on new data, or new approaches to analysis. We especially

phonological typology
phonological typology and grammar
morphological typology
synthesis and fusion
syntactic typology
typology of parts of speech
information structure
