Meeting Description:

Introduction:                                                   =20

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a central topic in contemporary computer sc=
ience
and informatics. The fruits of fifty years of AI research have benefited
application domains as disparate as industrial systems control and medicine=
. The
milestone events in AI research are increasingly regarded as mile stones in
human scientific and technological development: from the first chess playin=
g
program to defeat a reigning world champion under standard chess tournament
rules, to the first robot to autonomously traverse 150 miles of rough terra=
in.
Techniques, results, and concepts developed under the banner of AI research=
 have
proved to be of fundamental importance in areas such as economics, philosop=
hy,
linguistics, psychology, and logical analysis. And of course, AI remains a =
topic
of perennial fascination in popular culture.

Initiated in 1974, the biennial European Conference on Artificial Intellige=
nce
(ECAI) is Europe's premier archival venue for presenting scientific results=
 in
AI. Organised by the European Coordinating Committee for AI (ECCAI), the EC=
AI
conference provides an opportunity for researchers to present and hear abou=
t the
very best research in contemporary AI. As  well as  a full  programme of=20
technical papers, ECAI-2010  will include  the Prestigious  Applications  o=
f
Intelligent Systems  conference  (PAIS),  the  Starting  AI  Researcher=20
Symposium (STAIRS), and an  extensive  programme of  workshops, tutorials, =
 and
invited  speakers. (Separate calls are issued for PAIS, STAIRS, and worksho=
ps.)

ECAI-2010 will be held in the beautiful and historic city of Lisbon, Portug=
al.
With excellent opportunities for sightseeing and gastronomy, Lisbon promise=
s to
be a wonderful venue for a memorable conference.

16-20 August 2010=20
Lisbon, Portugal

y AI;

Important Dates:                                               =20

Deadline for electronic abstracts: Monday, 15 February 2010

Paper submission deadline: Monday,=0922 February 2010

Author response period: 15-16 April 2010

Notification of acceptance/rejection: Friday, 30 April 2010

Conference: 16-20 August 2010

Submission Information:                                          =20

Submissions must not exceed six (6) pages in camera-ready format. Over-leng=
th =20
 submissions will be rejected without review. Papers should be submitted us=
ing
the ECAI formatting style, to be available soon on the conference website (=
this
will be very close to previous ECAI styles). Each accepted paper will be
allocated six pages in the proceedings.  ECAI-2010 also accepts posters. Ea=
ch
poster will have two (2) pages allocated in the proceedings. Posters must f=
ollow
the same formatting guidelines as full papers. Authors may indicate whether=
 they
want a submitted full paper to be considered as well as a submitted poster =
in
case of non-acceptance of the full paper.

All submissions will be subject to peer review by the ECAI-2010 Programme
Committee, and evaluated on the basis of: relevance; significance of
contribution; technical quality; scholarship; and quality of presentation.

Reviewing for ECAI-2010 will be blind: reviewers will not be presented with=
 the
identity of paper authors. To allow for blind review, author names in a
submitted paper or poster should be replaced by the unique tracking number
assigned by the conference website at the submission of an electronic abstr=
act.
Authors should avoid writing anything that makes their identity obvious in =
the
text. Submissions should be original, and- in particular should not previou=
sly
have been formally published. (As a rule of thumb, any publication venue wi=
th an
ISBN or ISSN number counts as a formal publication.) Submissions should not=
 be
submitted elsewhere during the ECAI-2010 review phase.

The primary authors of submitted papers will be offered the opportunity to
respond to the reviews for their papers before the final decision on accept=
ance
or otherwise is made. The author feedback phase will last two days.

The proceedings of the ECAI conference, together with those of its associat=
ed
symposia, PAIS and STAIRS (calls to appear soon), will be published and
distributed by IOS Press as a book and as a CD-ROM. The authors will be
responsible for producing camera-ready copies of papers, conforming to the
ECAI-2010 formatting guidelines for inclusion in the proceedings. At least =
one
author of each accepted paper or poster is required to attend the conferenc=
e to
present the contribution.
