>=20
> Dear FEAST members,
> the European Commission has released a new Marie Curie scheme, the Marie
> Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES).
>=20
> *
> Activities*
>=20
> IRSES provides support for those Australian research organisations
> participating in a selected partnership, to establish or reinforce long-t=
erm
> research co-operation through a coordinated joint and balanced programme =
of
> exchange for 2 to 4 years, of researchers for periods not exceeding 12
> months. Importantly, technical and management staff may also participate =
in
> these exchanges.
>=20
>=20
>  The European Commission will support the travel and living costs of
> European staff travelling to Australia. In Australia, each organisation i=
s
> expected to cover the mobility costs (i.e. travel and subsistence costs) =
of
> their outgoing researchers travelling to Europe. Under IRSES, staff
> exchanges are treated as secondments (i.e. exchange participants maintain
> salary in their institution of origin, and have the right to return).
>=20
> More information at: http://www.feast.org/fp7/?documents/people
> *
> Application*
>=20
> The proposal must be submitted by a coordinator from a European Member St=
ate
> of FP7 Associated Country (list available in the guide for applicants). T=
o
> be eligible, the consortium must include the organisation of the
> coordinator, an organisation from another European country (Member State =
of
> FP7 Associated Country), and an Australian organisation (or from any Thir=
d
> country).
>=20
> The size of such exchanges is left to the appreciation of the partners an=
d
> the available matching funding from Australia. Consortium from
> Australiawill be competing on a ?25m call with all other third
> countries having a S&T
> agreement with the EC and European neighbours.
>=20
>=20
> *Deadline for application is 28 March 2008* (but submission portal will b=
e
> open on 24th December!)
>=20
>=20
>  *Funding for European staff*
>=20
> European staff will receive a monthly subsistence allowance of ?1,800 fro=
m
> the European Commission, covering all mobility costs (including travel).
>=20
> *
> Funding for Australian staff*
>=20
> This Marie Curie action is not totally supported by the European Commissi=
on.
> Australian staff will need to seek funding from their own institutions or=
/
> and any domestic sources. In order to assist participating Australian
> research organisations, the new Commonwealth Department of Innovation,
> Industry, Science an d Research is considering providing some support to
> help cover these mobility costs.
>=20
> Funding worth $60,000 has been reserved through the strategic policy elem=
ent
> of the International Science Linkages programme to assist such Australian
> research organisations for this purpose. This funding is intended to supp=
ort
> travel and subsistence costs for a number of exchanges over the period th=
at
> IRSES is in place, and this initial level of support may be reviewed if
> demand is particularly high. Such funding would be available on a
> competitive basis and, to be eligible for consideration, Australian resea=
rch
> organisations would need to demonstrate that they are a member of a selec=
ted
> partnership under IRSES. In particular, the Department would be intereste=
d
> in supporting exchanges in certain research priority areas for collaborat=
ion
> with the European Union, including biotechnology and food, energy
> technologies (including clean energy), bioeconomy (including industrial
> biotechnology and agriculture) and climate change. The Department will
> provide further information, through the FEAST website, about this proces=
s
> and selection procedures in January 2008.
>=20
> *Next step*
>=20
>    1. Review IRSES material for eligibility and selection criteria on
>    Cordis
>     2. If you have key strategic partners in Europe, contact them
>    proposing them this opportunity
>    3. Engage your management, as you may need your institution's backing
>    4. Liaise with other stakeholders as extra funding might be necessary
>     5. Build the consortium
