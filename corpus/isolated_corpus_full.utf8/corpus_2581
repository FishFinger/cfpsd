Meeting Description:

Workshop on Multilingual and Comparative Perspectives in Specialized Language
Resources 26 May 2008 (Afternoon session)
To take place within the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC
2008) Marrakech, Morocco, http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/ 

Second Call for Papers

Organizers:
Béatrice Daille LINA-CNRS, Université de Nantes
Kyo Kageura, Library and Information Science, University of Tokyo
Marie-Claude L'Homme, Observatoire de linguistique Sens-Texte, Université de
Montréal

Background:
We are currently witnessing an increasing interest in multilingualism in many
different fields including IR (CLEF: Cross language Evaluation Forum, annual),
summarization (DUC), semantic aspects (SemEval 2007 Task 1: Evaluating WSD on
Cross-Language Information Retrieval), textual corpora, etc. Although issues
related to multilingualism have been debated in different workshops (as those
listed above), they are often considered from a computational perspective and
for specific applications. Seldom have multilingual resources and the different
problems related to their development and modelling have been considered as such.  

Also, the importance of assessing the quality of language resources is
increasingly recognized as far as monolingual resources and tasks are concerned.
Regarding specialized language resources the usual emphasis put on scale is
gradually shifting towards a concern about quality of corpora and language
resources. Also, as we start emphasizing the need to assess the quality of
multilingual resources, a set of new issues arises, such as quality criteria,
more detailed classification of factors that apply to monolingual as well as
multilingual resources, typologies of specialized corpora, terminological
characteristics that may appear in a language but not in another. There is an
acute need for addressing these issues and to explore multilingual and
comparative approaches in specialized language resources. These approaches will
come from different fields, including - but not limited to - linguistics,
terminology, information science and computational linguistics.

This workshop aims at bringing together experts from different backgrounds
concerned by the acquisition and modelling of multilingual specialized
information. The workshop will provide an opportunity to share experience on
multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized
information. It will also be a forum for discussing issues of a more fundamental
nature.
 
Topics:
- Equivalence in specialized resources and specialized corpora;
- Multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized corpora;
- Corpus-based approaches to multilingual modelling of terminological data;
- Multilingual resources for terminology processing;
- Linguistic evidence for multilingual NLP such as identification of cognates,
transliteration, morphological evidence, etc.
- Comparative approaches to terminological variation and semantic relationships;
- Comparative approaches to discourse analysis;
- Comparative and multilingual approaches to document characterization;
- Modelling of multilingual data in ontologies or other terminological resources;
- Evaluation of multilingual resources and methods for acquiring them.

Submissions:
Abstracts should be 5 pages long and submitted in PDF format at the following
address: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/MCPSLR/submit.html. Authors are
requested to send an anonymized version of their abstract. Accepted papers will
be published in the workshop proceedings and should adhere to the stylesheet
that will be adopted for the LREC Proceedings (to be announced later on the
conference web site).

Important Dates:
Submission of abstracts: 10 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 10 March 2008
Final version for the proceedings: 12 April 2008
