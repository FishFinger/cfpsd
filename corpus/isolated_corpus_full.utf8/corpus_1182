Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Ling & Literature; Sociolinguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop invites participants to explore the language of the Romantic era
in two different, yet closely related areas, i.e. stylistics and
language-change. What is the balance between innovation and conservatism in the
language and/or style of writers of the period (whether considered as
individuals or social networks)? How - if at all - does their language-use
relate to their ideology? Contributions addressing these and related questions
will be welcome. 

Reminder: Deadline for Papers: 28th February 2007

LMEC3 Workshop: ''Rebels or Reactionaries? Romantic Writers in the Vanguard /
Rearguard of Contemporary Linguistic Change''

29 August 2007, University of Leiden

Literary scholarship of the past 20 years has argued that the Romantics were
neither as homogeneous nor as innovative as previously perceived; in many cases
they were reactionary compared to the Enlightenment writers and in some cases
'it was the classical... style that was... linked with republicanism' (Butler
1981:5). Whether this claim, which is based largely on writers' literary and
political ideologies, is also true for their language-use remains largely untested.

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 15-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

The third PaPI conference will be hosted by Universidade do Minho in June
25-26, 2007. Phonetics and Phonology in Iberia (PaPI) is an international
conference aiming to bring together researchers interested in all areas of
phonetics and phonology, with a special focus on the relationship between the two.

It aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum in Europe for discussion of
phonetics and/or phonology and their related areas - such as language
acquisition, language variation and change, speech pathology, and speech
technology -, the phonology-phonetics interface, and laboratory phonology work.

The conference is hosted every two years by an Iberian university. The PaPI
2007 conference format will be the following: a two-day meeting including
four oral sessions of 30 minutes presentations (plus 10 minutes discussion)
of submitted papers, and two invited talks. The invited speakers of PaPI
2007 will be Mary Beckman (Ohio State University) and Elan Dresher
(University of Toronto).

Following the main conference, two parallel workshops will be held: 
Transcription of Tone and Intonation in the Iberian languages, organized by
Sónia Frota and Gorka Elordieta, with Carlos Gussenhoven (Radboud Universiteit
Nijmegen) as invited speaker, and Mary Beckman (Ohio State University) and Jose
Ignacio Hualde (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) as commentators.

Acquisition of Phonology and Clinical Linguistics, organized by Maria João
Freitas and Marina Vigário, with Paula Fikkert (Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen)
as invited speaker, and Elan Dresher (University of Toronto) as commentator. 

PaPI 2007 welcomes the submission of abstracts on any area of phonetics and
phonology. In recent years, experimental approaches and data evaluation have
been crucial in the process of answering many controversial issues within
phonological theory. Studies in phonetics that can significantly contribute to
enhance our knowledge of phonology and studies in phonology that crucially
resort to phonetics and corpora analysis are especially welcome. Preference will
be given to cross-linguistic comparisons and contributions on Romance languages
and dialects.

Abstract guidelines:
 
Abstracts should be written in English and not exceed one page of text (examples
included). An extra page may be added for references and/or figures. Font: Times
New Roman, 12pt; Line spacing: single.

One copy of the abstract must be sent anonymously and another one with the
author's name(s), e-mail address(es), and affiliation(s). In the latter, the
first line of the abstract should contain the title of the paper in boldface,
the second line the author's name(s), the third line the affiliation(s) and the
fourth line the e-mail address(es). A blank line should be left between the
title lines and the abstract text.

Submissions should be sent both electronically (Word or PDF format; PDF is
required if the abstract contains special fonts/symbols or figures) and by
regular mail to the following addresses:
