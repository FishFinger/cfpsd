Meeting Description:

The Ohio State University Conference on Linguistic Pedagogy
January 15-16, 2009
Keynote Speaker:  Kirk Hazen, West Virginia University
Organized by Hope C. Dawson & Brian D. Joseph, OSU 

Call for Papers

Linguistics is a still relatively "new" discipline as far as the academy is
concerned, and has not yet progressed to the stage at which it has its own
allied field of "linguistics education"; in that sense is unlike older, more
established fields such as mathematics or art (cf. the existence of
departments/programs of Math Education or Art Education at many universities).
Still, publications in the area of linguistic education are to be found in
articles and reviews in our journals from time to time (e.g. review articles in
Language such as Ladd 1982 (vol. 58, 890-6) or Nevis & Stonham 1999 (vol. 75,
801-9), and the "Teaching American Speech" pedagogy section of American Speech
(vol. 84.2 (2009)), and books have been written on the subject (e.g. Wray,
Trott, & Bloomer (1998), _Projects in Linguistics_)).  Informally, too, one can
observe discussions in the halls and offices of most linguistics departments
focusing on the techniques of explaining our field to undergraduate novices, to
graduate student linguists-in-training, and even the public at large.  

To promote awareness of linguistic pedagogy, the Department of Linguistics at
The Ohio State University has for the past 8 years held an annual lecture on
this subject, inviting a leading figure in our field known for teaching
excellence and innovation.  In connection with the 2010 Pedagogy Lecture, to be
given by Dr. Hazen, and to give further prominence to our belief in the
importance of paying attention to educational practices in linguistics, we are
convening a conference on Linguistic Pedagogy, to be held on January 15-16, 2010.

We thus invite those interested in presenting a paper on some aspect of
linguistic education to submit abstracts of presentations for possible inclusion
on the conference program.  Possible topics include, but are not restricted to,
innovative course design, proven methods for teaching particular subjects,
reflections on appropriate content, linguistics outside the classroom, and the
like; the focus need not be limited to introductory-level classes and
presentations may deal with undergraduate or graduate education, in the
classroom or the lab or even one-on-one advising sessions.

Anonymous abstracts should be submitted by e-mail, as attached pdf documents, to
both joseph.1@osu.edu and dawson.165@osu.edu, with an indication in the body of
the e-mail message of the title of the abstract and the author's contact
information (affiliation, phone number, and e-mail address).  Abstracts should
not be more than 500 words, including any bibliography or relevant data, and
must reach us by November 15, 2009.  Submitters will be notified about the
conference program by December 4.
