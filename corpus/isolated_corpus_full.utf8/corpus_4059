25th Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing
September 8-10, 2009
Palacio Miramar, Donostia - San Sebastián
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/sepln2009/

Introduction:
The 25th edition of the Annual Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural
Language Processing (SEPLN) will take place in the Miramar Palace in San
Sebastian on September 8, 9 and 10, 2008.

We also expect to organise three satellite workshops during the week of the
conference (see list of workshops).
The huge amount of information available in digital format and in different
languages demands systems that enable us to access this vast library in an
increasingly more structured way. 

In this same area, there is a renewed interest in improving information
accessibility and information exploitation in multilingual environments. Many of
the formal foundations for dealing appropriately with these necessities have
been, and are still being established in the area of Natural Language Processing
and its many branches: 
Information extraction and retrieval, Questions answering systems, Machine
Translation, Automatic analysis of textual content, Text Generation, and Speech
recognition and synthesis.

The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for discussion and communication
where the latest research work and developments in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) can be presented by scientific and business communities. The
conference also aims at exposing new possibilities of real applications and R&D
projects in this field.

Moreover, as in previous editions, there is the intention of identifying future
guidelines or paths for basic research and foreseen software applications, in
order to compare them against the market needs. Finally, the conference intends
to be an appropriate forum in helping new professionals to become active members
in this field.

Topics:
Researchers and companies are encouraged to send communications, project
abstracts or demonstrations related to any of the following language technology
topics:
- Linguistic, mathematic and psycholinguistic models of language 
- Corpus linguistics 
- Development of linguistic resources and tools
- Grammars and formalisms for morphological and syntactic analysis
- Semantics, pragmatics and discourse
- Lexical ambiguity resolution
- Machine Learning in NLP
- Monolingual and multilingual text generation
- Machine translation
- Speech synthesis and recognition
- Monolingual and multilingual information extraction and retrieval
- Question answering systems
- Automatic textual content analysis
- Text summarization 
- NLP-based generation of teaching resources
- NLP for languages with limited resources
- NLP industrial applications

Structure of the Conference
The conference will last three days, and will consist of sessions devoted to
presenting papers, posters, ongoing research projects, prototype product
demonstrations or products connected with topics addressed in the conference.
Besides, we expect to organize three satellite workshops during the week of the
conference.

Submissions
The proposal must be submitted earlier than April 24, 2009 and they must meet
certain format and style requirements.

Both the delivery and revision of proposals will be done exclusively in PDF
electronic format via the Myreview system:
(http://www.sepln.org/myreview-congreso25/)

We recommend using the LaTeX and Word templates that can be downloaded from the
conference webpage (http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/sepln2009/).

Besides, the proposals will have to comply the following requirements, depending
if they are communications, demos or projects:

Communications
Authors are encouraged to send theoretical or system-related proposals.
The proposals must include the following sections:
- A title of the communication.
- The complete names of the authors, their affiliations, address, and e-mail
(anonymous in the submitted proposal).
- An abstract in English and Spanish (maximum 150 words), including a list of
keywords or related topics.
- The proposal can be written and presented in Spanish or English, and its
overall maximum length will be 8 pages, excluding references, which can take up
an additional whole page at the most.
- The documents must not include headings or footnotes. 
- The papers proposed will be assessed at least by three reviewers, and can be
accepted to be presented either as posters or as communications, depending on
the program necessities. However, no distinction will be made between
communications and posters in the printed version of the SEPLN magazine.

Projects and Demos
As in previous editions, the organizers encourage participants to give oral
presentations of R&D projects and demos of systems or tools related to the NLP
field.

For oral presentations on R&D projects to be accepted, the following information
must be included:
- Project title
- Name, affiliation, address, e¬mail and phone number of the project director
- Funding institutions
- Groups participating in the project
- Abstract (2 pages maximum)

For demonstrations to be accepted, the following information is mandatory:
- Demo title
- Name, affiliation, e-mail and phone number of the authors
