The 14th edition will take place in Toulouse, from June, 5 to June, 8, 2007.  It is jointly organised by IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse -- CNRS, INPT, Université Toulouse I, II and III) and by ERSS (Équipe de Recherche en Syntaxe et Sémantique -- CNRS, Université Toulouse II).  The conference is jointly organised with the doctoral consortium RECITAL, (see the separate call on this site).  The conference will consist of oral communications and posters, invited talks, workshops and tutorials.  The main language for the conference is French, but submissions in English are accepted for non-french speakers.
