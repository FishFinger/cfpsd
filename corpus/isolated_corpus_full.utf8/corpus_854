Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

The topic of the conference is the investigation of concept types (sortal,
relational, individual and functional concepts) and their respective
relationships to frames (recursive attribute-value structures). The
interdisciplinary conference combines approaches from linguistics,
computational linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, philosophy of science
and the history of science.

Linguistic perspectives

Nouns in natural language can be related to different basic types of
concepts. The basic types are sortal nouns (cow); individual nouns (e.g.
proper names) and functional nouns (size) are marked as inherently unique;
relational nouns (part) and functional nouns are marked by involving one or
more additional arguments. The focus of the conference is on functional
nouns.

Linguistically, functional nouns are linked to grammatical phenomena such as
possessive constructions and definiteness. Cognitively, functional concepts
enable the unique identification of referents, for example as unique parts
of wholes, or as unique values of attributes. Therefore, functional nouns
and concepts are of special importance in the advanced evolution of human
language and scientific terminology. In fact, most lexicalised functional
concepts are the products of complex linguistic developments. 	

Philosophical and cognitive perspectives:

Frames, in Barsalou's sense, are recursive attribute-value structures. While
frames can be used to implement individual and sortal concepts, their
attributes can themselves be analysed as recursively interrelated functional
concepts. Given that frames are the basic format of concept formation in
cognition, attributes and frames might have neural correlates in our brain.
Frames are a natural linguistic and conceptual format for the representation
of complex ontologies that embody substance-accidence and part-whole
relations. Of particular interest is the relation of frames to complex
representational formats such as conceptual spaces  and mental models.
Functional concepts and frames play a crucial role in the human evolution of
a stable cognitive framework for communication and cooperation, in everyday
life as well as in science. Insofar as the objects of a scientific
disciplines are defined in terms of underlying frames, Kuhnian paradigm
shifts are related to changes in the frames employed science.

The conference invites contributions to the following topics:

-Semantics and logic of concept types, in particular of functional, relational and individual nouns.
-Typological characteristics of functional, relational and individual nouns, including the typology of possession and definiteness.
-Historical development of functional and relational nouns and their grammatical integration.
-Semantics, typology and evolution of stative dimensional verbs such as
cost, weigh, mean.
-Automatic classification of noun types in natural language corpora.
-Frames as meaning representations in compositional and decompositional
semantics.
-The evolution of meaning and the role of functional concepts and
frames therein.
-The structure of scientific ontologies, especially in medicine and biology, and their relation to functional concepts and frames.
-The development of central functional concepts such as ''substance'' in the history of metaphysics.
-Functional concepts and frames in scientific theory and practice, from a historical perspective, in particular in the history of medical science.
-The relation of changes of scientific frames to paradigm shifts.
-Potential neural correlates and neural net models of functional concepts and frames.
-Formalization and computational modeling of functional concepts and
frames.

Subject: 2nd Qatar TESOL International Conference 

	

Full Title: 2nd Qatar TESOL International Conference 
Short Title: QTESOL 

Date: 13-Apr-2007 - 14-Apr-2007
Location: Doha, Qatar 
Contact Person: Kourosh Lachini
Meeting Email: klachini@qu.edu.qa
Web Site: http://www.qatartesol.org/call.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

The theme for the second annual Qatar TESOL 2007 conference is Challenges and Solutions in ELT. Proposals which apply this theme to the context of the classroom of the Gulf are welcome. 

Many changes are taking place in education in the region, and educational reforms are being implemented. Government policy is looking to the future, model schools are opening, and ELT professionals are working in a changing environment. How are we meeting these challenges? What solutions are we finding in our own teaching situations? How are students responding to these solutions? Is learning improving? What techniques, methods, materials and activities best meet the needs of students? The Qatar TESOL Conference committee is looking for proposals which offer innovative answers to these questions.Presenting at QatarTESOL is not just for well-known professionals, but a way for all of us to take an active role in our teaching community, ask important questions, share our knowledge, and learn from the experience of others. Teachers and administrators from the following areas are invited to present:

--Primary schools
--Secondary schools
--Independent schools
--University / College preparatory/foundation programs
--Adult education institutions

Types of Proposals:

Qatar TESOL invites proposals for papers, demonstrations, workshops, poster sessions, and roundtable discussions. When submitting your proposal, consider which of the categories below it would fit into:
- Young learners / Elementary: Reading 
- Call: Writing 
- Cross-cultural Education: Speaking
- Independent Learners: Listening
- Materials Writing: Vocabulary 
- Teacher Education: Grammar
- Administration: Assessment 
 
How to Submit Your Proposal:
You must submit a separate proposal form for each proposal. This form requires you to submit details of the presenter (biodata), the type & title of your presentation, a description of the session and an abstract for the conference program. Send your proposal by email attachment to Kourosh Lachini at klachini@qu.edu.qa. Please do not send your proposal in the body of an email. Alternatively, you can fax your proposal to +974 4873664.
