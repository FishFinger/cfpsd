Presentation
RECITAL 2009, the NLP annual conference for students and young researchers
associated to TALN, will take place in Senlis (France) from 24th to 26th june 2009.

RECITAL is reserved for PhD students and young doctors who passed their PhD up
to one year ago.

RECITAL has a calling to offer to young NLP researchers the opportunity to
present their research works and to compare their approaches. This conference
has its own program committee which is composed of researchers and PhD students.
Submissions accepted by the committee are published in the same conference book
as TALN papers.

The official conference language is French. English submissions are accepted for
non French-speaking people.

Scientific Directions
Submissions have to be about one of those thematics :
- Information research and NLP, information extraction, automatic summarization,
Q/A systems;
- Morphologic automatic analysis, syntax, semantics, lexical semantics, speech;
- Automatic translation and alignement ;
- Human to machine communication in natural language;
- Automatic generation and text planification ;
- Systems evaluation;
- Acquiring resources and resources development (lexicon, ontology, grammars ...)

Selection Criterion
Authors must exclusively be PhD students, Master Degree students or young
doctors (who passed their PhD at most one year ago). Submissions which appear to
have been co-written by confirmed researchers will be rejected (this type of
submission has to be submitted to TALN, not to RECITAL).
Authors are encouraged to submit original research works, which have not been
previously published. Submissions will be examined by at least two domain
specialists. Most important aspects to be considered:
- Contribution importance and originality;
- Scientific and technical contents have to be correct;
- Results discussion, in particular compared to other domain research works;
- Presentation organization and clarity;
- Adequation to the conference thematics.
 
Selected papers will be published in the conference book. According to the
program comittee opinion, presentation will be either oral or posters. A prize
for the best paper will be awarded. 

Submission Format and Modalities
Articles have to be written in French (or in English for non French-speaking
people), and shall not be over ten pages, references and figures included, in
pdf format. A LaTeX stylesheet and Word/OpenOffice models will be available on
the conference website.
 
Double submission of the same article to both TALN and RECITAL is forbidden.

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

Praxiling UMR 5267 CNRS (Université Paul Valéry, Montpellier 3), and the
Laboratoire des Sciences de la Parole, Académie Universitaire Wallonie-Bruxelles
(Université de Mons-Hainaut), co-organize an international workshop on nasals
and nasalization in phonetics and phonology. 

The workshop will be held on Friday June 5th 2009 from 9 AM to 6.30 PM, Grand
Amphithéâtre de la Délégation régionale du CNRS, 1919, route de Mende, F-34293
Montpellier cedex 5. 

Second Call for Papers

The aim of this international workshop is to allow researchers around the world
to meet and exchange about their recent work on nasals and nasalization. We
welcome every submission concerning nasalization, in particular those concerning
: speech production (articulatory measurements, aerodynamic studies, acoustic
analysis, etc.), perception of nasalization, phonological studies, phonetic
universals, modelling, poorly described languages, pathological and clinical
aspects of nasalization, language acquisition, L2 learning, etc. We are
specifically interested in proposals aiming at interconnecting these discipline
subfields: relationships between production and perception, cross-linguistic
studies, multiinstrumentation,links between phonological patterns and phonetic
constraints, convergences and divergences between L1 acquisition and L2
learning, etc.

Instructions for Submission
Deadline for paper submission is February 15, 2009.

Send to nasal2009@umh.ac.be a message including full information about the first
author (name, affiliation, paper and electronic address) and  the names of other
authors, and in attachment a pdf file containing your 4-page anonym paper. A
Word template is provided on our website.

Please note that all participants will be invited to submit a long version of
their paper (50000 characters) for a potential publication in a book to be
published by an international publisher. The deadline for submission of long
papers will be around September 14, 2009.
