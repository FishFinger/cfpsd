CONFERENCE THEMES
Since 1992, the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM) has successfully brought together leading researchers and
developers from the database, information retrieval, and knowledge
management communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify
challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and
information systems, and to shape future research directions through the
publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.
In CIKM 2008, we will continue the tradition of promoting collaboration
among multiple areas. CIKM 2008 topics are in the broad areas of
Databases, Information Retrieval, and Knowledge Management.
CIKM 2008 also includes an Industry track.

INDUSTRY DAY
Co-organized by Marius Pasca (Google, USA) and James G. Shanahan (Church
and Duncan Group, USA)

As CIKM 2008 will be held in Napa Valley, just one hour to the north of
San Francisco, one of the goals of the conference is to embrace the
innovative spirit of the Bay Area/Silicon Valley in bridging
further the academic-commercial gap in the database, information
retrieval, and knowledge management communities. To help achieve this
goal, we will having an industry day (separate from the industry
research track) where luminaries, primarily from industry and from the
VC (Venture Capital) community, will provide insights on how DB/IR/KM
technologies are/can be leveraged to make a billion-dollar success.

Confirmed speakers and panelists include:
- Andrei Z. Broder (Yahoo! Research, USA)
