Meeting Description:

This is a workshop within the 38th Poznan Linguistic Meeting, focussing on
historical approaches to text-type investigations. 

Papers are cordially invited for ''Text Types - Diachronic Investigations''. 

This is a conference session within the 38th Poznan Linguistic Meeting (PLM

- the fate of historical text-types 
- text-type characteristics in a historical perspective: lexis 
- text-type characteristics in a historical perspective: grammar 
- text-type characteristics in a historical perspective: pragmatic aspects 
- text-type characteristics in a historical perspective: stylistics 
- Language for Special Purposes in a historical perspective 

All paper proposals should be sent to conference organisers at
plm@ifa.amu.edu.pl, for submission guidelines see:

7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
Plus GALA - Gathering of Life-like Agents
17th - 19th September 2007
Paris, France
http://iva07.ntua.gr
First Call for Papers

Scope

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied agents in
an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able to interact
intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and especially with human users.

The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners
in computer graphics, animation, computer games, virtual environments,
artificial intelligence, natural language processing, cognitive modeling,
human-computer interaction and artificial life. Since the first IVA back in 1999
firm lines of research have been established and there is much that the graphics
and AI communities can learn from each other.

The domain of Intelligent Virtual Agents has become much more diverse and now
encompasses a wide range of disciplines; cognitive and social psychology,
communication models (conversational skills, interaction loops, conversational
analysis), non-verbal communication, sociology (modeling human / IVA societies),
HCI (intelligent user interfaces, gesture/body tracking interfaces), design and
arts (e.g., interactive installations with IVAs), and numerous application domains.

While initial research often focused on the use of IVAs in virtual environments,
they are now increasingly used in web-based interfaces, personal computing
devices and interactive television. The rapid advances in the field have enabled
it to be applied in both in research and industrial contexts. IVAs can provide
appealing characters for games and entertainment. They can also be used in novel
user interfaces or even as tools of psychological research.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners from
academia and industry with an interest in the design, implementation, and
evaluation of IVAs and IVA applications. We aim for a lively program of timely,
high-quality presentations and demonstrations to discuss the state of the art
and future of Intelligent Virtual Agents. Papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series.

This year, IVA'07 and ACII'07 (http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/acii2007/) are happening
close to each other. While we do encourage submitting to both conferences we do
highlight there are differences in topics of interest in each conference. We
highly advise authors to read them carefully. Papers submitted to both
conferences should be clearly different in their scope and topic.

IVA'07 will also host GALA - The Gathering of Life-like Agents - see
http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/donation/fund-drive2007/ 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
