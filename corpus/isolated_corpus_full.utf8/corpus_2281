Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 20-May-2008 

Meeting Description
ICGI-2008 is the ninth in a series of successful biennial international
conferences in the area of grammatical inference.

Grammatical inference has been extensively addressed by researchers in
information theory, automata theory, language acquisition, computational
linguistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational learning
theory and neural networks.

The conference will take place in the city of St Malo, a beautiful walled port
city, on the Brittany coast of France near Le Mont St Michel, with easy TGV
access. The conference will be hosted at the Palais du Grand Large, ideally
located in front of the sea and near the old town. 

Areas of Interest
The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of
original research papers on all aspects of grammatical inference including, but
not limited to:

- Different models of grammar induction: e.g., learning from examples, learning
using examples and queries, incremental versus non-incremental learning,
distribution-free models of learning, learning under various distributional
assumptions, learnability results, complexity results, characterizations of
representational and search biases of grammar induction algorithms.
- Algorithms for induction of different classes of languages and automata: e.g.,
regular, context-free, and context-sensitive languages, interesting subclasses
of the above under additional syntactic constraints, tree and graph grammars,
picture grammars, multidimensional grammars, attributed grammars, parameterized
models, etc.
-Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to grammar
induction including artificial neural networks, statistical methods, symbolic
methods, information-theoretic approaches, minimum description length,
complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic methods, etc.
- Broader perspectives on grammar induction, e.g. acquisition of grammar in
conjunction with language semantics, semantic constraints on grammars, language
acquisition by situated agents and robots, acquisition of language constructs
that describe objects and events in space and time, developmental and
evolutionary constraints on language acquisition, statistical modelling of
natural language, etc.

Historically the roots of grammatical inference have been in the modelling of
first language acquisition by human infants: we especially invite submissions
that address this theme, directly or indirectly. 

ICGI'08

9th International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference
St Malo, Britanny, France.

September 22 (Monday) - 24 (Wednesday), 2008

Conference Format
The conference will include plenary and invited talks, software demonstrations
and possibly poster presentations of accepted papers and tutorials. All plenary
and invited papers will appear in the conference proceedings.

The proceedings of ICGI-2008 will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume in
their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, a subseries of the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series.

Submission of Papers
Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper which represents
original and previously unpublished work. Simultaneous submission to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. The paper should be
written in English with the following format.

The cover page should specify: submission to ICGI-2008, title, authors and
affiliation, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the contact
author, a brief abstract describing the work, at least three keywords which can
specify typically the contents of the work. Postscript versions of the papers
should not exceed 12 single spaced pages (excluding the cover page) on A4 or
letter-size paper, and should be in single-column format using at least 1 inch
margins and at least 11-point font. Submissions deviating significantly from
these guidelines will be rejected without review.

The technical exposition should be directed to a specialist and should include
an introduction understandable to a non specialist that describes the problem
studied and the results achieved, focusing on the important ideas and their
significance.

All paper submissions, review and notification of acceptance will be done
electronically through the conference's WWW pages (http://icgi08.irisa.fr).

Deadlines
Submission of manuscripts: May 20, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 20, 2008
Final version of manuscript: July 14, 2008

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 29-Feb-2008 

Meeting Description

Second Language Acquisition research in context 

The conference will address issues related to Second Language Acquisition in
context, understood both in terms of contextual effects on (the) acquisition
(process) and in terms of practical issues such as language testing and
curriculum design. 

Call for Papers

Papers are invited on every aspect of empirical and theoretical Second Language
Acquisition research. However, priority will be given to papers that address
issues related to the theme of the conference.
Individual papers will be allotted 20 minutes of presentation plus 10 minutes
for discussion. Submissions should adhere to the requirements specified below in
sections A and B.

A. Abstract: electronic format.
1.The abstract (including examples) must comprise a minimum of 400 words and a
maximum of 500 words. Please note the word count at the bottom of the abstract.

2.The abstract should be sent as an attachment in Word or RTF format. The file
should bear the following name: surname_first name.rtf. The abstract should be
in a full (see 3. below) and an anonymous version.

3.The full version of the abstract for email submission should follow the format
below:
i.Title of the abstract/ paper
ii.Name of the author(s) (last name/ surname, first name)
iii.Affiliation of the author(s)
iv.Email address
v.Postal address.

4.The e-mail message carrying the attached abstract (full and anonymous version)
should bear in its header either ''Paper'' or ''Doctoral workshop''.

B. Organization of the abstract 
1.Choose a title that clearly indicates the topic of the paper and is no more
than one line long.

2.In the abstract, state the topic clearly.

3.When essential to the clarity of the argumentation, present linguistic data
(with glosses). Explain abbreviations at their first occurrence.

4.If the paper presents the results of experiments, but collection of data is
not yet complete, present the provisional results in detail. State the relevance
of the hypothesis to past work and indicate the nature of the experimental design.

Doctoral Workshop
The Doctoral workshop focuses on problems of methodology with regard to either
data analysis (interpretation of natural conversation, statistical data,
interviews, etc.) or research design (experimental design, corpus design, issues
of data collection, etc.). Each presentation will last 20 minutes and will be
followed by a 10 minute reaction by a senior researcher and 10 minutes of
discussion. 
Submissions should follow the same formal conventions as individual papers (see
above A and B). Please mention "Doctoral workshop" in the full version of the
abstract. State briefly the aim and the theoretical framework of your work and
then raise the methodological problems you submit for discussion. If your
presentation is accepted, you will be asked to send a more extensive summary to
the discussant of your paper.

Submissions/ Proposition de Communications
All submissions should be sent to eurosla18@gmail.com. All submissions will be
reviewed anonymously by the scientific committee.

Deadline for submissions: 29 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 22 April 2008
