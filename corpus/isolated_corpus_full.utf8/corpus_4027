Meeting Description:

EACL 2009 Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Acquisition
30 or 31 March 2009
Athens, Greece
http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cognitive/ 

Call for Papers

Paper submission deadline extended to 23 December, 2008 

Workshop Description
This workshop is focused on the relevance of computational learning methods for
research on human language acquisition. Developing and applying such
computational techniques that can improve our understanding of human language
acquisition will not  only benefit cognitive sciences in general, but will also
reflect back to NLP and place us in a better position to develop useful language
models.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP,
machine learning, artificial intelligence, (psycho)linguistics, etc. who are
interested in the relevance of computational techniques for understanding human
language
learning.

The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational and
cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and help initiate
 interdisciplinary research projects. Success in this type of research requires
close  collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. To this end,
interdisciplinary workshops can play a key role in advancing existing and
initiating new research.
This was demonstrated by some successful events like the previous edition of
this workshop held at ACL 2007.

Areas of Interest
Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:
- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning
- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language acquisition
- Computational models of various aspects of language acquisition, and their
interaction with each other
- Computational models of the evolution of language
- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human
languageacquisition
- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its
impact on the acquisition task
- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to
e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their
relevance to research on human language acquisition
- Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-
supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic,
biologically-inspired, active learning, various hybrid models) from  the
cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information
Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of completion
of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with previously published
work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the EACL 2009 main-
conference proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including
references. We strongly recommend the use of either the LaTeX style file or the
Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be found at
http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is
Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than December 23, 2008 using the
following submission
webpage  https://www.softconf.com/eacl09/cog-acq/

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program Committee. Authors of
accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to produce camera-ready 
versions of their papers for inclusion in the EACL workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.

Important Dates
- Paper submission deadline: 23 December 2008
- Acceptance notification sent: 30 January 2009
- Final version deadline: 13 February 2009

Meeting Description:

Web as Culture: Ethnography, Linguistics and Didactics 

Call for Papers

The World Wide Web is a cultural space in which new forms of social networking,
of creating, acquiring and teaching knowledge and competencies, and of
constructing personal and cultural identities have emerged. The International
Symposium "Web as Culture" is intended to address issues that are involved in
the processes of the construction and the perpetuation of social structures,
cultural narratives, memories, knowledge and language in the World Wide Web.
Particular emphasis is placed on sociocultural processes of transformation such
as the change of social networks, the change of teaching and learning cultures
and language change instigated by the World Wide Web. These sociocultural
processes of transformation will be discussed from various disciplinary
perspectives and at all relevant levels of analysis. It is very much in the
spirit and tradition of an interdisciplinary study of culture that we invite
scholars from all pertinent areas of research to participate in the
International Symposium "Web as Culture". Apart from researchers from the core
disciplines of ethnography, didactics and linguistics, we would particularly
like to invite scholars from the areas of media studies, literary studies,
sociology, anthropology, philosophy and neighbouring disciplines to submit
abstracts.

The plenary lectures will be given by:
- Prof. Dr. Henning Lobin (Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen)
- Prof. Dr. Angelika Storrer (Universität Dortmund)
- Prof. Dr. Jörg Strübing (Universität Tübingen) [to be confirmed]
- Prof. Steven L. Thorne, Ph.D. (Pennsylvania State University)

The Symposium will discuss the new cultural space provided by the World Wide Web
with a particular focus on three topics: (1) Networks, (2) Learning, (3)
Language. The three corresponding sections at the Symposium will address (but
are not restricted to) the following research questions:

1. Networks
- How does the Web change structures and mechanisms of sociocultural
interaction? How is the Internet influenced by social interaction?
- How do semantic structures and traditional concepts change on the Web?
- How is the cultural space of the Web created (from a sociological and
technological perspective) and limited?
- In what ways can ethnographic methods contribute to research into
sociocultural phenomena on the web and how would such an Internet-oriented
application change and influence the ethnographic toolkit?

2. Learning
- How do learning processes change on the Web?
- What role does the Web play in different learning environments and contexts?
- How can the Internet as a medium of information, communication and production
exert a positive influence on teaching and learning processes?
- What are the pedagogical challenges posed by the Web when it comes to
integrating the Internet into learning processes?

3. Language
- How does language use change on the Web?
- Which new forms of communication and genres have emerged on the Web?
- How can the Web be utilized as a linguistic and language-pedagogical resource?
- How do Web-specific interactions (e.g. in social networks and in web-based
learning processes) manifest themselves in language use?

Working languages of the Symposium are English and German. Please submit your
abstract of max. 400 words by 31 January 2009 to info@webasculture.de. We intend
to confirm acceptance of submissions by 28 February 2009. 
The paper presentations at the Symposium will be 20 minutes in length,
complemented by 10 minutes of discussion time. We expect to publish a collection
of selected papers after the Symposium.
