Call Deadline: 15-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of this bilingual conference (French/English) is to examine the
miscellaneous ways of using such a complex discipline as anthropology and its
methods in language learning and teaching and to gather some of the leading
specialists interested in these methods. 

Call for Papers

Meeting Description
« (?) The array of methods, observations and analyses available through
anthropology can help us to explain the complexity of a contemporary world
which witnesses contradictory movements of the explosion of diversity and
the end of boundaries » Augé & Colleyn

This is how one of the latest books which synthesizes the role of anthropology
(The Work of the Anthropologist (2006, Berg Publishers) justifies the importance
of anthropology in our contemporary worlds. Could the argument of the French
anthropologists Marc Augé and Jean-Paul Colleyn explain why anthropology and its
methods have been introduced (sometimes frenziedly) in language learning and
teaching, especially since the arrival of the much lauded concept of
interculturality in its didactics, which 'preaches' the acceptance and respect
of diversity, but struggles to connect discourse and acts?

Worldwide scientific literature in didactics but also applied linguistics
provides many examples of the introduction of anthropology in teaching/learning
programmes:
- Anthropology of the distant other (Jane Jackson in Hong Kong );
- Anthropology of the near (Judith Humery & Fred Dervin in Finland, method
based on the study of non-places);
- Anthropology of mobilities and intercultural encounters (Celia Roberts,
Michael Byram, Ano Barro, Shirley Jordan et Brain Street 2000);
- Cyberanthropology (Internet, asynchronous fora, videoconference, Second
Life... O'Dowd, 2007) ;
- Auto-ethnography (use of personal diaries, Marie-José Barbot 2006);
- Anthropology done by teaching staff and researchers in the classroom (Anna
Triantaphyllou 2002);
- Problem-based anthropologies such as the one theorized by Martine
Abdallah-Pretceille which moves away from a descriptive ethnology (2003:
17).
 
The purpose of this bilingual conference is to examine the miscellaneous ways of
using such a complex discipline as anthropology and its methods in language
learning and teaching and to gather some of the leading specialists interested
in these methods. The conference has its roots in a cooperative project on
cyberanthropology between the Universities of Paris 8 and Turku, Finland
(ACoNte, MSH Paris Nord) and in dramatic developments in the use of anthropology
witnessed in language learning and teaching in the past few years.

Papers should address research questions, including but not limited to the
following topics:
- Types of anthropological methods (interview, active/ peripheral participation-
observation?) and complementary methods of analysis (semiotics, discourse
analysis) used;
- The teaching and learning of these approaches/methods in language learning and
teaching;
- Contexts/fields in which the approaches/methods are used (far, near, places,
non-places...);
- The role and contribution of new technologies in the use of anthropology
(fields: Second Life, pod-/videocasting; collection tools: digital cameras,
digital voice recorders...);
- Impacts of these methods on learners and teaching staff in the long run;
- Language and intercultural autonomous learning and anthropology;
- Issues raised by the use of anthropological methods in language learning
and teaching. For teaching staff? Learners? Observed individuals?
(generalisations, ethical problems, face loss...) :
- Establishment of links between e.g. participation-observation and results;
- Learning objectives in terms of intercultural, plurlingual, pragmatic,
linguistic, academic competences and their integration/progression in curricula;
- Assessment.
The topic of training teaching staff for these methods can also be
discussed.

Invited Speakers:
- Martine Abdallah-Pretceille, Professor, Universities of Paris 3 & Paris 8,
France
- Thomas Hylland Eriksen, Professor of social anthropology, University of
Oslo (Norway) and Vrije Universiteit d'Amsterdam (The Netherlands);
- Shirley Jordan, Reader in French, Queen Mary, University of London,
Great-Britain.

Submissions in English or in French are invited in the following categories:
(1) Research papers (20 minutes + 15 minutes for questions)
These papers should document established results and/or present theoretical
reflections.
(2) Presentations on work in progress (20 minutes + 10 minutes for
questions and comments from audience)
These papers may address issues still being worked upon.

The author(s) should submit one 300-word abstract by e-mail (freder@utu.fi
and bfracchiolla@mshparisnord.org) by 15 May 2008. The abstract should
include: 
- the name, institution phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of each author;
- the title; 
- objectives or purposes;
- perspective(s) or theoretical framework;
- methods, techniques, or modes of inquiry;
- data sources or evidence;
- (results and/or conclusions/point of view)

Abstracts will be reviewed by the scientific committee for originality,
significance, clarity and academic rigor. Links with theory must be explicit.

Authors are requested to submit their papers before the conference (November 15
2008). A publication of the proceedings with refereed status will follow the
conference.
