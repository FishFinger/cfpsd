Meeting Description:

The focus of 'Dialogue Under Occupation' is the ongoing exploration of dialogue
and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occupation. Dialogue is
intended in the sense that understanding of differing perspectives comes through
dialogue. Discourse refers to the types of talk that the various stakeholders
involved in occupation engage in (e.g., political discourse, media discourse,
public discourse). 

Call for Papers

Description: 
The goal of the conference is to provide a venue to maximize the investigation
and application of differing perspectives (i.e., the dialogue or discourse of
the occupied, the dialogue or discourse of the occupiers, or the interaction
between opposing sides), and to actively promote greater understanding of the
ideologies, issues, concerns, etc. of individuals affected by occupation in its
various dimensions.

As we intend this conference to be interdisciplinary, we invite scholars from
various disciplines to submit papers that address the use of dialogue in the
creation, maintenance, resistance, and resolution of occupation.

Multidisciplinary approaches and models of dialogue analysis such as Dialogue
Grammar, Discourse Analysis, Critical Discourse Studies, Multi-modal Discourse
Analysis, Conversational Analysis, Social Constructionism, etc., are welcomed.

Strands
Papers relating to hegemony, power, agency, identity, among others, will be
particularly relevant. Be sure to identify the strand for your submission as
this will help to determine its applicability to the conference.
 
Discourse of Enactment: 
The language of the policies and politics of occupation (official contexts,
education, media, etc.).

Discourse of Transaction: 
The language of institutions and its role in spreading the policies, keeping the
occupied and the occupiers informed and/or misinformed (i.e., language of the
media, language of education policies that affect learners and teachers,
language of official public discourse).

Discourse of Reaction: 
The language of daily life under occupation: talking about the "self'' vs. the
"other"; historical narratives of the occupation; center vs. periphery; the
language of the ingroup, outgroup, and/or intergroup; the language of teachers
in relation to educational policies, and the language of students in reaction to
educational policies.

Discourse of Resolution: 
The language of peacemakers and peacekeepers, as well as the language of
resignation, acceptance, and coexistence. The language of educators who help out
building peace in occupied contexts (school and classroom experiences).

Submission Instructions:
Abstract (250-300 words) & Cover Sheet. You may submit a proposal for a paper
presentation (20 minutes with 10 minutes for questions), or a panel (maximum of
4 papers limited to a 2-hour block); posters may also be submitted for works in
progress.

Do not include any self-identifying information on the abstract; indicate only
the title and the abstract itself. On the separate cover sheet, include: 
	
1. Title 
2. Strand you're submitting to (i.e., Enactment, Transaction, Reaction, Resolution) 
3. Format (paper, panel, or poster) 
4. Author(s) 
5. Affiliation(s) 
6. Postal Mailing Address (for primary author) 
7. E-mail (for primary author) 

N.B. Incomplete or inaccurate submissions may not be considered.
