Special Issue Enculturating Human Computer Interaction, Journal of AI & Society
http://mm-werkstatt.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/documents/EHCI/

Deadline for submissions: 30 September 2008


----- Please feel free to distribute this call -----

We are living in a globalized world but local or cultural identities strongly
influence our patterns of behavior and our interpretation of behavior in
others by estblishing norms and values. Nevertheless, current interfaces
seldom reflect such cultural "mental programs" as Hofstede has termed this
effect. Thus, users are forced to adapt their way of interaction and
interpretation to a given (most of the time western) perspective. Instead it
would be much more reasonable to allow e.g. for culturally tailored
presentation of information. Although there is no principled approach yet to
challenge the importance of cultural patterns in human-computer interaction,
there are a number of promising results from a variety of research projects
around the world that have started to integrate cultural aspects in the
interaction. These range from artistic work over web design to CSCW support
tools and training applications with conversational virtual characters.
Bringing together the leading reseachers from these emerging research streams
in this special issue will further discussions and contribute to establishing
a new research area.

The special issue will be centered around three main research challenges:
1. Models and Theory: Cultural norms and values penetrate all our interactions
by giving us heuristics how to behave and how to interpret verbal and
nonverbal behaviors. To make such a notion like culture available for
computation, we need theories of culture that precisely describe its effects
on interaction allowing for building parametrized models.
2. Empirical data on cultural/cross-cultural interaction: To realize technical
systems that take cultural influences on behavior and perception into account,
precise data analysis on how this influence manifests itself is necessary.
Because this information is often scattered throughout the literature, it is
necessary to provide (meta-)analyses of specific behaviors. Additionally,
there is a need for large databases of comparable multimodal corpora from
different cultures to assess variations in a principled way. From a developers
point of view, data on cultural differences in interacting with interfaces and
devices is necessary.
3. Systems and Applications: Having identified cultural influences on
verbal/nonverbal interaction behaviors, it remains to be shown how this can be
applied to the development of human-computer interfaces, for instance in
dynamically tailoring web designs to the user's cultural preferences for
information presentation, or in ASR systems taking the user's culture-specific
verbal behavior into account, or in virtual characters in games and training
applications reflecting the users' culturally determined nonverbal behavior
patterns. Moreover, the effect of systems taking cultural variables into
account has to be evaluated to provide a sound empirical foundation for
further developments.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Models and theories of enculturated interfaces
- Design guidelines for enculturated interfaces
- Field studies of intercultural interaction
- Standardization issues on resources and tools for enculturated HCI such as
multilingual/multi-cultural comparative corpus, verbal/nonverbal behaviors
annotation scheme
- Language processing for enculturated interfaces/multilingual NLP
- Multimodal processing for enculturated interfaces
- Culture adaptive interaction techniques focuing e.g. on conversational,
mobile, pervasive, or web-based interactions
- Computer supported intercultural collaboration
- Web technologies for enculturated HCI
- Ambient technologies for enculturated HCI
- Prototypes of enculturated systems
- Evaluation case studies/Evaluation guidelines for enculturated systems
