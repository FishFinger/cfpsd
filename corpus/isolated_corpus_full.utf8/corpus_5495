Meeting Description:

The workshop on 'Bare Nouns: Syntactic Projections, and Their Interpretatio=
n'
will be held at the University Paris Diderot - Laboratoire de Linguistique
Formelle - UMR 7110 CNRS on 26th- 28th November 2009. The workshop is organ=
ized
by the bilateral projects Hubert Currein - Picasso 2007 - 2009 (resp. Carme=
n
Dobrovie-Sorin, LLF Universit=E9 Paris Diderot, France) and Acci=F3 integra=
da
hispanofrancesa HF 2007-0039 (resp. Maria Teresa Espinal, Universitat Aut=
=F2noma
de Barcelona, Spain; http://seneca.uab.cat/clt/activitat /congressos.html).=
=20

Call for Papers:

The workshop will consist of 10 talks by members of the above-mentioned
projects, and 10 selected talks (30 min. + 15 min. of discussion) bearing o=
n any
aspects of the syntax and/or semantics of bare nominals including the follo=
wing:

-Should we assume three distinct levels of syntactic representation (DP, Nu=
mP
and NP) or only one (NP) or two (DP and NP)?
-Do we need to postulate little n and if so, do we still need Number as a
functional category or should we analyze Number as a feature?
-What are the parameters that are relevant for the crosslinguistic variatio=
n in
the use of bare nominals?
-Should classifiers be viewed as counterparts of Number or rather as
counterparts of Gender?=20

The languages of the workshop are English and French.
