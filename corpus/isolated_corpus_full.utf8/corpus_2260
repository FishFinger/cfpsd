its 12th Annual Graduate Conference in French Studies. Transmission is the
theme of this year's colloquium. How can this notion be defined? What can
or should we transmit? Who transmits to whom and why? These questions and others
will be addressed during the course of this multidisciplinary
conference, to be held on the 17th and 18th of April 2008, at the St. George
campus of the University of Toronto. We encourage all graduate students to
attend the conference and participate in the academic sessions dealing with
linguistics, literature, cultural studies, anthropology, pedagogy and more.
