Language Change in Bilingual Communities. Focus on the Post-Soviet Countries and
Their Immigrant Communities Elsewhere.

Workshop at  The 23rd Scandinavian Conference of Linguistics
October 3, 2008, Uppsala, Sweden

http://www.let.uu.nl/~Nino.Amiridze/personal/organization/PSB08.html

The workshop aims at giving a perspective on post-Soviet bilingualism while
concentrating on the typology of linguistic changes under language contact.

During the Soviet era, languages of the former Soviet republics have been
influenced by Russian, the Soviet lingua franca. The collapse and the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union has caused reshaping of the relations
between various ethnic groups within individual States, on the one hand, and
between Russia and the rest of the States, on the other hand. Language situation
and linguistic hierarchy within the newly independent countries have
considerably changed, depending on the relations with Russia, and the growing
influence of wider globalization.

The fall of the Soviet Union has caused unprecedented waves of immigrants from
the former Soviet republics to various parts of the world. Immigrant communities
from the former Soviet Union do not always have institutional support for their
native languages in the host countries. Keeping mother languages exclusively as
a means of communication in the family and within the community, the speakers
used to preserve some features of the languages that eventually got changed in
the varieties spoken back at home by their compatriots. On the other hand, under
the influence of the language(s) of the host countries, changes have occurred in
the immigrant languages.

Globalisation has influenced the area into a more open attitude with respect to
sign language and bimodal bilingualism. The former Soviet Union maintained the
medical model of disability, treating the Deaf as a disabled group. However, in
some of these States there are attempts to change the medical model with the
social one, and view the Deaf as a cultural and linguistic minority. One of the
positive consequences of changing the approach is the promotion of bilingual
education in the schools for Deaf, rather than pursuing exclusively oralist
educational policy. As a result of the changing attitudes towards sign language
and Deaf culture, Deaf people in the Post-Soviet States will become bilingual in
a sign and a spoken language (a case of bimodal bilinguality).

The following three topics will be addressed during the workshop:

- contact-induced changes that have occurred in the languages of the Post-Soviet
States under the declining role of Russian as a dominant language and the
growing influence of other regionally and globally dominant languages;

- contact-induced changes and contact-induced preservation in the language
varieties spoken by communities that have immigrated from the Post-Soviet
countries since 1991 to various parts of the world.

- bimodal bilingualism and language situation in Deaf communities of the
Post-Soviet States. How changing of attitudes towards deafness affects
sociolinguistic situation of users of sign languages across the former Soviet
Union. Influences of the structure of one of their languages over that of the
other language.

Invited Speakers:
- Anna Komarova (hearing) (Moscow Centre for Deaf Studies and Bilingual
Education), Development of Bilingual Education of the Deaf in Post-Soviet Countries.
- Tatiana Davidenko (Deaf) (Moscow Centre for Deaf Studies and Bilingual
Education), Sign Language Diversity in Post-Soviet Countries (translation from
the RSL into English by Anna Komarova).
- Kristina Svartholm (hearing) (Stockholm University), Bilingual Education for
the Deaf. A Swedish Experience.
