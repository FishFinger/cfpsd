NAACL-HLT 2007 Workshop
Rochester, New York, 26 April 2007
http://cenlp.iltevents.org/

Description:

Confidence estimation (CE) is a method for automatically estimating the
reliability of output generated by NLP systems. It is useful in =
scenarios where
the underlying systems make errors, especially when human users are
involved. This is the case in many areas of NLP, because systems are =
known to
be imperfect. Applications can exploit knowledge of likely mistakes to =
improve
their interactions with users and thereby enhance their overall
effectiveness. The workshop aims at bringing researchers from different =
NLP
fields together. We would like to provide a forum for sharing ideas,
techniques, and experience on common aspects of CE across different =
areas of
NLP. We hope to provide an opportunity for researchers to learn from =
previous
and ongoing work in other fields.

Main topics:

The workshop invites technical papers related to confidence estimation =
for
natural language processing. Possible topics include, but are not =
limited to:
* CE techniques for different NLP areas
* Design and training of CE models; machine learning
* Confidence features exploring different knowledge sources
* Evaluation and calibration of CE
* CE with imprecise or unreliable references
* Applications of CE in NLP
* Lessons learned from CE systems deployed in applications

Submission instructions:

Researchers interested in presenting their work at the workshop should =
prepare
a PDF (or postscript) version of their paper, maximum 8 pages (including
references) in the NAACL/HLT 2007 format.  Reviewing will be =
double-blind.
Submissions will be handled electronically using the START system. The =
dates
are given below.
