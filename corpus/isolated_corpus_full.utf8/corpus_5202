Meeting Description:

The 84th Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America will take
place in Baltimore, Maryland at the Hilton Baltimore from 7-10 January,
2010. Keynote speakers will be Colin Philips (University of Maryland),
Ted Supalla (University of Rochester), and Deborah Tannen (Georgetown
University). 

2010 Annual Meeting
Abstract Guidelines and Specifications

Those interested in presenting a paper or poster at the meeting are invited
to submit a one-page abstract between 1 June and 31 July, 2009. Further
information abstract submission can be found at https://lsadc.org/info/meet-
ann10-abguide.cfm.

Model abstracts may be viewed at http://www.lsadc.org/info/abstract-models.cfm.
Deadlines for receipt of abstracts: Friday, 31 July 2009. Technical support for 
abstract submission will not be available after 5:00 p.m. EDT on 31 July.
All abstracts and completed Abstract Submission Forms (available online at
http://www.lsadc.org/info/meet-annual.cfm after June 1) must be submitted to 
the LSA website by the deadline. Late abstracts will not be considered, 
whatever the reason.

The Program Committee requires that the subject matter be linguistic, that the 
papers not be submitted with malicious or scurrilous intent, and that the 
abstract be coherent and in accord with published specifications.
In 2010, there will be no more than six (6) simultaneous sessions of regular 
papers in each time block. As in the past, there is no upper limit on the 
number of papers in any subarea. Each abstract will be reviewed by members of 
the Program Committee and by external expert reviewers. When the Program 
Committee meets, members discuss the ratings that have been assigned to each 
abstract, and on the basis of these ratings and their collective knowledge, they
make decisions about acceptances and rejections. Then, they arrange each 
session, assemble the final program, and select session chairs.

General Requirements
1. All abstracts must be accompanied by a completed Abstract Submittal Form 
(available on-line after June 1).
2. The submitting author must be a member of the Linguistic Society. Nonmembers 
may join at https://lsadc.org/secure/login/login-settings1.cfm.
3. Any member may submit one single-author abstract and one multi-author 
abstract OR two multi-author abstracts. An organized session paper presentation 
counts as a multi-author abstract submission.
4. Authors who will be unable to present their papers personally should 
specifically name a proxy who will both read the paper and respond to questions 
that follow.
5. After an abstract has been submitted, no changes of author, affiliation, 
title, or wording of the abstract, other than those due to typographical 
errors, are permitted.
6. Papers must be delivered as projected in the abstract or represent bona fide 
developments of the same research.
7. Papers must not appear in print before the meeting.
8. Handouts, if any, are not to be submitted with abstracts but should be 
available at the meeting for those listening to the paper.
9. Abstracts for 20-minute papers and for posters must be submitted 
electronically and must be accompanied by a completed Abstract Submittal Form 
to be eligible for review.
10. Presenters must pre-register for the meeting.

Abstract Format Guidelines 
1. Abstracts must be submitted in PDF format.
2. An abstract, including a bibliography, if needed, and examples, must be no 
more than one 8 Â½ inch by 11 inch page in length, in type no smaller than 10 
point. References may be on a second page. Abstracts exceeding this length 
limit or in type smaller than 10 point will be rejected without being evaluated.
3. Your name should only appear on the Abstract Submittal Form. If you identify 
yourself in any way on the abstract (e.g. 'In Smith (1992)...I'), the abstract 
will be rejected without being evaluated.
4. Abstracts that do not conform to the format guidelines will not be 
considered.
5. A short abstract, intended for publication in the Meeting Handbook, will be 
requested from all authors of accepted papers. Specific instructions for the 
transmittal of this abstract will be included in the acceptance letters. These 
instructions, including the stated deadlines, must be observed or the paper 
will be withdrawn from the program. 

Abstract Contents
Many abstracts are rejected because they omit crucial information rather than 
because of errors in what they include. Authors may wish to consult the 
abstract models prepared by the Program Committee. A suggested outline for 
abstracts is as follows:
1. Choose a title that clearly indicates the topic of the paper and is not more 
than one 7-inch typed line.
2. State the problem or research question raised by prior work, with specific 
reference to relevant prior research.
3. State the main point or argument of the proposed presentation.
4. Regardless of the subfield, cite sufficient data, and explain why and how 
they support the main point or argument. When examples are in languages other 
than English, provide word-by-word glosses and underline the portions of the 
examples which are critical to the argument. Explain abbreviations at their 
first occurrence.
5. If your paper presents the results of experiments, but collection of results 
is not yet complete, then report what results you've already obtained in 
sufficient detail that your abstract may be evaluated. Also indicate explicitly 
the nature of the experimental design and the specific hypothesis tested.
6. State the relevance of your ideas to past work or to the future development 
of the field. Describe analyses in as much detail as possible. Avoid saying in 
effect 'a solution to this problem will be presented'. If you are taking a 
stand on a controversial issue, summarize the arguments that led you to your 
position.
7. State the contribution to linguistic research made by the analysis.
8. While citation in the text of the relevant literature is essential, a 
separate list of references at the end of the abstract is generally unnecessary.

Categories of Presentations
Members submitting abstracts of poster presentations and 20-minute papers 
should follow the instructions for abstract format and content carefully. 
Submissions in these two categories will be reviewed anonymously.
Note that members may submit an abstract as (1) a paper ('20 min'), (2) a 
poster ('poster'), or (3) a paper or a poster ('20 min or poster'). Submission 
type information is not accessible during the review process, to ensure that 
all abstracts are evaluated strictly according to content and not according to 
type of presentation. During the selection process, abstracts submitted under
the third category ('20-min or poster') are considered first as papers, and 
those that are not accepted as papers are then considered for inclusion as 
posters.

Poster Sessions
Depending on subject and/or content, it may be more appropriate to submit an 
abstract to the poster session for visual presentation rather than to a 20-
minute paper session. In general, the sorts of papers which are most effective 
as posters are those in which the major conclusions become evident from the 
thoughtful examination of charts and graphs, rather than those which require 
the audience to follow a sustained chain of verbal argumentation. Therefore, 
authors will want to make points in narrative form as brief as possible. The 
poster paper is able to 'stand alone', that is, be understandable even if the 
author is not present, and does not require audiovisual support.

20-Minute Papers
The bulk of the program will consist of 20-minute papers, with 10 minutes for 
discussion of each paper.

Organized Sessions
Information about organized session proposals can be found at
http://www.lsadc.org/info/pdf_files/2010%20Organized%20Sessions.pdf.
