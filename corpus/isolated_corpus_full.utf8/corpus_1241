  	           SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

 		    ACL 2007 Workshop on

        Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data
                        (LaTeCH 2007)

              28th June, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic

                  http://ilk.uvt.nl/latech07/

               Submission deadline: 26 March 2007

*********************************************************


The ACL 2007 Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage
Data will be held in conjunction with the 45th Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics, and will take place on
June 28th in Prague, Czech Republic.


* SCOPE AND TOPICS

Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large
collections of cultural heritage objects, such as archaeological
artefacts, sound recordings, historic manuscripts, or preserved animal
specimens. Large scale digitisation projects are currently underway to
make these collections more accessible. Of equal importance, however,
is the development of powerful tools to search, link, enrich, and mine
the digitised data. Language technology has an important role to play
in this endeavour, even for collections which are primarily
non-textual, since text is the pervasive medium used for metadata. At
the same time, the cultural heritage domain poses special challenges
for the NLP community, including the use of historic or non-standard
language, the presence of OCR or transcription errors in the input
data, and the necessity to deal with data from various media.

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- enriching cultural heritage data by inducing metadata
- dealing with linguistic variation and non-standard or
   non-contemporary use of language
- automatic error detection and cleaning
- adapting existing NLP tools for the cultural heritage domain
- linking and retrieving information from different sources, media, and
   languages
- representing cultural heritage data to different audiences
   (personalisation, text simplification, text summarisation,
   text generation from databases, hypertext generation) 
- knowledge discovery in cultural heritage data


* SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished
work in the topic area of this workshop. Submissions should should not 
exceed 8 pages and should be formatted using the ACL 2007 stylefiles,

papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.
