First Call for Papers

Workshop on: Multilingual resources, technologies and evaluation for  =

Balkan and Slavic languages

- associated with the RANLP 2009 (http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/)-

17 September 2009, Borovets, Bulgaria

Workshop page: http://www.c-phil.uni-hamburg.de/view/Main/RanlpBalkan09

The economical and political changes during the last years in Europe  =

have led to a major shift  of activities in the language technology  =

area. On one side the access for all citizens to global information  =

has become a real demand, on the other side the specific European  =

context with a big number of national and minority languages and the  =

exponential number of documents appearing every day, makes this  =

desiderata a real challenge.

Language Processing is now seen as the main technology being able to  =

give people access to information (no matter where it was produced) in  =

their own languages. Despite important developments, the  =

infrastructure in terms of languages resources (data and tools) for  =

less spoken languages , (especially Balkan and Slavic languages) are  =

still far behind the achieved standard for major west European ones.

As most part of the current LT-Applications rely on data-driven  =

methods, one major drawback in the development of language resources  =

for these languages is the lack of training and evaluation data , as  =

well as reference systems for comparing results. Well-known corpora  =

like JRC-ACQUIS and OPUS, although a significant step forward,:
- still do not cover all languages in Balkan area
- are collection of documents in specialised language and therefore  =

decrease the performance of systems trained on this data when testing  =

on other domains and registers.
In order to shorten this bottleneck, it is necessary to develop,  =

promote and make available data which can be used for training and  =

evaluation. In addition, it is important to know which systems have  =

been developed for which applications, on which data were tested and  =

with which evaluation results.

The aim of the current workshop is to make a first step in this  =

direction. We encourage submission of original, unpublished work  =

related to Balkan and Slavic languages  in the  following areas:
- data-set profiling for Balkan and Slavic languages
- development of multilingual resources (parallel and comparable  =

corpora, lexica, etc)
- multilingual and cross-lingual applications (IR, IE)
- machine translation
- evaluation of machine translation  and cross-lingual IR/IE systems
- evaluation protocols and measures
- usage of language independent models for the considered languages

Submissions will be made through the START System of the main  =

conference no later that June 20th, and should follow the formatting  =

instructions specified on http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/ under  =

?Submission Info?. Submissions should be ANONYMOUS and should not be  =

longer as 8 A4-pages.
