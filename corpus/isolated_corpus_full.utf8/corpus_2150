Hey, it's a kind of Academic Idol for naming departments.  Send me any 
suggestions for what our Department of Computing should call itself from 
next year.

This message was sent and authorised by Prof. Judyth Sachs, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Provost)

Dear Colleagues,

During the Review of Academic Structure, we committed to a process by
which staff might participate in selecting the name of their department.
The process to be followed and principles to be applied are outlined as
follows:

PROCESS & PRINCIPLES TO BE USED IN SELECTING A DEPARTMENTAL NAME

Staff have been advised that they may participate in selecting a name
for their department in the new academic structure. It is desirable that
names be established prior to year end to enable implementation
activities in 2008 to be carried out with any new names already
determined.
The following process should be followed in November to enable
department names to be finalised by 15 December.

Process:
November
1. Staff in any department may make a submission concerning the name of
the department in which they work, or in the case of departments to be
amalgamated, the departments in which they will work. Submissions may
made by groups or individuals.

2. If staff wish to change the name from that outlined in the final
version of the structure posted on the web, alternatives nominated must
take into account the principles from the Review of Academic Structure,
and two additional principles, which are set out below.

3. Staff have until 7 December to make a submission to the provost at
academicreview@vc.mq.edu.au

December
4. The Provost will consider a summary of the submissions, and make a
determination (by 15 December), with the Principles of the Review in
mind.

Principles:

The new structure must:
-	contain units that are easily understood in the wider community,
nationally and internationally, providing the basis for a more cohesive
profile and improved visibility for the university

-	be simple in character and support ease of communication across
  the university

Additionally:
-	a department name should explicitly and succinctly describe the
academic discipline(s) that are at the core of its teaching and research


-	 Department names should be of the form "Department of..... ".
Other brands can be used in marketing, publicity, and common parlance,
but in the formal academic structure of the University, a department
should be described as "Department of 'academic discipline(s)'".


We look forward to your input and ask that you make your submission to
academicreview@vc.mq.edu.au by the closing date of 7/12/07.

Best regards
Prof Judyth Sachs
