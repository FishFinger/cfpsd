### CROWNCOM 2009
4th International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications
June 22nd - 24th 2009, Hannover, Germany

http://www.crowncom2009.org/ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS

### Brief description
The owned spectrum allocation model in use today is believed to be obsolete. Firstly due to its intrinsic principle of fixed resource allocation that leads to a supposed spectrum scarcity, later revealed to be a question of non-efficient utilization. Secondly comes into play the need of introducing new wireless applications and services, which have experienced a huge growth in the last couple of decades, and are now supposed to cope with a multitude of already deployed standards. Both scenarios motivate the use of dynamic spectrum access in order to turn primary licensed networks into dynamic spectrum access networks (DSANs). This lends itself to cognitive radio, an enabling technology that will benefit several types of players and help to implement a more efficient approach regarding spectrum requirements in the future.

The aim of this conference is to bring together the state of the art research contributions that address the various aspects of cognitive wireless systems and technologies, including a broad range of communications, networking and implementation issues. We seek original and unpublished work not currently under review by any other journal, magazine or conference.

### Topics of interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

Track 1. New Trends
- Regulations, standardization and implementation for Cognitive Radio 
- Dynamic spectrum access networks (DSANs): 
  o Secondary markets 
  o Business models 
  o Industrial role 
- Trust and security mechanisms 

Track 2. Interference and Coexistence Analysis
- Interference metric modeling 
- Beamforming, MIMO and anti-jamming channel coding as interference avoidance strategies 
- Radio resource management and dynamic spectrum sharing 
- Spectrum sensing mechanisms and protocol support 
- Wireless network co-existence 
- Ultra-Wideband cognitive radio systems 

Track 3. Networks
- Novel adaptation and optimization algorithms suitable for Cognitive Radios and Cognitive Radio Networks
- Analysis of performance and performance enhancement methods of CRs, including methods for network management and QoS-provisioning.
- Self-organizing mesh networks and autonomic communications 
- Applications of cognitive networks (e.g. emergent and public safety networks)
- New architectures and platforms for cognitive radio & software defined radio 
- Radio access protocols and algorithms for the PHY, MAC, and Network layers 
- Cross-layer cognitive algorithms 

Track 4. Research Projects
- Large on-going Cognitive Radio & Networks related research projects in Europe, USA and Asia are encouraged to submit their latest results to CrownCom 2009.
