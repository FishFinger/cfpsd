Meeting Description:

Translation and Identity: Transforming the Personal toward the National and the
Global

This roundtable session will explore translation as a transformative and
creative process within personal, national and/or global contexts.  We will
discuss the role translation plays in the establishment of identity (one's own
and that of the target culture/language), the enhancement of intercultural
dialogue, and the promotion of mutual empathy through communicative performance,
in-service learning and study abroad experiences, as well as textual
translation.  We will also examine the heightened role and new significance of
translation within the ever changing global reality. 

We welcome a variety of perspectives and disciplines to this conversation,
including, but not limited to, cultural and ethnic studies, linguistics,
literature and gender studies.

Please submit 250-500 word abstracts to Miriam Margala
(miriam@ling.rochester.edu). For more info, please visit www.nemla.org.
