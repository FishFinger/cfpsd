have no means of enforcing these standards.

Job seekers should pay special attention to language in ads regarding
employment requirements and are encouraged to consult our international

University or Organization: University of Berne 
Department: Department of Linguistics
Job Location: Bern, Switzerland 
Web Address: http://www.isw.unibe.ch

Job Rank: Full Professor  

Specialty Areas: Historical Linguistics; Theory of language change


Description:

The University of Berne announces a Full Professorship in Historical
Linguistics
with special emphasis on the theory of language change at the Department of
Linguistics, starting September 1st, 2009 (second call).

The position covers teaching in the whole field of historical linguistics.
Applicants will be expected to have international experience in teaching
and research and a research profile characterised by an empirical focus
outside the Indo-European language family. Co-operation within the
institute, with neighbouring disciplines and institutions is expected, as
well as an active implementation of the Bologna declaration. Experience in
negotiating external funding of research projects is essential. As
dedicated co-director of the department the position also involves academic
administration, which means a good working knowledge of German is therefore
indispensable. 
 
Academic requirements for this position are a "Habilitation" or equivalent
qualifications (e.g. a second book).

The University of Berne is committed to equal opportunities in employment,
in particular to increasing the number of women in senior academic
positions. Women are therefore encouraged to apply.

Applications including a Curriculum Vitae, listing publications, courses
taught, externally funded projects, previous functions and involvement in
academic committees should be sent in paper form to the address provided
below. (Publications will be requested afterwards.) 

Please contact the Dean's Office for an information sheet (see contact
information below).

Applications to the first call (closing date April 5, 2008) will still be
taken into account.
