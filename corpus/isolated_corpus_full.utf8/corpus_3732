Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

This is an invitation to submit a paper to the International Conference on Computer Supported Education (CSEDU 2009 - http://www.csedu.org), which has currently an open call for papers. 

CSEDU will be held in Lisboa (Portugal) next year, on March 23-26, 2009. The deadline for paper submission is next November 18.

The International Conference on Computer Supported Education, which is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Education Society Portuguese Chapter, the IEEE Portugal, the Workflow Management Coallition (WfMC) and the Interdisciplinary Institute for Collaboration and Research on Enterprise Systems and Technology (IICREST), aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing new educational environments, best practices and case studies on innovative technology-based learning strategies, institutional policies on computer supported education including open and distance education, using computers. In particular, the Web is currently a preferred medium for distance learning and the learning practice in this context is usually referred to as e-learning. CSEDU-2009 is expected to give an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the pedagogical potential of new learning and educational technologies in the academic a!
 
 nd corporate worlds. 

The conference program includes a number of Keynote Lectures to be delivered by distinguished world-class researchers. The list of currently confirmed invited speakers is the following:
- Manuel Castro Gil, National University for Distance Education, Spain
- Mats Daniels, Uppsala University, Sweden
- Edmundo Tovar, Madrid Polytechnic University, Spain
- Thao Le, Faculty of Education of the University of Tasmania, Australia
- Wim Veen, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands
- Itiel Dror, University of Southampton, United Kingdom

Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process by a respected international program committee, composed of researchers with a PhD degree in one of the conference topic areas. 
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, in paper and in CD-ROM support. The proceedings will be indexed by DBLP and INSPEC. Other indexes have been contacted and may also include the conference proceedings in due time.
Best paper awards will be announced and presented at the closing session of the conference.

Please check further details at the CSEDU conference website (http://www.csedu.org/). There you will find detailed information about the conference structure and its main topic areas.

Workshops and special sessions are also invited. If you wish to propose workshop or a special session, for example based on the results of a specific research project, please contact the secretariat.

As a final remark, I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that CSEDU is co-located with WEBIST (http://www.webist.org) and registration to one conference allows free access to the other.

Kind regards,
Vera Rosario
