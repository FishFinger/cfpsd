Meeting Description:

Workshop on Consonant Clusters and Strucutral Complexity
July 31st to August 2nd, 2008
Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, University of Munich, Germany 

2nd Call for Papers

In the fields of phonetics, phonology and psycholinguistics there is currently a wealth of activity involving the analysis of complex sound sequences. Consonant clusters, whether occurring within individual lexical items, or emerging in running speech at word boundaries, give particularly striking evidence for the temporal complexity of human speech. The main aim of this workshop is to do justice to this complexity by bringing together researchers from a wide range of backgrounds, including speech production, speech perception, speech disorders, language typology, acquisition of first and second language, lexical processing.

Organizers: Phil Hoole, Lasse Bombien, Marianne Pouplier (Munich),
Christine Mooshammer (Haskins), Barbara Kühnert (Paris)

Venue: Munich University, Germany

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 07-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

2008 NooJ Conference
Budapest, Hungary
8-10 June, 2008 

Call for Papers

The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(HAS), LAboratoire de SEmioLinguistique, Didactique et Informatique (LASELDI, Univ. de Franche-Comté) and Maison des Sciences de l'Homme Claude Ledoux, France, are pleased to announce the 2008 NooJ Conference to be held in Budapest, Hungary, 8-10 June, 2008.

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used to
formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical and
productive morphology, local, structural and transformational syntax) using a
large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State Automata to Augmented Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes tools to construct, test, debug, maintain and accumulate large sets linguistic resources, and can apply them to large texts. NooJ is used as a linguistic engineering development platform, a corpus processor, an information extraction system, a terminological extractor, a Machine Translation development tool as well as to teach linguistics and computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ, download the software, linguistic resources, manual, tutorials and reference papers: www.nooj4nlp.net.

This conference will hopefully provide an opportunity for NooJ users, as well as other researchers interested in corpus linguistics, to meet and to exchange their experience of development, research or teaching. It will also be the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ (v2.0).

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 7, 2008 to
nooj08@nytud.hu . The abstract, in French or in English, should contain the
title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail and electronic address
of each co-author. All papers will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee.
Authors will be notified whether their papers are accepted or rejected by 30
April, 2008 the latest. The timeslot is 30 minutes for presentations, including
5 minutes for discussions.

Further information on the conference: www.nytud.hu/nooj08.
