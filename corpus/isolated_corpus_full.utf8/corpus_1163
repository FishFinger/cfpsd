SMSes (mobile phone text messages), 
emails, blogs and forums, 
wikis, 
texts published without reviewing. 

Submissions for the general session may address any of the usual topics of the
Conference: 
predicate-argument structures, 
the interface between lexis and grammar, 
exploitation of language resources (including manually constructed lexicons and
grammars) for language processing (including information retrieval, information
extraction, parsing), 
language resources concerning lexis or grammar. 

The languages of the Conference are English and French.

Submission information can be found here:

Short Title: DiSS'07 

Date: 02-Aug-2007 - 04-Aug-2007
Location: Edinburgh, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Corey McMillan
Meeting Email: papers@disfluency.org

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

DiSS'07 is the 5th in the series of successful interdisciplinary workshops on 
disfluency in spontaneous speech. The next workshop will be held in Edinburgh,
Scotland from 2-4 August, 2007. 

Second Call for Papers

Disfluencies - errors, self-repairs and hesitations in speech - present
challenges for researchers in many different fields, including phonetics,
perception and production in psycholinguistics, discourse analysis,
computational linguistics and automatic speech recognition.

This workshop allows researchers from diverse backgrounds to present their
research findings, discuss common interests, identify future directions and
establish new collaborations.

We invite submission of 4 page papers for review by March 8 2007. Suitable
topics include but are not limited to:
-Descriptive studies of error, self-repair and hesitation
-Cognitive models of error, self-monitoring and self-repair
-Experimental work on perception, comprehension, and production of speech
 with disfluencies.
-Computational approaches to processing disfluent speech
-Automatic speech recognition with spontaneous speech
-Theoretical approaches to disfluency in speech and communication disorders

The required format for paper submission and workshop details are available on
the DiSS'07 website: http://www.disfluency.org.
