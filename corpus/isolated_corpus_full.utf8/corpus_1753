Meeting Description:

Workshop Theme: Speech Sciences in Linguistics: Non-native speech production and
perception

In recent years, there has been an increasing theoretical interest in the study
of non-native speech in the field of theoretical phonetics, experimental and
acoustic phonetics, applied phonetics, experimental phonology and speech
technology. Part of the reason comes from the implications it has on the study
of native speech. Findings from the studies of non-native speech have shed light
upon the research of many aspects of the native speech. The study of non-native
speech has also implications on the second language education. With increasing
exchange of people and culture around the world, the study of non-native speech
as well as that of native speech has become an important subject that many
linguists believe may contribute to improving the theory and methodology of
second language education. In addition, findings from the study of non-native
speech can be employed in building computer-aided language learning
applications. Carefully constructed and annotated corpora of non-native speech
could be used to augment and improve language learning applications in
laboratory and commercial environments.

Potential topics include, but not limited to;
(1) Phonetics and phonology of non-native speech
(2) Perceptual aspects of non-native speech production
(3) Aspects of non-native speech in second language education
(4) Construction of non-native speech corpora
(5) Application of non-native speech
