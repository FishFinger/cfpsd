Meeting Description

The 17th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference will be held November 9-11,
2007, on the UCLA campus. This conference aims to provide a forum for presenting
research in Japanese and Korean linguistics, thereby facilitating efforts to
deepen our understanding of these two languages, which have striking typological
similarities. This year in addition to the general session, two workshops with
guest speakers are scheduled during the conference. 

17th Japanese/Korean Linguistics Conference
November 9-11, 2007

UCLA

Special Panels

''Progress in Generative Grammar; its characterization and assessment''

Fritz Newmeyer (University of Washington)
and others

''Usage-based linguistics: theory and methodologies''

Joan Bybee (University of New Mexico)
and others

Discussant: Patricia Clancy (UCSB)

Papers in all sub-areas of Japanese and Korean linguistics are invited.
Presentations will be 20 minutes long and will be followed by a 10-minute
question and answer period. Please submit abstracts (one page, 500 words
maximum) as a PDF file attached to an email message to JK17@humnet.ucla.edu by
July 15, 2007 (Please note this new deadline). You may use a second page for
references and/or example sentences. The first line of your abstract should
indicate the category (Formal or Functional), followed by the sub-field (e.g.,
Formal/Syntax, Functional/Discourse, etc.). The second line should be the paper
title, followed by the number of words used on the first page of the abstract,
excluding the first two lines with the category, the sub-field, and the paper
title (e.g., Title (492)). Omit your name and affiliation from the abstract. In
the body of your email message, include name(s) and affiliation(s), address,
phone number, and email address, followed by the category, the sub-field, and
the paper title (e.g., Title (492)) copied from the top of the first page of the
abstract. Use the following subject header for your email: ''JK17, Last name,
First Initial.'' Please note that only one abstract from each individual can be
considered for acceptance. One individual abstract or one jointly authored
abstract may be submitted.  All the necessary information about the conference
will appear on our conference website: http://www.alc.ucla.edu/jk17/.

Linguistic Field(s): Philosophy of Language; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 21-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:
Conference on game theoretic pragmatics: the role of preferences and decision
making in language use. 

Games and Decisions in Pragmatics III
November 23rd-24th, 2007 
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

URL: http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/gdpIII/index.html

Recent years witnessed an increased interest in formal pragmatics and especially
the establishment of game theory as a new research methodology for the study of
language use. Game and Decision Theory (GDT) are natural candidates if we look
for a theoretical foundation of linguistic pragmatics. Over the last decade, a
firm research community has emerged with a strong interdisciplinary character,
where economists, philosophers, and social scientists meet with linguists.
Within this field of research, three major currents can be distinguished: one is
closely related to the Gricean paradigm and aims at a precise foundation of
pragmatic reasoning, the second originates in the economic literature and is
concerned with the role of game theory in the context of language use, and the
third aims at language evolution seen either from a biological or from a
cultural perspective. 

It is the aim of this conference to provide a forum for research on game
theoretic pragmatics. Pragmatics is understood in a wide sense, including not
only classical topics like Gricean pragmatics, speech act theory, rhetoric, and
socio-linguistics, but also e.g. investigations into the role of rational
behaviour in language change. We invite talks that further our theoretical
understanding of the role of preferences and decision making in language use, as
well as empirical investigations into the validity of theoretical models. 

Invited Speakers:
Patrick Grim, St. Andrews
Arthur Merin, Konstanz
Brian Skyrms, Irvine
tba

Submissions:
Authors should submit an anonymous abstract. The length of abstracts for talks
should be at most 3 single-column pages including literature. All submissions
should include a separate cover page specifying the authors' names, affiliation,
address, e-mail address and title of the paper. The abstracts should be
submitted electronically (pdf, ps or doc format) to: gdpIII@zas.gwz-berlin.de

A selection of the papers of this workshop will be the kernel of a book
''Language, Games, and Evolution'' edited by Benz, Ebert, JÃ¤ger, and van Rooij
to appear in the series ''Texts on Logic and Games'' published by the Amsterdam
University Press.

Important Dates:
Deadline for Submissions: September, 21st 2007
Notification of Acceptance: October, 15th, 2007
Conference: November 23rd-24th, 2007
