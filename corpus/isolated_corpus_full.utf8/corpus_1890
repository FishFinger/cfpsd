                      Call For Papers

 

            ********************************************

           Paper submission: September 3, 2007 

 

            ********************************************

    
** OVERVIEW

 

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA).  This event
will be the fifth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

The ALTA Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Australian 
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues 
ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards 
for markup, through various aspects of document processing. 

The goals of the workshop are: 

 

 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community 
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; 

 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community 
   and with the wider international LT community; 
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; 
 * to encourage dissemination of research results; 
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research 
   and projects; 
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence 
   community to become aware of local LT research; 
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand 
   and overseas. 

 

As with the 2006 Workshop, there will be poster presentations 
in addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive

discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage 
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any 
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the 
same status in the proceedings.

 

** Topics

 

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished 
research on all aspects of natural language processing, 
including, but not limited to:

 

 * speech understanding and generation; 
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, 
   and discourse; 
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language; 
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language; 
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval; 
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling; 
 * summarisation; 
 * machine translation and translation aids; 
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems; 
 * natural language and multimodal systems; 
 * message and narrative understanding systems; 
 * evaluations of language systems; 
 * computational lexicography. 

 

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT 
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the 
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT 
applications and through multi-disciplinary research. 

 

** Submission Format

 

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL 
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including 
references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style 
files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's 
conference. The style files and example documents are available 
from the workshop website. We reserve the right to reject 
submissions that do not conform to these styles including font 
and page size restrictions.

 

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces 
problems, please contact the organisers beforehand.

 

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be 
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged 
to send an early version with the typographical complexity of 
your final intended version so that we can check it is printable. 
All papers should include the full authors' names and affiliations. 
(Note that this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines 
adopted for ACL conferences.)

 

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at 
the workshop website. 

Contact the organisers (workshop AT alta DOT asn DOT au) for 
any questions regarding this process.

 

**Proceedings

 

A proceedings containing all papers (presentations and posters) 
will be produced in paper and/or CD-ROM format. Each format 
will have an ISBN number.


**Important Dates

 

 * Paper submission: September 3, 2007 
 * Submission date for Hons/Ugrad students: Sept 17, 2007 (see below) 
 * Notification of acceptance: October 5, 2007 
 * Camera-ready copy: October 19, 2007 
 * Workshop: December 10-11, 2007 

 

Note that we have instituted a later submission deadline for papers 
with **first-named** authors that are current Honours or Undergraduate 
students. If you qualify for this condition and plan to submit to 
this deadline then you must register an "Intention to Submit" with 
the workshop chairs by the normal submission due date (Sept 8). 
Send an email to the organisers (workshop AT alta DOT asn DOT au) 
with title, authors, and abstract.
