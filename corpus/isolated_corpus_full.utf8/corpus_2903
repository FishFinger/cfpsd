Full Title: Biolinguistics: Acquisition and Language Evolution 

Date: 02-Jul-2008 - 04-Jul-2008
Location: York, North Yorkshire, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Koji Kawahara
Meeting Email: lang504@york.ac.uk
Web Site: http://www.york.ac.uk/conferences/bale2008/index.html 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

Conference on biological aspects of human language with specific focus on language acquisition and language evolution, Department of Language and Linguistic Science, University of York 

Extended Deadline for Biolinguistics: Acquisition and Language Evolution

Venue: University of York, United Kingdom
Date: 2-4 July, 2008
Invited Speakers:
Koji Fujita (Kyoto University)
Jim Hurford (University of Edinburgh)
Simon Kirby (University of Edinburgh)
Juan Uriagereka (University of Maryland)

A major goal of current linguistic research is to understand the unique language ability of human beings. A central question is the nature of our genetic endowment for language, as reflected in its acquisition and its neurological and biological underpinnings. The key questions of language acquisition include the extent and role of innate knowledge of linguistic structure and the interaction of such knowledge with the ambient language input to which children are exposed. 

Language evolution, similarly, questions the possible origin of a unique 'language faculty'. Hypotheses regarding both acquisition and evolution must confront the issue of the interaction of Universal Grammar with other human cognitive and perceptuomotor capacities. At the same time, cultural and historical perspectives on evolution are also needed, as are insights from interdisciplinary fields such as psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, genetics and computational modelling. This conference would like to invite contributions for these or other disciplines which can address any or all of the three topics named in our title. 

We call for papers for 20-minute talk and 10-minute discussion. Anyone may submit one abstract as the sole author and a second as co-author, or two as co-author. 

All abstracts must be submitted by 15 April, 2008. Abstracts should conform to the following specifications: 

PDF format, with file name ''Lastname'' (e.g., Chomsky.pdf). 

Typed in 12 pt and 1-inch margins. 

Abstract should be no more than 500 words in length. Data, graphics, and references are not included in the final count, but please interleave data with the main body of the abstract. There is no limit in total abstract (including data, graphics and references). 

Author name(s) should not appear on the main body of the abstract. 

For abstract submission, please visit our website:http://www.york.ac.uk/conferences/bale2008/index.html

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 20-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

It's been almost two years since the first Papuanists' Workshop (summarised at http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/elac/2006/11/papuanists_workshop_wrapup.html) and now it's time for another. The linguistics departments at Sydney University and in RSPAS at the ANU are organising the second Papuanists' Workshop. It will be held on Saturday and Sunday 28-29 June 2008 at the University of Sydney, right before Lingfest gets started (http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/). 

2nd Sydney Papuanists' Workshop

Now calling for papers and for registration of participants.

Anyone who has an interest in Papuan languages and linguistics is invited to come and present a paper or just listen to other people's papers and join in the discussion.

Papers should be 20 or 40 mins long and on a topic related to Papuan languages or linguistics. We're hoping to have one day dedicated to talks on the theme of 'giving back to the community', making practical use of our linguistic research for the benefit of the community by such means as developing orthographies and producing educational materials. Talks related to topics of this sort are especially welcome.

For more information on the conference, see the conference website, http://conferences.arts.usyd.edu.au/index.php?cf=19 , which is being constantly updated.

The closing date for abstracts is 20 April 2008. To submit a title and abstract for a paper or to register, e-mail James McElvenny at james.mcelvenny at arts.usyd.edu.au

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
