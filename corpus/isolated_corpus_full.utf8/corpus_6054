Call for Papers

The Athens Institute for Education and Research (ATINER) was established in 
1995 as an independent academic organization with the mission to become a 
forum, where academics and researchers - from all over the world - could meet 
in Athens and exchange ideas on their research and discuss the future 
developments of their discipline. Since 1995, ATINER has organized more than 
100 international conferences and has published over 80 books. Academically, 
the Institute consists of four research divisions and nineteen research units. 
Each research unit organizes at least an annual conference and undertakes 
various small and large research projects.

The aim of the conference is to bring together scholars and students of
languages, literatures and linguistics.  Areas of interest include (but are not 
confined to):

- Literatures and Languages
- Classics

- Contemporary Literature
- Comparative Literature
- Drama, Film, Television, and other Media
- Poetry and Prose (Fictional and Non-fictional)
- Translation
- Linguistics
- Theoretical Linguistics
- Language Acquisition
- Teaching of Foreign Languages (including Technology in the classroom)
- Sociolinguistics 

Selected papers will be published in Special Volumes of Conference Proceedings.

Please submit a 300-word abstract by 8th of January 2010, by email 
atiner@atiner.gr or mail, to: Dr. Gilda Socarras, Academic Member, ATINER & 
Assistant Professor, Auburn University, USA.  

Abstracts should include: Title of Paper, Family Name (s), First Name (s),
