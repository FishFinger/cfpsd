The co-editors, Lise Fontaine, Tom Bartlett and Gerard O'Grady of Cardiff
University, invite contributions on the topic of 'choice' for an edited
volume entitled "'Choice': Critical Considerations in Systemic Functional
Linguistics," to be published with Cambridge University Press (pending
acceptance of the book proposal), to appear early 2011.

Please send an extended abstract of 800 words together with contact
information and a short biographical outline to Lise Fontaine
[FontaineL@cf.ac.uk]. 

Deadline for submission:  January 21, 2010

Notification of Acceptance: February 21, 2010 

All proposals will be reviewed and a decision about possible inclusion is
expected to be made within four weeks. Acceptance of your abstract does not
guarantee inclusion of your chapter in the book, as the final chapter draft
will be subject to further review. It is expected that full manuscripts
will be submitted by the end of June 2010. This date will be announced in
the letters of acceptance.


Rationale

'Choice' as a theoretical term is central to Systemic Functional
Linguistics (SFL). The notion of 'choice' somehow encompasses everything
important to systemic linguistics where language is seen primarily as a
resource for making or constructing meaning and where speakers are assumed
to be making choices among potential meanings. 

The great importance given to the term 'choice' is certainly not disputed;
however the concept itself has not been the subject of a comprehensive
study. Despite the lack of literature on this subject, the term itself is
pervasive and used both commonly and technically, often without
distinction. In fact, despite being what makes SFL an attractive view of
language, 'choice' as a term is also at the source of criticism precisely
for the fact that it has not been explicitly defined or debated. 'Choice'
is therefore the most important and significant concept and at the same
time the most problematic. 

This book will take up the challenge of dealing explicitly with the
centrality of choice in SFL by theorizing 'choice' and by offering a
comprehensive and coherent treatment of its place and use in SFL.

Book Contents
"'Choice': Critical Considerations in Systemic Functional Linguistics"
seeks to explore the concept of choice in the following main areas:

Section 1 - Choice: Theory and debate
Section 2 - Cognitive and Neurolinguistic views on 'choice'
Section 3 - Intra-linguistic constraints on choice (including co-selection
and multi-word expressions)
Section 4 - Extralinguistic constraints on choice (including social context)
Section 5 - Choice in Computational frameworks
Section 6 - Views on 'choice' from the analyst's perspective

Contributions:
Final manuscripts will be between 7,000 and 9,000 words. The paper
submissions must follow the editorial guidelines, which can be obtained
from The Cambridge University Press website: http://www.cambridge.org.

Schedule for the edited volume:
The deadline for initial submissions in the form of extended abstracts of
approximately 800 words is 21 January 2010.  

Contributors whose chapters are felt appropriate for the volume will be
included in the proposal to Cambridge University Press. It is intended that
the book will be published in early 2011. 
- Extended abstract submissions: 21 January 2010
- The selection of papers and contacting selected authors: 21 February 2010
- Completed manuscripts: June 2010 (est.)
