CALL FOR PAPERS

The 1st ACM Workshop on Large-Scale Multimedia Retrieval and Mining 
(LS-MMRM)
in conjunction with 2009 ACM International Conference on Multimedia 
(ACM-MM)
Beijing Hotel, Beijing, China
October 23, 2009

Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of multimedia content 
driven by the wide availability of massive storage devices, 
high-resolution video cameras and fast networks.  Stimulated by recent 
progress in scalable machine learning, feature indexing and multi-modal 
analysis techniques, researchers are becoming increasingly interested in 
exploring challenges and new opportunities for developing much larger 
scale approaches for multimedia retrieval and mining.  Many of these 
computationally-intensive ideas are now becoming practical because of the 
broader availability of high-speed clusters and the advent of cloud 
computing.  

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industrial 
practitioners interested in large-scale multimedia retrieval and mining. 
The workshop will provide a venue for the participants to explore a 
variety of aspects and applications on how advanced multimedia analysis 
techniques can be leveraged to address the challenges in large-scale data 
collections. We solicit high-quality original papers for the technical 
sessions that address important issues in large-scale multimedia analysis, 
and which demonstrate that the proposed approaches scale to sufficiently 
large multimedia collections (e.g., hundreds of thousands of images, or 
hundreds of hours of video or audio content). The list of possible topics 
includes, but is not limited to:

- Indexing and retrieval for large multimedia collections (including 
images, video, audio and other multi-modal systems)
- Near-duplicate detection over large data sets
- Large-scale video event and temporal analysis over diverse sources
- Web-scale social-network and content-network analysis
- Automatic machine tagging, semantic annotation and object recognition on 
massive multimedia collections
- Collaborative image and video annotation for distributed users
- Interfaces for exploring, browsing and visualizing large multimedia 
collections
- Scalable and distributed machine learning and data mining methods for 
multimedia data
- Scalable and distributed multimedia content analysis systems
- Construction of standardized large-scale multimedia collections

Submissions for this workshop are required to follow the same format as 
regular ACM Multimedia papers with no more than 8 pages. All submitted 
papers will go through a peer review process. We plan to invite extended 
versions of selected papers for a special issue of a top-tier multimedia 
journal.

Additional information is available at the ACM Multimedia website:

Important Dates:
Jun. 19, 2009 (Friday): Submission Deadline
Jul. 17, 2009 (Friday): Acceptance Notification
Jul. 24, 2009 (Friday): Camera-Ready papers

Workshop Chairs:
Rong Yan (IBM TJ Watson Research)
Qi Tian (Microsoft Research Asia)
John R. Smith (IBM TJ Watson Research)
