CoNLL is the yearly conference organized by SIGNLL (the ACL Special
Interest Group on Natural Language Learning). Previous CoNLL meetings
were held in Madrid (1997), Sydney (1998), Bergen (1999), Lisbon
(2000), Toulouse (2001), Taipei (2002), Edmonton (2003), Boston
(2004), Ann Arbor (2005), New York (2006) and Prague (2007). This
year, 2008, CoNLL will be collocated with COLING in Manchester, UK.

See http://ifarm.nl/signll/ and http://ifarm.nl/signll/conll/
for more information about SIGNLL and CoNLL. The official Web site
of CoNLL-2008 can be found at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2008/

CoNLL is an international conference for research on natural language
learning. We invite submission of papers about natural language
learning topics, including, but not limited to:

 * Computational models of human language acquisition
 * Computational models of the evolution of language
 * Machine learning methods applied to natural language
   processing tasks (speech processing, phonology, morphology,
   syntax, semantics, discourse processing, language
   engineering applications)
 * Statistical methods (Bayesian learning, graphical models,
   kernel methods, statistical models for structured problems)
 * Symbolic learning methods (rule induction and decision
   tree learning, lazy learning, inductive logic programming,
   analytical learning, transformation-based error-driven learning)
 * Biologically-inspired methods (Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computing)
 * Reinforcement learning
 * Active learning, ensemble methods, meta-learning
 * Learning architectures for structural and relational NLP tasks
 * Computational learning theory analysis of language learning
 * Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods
 * Models of induction and analogy in linguistics

Special Topic of Interest
-------------------------

This year we wish to encourage the submission of papers on models that
explain natural phenomena relating to human language. This has two
strands.

The first concerns the central scientific problem addressed by CoNLL:
the study of first language acquisition. The only systems that we know
of that can process language accurately are humans; the acquisition of
their first language by infant children is one of the central problems
of cognitive science. We invite papers that address this problem using
computational models; including papers that address purely linguistic
aspects of the problem, papers that model psycholinguistic data, or
papers that apply learning theoretic analysis to language acquisition.

The second theme is the central engineering problem: how to build
systems that do something useful: we are interested in complete
systems that solve real problems.  Thus we particularly invite papers
that are evaluated on naturally occurring annotations, such as machine
translation, language modelling, or question answering.  We are also
interested in work that evaluates the contribution of components which
predict linguist-defined intermediate structure such as part-of-speech
tags, semantic roles, or syntactic analyses to the performance of real
systems.  Important issues such work might study are the correlation
of the component's performance on the sub-task with its impact on the
end system performance and alternative architectures for incorporating
predictions from different components.

Shared Task:
------------

The shared task for this CoNLL is "Joint Parsing of Syntactic and
Semantic Dependencies".

The task proposes the merging of both syntactic dependencies
(extracted from the Penn Treebank ) and semantic dependencies
(extracted both from PropBank and NomBank) under a unique unified
representation. The task has several novel objectives:

1. The first objective, performing Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) on
   a dependency-based representation, is to our knowledge novel.
   Furthermore, the SRL problem will address not only propositions
   centered around verbal predicates but also around nouns.
2. The syntactic dependencies to be modeled will be more complex
   than the ones used in the previous CoNLL evaluations: Johansson
   and Nugues have shown that a richer set of syntactic dependencies
   improves semantic processing (Johansson & Nugues 2007).
3. The proposed evaluation offers a practical framework to perform
   joint learning for the two problems.

Main Session Submissions
------------------------

A paper submitted to CoNLL-2008 must describe original, unpublished work.
Submit a full paper of no more than 8 pages in PDF format by April 28 2008,
electronically through a web form at http://www.softconf.com.
(Please check back for exact URL).

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Submissions should
follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should not exceed
eight (8) pages, including references.  We strongly recommend the use
of the Coling 2008 LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files
tailored for this year's conference. Papers must conform to the
official Coling 2008 style guidelines.  Authors who cannot submit a
PDF file electronically should contact the program co-chairs.

Since reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations, and there should be no
self-references that reveal the authors' identity. In the submission
form, you will be asked for the following information: paper title,
authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses, contact author's
email address, a list of keywords, abstract, and an indication of
whether the paper has been simultaneously submitted to other
conferences (and if so which conferences). The contact author of an
accepted paper under multiple submissions should inform the program
co-chairs immediately whether he or she intends the accepted paper to
appear in CoNLL-2008. A paper that appears in CoNLL-2008 must be
withdrawn from other conferences.

Authors of accepted submissions are to produce a final paper to be
published in the proceedings of the conference, which will be
available at the conference for participants, and distributed
afterwards by ACL. Final papers must follow the Coling 2008 style and
are due 1 July, 2008.
