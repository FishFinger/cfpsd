Linguistic Field(s): Lexicography; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

A number of present linguists consider the interface between lexis and grammar
as a key issue in the formal description of languages. This trend originated in
the 1960's in North America and Europe. It gained momentum in the last 10 years
with the increasing development of computer-aided language resource management
and natural language processing. The linguistic motivation for studying the
lexis-grammar interface is the large degree of interdependency between the
lexicon and the grammar of any language, in particular at the syntactic and
semantic levels. Lexical items show an idiosyncratic behaviour with regard to
numerous syntactic constructions and semantic properties. The formalization of
rules in a grammar cannot be dissociated from the treatment of irregularity,
since these two aspects are complementary. The practical construction of a
syntactico-semantic grammar involves such lexicological tasks as the separation
of homographic words into distinct lexical items. Thus, there is a sort of
continuum between lexis and syntax. A few hot topics within this general line of
research are: phraseology and multi-word expressions, constructions with support
verbs (or light verbs) and predicative nouns, semantic classification of
predicates and nouns, productivity of syntactic constructions. Thus, the issue
of lexis-grammar interface is relevant to a number of existing traditions and
communities:

- Construction Grammar and Frame Semantics (Charles Fillmore),
- the Lexicon-Grammar methodology (Maurice Gross),
- the Object Class community (Gaston Gross),
- Lexico-grammar (John Sinclair),
- the VerbNet framework (Martha Palmer).

In addition, such a workshop will be of interest for specialists of natural
language processing with manually constructed language resources, e.g. in the
HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar) and LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar)
frameworks.
