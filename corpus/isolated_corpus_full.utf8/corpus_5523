===================================================================
First Call for Papers
for a Special Issue of
the Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces (JMUI), Springer, on

NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR SYNTHESIS FOR EMBODIED AGENTS:
Producing Expressive, Individual, Interpersonally and Socio-Culturally
Aware Behavior

===================================================================

Deadline for paper submission: 4 September 2009

This special issue will address the question of how to synthesize
realistic, contextually appropriate nonverbal behavior for embodied
agents. Such techniques may be based on empirical studies, cognitive
models or statistical modeling of observed behaviors. The range of
nonverbal behaviors includes all modalities of human communication,
most notably speech, gesture, facial expression and posture. Key
challenges include how to model cross-modal synchronization and how to
take into account the world context, especially that of the
participating interlocutors - both human and artificial. Current
research aims at producing nonverbal behavior that tightly coheres
across modalities while relating to the behavior of other
interlocutors with respect to timing/form and taking social factors
like status and intercultural differences into account. Approaches
range from using low-level data such as motion capture, prosody or
physical forces to drive the synthesis to more high-level, functional
models employing grammars, semantics, information structure and
discourse knowledge.

The articles of this special issue will share the vision of making
virtual agents more believable as a crucial step in making them an
acceptable interface metaphor. Thus deployed, the agents have
considerable potential, as virtual service or tutoring assistants,
avatars in online social worlds or for non-player characters in
computer games.

We encourage submissions from AI researchers working on models for
multimodal behavior planning, as well as interdisciplinary research
covering psychology and the social sciences with a focus on evaluation
studies. We specifically welcome contributions from computer graphics
with a focus on efficient, data-driven algorithms. Finally, we also
invite more theoretical contributions that clarify the conceptual
levels of intra-agent processing as well as the contextual factors
that affect the communicative setting and thus must be included in any
model of behavior synthesis.
