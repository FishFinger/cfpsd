Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 22-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 4th International Workshop on Theoretical East Asian Linguistics (TEAL-4)
will be held at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University on December 30, 2007, as
one of the core celebration activities and the finale for the University's 70th
anniversary. 

Call for Papers

We welcome submissions of works that address problems of East Asian linguistics
from a theoretical perspective, preferably works bearing on the interface
properties in East Asian languages. A special session on 'phases' will be
organized. This special session aims to bring us together to concentrate on the
issues related to the phase theory developed in Chomsky's recent work and its
application in East Asian linguistics. Each paper will be allotted 20 minutes
for presentation and 10 minutes for discussion.

General Session:

Interface Properties

Special Session:

Phases

Selection of papers is based on anonymous review of abstracts. A selection
committee will be formed to review the submitted abstracts which are considered
by the reviewers to be of high interest to the development of theoretical East
Asian linguistics and linguistic theory in general. Please follow these
guidelines to submit your abstracts:

All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two
single-spaced pages, complete with examples and bibliography. All texts should
fit within a US letter-size or A4 page, with 1-inch margin all around. Each
abstract should start with the title (centered) at top, followed by 3
single-spaced blank lines, above the main text. Use font size 12 throughout,
preferably in Times or Times New Roman. Romanize all Asian texts, and avoid
Asian character fonts unless absolutely necessary. The abstract should be
camera-ready. 

Abstract submission is by email-attachment only. We do not accept submissions by
postal mail. Save your abstract as a PDF, DOC, or RTF file. Documents in other
formats must be converted before submission. Name your abstract with your last
name followed by the suffix pdf, doc, or rtf (e.g., huang.pdf, kim.doc, or
watanabe.rtf). Send your abstract to the selection committee via:
http://www.teal.cbs.polyu.edu.hk/openconf

Abstract selection is based on anonymous review. Please leave your name and
affiliation out of the abstract (but keep 3 blank lines between title and text).
The workshop will accept at most one single-authored work or one joint-authored
work by an individual. Each author may submit abstracts to the TEAL workshop and
either to the Sixth GLOW in Asia or to the Acquisition Workshop. The submitted
abstracts should, however, be substantially different in content. Abstracts
submitted to TEAL are reviewed separately from those submitted to the Sixth GLOW
in Asia and the Acquisition Workshop.
