This e-mail is a Call for Papers concerning the following workshop:

Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation, Disambiguation  =

and Applications (MWE 2009)
Workshop at the ACL/IJCNLP 2009 Conference (Singapore), 06 August 2009

The workshop is endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the  =

Lexicon (SIGLEX)

The link to MWE 2009 is the following:  =

http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=3DCONF&page=3DCONF_40_MW=
E_2009___lb__ACL__rb__

A short description of the workshop, the topics as well as submission  =

information, important dates and the members of the Programme  =

Committee are presented below.

Description

         Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) are an indispensable part of  =

natural languages and appear steadily on a daily basis, both new and  =

already existing but paraphrased. Thus, the automated processing of  =

MWEs is important for many natural language applications. The meaning  =

of MWEs can be either motivated or arbitrary. Native speakers master  =

most MWEs, while learners of a foreign language have to learn MWEs by  =

heart. The interpretation of MWEs poses a major challenge for  =

automated analysis helping both groups easily master MWEs.

         The growing interest in MWEs in the NLP community has led to  =

many specialized workshops held every year since 2001 in conjunction  =

with ACL, EACL and LREC; there have been also two recent special  =

issues on MWEs published by leading journals: the International  =

Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation, and the Journal of  =

Computer Speech and Language.

         As a result of the overall progress in the field, the time  =

has come to move from basic preliminary research to actual  =

applications in real-world NLP tasks. Following this trend, the  =

LREC-MWE'08 focused on gathering resources and creating a common  =

repository in order to rank MWE candidates and facilitate further  =

research.

Call for papers

         In MWE'09 we are interested in the overall process of dealing  =

with MWEs, asking for original research related (but not limited) to  =

the following four fundamental topics.

         Workshop topics

               (1) Identification. Identification is a major problem  =

for MWEs. The MWE identification task is to determine whether a MWE is  =

used non-compositionally (figuratively) or compositionally (literally)  =

in a particular context. The identification of MWEs by automated means  =

is a difficult task, as it does not suffice to store the MWE into a  =

dictionary database. Rule-based (morphosyntactic rules) and/or  =

statistical approaches may be needed to identify MWEs in context.

               (2) Interpretation. Semantic interpretation of MWEs,  =

particularly noun compounds and determinerless prepositional phrases,  =

is the task of determining the implicit semantic relation holding  =

between the MWE's sub-components. This specific area is inviting  =

research on (linguistically) identifying the semantic relations (SRs)  =

and automatic SR interpretation in MWEs. The relation inventories used  =

can be of different granularity and dependent on the particular type  =

of MWE construction. In some cases, MWE's semantics can be also  =

specified in terms of a suitable paraphrase.

               (3) Disambiguation. Disambiguation (Semantic  =

classification) is the task of specifying the semantics of MWEs based  =

on an inventory of semantic relations. It tends to presuppose the  =

ability to classify the (degree of) compositionality of MWEs and  =

applies only to compositional MWEs. The aim is to specify the  =

semantics of MWEs in terms of predefined semantic categories, e.g., in  =

WordNet.

               (4) Applications. Identifying MWEs in context and  =

understanding their syntax and semantics is important for many natural  =

language applications, including but not limited to question  =

answering, machine translation, information retrieval, information  =

extraction, and textual entailment. Still, despite the growing  =

research interest, there are not enough successful applications in  =

real NLP problems, which we believe is the key for the advancement of  =

the field.

         Submission information

               Submissions must describe substantial, original, and  =

unpublished work. Submissions will be judged on correctness,  =

originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the  =

conference, and interest to the attendees. Full papers may consist of  =

up to eight (8) pages in total (references icluded) and will be  =

presented orally. The deadline for paper submission is May 1, 2009  =

(GMT + 8).
               The official style files for ACL/IJCNLP 2009 are  =

available at: http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/.  =

The workshop submissions should use the same formatting guidelines.

         Format

               Full paper submissions should follow the two-column  =

format of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 proceedings without exceeding eight (8)  =

pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX  =

style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's  =

conference, which will be available on the conference website. All  =

submissions must conform to the official ACL-IJCNLP 2009 style  =

guidelines to be announced in the conference website and they must be  =

electronic in PDF.
               As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not  =

include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,  =

self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We  =

previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use  =

citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers  =

that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without  =

review.
