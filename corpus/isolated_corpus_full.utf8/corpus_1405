Meeting Description
The First Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition (SALC)
Lund, Nov 29 - Dec 1, 2007
http://www.salc-sssk.org/ 

Second Call for Papers

Includes theme sessions and an updated Scientific Committee list.

We invite the submission of abstracts for oral or poster presentations for the
The First Conference of the Swedish Association for Language and Cognition
(SALC) to be held at the Centre for Languages and Literature, Lund University
between Nov 29 and Dec 1, 2007. Presentations should involve research in which
language is not treated in isolation (e.g. as a ''module''), but both as based
on structures and processes of general cognition (e.g. perception, memory and
reasoning) and social cognition (e.g. joint attention and imitation), and as
affecting such structures and processes. The conference, as SALC in general, is
intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas between disciplines, fields of
study and theoretical frameworks. Topics include, but are not limited to: 

- semantic analysis and cognition
- discourse analysis and cognition
- grammar and cognition
- pragmatics and cognition 
- semiotics and cognition 
- linguistic typology and cognition
- language and cognitive development
- language and cognitive evolution
- language change and cognition
- language and gesture 
- language and consciousness
- linguistic relativity and linguistic mediation

Plenary Speakers
- Susan Goldin-Meadow, Department of Psychology, University of Chicago
- Esa Itkonen, Department of Linguistics, University of Turku
- Chris Sinha, Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth
- Östen Dahl, Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University
- Peter Gärdenfors, Department of Cognitive Science, Lund University

Theme Sessions
Space in language and cognition (Conveners: Carita Paradis, Marlene Johansson
Falck, Carita Lundmark and Ulf Magnusson)
The link between spatial concepts and construals in linguistic expressions and
in thought is a rapidly growing field of inquiry which cuts across disciplines
such as linguistics, cognitive psychology, anthropology, computer science and
philosophy. Oxford University Press will be publishing papers from the session
in an edited volume of strictly peer-reviewed papers that capture cutting-edge
scholarship in this area. 

Language and gesture (Conveners: Jordan Zlatev and Cornelia Mueller)
While there is a consensus on the close relationship between language and
gesture, there is an ongoing debate on the exact relationship between the two:
do they constitute a ''unified system'' (e.g. McNeil) or two closely integrated
but distinct semiotic resources (e.g. Donald), supported by distinct cognitive
mechanisms (e.g. Kita and Özyürek)? We plan a publication of papers addressing
this issue from different perspectives: semiotics, interaction studies,
development, evolution and neuroscience.

One page abstracts (at most 500 words) should be sent as an attachment (MS Word
preferred) to Marlene Johansson Falck, at marlene@magicspelling.com by June 1st
2007. Abstracts will then be reviewed by two members of the Scientific
Committee, and notification of acceptance will be sent by August 1st. Please
indicate whether an oral or poster presentation is preferred, and if a poster
presentation is acceptable if the space of the program does not allow for an
oral presentation. If you wish your contribution to be considered for one of the
theme sessions, please indicate this. The conference will be held in English.

Registration fees, including conference participation, book of abstracts, and
coffee/snacks
- Faculty: 50 euro/450 SEK (40 euro/360 SEK for SALC members)
- Students: 40 euro/360 SEK (30 euro/270 SEK for SALC members)
On-line registration facilities will be announced in the Final Call for Papers.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
