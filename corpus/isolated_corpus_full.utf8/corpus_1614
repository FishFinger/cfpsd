Title: Monolingualism

Special issue Editor: Dr. Elizabeth Ellis

Background

It is widely accepted by linguists that bilingualism and multilingualism
are more common worldwide than monolingualism. However, research has
concentrated on the former two; the implication being that monolingualism
is the norm, and that bi/multilingualism constitute aberrant states. In
contrast, there is little systematic investigation of monolingualism, and,
as Romaine (1995) points out, it would be strange to find a book with the
title 'Monolingualism'. The planned monograph will carry such a title, and
the papers it seeks to include will explore the phenomenon of
monolingualism from a number of different perspectives. These perspectives
might include language ideology, language choice in education, language
policy and planning, language awareness, second and third language teaching
and others from applied linguistics and sociolinguistics.

NB This is a shortened version of the Background and Rationale. You are
very welcome to contact Dr. Elizabeth Ellis at liz.ellis@une.edu.au and I
will send the full Call for Papers and be glad to answer any queries.
