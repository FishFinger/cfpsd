Dear Colleague, 

Revista Alicantina de Estudios Ingleses (RAEI) is an international Journal
of English Studies published annually since 1988 by the University of
Alicante (Spain). Although many of its volumes deal with miscellaneous
topics of interest for researchers in English Studies, it has also
published several special issues on English language teaching (1991),
Anglo-Irish literature (1992), relevance theory (1998), pragmatics and
translation (2001), new literatures in English (2003) and linguistics and
the media (2006).

RAEI is currently preparing another special issue on New Trends in
Cross-Cultural Communication Studies edited by Dr. Victoria Guillén, Dr.
Chelo Vargas and Judith Williams from the University of Alicante. We would
like to invite scholars who are doing research in this field to participate
in this interdisciplinary volume which is due to appear in December 2008. 

New Trends in Cross-Cultural Communication will cover six broad areas: 
1. Social anthropology and cross-cultural communication.
2. Social psychology and cross-cultural communication.
3. Pragmalinguistics and cross-cultural communication.
4. Interlanguage pragmatics.
5. Social etiquette and non-verbal communication in cross-cultural studies.
6. Information technologies and computer simulation for cross-cultural
training. 

As shown above, each area will focus on the study of cross-cultural
communication from a distinctive approach, i.e. social anthropology, social
psychology, pragmalinguistics, non-verbal behaviour, ICT, computer
simulation, and cross-cultural training.

Any contributions from any of the above-mentioned perspectives will be
welcome for this special issue on cross-cultural communication.

Manuscripts should be written in English, not exceed 12,000 words, and be
submitted no later than 30th April 2008.

All papers submitted to RAEI should be original, unpublished research, and
not be currently under evaluation elsewhere.

Manuscripts should be in conformity with the general RAEI guidelines which
may be consulted at the following Internet address:

The editors will select contributions for the special issue and will
contact the authors regarding the Acceptance, rejection or request for
modifications once the reports are received from the reviewers.

The papers pertaining to the areas mentioned above should be submitted in
hard copy (2 copies) to the editors at the address provided below no later
than 30th April 2008.
