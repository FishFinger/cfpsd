Meeting Description

ESSE is a European federation of national higher educational associations for
the study of English. ESSE conferences bring together those researching and
teaching English languages, literatures in English and cultures of
English-speaking peoples in Europe. 

ESSE Seminar S.23: 
Modern English Syntax: Historical and Comparative Approaches

Convenors
Jonathan White (University of Dalarna) 
E-mail: jwh@du.se
Johanna L. Wood (University of Aarhus)
E-mail: engjw@hum.au.dk

Syntactic changes that have occurred in English over the past 1500 years have
affected both clausal and nominal domains. Some of these changes have occurred
in other languages and language families, some have not. Many Romance languages
and non-standard varieties of English have multiple negation; standard English
does not. Most Germanic languages have developed a dedicated definite article;
most Slavic languages have not. This workshop invites comparative approaches
(e.g. between English and other languages or between different stages within
English) to these and other changes, for example: group genitives, the syntax of
numerals, changes involving the verb-second constraint, OV-VO word order, and
main verb movement.

General Information:
Those wishing to participate in the Conference are invited to submit 200-word
abstracts of their proposed papers directly to both convenors of the seminar in
question before 1 March 2008. The convenors will let the proponents know whether
their proposals have been accepted no later than 21 March 2008.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral
presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply reading
their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced versions of the papers
are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in question. There
will be a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar session, and convenors
should plan so that there is time for discussion between speakers and with the
audience.
