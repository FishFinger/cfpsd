LULCL II - Call for posters
----------------------------------
Lesser Used Languages and Computer Linguistics (LULCL) II "Combining effort=
s to foster computational support of minority languages"

13th - 14th of November 2008
European Academy Bolzano/Bozen, Italy

http://www.eurac.edu/lulcl2
--------

Following up on the "Lesser Used Languages and Computer Linguistics (LULCL)=
" conference in 2005, the Institute for Specialised Communication and Multi=
lingualism at the European Academy Bozen/Bolzano is pleased to announce a s=
econd scientific meeting on computational approaches for lesser used, lesse=
r standardised and lesser resourced languages. LULCL II will take place the=
 13th and 14th of November 2008 at the European Academy Bozen/Bolzano. The =
aim of the colloquium is to provide an overview of ongoing research activit=
ies and to strengthen the research community and its practices.=A0 =

This year's LULCL colloquium puts a special focus on bringing together effo=
rts from several related research communities, in order to join best practi=
ces, approaches and techniques and to add value to individual initiatives. =
In addition to lesser used languages, other types of language, including la=
nguage varieties, sign languages, learner language and spoken language pose=
 similar issues for researchers, having to do with sparse resources, little=
 standardisation, and challenges with automatic processing and building up =
of computational resources.
The colloquium will provide an opportunity to learn what tasks are analogou=
s and shared among the different research communities, what practices and r=
esources could be exchanged and generally how the groups could gain from wo=
rking together and how they can bring forward lesser used languages. =


The research communities of interest for this colloquium are:
* Lesser used / minority languages
* Language varieties
* Sign languages
* Learner languages
* Spoken language

During the two-day event invited researchers of each field will present ong=
oing research activities by pointing out challenges inherent to the automat=
ic processing of a particular lesser resourced / lesser standardised langua=
ge and relating it to the broader picture of working with lesser resourced =
/ lesser standardised languages in general. The emerging dialogue should gi=
ve particular consideration to smaller projects and thus help them to disse=
minate their objectives and to enter the international research community.

CALL FOR POSTERS
In addition to presentations by invited speakers this call for posters is o=
pen to all researchers working with lesser used, lesser resourced and lesse=
r standardised languages. =


Topics of particular interest include:
* Corpora
* Lexicographic resources
* Terminological resources
* Computer assisted language teaching and learning * Tools and resources fo=
r translation * Language tools * Multimedia and internet

* Representation and access of non-written language * Impact of computation=
al approaches to support/strengthen a language * Transferability of approac=
hes developed for major world languages

Posters may range from theoretical work to descriptions of resources and ap=
plications. We encourage PhD students to submit their research. =

The colloquium's language is English. Reviewing is non blind. =

Please submit an abstract (including relevant bibliography) of no more than=
 1000 words to : communication.multilingualism@eurac.edu

IMPORTANT DATES
NEW DEADLINE: September 29th 2008: Submission of abstracts for poster prese=
ntations
October 20th 2008: Notification of acceptance =

November 13th and 14th 2008: Colloquium at the Convention Center of the Eur=
opean Academy of Bozen/Bolzano, Italy
