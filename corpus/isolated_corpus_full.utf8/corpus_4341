			   Call for Papers

Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology
			     (sfcm 2009)

			 <http://sfcm2009.org>

		   Workshop date: September 4, 2009

	     Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland

		  Submission deadline: March 1, 2009

*********************************************************************

>From the point of view of computational linguistics, morphological
resources are the basis for all higher-level applications. This is
especially true for languages with a rich morphology like German. A
morphology component should thus be capable of analyzing single
wordforms as well as whole corpora. For many practical applications,
not only morphological analysis, but also generation is required,
i.e., the production of surfaces corresponding to specific categories.

Apart from uses in computational linguistics, there are practical
applications that can benefit from morphological analysis and/or
generation or even require it, for example in text processing, user
interfaces, or information retrieval. These applications have specific
requirements for morphological components, including requirements from
software engineering, such as programming interfaces or robustness.

In 1994, the first Morpholympics, a competition between several
systems for the analysis and generation of German wordforms, took
place at CLUE (Department of Computational Linguistics at the
Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg).

15 years later, some of the systems that participated in the
Morpholympics still exist and are being maintained. However, there are
also new developments in the field of computational morphology, for
German and for other languages. Unfortunately, the publications about
morphologic analysis and generation are spread over many different
conferences and journals, so that it is difficult to get an overview
of the current state of the art and of the available systems. This
workshop tries to bring together researchers, developers, and
maintainers of morphology systems for German and of frameworks for
computational morphology from academia and industry.

This workshop concentrates on actual, working systems and frameworks
of at least prototype quality. To ensure fruitful discussions among
workshop participants, submissions on concrete morphology systems are
preferrably for German; submissions on morphological frameworks are
relevant if the framework can be used to implement components for
different languages.

In contrast to, for example, Morphochallenge, this workshop focuses on
systems and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing
linguistically motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of
linguistic categories.

The workshop has three main goals:

    * To stimulate discussion among researchers and developers and to
      offer an up-to-date overview of available systems for German
      morphology which provide deep analyses and are suitable for
      generating specific wordforms.
    * To stimulate discussion among developers of general frameworks
      that can be used to implement morphological components for
      several languages.=20=20
    * To discuss aspects of evaluation of morphology systems and
      possible future competitions or tasks, such as a new edition of
      the Morpholympics.


*Topics*

The topics of this workshop include both technical aspects,
applications, and uses of systems and frameworks for computational
morphology. While purely theoretical submissions may be relevant, the
focus of the workshop is clearly on actual, working systems and
prototypes.

The workshop will mainly focus on German, but contributions for other
languages are encouraged in order to demonstrate open-source tools and
runtime software for full-scale morphologies. Topics include, but are
not limited to:

    * Frameworks for developing morphological components.
    * Open-source tools and resources for morphology.
    * Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms,
      especially for German.
    * Suitability of morphological components for interactive use.
    * Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.
    * Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation
      in applications.
    * Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with
      respect to performance, quality, and coverage.
    * Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance,
      hardware/software requirements, resource usage.
    * License models and legal aspects.

There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.


*Submissions*

We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages
(including references) or short papers of up to 10 pages. Long papers
constitute an excellent opportunity to publish citable, in-depth
descriptions of systems and frameworks. Submissions must be in
English. Reviewing of papers will be double-blind by the members of
the program committee, and all submissions will receive several
independent reviews. Papers submitted at review stage must not contain
the authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may disclose
the authors' identity.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research
at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings
of the workshop by Springer in their series Communications in Computer
and Information Science.

The papers must use the Springer LNCS format. We recommend to use the
LaTeX2e format. Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format
guidelines. Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. For
paper submissions we use EasyChair, see
