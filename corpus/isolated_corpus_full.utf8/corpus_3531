Dear all,

unwittingly, it seems, we're again falling into the trap of not
distinguishing between introspection and intuition. All linguists can, do
(and must) use their intuition when analysing language; you can take or
leave introspection.

Corpora provide a source of data which originates in the intuitive use of
language by 'ordinary' speakers. This use is not introspective: even if we
consider that most corpus data in current use is written rather
than transcribed, and so will have undergone a degree of revising and
refining by the original authors, the kind of thinking about language that
is necessary for perfecting one's writing style is not the same as an
armchair linguist's delving for data in his/her own head, in which the
introspective part filters out a lot of what is intuitive. Of course, when =
I
say armchair linguist, I'm not excluding non-professionals. I really mean
anyone who makes claims about what they personally do, or what an ideal
speaker does, or what the speaker community does.

Working with figurative language and phraseology, I find that a lot of what
can be discovered by corpus analysis is confirmed and complemented by
psycholinguistic research; sometimes the concordances explain the whys and
wherefores, and other times it is the experimental data that explains
oddities in the concordances. I also find that many corpus and
psycholinguists are united in their dissatisfaction with the claims made by
their theoretical linguist, language philosopher, and/or cognitive linguist
colleagues, who prefer to introspect for their data. Both corpus and
psycholinguistic scholars highlight the fact that introspectively-derived
data inevitably leads to oversimplification, and oversimplification amounts
to getting the facts wrong an awful lot of the time. Of course some of the
facts will be accurate - and this is why people still introspect, because i=
f
it never worked, they'd have given up on it ages ago - but the finer detail=
s
tend to escape notice.

That said, convincing an introspector to use a corpus instead is probably a=
s
difficult as convincing somebody who truly believes the world is flat that
is is a sphere... or like convincing a corpus user to introspect his/her
concordances. Maybe in 300 years time the paradigm shift will have taken
place, but I for one do not plan to hold my breath. Live and let live: but
we have much more interesting and exciting data ;-)
