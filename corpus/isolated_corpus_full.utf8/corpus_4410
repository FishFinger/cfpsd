                    NAACL HLT 2009 Workshop on
           Active Learning for Natural Language Processing

               June 5, 2009, Boulder, Colorado, USA

                     http://nlp.cs.byu.edu/alnlp/

                  Submission Deadline: March 6, 2009

          Endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups:
          * Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL)
          * Special Interest Group for Annotation (SIGANN)

MOTIVATION

Labeled data is a prerequisite for many popular algorithms in natural =

language processing and machine learning.  While it is possible to =

obtain large amounts of annotated data for well-studied languages in =

well-studied domains and well-studied problems, labeled data are rarely =

available for less common languages, domains, or problems. =

Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations for linguistic data is =

labor-intensive and typically the costliest part of the acquisition of =

an annotated corpus.

It has been shown before that active learning can be employed to reduce =

annotation costs but not at the expense of quality.  While diverse work =

over the past decade has demonstrated the possible advantages of active =

learning for corpus annotation and NLP applications, active learning is =

not widely used in many ongoing data annotation tasks.  Much of the =

machine learning literature on the topic has focused on active learning =

for classification problems with less attention devoted to the kinds of =

problems encountered in NLP.


TOPICS

We are interested in bringing together researchers to explore the =

challenges and opportunities of active learning for NLP tasks, language =

acquisition, and language learning.  General work on active learning on =

NLP classification tasks, sequence labeling, parsing, semantics, and =

other more complex tasks will be welcome in the workshop.  More specific =

topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   - theoretical analysis of active learning in the context of NLP
     applications
   - novel active learning approaches to estimate the training utility
     of individual selection units
   - cost-sensitive active learning approaches incorporating data
     acquisition costs
   - approaches to model or predict annotation costs as well as studies
     on factors that influence annotation time
   - criteria for stopping or monitoring progress of active learning
   - overfitting of data acquired with active learning: how much is the
     data biased towards the learning scheme involved in the selection
     and what are the limitations of re-use with other learning schemes
   - Human-Computer Interaction aspects of annotation including
     requirements, impact of interface design on annotation time, and
     methods to deal with reliability of annotators
   - approaches to multi-task active learning
   - approaches to deal with or reduce computational complexity of
     active learning approaches including parallelization, issues of
     pool- or batch-size, varying degrees of look-ahead, etc.
   - active learning and domain adaption
   - active learning compared to or combined with other semi-supervised
     or even unsupervised learning approaches
   - application of active learning in real annotation projects and
     experiences gained thereby


SUBMISSIONS

We invite submissions of two kinds:
1. original and unpublished work as full papers, limited to 8 pages of =

text (up to one extra page may be used for references);
2. position papers or papers describing ongoing work as short papers, =

limited to 4 pages in total (including references).

Both kinds of papers will appear in the proceedings and will be =

presented orally.  As reviewing will be double-blind, author information =

should not be included in the papers and self-reference should be avoided.

All submissions must be made in PDF format using the START paper =

submission website:
https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/ActiveLearningNLP2009/

Submissions must follow the NAACL HLT 2009 formatting requirements:
http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html

Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style =

files available there.  Papers not conforming to these requirements are =

subject to rejection without review.
