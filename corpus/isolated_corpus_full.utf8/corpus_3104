Meeting Description:

Revisiting Parameters: Holmberg and Platzack (1995) Reloaded

Lund University, October 16-17, 2008 

Call for Papers

Invited speakers: Anders Holmberg, Christer Platzack, Höskuldur Thráinsson,
Frederick Newmeyer.

Abstract deadline: July 15th, 2008

Organized by NORMS. Support for speakers provided by NORMS, with funding from
NOS-HS.

Thirteen years have passed since the release of Holmberg & Platzack 1995, itself
the culmination of about a decade of work on the parametric differences between
Mainland and Insular Scandinavian (by which they meant, Norwegian, Swedish, and
Danish on the one hand and Icelandic and Faroese on the other).* 

That monograph constitutes one of the most extended arguments for the classic
view of parameters in linguistic theory. It argues at length that two
parameters, an agreement parameter and a case parameter, account for a host of
finer-grained distinctions between two groups of languages in such phenomena as
V-to-T, null expletives, non-nominative subjects, object shift, long-distance
reflexives, and word order options in double-object constructions, connecting
them all to the presence in Icelandic of overt agreement and case morphology, as
opposed to the absence of such morphology in Swedish and neighboring languages. 

In the ensuing 13 years, each of these phenomena has received other treatments,
and other differences among North Germanic varieties have been analyzed as well.
In many of these more recent treatments, the connection between morphology and
syntax has been challenged, and furthermore the interconnections among the
various syntactic phenomena has also been called into question. In addition,
there has been work on languages other than Scandinavian contributing to our
understanding of the syntax-morphology interface and of the nature of parameters.

The conference ''Revisiting Parameters'' calls for 2-page abstracts for papers
that address these issues, including (but not limited to) such matters as:

- Do other language families that show a similar split between a morphologically
rich branch and a morphologically weak branch exhibit comparable differences in
syntactic phenomena to the North Germanic case?
- To what extent can the differences between two groups of languages such as
Mainland and Insular Scandinavian be characterized in terms of a small set of
parameters?-
 How can a microparametric or lexical approach, in which there are few or no
implicational relations among parameter settings, account for the problem of
language acquisition?
- What do such differences as those among the North Germanic languages tell us
about the nature of parameters?

Abstracts dealing entirely with non-Scandinavian languages are welcome. 

Presentations will be in English. Partial reimbursement for travel expenses will
be available for speakers whose abstracts are selected for presentation.

Two-page abstracts should be sent in pdf format before midnight, July 15th
Central European Summer Time (Greenwich +1+1) to parameters@list.uit.no;
abstracts should be anonymous, and contact information should be included in the
e-mail. An individual may submit at most one joint and one solo abstract, or two
joint abstracts. Additional questions can also be directed to that address.

*Though we use 'Scandinavian' here, following Holmberg & Platzack, in its common
polyseme to refer to the North Germanic languages, there are also Scandinavian
languages of the Finno-Ugric family, for example Northern Sámi. Papers dealing
with those languages are extremely welcome.
