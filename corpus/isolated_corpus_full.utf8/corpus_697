GENERAL INFORMATION

Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is the problem of deciding the
satisfiability of first-order formulae with respect to some
decidable background theory (e.g., linear arithmetic, the theory of
arrays, the theory of bit-vectors).
SMT techniques are gaining increasing relevance in many application
domains, including formal verification of hardware and software,
compiler optimization, planning and scheduling. .....

In the last decade, agents and data mining have emerged as two of
most vivacious areas in information technology field. The nature
and complementarity of both areas foreshows an emerging trend -- the
increasing interaction between agents and data mining. As a result, both
technologies have been greatly enhanced in terms of solving existing
individual challenges and innovating new research and development
opportunities. The interaction will significantly strengthen the progress .....
