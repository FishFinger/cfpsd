Meeting Description

ILINTEC'08 
Intelligent Linguistic Technologies 2008
Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas , Nevada , USA
June, 14-17, 2008

The International Workshop on Intelligent Linguistic Technologies ILINTEC'08
will be held as part of the MLMTA'08 Conference (Machine Learning, Models,
Technologies, Applications 2008). All accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings by CSREA Press (Computer Science Research, Education and
Advanced Technologies Association) http://www.ipiran.ru/conference/Ilintec08/
(the web site for ILINTEC'08 is under construction).
ILINTEC'08 is a unique opportunity to discuss the problems of natural language
processing in immediate contact with the leading research and development teams
from universities and industry engaged in information technology projects and
various fields of Computer Science.

The Scope of the Workshop
The workshop is centered around but not limited to the topics given below:
- Machine translation;
- Text retrieval;
- Information extraction;
- Applications of machine learning to speech and language processing;
- Neural networks for speech and language structures recognition;
- Algorithms of morphological and syntactic analysis of natural languages;
- Word class and part-of speech tagging for text corpora;
- Parsing with context-free grammars, unification grammars, etc.;
- Lexicalized and probabilistic parsing;
- Meaning representation, semantic analysis;
- Word sense disambiguation and information retrieval;
- Reference resolution;
- Natural language generation

The first page of the draft paper should include for each author: 
title of the paper,
name,
affiliation,
postal address, 
E-mail address, 
telephone number and fax number.
the name of the author who will be presenting the paper (if accepted)
5 keywords (maximum) 
 
The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to 7 (IEEE
style) pages. Papers must not have been previously published or currently
submitted for publication elsewhere.
 
Evaluation Process
 
Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and soundness.
Each paper will be refereed by two researchers in the topical area. The
Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one person.
 
Publication

proceedings will be available at the conference. Some accepted papers will also
be considered for journal publication (soon after the conference). All
conference materials published by CSREA Press are included in major database
indexes, such as: ISI Thomson Scientific, IEE INSPEC, DBLP, etc? that are
designed to provide easy access to the current literature.
