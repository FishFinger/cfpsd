Full Title: A Cross-linguistic Reflection on Verb Typologies 

Date: 05-Feb-2009 - 07-Feb-2009
Location: Ghent, Belgium 
Contact Person: Bernard De Clerck
Meeting Email: verbtypology2009@ugent.be

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Linguistic Theories; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Ghent University CONTRAGRAM research team is proud to announce an International Conference on Verb Typologies to be held at Ghent, 5-7 February 2009. The meeting is organized in collaboration with the French, English and Dutch department of Ghent University and is to be positioned against the larger background of the research project Meaning in between structure and the lexicon. Papers presented will be from both a theoretical as well as a practical point of view with the goal of achieving cross-fertilization and new insights on verb typologies. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts are invited for 30-minute talks (20'+10') in English on any topic related to the semantics, morphosyntax, or typology of verbs, especially from a cross-linguistic perspective. We invite papers addressing general typological questions as well as papers taking the viewpoint of one (or more) particular language(s), preferably Germanic or Romance languages. 
We particularly welcome papers on the following topics:
- (new) reflections on verb classifications
- contrastive analysis of verbs, verb classes and typologies
- corpus-based (cross-linguistic) studies on verbs and verb classes
- theoretically inspired papers focusing on classification systems and criteria (and related terminology), on the relation between verb classes and polysemy 
- papers exploring the tension between syntax, semantics and lexicon with respect to the verbal lexicon (see conference call)

Abstracts should have between 500 and 800 words (exclusive of references) and should state research questions, approach, method, data and results. 
They can be sent to verbtypology2009@ugent.be. Abstracts will be anonymously reviewed.

The deadline for the submission of abstracts is 1 June 2008. Notification of acceptance will be given by 31 August 2008.

The body of your email message should include your name, affiliation and contact information.
 
More information will periodically appear on the Conference website which will be launched shortly:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
