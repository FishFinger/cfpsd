Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

International Workshop: Construction, manifestation and dynamics of formulaic
patterns in texts and paintings. Historical perspectives and modern technologies.

The international workshop aims to explore the construction, manifestation, and
dynamics of formulaic patterns in an interdisciplinary approach under the
perspectives of Linguistics and Art History. Central objects of research will be
historic texts from different genres and languages (poetry and fiction,
non-literary sources, lexicographic and grammatographic sources) and Medieval as
well as (Early) Modern works of art (painting, graphic, sculpture, and arts and
crafts). Furthermore, there shall be room to discuss the possibilities and
potentials of editing, annotating and preserving linguistic and visual formulaic
patterns with the help of modern technologies. 

Call for Papers

So far historical cultural sciences have given little attention to form,
formation, and function of formulaic ritualised methods of communication. The
reciprocal influence of visual and linguistic media has also been left
untouched, with the exception of isolated studies. The following list of key
words derives from this complex of themes and should be regarded as a starting
point for further thoughts:
- form(s) and function(s) of formulaic patterns in texts and paintings 
- cultural formation of formulaic patterns in texts and paintings
- genesis and identification of formulaic phrases
- divergency and congruency in visual and textual sources
- history of mediality of proverbs and proverbial paintings
- electronic systematization and preservation of formulaic patterns
- search routines in texts
- processes of semantic and structural stability and possibilities of variation

Contributions by art historians, philologists (also from the fields of
dialectology, computer and corpus linguistics) as well as by other experts from
cultural-historical disciplines are especially welcome. The lectures should not
exceed 20 minutes to allow enough room for discussion.

You are kindly invited to send abstracts of up to one page as MS-Word-file to
the following e-mail-address: filatkin(at)uni-trier.de

Deadline for the submission of abstracts is: May 15, 2008.

CHCP-2008

1st International Workshop on Contextualization of Human Centered Processes
(CHCP 2008), in conjunction with HCP 2008 3rd International Conference on Human
Centered Processes

June  9-12, 2008 Delft, Nederlands

http://wiki.decis.nl/publichcp2008/

You are invited to submit your papers to the 1st International Workshop on
Contextualization of Human Centered Processes (part of the 3rd International
Conference on Human Centered Processes), to be held in June 12, 2008 Delft,
Nederlands.

The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, developers and
practitioners to discuss research issues and experience in developing and
deploying models or applications, in which actor's behavior rely heavily on
contextual knowledge. Concrete aspects of contexts can be considered at
different levels ranging from knowledge representation to modelling. Papers
describing application experiences are particularly encouraged. To effectively
exploit the true potential of contextual knowledge, methods and tools to
facilitate its modelling are required. Managing contextual information provides
both new challenges and opportunities. Since the major theme of the workshop is
context at the heart of human centered activity, challenges that are addressed
must include among others:

- new methods and new algorithms for contextualization,
- how to bridge the gap between semantic web and contexts,
- contextualization of ontological engineering,
- context in design tools,
- context in interactive systems (e.g., question-answering systems),
- ambient systems which must include a user model,
- inter-personal work practices modelling in enterprises,

in all domains where context plays a key role (recognized explicitly or not)
because the human is the core of the processes that are concerned. Modelling the
interplay between tasks and contexts is a crucial part of contextualization
required for a sound analysis of their evolution. We would like to explore the
role of contextualization at the human and machine level (knowledge, user model,
mental representation, personalization, individualization, learning-when-doing,
knowledge representation, metadata, relationships with incremental acquisition,
learning, explanation, statistical methods, training, education, etc.). We are
also interested in investigation of formalisms to ensure sound mechanisms
incorporating human activity and context models.

Submission of Papers:
Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation in any of
the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be accepted, and the
length of the paper should not exceed 12 pages with 2cm margins and one column.
PDF versions of the manuscript should be submitted through the web-based paper
submission procedure (for details, see the HCP 2008 website):
www.easychair.org/conferences/
