Call for Papers
 
The newly founded Turkish Research Institute (Türk Dilini Ara?t?rma
Enstitüsü) in Skopje, Macedonia, decided to publish twice a year (in March
and September), a new international peer-reviewed linguistic journal called
'Journal of Turkish Linguistics'.

We invite all interested researches from all over the globe to submit
manuscripts that will be considered for the first (September 2007) and
upcoming issues of the journal.

Papers from all areas of Turkish linguistics are welcomed. Papers that
indirectly treat Turkish also could be considered for publication.

The papers should be in Turkish or English and must be original work, not
published anywhere before.

Manuscripts should be sent in Times New Roman, 12 pts. If used other fonts,
they should be sent separately.

Even though there are no lengths limits, priority will be given to papers
which are between 10-50 pages long.

Manuscripts should be sent only electronically to jtl@tdae.org before June
15th, 2007 in order to be considered for the first (September) issue.
Preferred file formats are: DOC, RTF or XML.

As attachments to the original paper, two separate PDF files also should be
sent:
- Paper's anonymous version;
- Author's details: name, title, institution, paper's title, regular mail
and e-mail address.

For submitting papers written in other languages, formats, fonts and all
other questions, do not hesitate to contact us at jtl@tdae.org.

On behalf of Turkish Research Institute,
Dr. Oktay Ahmed, Chairman
oktay@tdae.org
