Meeting Description:

Figurative language, such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms, among others, is in abundance in natural discourse. The recognition of figurative language use and the computation of figurative language meaning constitute one of the hardest problems for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. As natural language processing moves to an unprecedented new stage, it has become more urgent than ever to tackle the bottleneck presented by figurative language. 

This workshop will provide a venue for researchers in this area to inform  each other and the natural language processing community at large of the state of the art of current systems and to reach a better understanding of the new issues and challenges that need to be tackled. This workshop will be held in conjunction with HLT/NAACL 2007. 

Workshop in conjunction with HLT/NAACL 2007
To be held in Rochester, NY, April 26, 2007

Figurative language, such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms, personification, simile among others, is in abundance in natural discourse. It is an effective apparatus to heighten effect and convey various meanings, such as humor, irony, sarcasm, affection, etc. Figurative language can be found not only in fiction, but also in everyday speech, newspaper articles, research papers, and even technical reports. The recognition of figurative language use and the computation of figurative language meaning constitute one of the hardest problems for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. Resolution of this problem involves both a solid understanding of the distinction between literal and non-literal language and the development of effective computational models that can make the appropriate semantic interpretation automatically.

As natural language processing moves to an unprecedented new stage, it has become more urgent than ever to tackle the bottleneck presented by figurative language. There has been an increasing amount of work in this area in the past few years (e.g. theoretical semantic/pragmatic analyses of non-compositional phenomena, research on psychological/neuro-linguistic modeling of figurative language comprehension and production, research on the structure of the lexicon, knowledge representation and figurative language comprehension, domain-specific figurative language detection, computational corpus studies of figurative language), but much more work needs to be done (e.g. large-scale automatic figurative language detection, automatic extraction of idioms and non-compositional phrases from large corpora, automatic semantic interpretation of figurative language, automatic figurative language generation, machine translation of non-literal phenomena, etc.). The goal of this workshop is!
  to provide a venue for researchers in this area to inform each other and the natural language processing community at large of the state of the art of current systems and to reach a better understanding of the new issues and challenges that need to be tackled.

The workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. We encourage the participation of people whose research deals with figurative language from different perspectives, including (but not limited to) applied linguistics, psychology, corpus linguistics, human-computer interaction, natural language processing, etc. 

Topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to:

(1) Computational models of figurative language processing, including:
    - extracting idioms and non-compositional phrases from large
      corpora;
    - classifying metaphoric/non-metaphoric and humorous/non-humorous
      language use;
    - computing non-literal meaning;
    - multilingual or cross-lingual processing of figurative language;
    - computational modeling of human figurative language
      comprehension and production.

(2) Psychological models of figurative language processing, including:
    - figurative language comprehension;
    - figurative language production;
    - figurative language acquisition.
    
(3) Corpus-driven studies of figurative language, including:
    - corpus-based studies of figurative aspects of any language;
    - corpus-based studies of specific linguistic cues for figurative language;
    - effects of domain and genre on studies of figurative language;
    - annotation of non-literal phenomena in corpora.

(4) Theoretical discussions on literal and non-literal language, including discussions on:
    - the distinction between literal and non-literal language;
    - the distinction between different types of figurative language;
    - cross-linguistic differences of figurative language.

(5) Lexical and ontological resources for figurative language processing, including:
    - representation of non-literal meaning in lexicons and ontologies;
    - development of new lexical resources for figurative language processing.

(6) Evaluation of figurative language processing in large-scale NLP systems, such as machine translation, Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL), question answering, dialogue systems, etc. 

The emphasis of the workshop is on computational approaches to figurative language. We particularly are interested in submissions that deal with figurative language in the context of Machine Translation, Word Sense Disambiguation, Information Extraction, Document Retrieval, Dialogue Systems, Intelligent Tutoring systems, etc.
