Hi Jette,

thanks A LOT!! You've done a great job!
It's funny how often you sound like Robert in your comments ;-) The
"standalone chapter" thing is typical! Now I've got to deal with all
these...
Cheers,
JP

Done.<br>
<br>
Sorry about the extent of comments, in places I went a bit past the<br>
call for grammatical corrections and also suggest different word<br>
choices and even more substantial stuff like short explanation of<br>
stuff from previous chapters and things like that. The reasoning<br>
behind that is that whenever I go and read a thesis, I try to avoid<br>
having to read the whole thing and go straight for the chapter I think<br>
is important to me. So, I think it&#39;s a good idea if each chapter is<br>
comprehensible in itself.<br>
<br>
I hope my comments are nice enough, I know how hard it can be to read<br>
comments and feeling personally attacked. Your French constructions<br>
are really cute sometimes ;) I had to look up a few words &nbsp;that you<br>
probably just took from French, my own fault for having a Germanic<br>
English vocabulary and lacking a lot of the Romanic part.<br>
<br>
Also, I didn&#39;t find a good way of distinguishing hard-fast things that<br>
you just have to change and things where I just thought it could be<br>
better. Sometimes one sentence would contain some grammatical errors<br>
that really need fixing but I also thought even if grammatically<br>
correct there would be a better way of saying it. I tried to point out<br>
both, I hope it&#39;s not too confusing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let me know if you need a little more done. Good luck with it!<br>
<br>
Hugs,<br>
