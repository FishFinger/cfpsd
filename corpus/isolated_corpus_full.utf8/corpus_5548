SUMMARY
This book attempts to resolve a number of intriguing problems related to th=
e
complex relationship between grammar and pragmatics. While maintaining the
mainstream conviction about the grammar/pragmatics division of labor, the a=
uthor
seems to be more willing to announce a happy marriage between the two, thou=
gh
admitted (explicitly and/or implicitly) to be at times uneasy bedfellows, t=
han
keep them single. If they are kept absolutely distinct from each other, as
suggested by standard analyses, Ariel argues that accounts for grammaticiza=
tion
and semanticization will not be possible (cf. pp. xiii; 257). The book open=
s
with a preface followed by an introductory chapter and six more chapters
distributed over three parts, each of which addresses questions intended to=
 be
answered on the basis of her mostly natural linguistic/discourse examples
collected from various sources, mainly representative of Hebrew and English=
.
Original examples and their glosses can be found at:
www.cambridge.org/0780521559942. A cursory look at the rich list of referen=
ces,
followed by two indexes, is indicative of the tremendous efforts she has ex=
erted
on preparing the book.

Chapter 1: Grammar, pragmatics, and what's between them (pp. 1-24) draws ou=
r
attention to the fact that although we need to draw a distinction between
grammar, as correlated with a set of codes, and pragmatics, as correlated w=
ith
different types of inferences, to which part I is devoted, we equally need =
to
account for how inferences cross over and become codes. In addition to bein=
g
content with ''the now well accepted assumption that we always communicate =
by
combining codes (grammar) with inferences (pragmatics)'' (p.3), which means=
 that
inferences constitute an integral part of grammar by definition, the author=
 is
committed to the issue of cross-over which is believed to have serious
implications for grammaticization and/or semanticization and hence the on-g=
oing
development of current grammars. Ariel appeals to Grice's pragmatic theory;=
 for
since it is assumed ''that every act of communication is actually inferenti=
al''
(p. 4), i.e. involving additional or complementary interpretation, it follo=
ws
that all pragmatic theories are essentially Gricean. As such, the author's
position in this book ''is contra the assumption made by other linguists, t=
hat
there must be a purely grammatical literal meaning which corresponds to the
complete utterance (usually assumed to be a single complete proposition) ..=
.
[for it] may well be a combined grammatical/pragmatic representation in mos=
t
cases'' (p. 24).

Chapter 2: Distinguishing the grammatical and the extragrammatical: referen=
tial
expressions (pp. 27-67) focuses on some referential expressions, mostly def=
inite
expressions and pronouns. In order to provide arguments for drawing the div=
ision
of labor between interpretations and language use conditions whose
grammatical/pragmatic identity is opaque, presuppositions are given a speci=
al
treatment because the available literature about their assignment is divide=
d.
The heated argument, based on case studies and ''contentious'' examples, sh=
ows
that some aspects of the use of presuppositions are semantic, others, pragm=
atic.
Certain other referring expressions seem to require explanations by making
appeal to extralinguistic principles but, as evidence shows, a grammatical
convention is also involved. Preferred Argument Structure constraints as we=
ll as
register-specific referring expressions are claimed to fall in between, i.e=
.
neither encoded nor inferred. In Ariel's words, the conclusion is that ''on=
e
aspect of the use of definite descriptions is grammatically encoded, the ot=
her,
pragmatically inferred'' (p. 44).

In part I (pp. 25-109), we are told that ''some interpretations are implica=
ted,
some are explicated, and yet others are only potential truth compatible inf=
erred
interpretations'' (p. 25), which chapter 3 (pp.68-109) handles in conjuncti=
on
with codes. For the purpose of assignment, Ariel selects a number of issues=
,
e.g. conjoined clauses with 'and' and some scalar expressions such as 'most=
' and
'all'. While Gricean pragmatists variously rely ''on the criterion of truth
conditionality for distinguishing grammatical and extragrammatical
interpretations, taking truth-conditional meanings as semantic and
nontruth-conditional meanings as pragmatic'' (p. 69), Ariel's position is
consonant with Relevance theoreticians ''who apply the code/inference disti=
nction
strictly'' (p. 69). For them, Grice's conventional implicatures, which are =
the
domain of pragmatics, constitute coded meanings and hence semantic in essen=
ce.
Towards the end of the chapter, however, Ariel admits that it is ''a delica=
te
matter to distinguish the truth-compatible from the encoded'' (p. 108).

In part II: Crossing the extralinguistic/linguistic divide (pp. 111-256), t=
he
author takes the reader to an arena where the grammar/pragmatics interface =
is
likely to take place. Central to this part is the argument that ''pragmatic=
s,
together with other extragrammatical triggers, provides the raw materials a=
nd
impetus for grammar'' (p. 111). Following such an argument, mainly based on=
 the
complex relationship between diachronic and synchronic facts, the reader ma=
y at
this junction draw two assumptions: (1) the linguistic/extralinguistic divi=
de is
a prerequisite for the grammar/pragmatic divide; and (2) our current and fu=
ture
grammars can equally contribute to the building up of foreseeable grammars =
and
hence witnessing an ever running process of grammaticization (or
grammaticalization, if you wish).

Chapter 4: Grammar, pragmatics, and arbitrariness (pp. 117-148) begins by
addressing the most crucial question, viz. whether grammar is
extralinguistically motivated or arbitrary. In introductory linguistic cour=
ses
we often tell our students that grammar is a self-contained system. If
autonomous, then it must be arbitrary. We do this for the sake of purely
describing form-function correlations without seriously embarking on possib=
le
motivations. Yet, if we, as researchers, are not prepared to accept the sim=
ple
fact that ''grammar is a natural historical product'' (p. 148), then it fol=
lows
that human history is ''chaotic'' and ''arbitrary''. In fact, one of the ma=
in
reasons why certain linguistic phenomena seem to us arbitrary is the lack o=
f
evidence. Don't we often frown at innovations in language use, which are li=
kely
to end as conventional codes by which others abide gradually?

Chapter 5: All paths lead to the salient discourse pattern (pp. 149-211)
addresses a number of questions intended to show how ''grammar is constantl=
y in
the making'' (p. 149). A number of factors, viz. (embodied) cognition,
sociocultural norms and inferential practices (pragmatic enrichments), not =
to
mention grammar itself (cf. p. 150), may all conspire in the creation of ne=
w
codes. It is undeniable that the world in which we live, ''the world filter=
ed by
the human cognitive make-up'' (p. 151), can have a considerable impact on t=
he
molding and re-molding of our grammars. In Ariel's words, all of these
''constitute an integral part of communication, because the linguistic code=
 is
forever under-determinate'' (p. 166). It is to be noted that the influence =
of
extralinguistic factors on grammar is not direct. Rather, it is the mediati=
ng
salient discourse patterns, of which only a small set (as deemed necessary)
undergoes conventionalization (cf. p. 211).

Chapter 6: The rise (and potential fall) of reflexive pronouns demonstrates=
 why
and which salient discourse patterns actually do turn grammatical. Current
English reflexive pronouns are used as an example to show that ''earlier
grammaticizations do not preclude newer ones, and newer ones do not always
cancel out old ones'' (p. 213). The English reflexive pronoun, ''which we a=
re used
to thinking of as a type of referring expression, is historically tied to t=
wo
quite distinct grammatical categories. It evolved out of an originally emph=
atic
adjunct, which acquired argument status. As such, it became a marked form, =
used
for marked interpretations'' (p. 253). But once it is used intransitively, =
as is
sometimes the case today, ''the reflexive pronoun will lose not only its
interpretative markedness, but also its argument status (once again)'' (p. =
253)
and hence the widespread use of the nonreflexive form, i.e. regular pronoun=
s, as
perhaps a more marked use in the future.

The few introductory pages in part III: Bringing grammar and pragmatics bac=
k
together (257-308) round off the whole argument run in parts I and II. Whil=
e
they remind the reader of what has been achieved so far, on the one hand, t=
hey
are meant to enable us to link the previously discussed meanings, e.g. the
so-called 'conveyed' and 'bare' meanings, with an intervening (or intermedi=
ate)
'basic level' meaning, captured by the fashionable, but highly controversia=
l,
'what is said' concept, on the other hand. This third level of meaning
representation is the topic of chapter 7: Grammar/pragmatics interfaces (pp=
.
261-308), which is mainly a critical review of some important accounts of '=
what
is said' in the literature starting with Grice. The chapter discusses ''the
possibility that 'what is said' is not only important for grammar/pragmatic=
s
interfaces during interaction, but also in processes in which pragmatics cr=
osses
over to become grammar'' (p. 261). To conclude, a word of caution is in pla=
ce at
this juncture. The author's position is that explicated inferences (or conv=
eyed
meaning level), rather than implicated inferences, would serve as the immed=
iate
impetus for, or potentially give rise to, most semanticizations and
grammaticizations (cf. pp. 306-307).

EVALUATION
With the exception of a few invented examples, this book utilizes a wealth =
of
references, a comprehensive literature overview indeed, and naturally occur=
ring
data, which enables the author to draw subtle pragmatic distinctions while
simultaneously offering a wide range of convergent/divergent perspectives, =
all
being undoubtedly indicative of her strong research background. The book ha=
s a
clear structure. It is equally error-free, but perhaps with the exception o=
f the
third occurrence of the word ''implicatures'' (p. 81 fn. 13) which must be
''explicatures'' instead.

At the outset, one might be curious to ask Mira Ariel why choosing to order
''Pragmatics'' before ''Grammar'' as the title of the book when her consist=
ent use
of their reversal is quite evident throughout the whole book, including par=
t and
chapter titles. One may simply attribute concept order to prominence (or fo=
cus,
if you like) which captures the main argument of the feeding relationship, =
i.e.
the fact that pragmatics, including whatever extralinguistic factors, is he=
ld
responsible for grammaticization/semanticization. If the initial ordering a=
nd
its reversal are never meant to invite inferences, should we say that a par=
adox
in ordering is optional and hence arbitrary or even meaningless? Suppose th=
e
following conversation is valid in a possible world:

Teacher: Did you like Ariel's _Pragmatics and Grammar_?
Student: Yes, I did, but not in this order.
Teacher: How's that?
Student; Well, I'd rather place ''Grammar'' before ''Pragmatics''.
Teacher: But why?
Student: Can you ever draw inferences without an existing code, including g=
estures?
(cf. p. 285 for a similar example).

I do not wish to push it any further and compare it with the chicken-egg pu=
zzle,
but I still wonder. And if an answer is provided, I'm afraid (delayed) repa=
ir
work should have been given due attention as regards (written) communicatio=
n.

The second remark I'd like to make is the author's consistent choice of ''h=
er''
for 'speaker', 'person', 'participants' (A, B, ...) and even 'dog' (cf. p. =
307),
perhaps with two exceptions where in the first she refers to the addressee =
as
'his' (p. 49, fn. 27) and in the second both 'she' and the neutral 'they' (=
p.
291, fn. 29). Since she discusses 'reference' and 'anaphora', could her
extensive use of 'she' (cf. her 'frequency' throughout) be indicative of
femininization and hence susceptible to foreseeable grammaticization? One
wonders if English will ever have two competing codes, viz. a she-grammar v=
s. a
he-grammar, in the future.

Documentation is impressive, yet often felt extravagant and annoying at tim=
es.
The frequently squeezed references and cross-references in a work which is
intended as a textbook may have side effects, particularly on the smooth fl=
ow of
information. The book is highly theoretical and argumentative in a number o=
f
places and hence presupposing too much background knowledge on the part of =
the
(average) reader. Just as certain things are not clear to the author (cf. p=
.
152, fn. 4), we do not expect all students to make their way through the
condensed theoretical account about, e.g. iconicity and world view (p. 152)=
.
Equally in the absence of examples, e.g. left dislocations and their ''thre=
e
distinct discourse functions'' (p. 120), the reader would likely be unable =
to
follow the argument. To substantiate this particular point, I gave the foll=
owing
extract to some of my M.A. students: ''one can measure the syntactic
(in)dependence of combined clauses by the (in)dependent choice of tenses,
illocutionary forces, participants, etc. Thus, causative and modal relation=
s are
high on the cohesion hierarchy, representing one perceived event, temporal
adverbials and conditionals are intermediate, and two unrelated events
(propositions) end the cohesion hierarchy'' (p.152).

In a word, they were totally lost, simply because no example is provided. W=
hile
she is a supporter of Grice's maxims, she appears to violate those maxims,
though unintentionally, in a few places.

Confusion may also arise with term-distinction. For example, it's only afte=
r
reading 94 pages that Ariel asks us to see Sperber and Wilson (1987) ''for
arguments against positing a distinction between generalized and particular=
ized
conversational implicatures'' (p.94, fn. 22). Much earlier (p. 22), she alr=
eady
seems to be for the idea that ''many cases analyzed as generalized conversa=
tional
implicatures by neo-Griceans are analyzed as explicated inferences by Relev=
ance
theoreticians ... [in which case] the inferences are non-prototypical
implicatures.'' What makes scalar implicatures involving 'most', 'not all',=
 'more
than half', for example, generalized conversational implicatures? Is it bec=
ause
they easily lend themselves to guesses? Are particularized conversational
implicatures ''generated only in specific contexts'' (p. 98)? If 'most' wer=
e
compatible with 'all', as concluded by Horn (2006) and reported by Ariel (p=
.
92), 'most' would have been synonymous with 'all', which is not the case. T=
he
quantifier 'all' was most likely not intended by the speaker, Dana, whose '=
most'
turned out to be 'all'. If you asked Dana after the event: ''Did you expect
'all', without exception, would prefer square plates?'', she would most lik=
ely
answer: ''Well, not really'', or ''I guess so'', etc. If this were not the =
case, we
could also say that ''most likely'' is equally compatible with 'absolutely'=
,
'certainly', 'positively', etc., which is not intended. If it is a matter o=
f
focusing on ''informativeness'' only, then this would be fine. Still,
possibilities and probabilities of meaning dominate her overview of argumen=
ts
for/against implicature/explicature accounts of the upper bound of 'most'.

In fact, one could come to the conclusion that the best part of the book is
really much less about grammar/pragmatics interface per se than
semantic/pragmatic overlap/interface. One would have liked to see, e.g. Qui=
rk et
al. (1985), a classic code, to be used as a point of reference for grammati=
cal
points but, unfortunately, it is only footnoted in one place (p. 252, fn. 6=
1).
Unlike Van Valin (2005), which looks at how syntax, semantics and pragmatic=
s
interact in different ways across human languages, Ariel's book, though foc=
using
on the ''grammaticization of pragmatics'' (p. 159), is a kind of grammar th=
at
sounds very much lexically biased. This is evident in, e.g. her support of =
a no
''one-to-one relationship between cognitive concepts and grammatical catego=
ries''
(pp. 167-169) as in the case of 'washing' and 'hiding', while maintaining t=
hat
''the grammar goes the discourse, rather than the cognition, way'' (p. 169)=
 and
hence much in agreement with Hopper and Thompson (1980; 1984; 1993) who are=
 of
the view that semantic concepts are derivative of discourse functions, rath=
er
than the other way round (p. 172). Except for the development of S-modifier=
s (p.
297) and 'since' (p. 307), the rest of the argument presented in Chapter 7 =
is
devoted to solving the controversial question of 'what is said' (see Levins=
on
2000 and Ariel's summary, p. 292), which is obviously a pragmatic/semantic =
issue.

This is not to deny that she has tackled grammatical, including a number of
phonological/morphological, issues. In one place (p. 192), she says that ''=
some
strings are more useful to speakers than others''. As such, we would expect=
 users
of Standard Arabic to feel content with the construction /sa?aktubu/ 'I'll
write' and thus ridding of the categorical boundary in the equivalent expre=
ssion
/sawfa ?aktubu/. Such a preference may be ''privileged'' on the basis of
''frequency'' (cf. p. 191), but since negation is blocked in the constructi=
on,
users normally negate the expression: /sawfa lan ?aktuk/ 'I'll not write'.,=
 at
which classical grammarians would frown, though. In another place (p. 186; =
cf.
also p. 191), she seems to agree with Hooper's (1976) argument when she wri=
tes:
''That a potential reductive sound change applied to the original schwas in
_every_, _artillery_, and _memory_ according to their respective frequencie=
s.
The fact that _every_ has no schwa preceding the /r/ now, but _artillery_ d=
oes,
is due to the fact that the former is a highly frequent word, whereas the l=
atter
is quite rare. In between in terms of frequency is _memory_, which is also
phonetically intermediate, with a syllabic /r/.''=20

My position is that in _every_ primary stress is retained, whereas stress w=
ould
shift to the pre-antepenultimate syllable if the schwa were reduced in
_artillery_. Since the majority of multisyllabic words in English receive t=
heir
primary stress on the antepenultimate syllable (my dictionary-based conclus=
ion),
due to its prominence, the schwa must be maintained in the penultimate syll=
able
as constrained by English phonology elsewhere.

The ''surprising facts'' (p. 254) for which she posits seven stimulating qu=
estions
are not very much different from the ones called ''ugly facts'' (p. 195) in
essence; for there's no question about their pragmatic motivations, includi=

whatever extralinguistic forces. At this point, one may wonder if there is =
any

 role
played by language academies (p. 182, fn. 28), including prescriptive

Ariel, after all, is fully aware that the ''road to grammar is still not
obstacle-free'' (p. 209). That said, Ariel's use of ''potential'' so freque=
ntly
that factors affecting linguistic change will forever remain competitive an=

hence justifying the ''paths'' she has chosen for the bride and groom, name=

grammar and pragmatics, will undoubtedly pave the road for other researcher=
s to
follow up the numerous challenging issues which await verification in light=
 of
fresh data secured from other languages. Her reference to Haspelmath (2004)=
,
being written at the same time as her chapter 6 ''without either knowing ab=
out
the other'' (p. 213, fn. 4), is a sign of honesty and credibility, which we=
 are
compelled to admire. Though found (sometimes) a bit tiring at certain
crossroads, I must say I enjoyed reading the book.
