Meeting Description:

Clinical Linguistics Workshop Session at Poznan Linguistic Meeting 

Call for Papers

We invite contributions which deal with all areas of language disorders
employing diverse theoretical and methodological approaches. The concepts  of
'Variants, Variability and Variation' are crucial in distinguishing between 
typical versus atypical speech. This is particularly true when confronted by
human language which is disordered and dysfunctional. In this workshop we will
concentrate on empirical studies of atypical speech and language phenomena per
se as well as research comparing and contrasting the phonetic-phonological,
prosodic, lexical, grammatical and pragmatic differences between individuals
with various speech and language disorders and matched peer control groups.

To submit an abstract please go to: 
http://ifa.amu.edu.pl/plm/Abstract_submission

Notification of acceptance: 01 June 2009 

Each paper will be given 30 minutes, including 10 minutes for discussion. The
language of the conference is English.

Selected papers from the conference will be published in a joint volume issued
by Cambridge Scholars Publishing.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
