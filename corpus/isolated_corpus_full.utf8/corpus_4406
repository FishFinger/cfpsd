Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

The distinction between conceptual and procedural content, which represents
a new view on other classic characterizations, is a major component of
Relevance Theory. According to Wilson and Sperber (1993:1), an utterance can be
expected "to encode two basic types of information: representational and
computational, or conceptual and procedural -that is, information about the
representations to be manipulated, and information about how to manipulate them."

Research on procedural content has already produced very noteworthy results in
many areas. However, there are still a number of questions that require further
clarification and more detailed analysis. The conference is intended to be a
meeting point for those working on procedural meaning from different points of
view and to identify new challenges that will determine the directions for
research in the next few years. 

Second Call for Papers

In order to bring together the most outstanding researchers currently working in
the field of procedural semantics, we are organizing a monographic and highly
specialized meeting.  It will provide an opportunity to present and reflect on
the most recent achievements of investigations in this field within a forum of
qualified academics, and to discuss the questions which are still open, as well
as the challenges for future research. 

We welcome contributions, either for 30-minute plenary oral presentations or for
the poster session, within three main areas: 
- theoretical
- analytical-descriptive  
- experimental 

Invited Speakers 
- Diane Blakemore (U. Salford) tba
- Bruce Fraser (U. Boston) tba
- Thorstein Fretheim (U. Trondheim): The use of conceptual meaning for a
procedural purpose
- Daniel Wedgwood (U. Edinburgh): Interpreting procedures: some conceptual
issues in meaning and grammar
- Deirdre Wilson (University College London) tba

Date: 03-Sep-2009 - 04-Sep-2009
Location: Paris, France 
Contact Person: Anton Antonov

Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Phonology 

Subject Language(s): Japanese (jpn)

Language Family(ies): Japonic 

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

This two-day international workshop aims at bringing together specialists from
around the world working on the history & reconstruction of (proto-)Japanese
accent. Its foremost goal is to take stock of recent advances in this area and
to see how we can further refine our current understanding of the history of
Japanese accent and of its very nature.

Indeed, recent proposals to treat it as tone at least at the (Early) Middle
Japanese level will be addressed, as will be different interpretations of the
(Early) Middle Japanese tone dot materials and consequently diverging proposals
for the reconstruction of proto-Japanese accent.

Data from the Ryukyus, especially if new & hitherto unpublished, will be most
welcome as it could possibly help clarify & validate proposed reconstruction
models & pathways of diachronic evolution of Japanese (or rather, Japonic) accent.

The working language of the conference will be English. 

Call for Papers

A call for papers is hereby issued. Apart from oral presentations (both long and
short, see hereafter), a poster session, whose goal is mainly to present the
work of graduate students, will also be organized.

Presentations may be short (45 min. incl. discussion) or long (60 min. incl.
discussion). Those willing to contribute a presentation dealing with the history
and/or reconstruction of Japanese (and/or Ryukyuan) accent are invited to submit
an abstract in English (2 pages max. incl. references, Times New Roman 12 pt,
single-spaced, pdf format) at the following address starting Feb 16 and until
March 31: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/HRJA2009. Authors will be notified of
acceptance in early May.

Please note that papers/posters presenting a historically-minded synchronic
description of hitherto understudied Japanese/Ryukyuan varieties are also most
welcome.
