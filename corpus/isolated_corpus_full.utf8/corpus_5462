Meeting Description:

Capturing knowledge by using markup techniques and by supporting semantic
annotations is a major technique for creating metadata. It is beneficial in a
wide range of content-oriented intelligent applications. One important
application for instance is the Semantic Web. The research about the WWW
currently strives to augment syntactic information already present in the Web by
semantic metadata in order to achieve a Semantic Web that human and software
agents can understand. Here, one of the most urgent challenges now is a
knowledge-capturing problem, i.e., how one may turn existing syntactic resources
into knowledge structures. A solution is to markup web documents in order to
create metadata on the web or to author new documents in a way that they contain
markup directly.

Another application is the indexing and searching of multimedia (and
multilingual) data. It is difficult to completely process the content of
multimedia data, even with technologies based on natural language processing,
image processing, machine vision and speech recognition. Therefore, semantic
annotation is one of the promising methodologies to define semantic structures
on the content.

Workshop Goals:

This workshop aims at bringing together members of different overlapping
communities that share the interest on semantic authoring and annotation for
developing methods and tools:

-Semantic Web researchers who use semantic authoring and annotation to enrich
the web with distributed relational meta-data in order to enable a
machine-readable web.
-Members of the human language technology community, developing information
extraction systems for the generation of meta-data
-People from the multimedia content domain, indexing and searching of multimedia
(and multilingual) data.
-Researchers who address innovative topics and applications by semantic
annotation (semantic annotation of databases, annotation of web/grid services,
semantic hypertext, etc.) This will give an opportunity to push further the
discussion upon the potential of semantic annotation across these communities.
