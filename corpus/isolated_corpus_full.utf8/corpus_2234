-----------------------------------------------------------


In connection with the workshop Finding the Hidden Knowledge: =

Text mining for biology and medicine, to be held in Glasgow =

(Scotland) 21-22 February 2008, there will be a hosted poster =

session with refreshments and prizes for the best student =

posters.

Judges for the competition will be drawn from the =

internationally-known researchers who will be speaking or =

participating in panels at the workshop, including:

Doug Armstrong, University of Edinburgh
William Hayes, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA
Lawrence Hunter, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine
Peter Jackson, Thomson Corporation
Mark Liberman, Linguistics Data Consortium (University of Pennsylvania)
John Pestian, Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Jun'ichi Tsujii, University of Tokyo & University of Manchester

Researchers and post-graduate students are encouraged to submit =

posters on their research on text mining, methods which could be =

adapted for text mining, or aspects of biomedical research which =

could benefit from text mining. Creativity and imagination are =

encouraged.

***Poster abstract submission deadline: 21 January 2008***

Abstracts should be in MSWord or PDF format and no longer than =

300 words. The submission should include the title, authors, =

affilation, contact details for the corresponding author, and =

the description of the poster (abstract). The posters chosen =

based on this abstract will be displayed at the workshop and =

included into a workshop booklet.

Workshop on Finding the Hidden Knowledge:
Text mining for biology and medicine
-----------------------------------------


Dates:    21-22 February 2008
Location: Kelvin Gallery, Glasgow University, Glasgow, Scotland
Price:    40 GBP (10 GPB for students)


The electronic availability of biomedical publications has led =

to a surge of interest in using text mining (TM) as a way of =

accessing this ever expanding knowledge store. It is clear that =

future advances in understanding of biomedical issues will rely =

on the discovery of interconnections of data and models, which =

are as yet unrecognised. TM will provide a major contribution to =

joining up diverse experimental evidence and will give new =

insights into biological processes. Assembling a picture of the =

mechanisms of life in a systems or pathway context, for example, =

can be greatly facilitated by the use of tools such as =

intelligent search and knowledge distillation over very large =

document collections. However, effective tools require =

cooperation between the designers and the users. This workshop =

aims to bring the biomedical and TM communities together by =

showcasing the possible applications of TM while opening up =

dialogue that will facilitate specification of use cases to =

drive the next generation of applications.

Some key questions that the workshop will address are: Is there =

such a thing as an ultimate TM application or are individual =

solutions needed for each problem? What are the common =

difficulties in eliciting user requirements and what are the =

solutions? Is TM really the way forward, or are the =

higher-precision hand-curated databases and ontologies more =

practical? What are the specific challenges for TM in the =

biomedical domain? How can TM technology be successfully =

incorporated into research and curation workflows despite being =

imperfect?


What to expect
--------------

- Two days of talks by leading international speakers from
   academia and industry (backgrounds to include biology,
   medicine, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics, ontologies and text
   mining)

- Poster/demo sessions for participants to present recent work
   and specific information needs

- Ample time for informal discussion and networking including a
   reception with wine and food


Target Audience
---------------

- Biomedical Text Mining Community
- Larger Bioinformatics Community
- Life and Health Science Communities


Organisers
----------

David Gilbert, Bioinformatics Research Centre, University of Glasgow
Claire Grover, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
Ben Hachey, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
Chris Janssen, Scottish Bioinformatics Forum
Ewan Klein, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
Tamara Polajnar, Bioinformatics Research Centre, University of Glasgow
Bonnie Webber, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh
