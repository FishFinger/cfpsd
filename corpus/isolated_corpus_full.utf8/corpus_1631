The 3rd International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing
                          IJCNLP-08

 	        CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS  

The Program Committee of the The 3rd International Joint Conference on
Natural Language Processing  (IJCNLP-08 -
http://www.rcl.cityu.edu.hk/ijcnlp-08/)  invites proposals for the
tutorial program for IJCNLP.  The Conference is being organized by the
Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP:
http://www.afnlp.org/) in the historical Hyderabad, India, 7 - 12
January 2008.  The tutorials will be held on January 7, 2008. 

Proposals for tutorials on all topics in the general area of natural
language processing   are solicited. In addition to tutorial proposals
on fundamental areas of computational linguistics, we encourage
cross-disciplinary tutorials that introduce recent  advances in
machine learning, statistics, data mining, information retrieval or
speech processing that are relevant to the natural language processing
community. We also specifically solicit tutorials which address
language processing techniques and issues for lesser-studied
languages.  

 SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and a brief description of the tutorial content and its
   relevance to the natural language processing  community (not more
   than 2 pages). 

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
   tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot
   (including a coffee break). In very exceptional cases, six-hour
   tutorial slots could be made available as well. 

3. A sample (and preferably all, if available) of the slides and any
   other material that will be used for the tutorial. 

4. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
   the tutorial instructors, including a brief resume and
   one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of
   expertise. 

5. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the
   same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an
   estimate of the audience size. 

6. A description of any special requirements for technical equipment
   and services (e.g., Internet access, multiple projectors/screens,
   additional desktops or laptops).  

All components of the proposal, except perhaps the course material
sample, should be submitted together as either a single text or a
single pdf file. The  (sample) course material can be made available
via a web site for download by us, if the size is large for e-mail. 

Proposals should be submitted by September 10, 2007 to

        oflazer@sabanciuniv.edu

The subject line should be: " IJCNLP'08 -- TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

PLEASE NOTE: PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY REGULAR MAIL OR FAX.

 TUTORIAL INSTRUCTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

Proposers will be notified  by September 17, 2007 whether their
tutorial proposals have been accepted or not. Proposers must then
provide descriptions of their tutorials for inclusion in the
conference registration material by October 15, 2007. The description
should be in three formats: a Latex version that fits onto a 1/2 page;
an ASCII version that can be included with the email announcement; and
an HTML version that can be included on the conference home
page. Tutorial instructors must provide the final tutorial materials,
at least, containing copies of the course slides as well as a
bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, and any other
material by November  23, 2007. 

 IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline for tutorial proposals:  September 10, 2007 
Notification of acceptance:                  September 17, 2007
