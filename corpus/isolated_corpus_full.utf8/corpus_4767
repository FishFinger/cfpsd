SIGIR 2009 Workshop on the Future of IR Evaluation
July 23, Boston
http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kamps/ireval/

Call for Papers

Evaluation is at the core of information retrieval: virtually all
progress owes directly or indirectly to test collections built within
the so-called Cranfield paradigm.  However, in recent years, IR
researchers are routinely pursuing tasks outside the traditional
paradigm, by taking a broader view on tasks, users, and context.
There is a fast moving evolution in content from traditional static
text to diverse forms of dynamic, collaborative, and multilingual
information sources.  Also industry is embracing "operational"
evaluation based on the analysis of endless streams of queries and
clicks.

We invite the submission of papers that think outside the box:

- Are you working on an interesting new retrieval task or aspect?  Or
   on its broader task or user context?  Or on a complete system with
   novel interface?  Or on interactive/adaptive search?  Or ...?
   Please explain why this is of interest, and what would be an
   appropriate way of evaluating.

- Do you feel that the current evaluation tools fail to do justice to
   your research?  Is there a crucial aspect missing?  Or are you
   interested in specific, rare, phenomena that have little impact on
   the average scores?  Or ...?  Please explain why this is of
   interest, and what would be an appropriate way of evaluating.

- Do you have concrete ideas how to evaluate such a novel IR task?  Or
   ideas for new types of experimental or operational evaluation?  Or
   new measures or ways of re-using existing data?  Or ...?  Please
   explain why this is of interest, and what would be an appropriate
   way of evaluating.

The workshop brings together all stake-holders ranging from those with
novel evaluation needs, such as a PhD candidate pursuing a new
IR-related problem, to senior IR evaluation experts.  Desired outcomes
are insight into how to make IR evaluation more "realistic," and at
least one concrete idea for a retrieval track or task (at CLEF, INEX,
NTCIR, TREC) that would not have happened otherwise.

Help us shape the future of IR evaluation!

- Submit a short 2-page poster or position paper explaining your key
   wishes or key points,

- and take actively part in the discussion at the Workshop.

The deadline is Monday May 18, 2009, further submission details are on
http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kamps/ireval/
