TJL: call for submissions on Spoken Corpus

The 7th Annual Wenshan International Symposium, hosted by the Department of
English at National Chengchi University in Taiwan on May 19, 2008, features
the topic: Spoken Corpus: Language Documentation and Applications. In order

and useful for history, culture, research, and teaching, and in order to
inspire more students and scholars to engage in language documentation,
Taiwan Journal of Linguistics is organizing a special issue with Spoken
Corpus as its main theme. Researches related to the theme are welcome to
submit the papers to the Guest Editor for this special issue Huei-ling Lai
at hllai@nccu.edu.tw. The submission deadline is July 31, 2008. The length
of the submission should not exceed 40 pages single-spaced.
