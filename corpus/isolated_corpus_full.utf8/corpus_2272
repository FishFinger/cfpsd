Dear DUC friends,

As was announced at the DUC 2007 workshop earlier this year, starting in 
2008, DUC workshops will no longer be held as part of the NAACL-HLT 
Conference.  Rather, the workshop will move to the NIST campus in 
Gaithersburg, Maryland, and will expand to include other NLP tasks in 
addition to Summarization.  This new workshop will no longer be referred 
to as DUC, but will be called the Text Analysis Conference (TAC).  The 
organization of TAC will be very similar to DUC except for the fact that 
it will have multiple "tracks", or areas of focus.

TAC 2008 will have three tracks:
	1. Summarization
	2. Question Answering (formerly part of TREC)
	3. Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)

TAC participants may participate in one or more tracks.  It is hoped 
that bringing together these related NLP evaluations under the new TAC 
umbrella will facilitate sharing of resources and research ideas.  For 
example, in addition to the main update summarization task, the 2008 
Summarization track will include an opinion summarization pilot which 
will share data with the QA track; in this joint QA-Summarization 
exercise, QA track participants will search a large collection of 
documents to retrieve passages/answers to opinion questions, which 
Summarization track participants will use to generate short, coherent 
summaries.

Submission deadlines for the various TAC 2008 tasks will likely range 
from late June to early September. The workshop itself will be held at 
NIST on November 17-18.  Please watch for the TAC 2008 Call for 
Participation which will come out in a few weeks with preliminary task 
descriptions and information about registration.

With best regards,

Hoa
