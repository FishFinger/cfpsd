Meeting Description:

This workshop aims at investigating interpretative and formal aspects of=20
indefiniteness in individual languages as well as crosslinguistically.

Crosslinguistically, an NP may be marked as indefinite by different means. =
In=20
addition to the prototypical indefiniteness markers, e.g. the indefinite ar=
ticle in=20
languages such as English or German, there are markers like 'some' and=20
indefinite 'this' in English or 'irgendein' and 'so'n' in German. It is a m=
atter of=20
debate what facets of indefiniteness such markers express in comparison to =
the=20
indefinite article. A more complete picture of the exact function of indefi=
niteness=20
markers can be reached by taking into account languages like Moroccan Arabi=
c=20
and Uzbek, which employ two distinct indefinite articles, or languages like=
=20
Russian, in which indefiniteness is grammaticalized in the complex system o=
f=20
indefinite pronouns. In his influential typological study, Haspelmath (1997=
)=20
determines different functions indefinite pronouns may display in different=
=20
languages.=20

Since this seminal work that was restricted to indefinite pronouns, there h=
ave=20
been important steps towards an understanding of the semantic and pragmatic=
=20
properties of different indefiniteness markers in general (e.g. by Farkas (=
2002)=20
and Ionin (2006) for English; Jayez & Tovena (2006) for French; Mart=ED (20=
07) for=20
Spanish; Ebert, Ebert & Hinterwimmer (to appear) for German; Geist (2008), =
Geist=20
& Onea (2007) for Russian, and von Heusinger & Klein (2008) for Uzbek). Suc=
h=20
fine-grained analyses of indefiniteness markers in particular languages now=
=20
provide a basis for cross=AClinguistic comparison with the aim to determine=
=20
universal types and crosslinguistically applicable concepts of indefinitene=
ss.=20

Call for Papers:

We welcome submissions in which the following issues are addressed:

-Comparative studies on the linguistic coding of indefiniteness;=20
-Systems of indefinite pronouns: semantic fine-grained distinctions and=20
pragmatic functions;=20
-Interrelations of indefiniteness with other phenomena like specificity,
information structure, aspect, and modality;=20
-The diachronic rise of indefinite articles and the degrees of
grammaticalization of indefiniteness markers in different languages.

Abstracts should be anonymous and at most 2 pages in length. Please send yo=
ur=20
abstracts electronically in pdf- and doc-format to indefiniteness 'at' ling=
.uni-
stuttgart.de, and include your name, affiliation and the title of the abstr=
act in the=20
body of the e-mail. Submissions will be reviewed by two reviewers.
