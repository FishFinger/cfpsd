SPOKEN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS

A workshop organised within the Intelligent Information Systems 2008
conference in the Polish mountain resort of Zakopane on 18 June 2008.

The aim of the workshop is to give an opportunity to share experience
in solving problems related to NL communication with computer systems
and creation of dialogue systems. The workshop is organised by the IST
LUNA (http://www.ist-luna.eu/) projects members and it will cover
diverse topics related to human-computer interaction in natural
language, which include among others spontaneous speech understanding
(SLU), speech corpora, and semantics and pragmatics of dialogue.  We
welcome all researches working on dialogue systems and speech
understanding to present their activities related to the topic.

See the conference page, http://iis.ipipan.waw.pl/, for deadlines,
submission requirements and other practical information.  (Submission
deadline is 31 January 2008.)
