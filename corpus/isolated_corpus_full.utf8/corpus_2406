XII Conference of the Foundation for Endangered Languages

Call for Abstracts 

The Foundation for Endangered Languages exists to support, enable and assist the
documentation, protection and promotion of endangered languages. One of the
possibilities to reach this is to bring specialists together during conferences,
which have been held every year since 1996, most recently in Barcelona, Spain
(2004), Stellenbosch, South Africa (2005), Mysore, India (2006) and Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia (2007).
In 2008 the Foundation will organise its Twelfth Conference in association with
the Mercator European Research Centre on Multilingualism and Language Learning
and the Fryske Akademy. The conference will be organised and sponsored in the
framework of the jubilee program KNAW 200, the bicentenary celebration of the
foundation of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1808.

Place and Time
Conference Centre 'It Aljemint'
Fryske Akademy
Doelestrjitte 2-4
Ljouwert/Leeuwarden
The Netherlands

Dates: 25-27 September 2008
The United Nations' Year of the Languages will be celebrated in 2008. On the
26th of September 2008 it is the annual European Language Day and these two
facts will be taken into account during the conference. 

Theme of the conference:
Endangered Languages and Language Learning

This theme is related to the profile of the Mercator European Research Centre,
which gathers and mobilises expertise in the field of language learning at
school, at home and through cultural participation in favour of linguistic
diversity of Europe. 

Possible topics to be discussed:
1) Language learning in general:
- Successful multilingual regions with endangered languages
- Language learning processes and language transmission in small communities
- Language transmission outside formal educational settings (pre-school
facilities, cultural settings, distant learning facilities)	
2) Language learning in an educational context:
- Promoting linguistic diversity through multilingual education and teacher
training programs
- Language teaching in small indigenous or migrant communities
- Potential of teaching methods for language revitalisation
- Innovation in language learning and teaching strategies
- Case studies on language immersion in endangered language communities 
- The use of electronic tools for language teaching and maintenance
Papers presented at the conference should make reference to actual language
situations, and ideally should draw on personal experience. The aim of the
conference is to pool experience, to discuss and to learn from it. Possible
expected outcomes could be:
- Suggestions for further action and research for the revitalisation of
endangered languages;
- Proposals for action programmes aimed at language learning and language
transmission;
- Recommendations for a common European approach towards the strengthening of
endangered languages to the European Union, the Council of Europe and UNESCO;

Meeting Description:

Cognitive and Functional Perspectives on Dynamic Tendencies in Languages

Description

The aim of the conference is to bring together linguists working in the
functional and cognitive linguistic paradigms. We invite linguists who take a
functional and/or cognitive perspective in describing and explaining linguistic
phenomena in the language(s) they are researching and those working on language
dynamics from a functional or cognitive perspective to participate.
We especially encourage linguists working on the Uralic languages to submit
papers, in the hope of expanding the Cognitive Linguistic paradigm with data
from these languages; researchers involved with other languages and language
families are, of course, also most welcome. We also encourage papers on
grammaticalization and those looking at the role of oral and written forms, or
different language varieties, in language change, as well as changes in grammar
resulting from language contact. Furthermore, presentations dealing with
different usage-based models, including construction grammar, are also welcome.

Keywords

cognitive and functional studies on grammar
grammaticalization
dynamics of language
synchronic and diachronic language change
language contact: aspects of grammar
usage-based approaches and models
emergent grammar
language typology
language evolution
Uralic languages
