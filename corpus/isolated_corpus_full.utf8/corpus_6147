Meeting Description:

XIV Forum for Iberian Studies: 'The Limits of Literary Translation'
June 24-25, 2010 - Exeter College, University of Oxford

Thinkers ranging from Voltaire to Nabokov have dismissed the translation of
poetry as an impossibility. Pirandello famously made similar protestations
regarding drama. Jokes are routinely shrugged off as untranslatable. Yet
translators, in theory and in practice, regularly contravene these claims, =
and
the XIV Forum for Iberian Studies will likewise take these up as a gauntlet
flung down. The Forum will explore ways in which translators overcome,
acknowledge, or compensate for the presumed 'impossibilities' they encounte=
r in
the context of Iberian languages and literatures. At the university where t=
he
'La Celestina,' 'Guzm=E1n de Alfarache,' 'La Regenta,' and the 'Novelas
ejemplares' were first translated into English, we will discuss old and new
challenges in concrete, practical terms.=20

Call for Papers

The Forum invites proposals for papers that grapple with the potential solu=
tions
and limitations to rendering the most challenging modes. Papers are not lim=
ited
to the following areas, but may fall into these categories or thematic stra=
nds:
- Poetry=20
- Theatre=20
- Novel=20
- Humour
- History in translation
- Experimental modes (the avant-garde; neologisms; audiovisual translation)
- Dialects, sociolects, and Iberian languages other than Spanish=20

Guidelines for the submission of abstracts:
The Organising Committee of the Forum for Iberian Studies welcomes the=20
participation of scholars, researchers, lecturers, graduate students,
professional/amateur translators and interested individuals worldwide. The =
main
languages of the conference will be English and Spanish. Other Iberian lang=
uages
are also welcome. Proposals are invited for papers (20 minutes) followed by
discussion (10 minutes).

Abstracts are due on 30 January 2010 and will be reviewed by the organising
committee. Notification of acceptance is scheduled for 28 February 2010.=20
