Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

The goal of this conference is to bring together scholars focusing on
intra-speaker variation in syntax in an effort to stimulate theoretical debate
in this area. 

Formal Approaches to Variation in Syntax 

Call for papers 
(Deadline extended due to late publication of second call for papers)

The Kings Manor, York, England, May 10-13, 2007 

Within the last few years, syntacticians have begun to take an interest in
intra-speaker variation to a degree that was hitherto unknown. Previously, only
those syntacticians interested in diachronic variation--led by Kroch and
colleagues--devoted much attention to the issue of how variation can be dealt
with formally (Kroch 1989, 1994, 2001, Kroch and Taylor 1995, 2000, Pintzuk
1991). Formal syntax has otherwise largely ignored the type of data that
sociolinguistic variationists attach so much importance to quantifying, either
because they had nothing to say about it or because they felt that in the
grammar of the idealised speaker-hearer there would (or even could) be no
variation. The advent of minimalism, which generally eschews the possibility of
optionality in grammar, has prompted some syntacticians to take a greater
interest in variability, in order to explain it without reference to ''free
variation.'' Recent literature, then, has seen several promising new formal
approaches to intra-speaker variation in syntax (Adger 2006, Yang 2000, Henry
1995, Clark 2004, Asudeh 2001). 

The goal of this conference is to bring together current researchers in this
area in an effort to stimulate debate on issues such as the following: 

-Is variability in child language at the root of syntactic change or is 
variation in the adult grammar a necessary impetus? 
-What is the relationship between intra-speaker and inter-speaker variation 
in syntax? 
-What formal and syntactic mechanisms best explain the existence of
intra-speaker variation? 
-Are frequencies of variants (partially) predictable from the formal 
properties (e.g. features) involved? 
-What if any is the role of parameters in intra-speaker variation? 

Invited Speakers: 

David Adger 
Sjef Barbiers 
Joan Bresnan 
Tony Kroch 
Charles Yang 

The conference will run from Thursday evening to Saturday evening. Researchers
in this area are invited to submit abstracts for presentations of 35 minutes,
with an additional 10 minutes allotted for questions. (Invited speaker
presentations will be 45 minutes in length with an additional 15 minutes for
questions.) We intend to approach publishers with a view to publishing an edited
volume of selected papers following the conference. Preference will be given to
papers which address the issues outlined above and related formal issues rather
than merely providing detailed analysis of a piece of variation. We encourage
syntacticians of all theoretical persuasions to apply. 

Abstracts of no more than 2 pages (A4 or 8.5'' x 11'') should be sent to 
lang6@york.ac.uk by March 8, 2007. Please send two copies of each abstract, one
in camera ready form for inclusion in the abstract booklet with 
speakers' names, affiliation and email addresses, and another anonymised, 
both in pdf format. Notifications of acceptance will be sent by March 15th 
2007. 

Organisers: 

Bernadette Plunkett and Bill Haddican (University of York Linguistics)

Call Deadline: 01-May-2007 

Meeting Description:
We are pleased to announce that the 30th Annual Second Language Research Forum
(SLRF-2007) will be hosted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

1) Dates of the Conference: Thursday, October 11th through Sunday, October 14th,
2007.  

2) Place of the Conference: Illini Union at the UIUC campus.

3) Theme of the Conference: "Second Language Acquisition and Research: Focus on
Form and Function" which will highlight the interconnections and interfaces
between form and function in SLA research and practices and will explore the
implications of these interfaces for second language pedagogy. 

We are pleased to invite proposals for papers, posters, and thematic colloquia
investigating form and function in SLA from any of the following research areas:

Formal approaches to SLA
Functional approaches to SLA
Conversation analysis (CA for SLA)
Testing and assessment
Heritage language acquisition
Psycholinguistic approaches to SLA
Classroom research
SLA pedagogy
Naturalistic SLA
CALL / CMC
Learner corpora and SLA

Abstract submission will be done online, on the SLRF 2007 website:
http://www.slrf-2007.uiuc.edu. Click on the ''Abstracts'' link on the left, and
follow the instructions there.

Only online PDF submissions at the site specified above will be accepted.
Abstracts should be anonymous. They must be limited to 400 words for papers or
posters, and 500 words (plus individual abstracts submitted separately) for
thematic colloquia. Each author may submit no more than one individual and one
co-authored abstract.

Submission Deadline: May 1, 2007 
Notification of Acceptance: July 1, 2007
