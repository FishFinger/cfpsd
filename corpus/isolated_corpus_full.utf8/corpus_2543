IIS 2008 Workshop on

Spoken Language Understanding and Dialogue Systems 

Zakopane, Poland
18 June 2008

http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/IIS2008/luna.html

Submission Deadline: 13 February 2008

The SLUDS workshop is organized by the IST LUNA (http://www.ist-luna.eu) projects members and it is aimed to give an opportunity to share ideas on problems related to communication with computer systems in natural language and dialogue systems.  

Scope:
The main area of interest of the workshop is human-computer interaction in natural language and include among others:
- spontaneous speech recognition, 
- preparation of speech corpora,
- transcription problems in spoken corpora 
- parsing problems in spoken texts  
- semantic interpretation of text,
- knowledge representation in relation to dialogue systems,
- dialogue models,
- spoken language understanding.

Submissions: 
The workshop organizers invite long (10 pages) and short (5 pages) papers. The papers should be organized in accordance with common scientific structure (abstract, state of the art in the field, intention, used methodology, obtained results and references). Authors should upload an electronic version of the paper (pdf and/or possibly ps) by using the conference paper registration site till February 13, 2008.

The papers (written in English) will be refereed on the basis of long abstracts (4 pages, but full version will be also accepted) by an international committee. After notification of acceptance, authors will be allowed to make extensions/corrections in accordance with the suggestions of the reviewers and submit final camera-ready papers. The final papers are to be prepared using LaTeX (zipped archive with files needed to process documents can be uploaded form the conference page).
