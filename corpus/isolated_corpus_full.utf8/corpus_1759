Intelligent User Interfaces - IUI08
A new generation of user interfaces
Call for Tutorials


Tutorials provide conference participants with the opportunity to gain
new insights, knowledge, and skills. Topics may range from practical
guidelines and standards to academic issues and theory. Different types
of people attend IUI so the tutorial should be designed to address a
specific audience:

IUI Novices: provide a basic understanding

    * Theoretical introduction on major topics concerning intelligent
      user interfaces.
    * Hands-on introduction to established practice and methodologies.

IUI Intermediate: provide a quick-start to knowledgeable attendees

    * Exhaustive overview of a mature area of IUI research and/or
practice.

IUI Advanced: provide in-depth views on new trends in IUI

    * Expert survey of an IUI subarea.
    * Motivated and explained vision on emerging topics relevant to IUI
      researchers.

Tutorials are intended to provide an overview of the field and should
therefore present well-established information in a balanced way. 
Tutorials should not advocate a single avenue of research or promote a
product. Proposals will be reviewed by the tutorial co-chairs.


Format

Tutorials may last a half day or a full day. Half-day tutorials are
three hours long (not including breaks). Full-day tutorials are six
hours long (not including breaks).

 Timeline for tutorial proposal submissions:
 Monday, 27 August 2007 	 Submission of proposal
 Monday, 10 September 2007 	 Notification about acceptance or
rejection
 Monday, 17 September 2007 	 Submission of tutorial description
 Monday, 14 November 2007 	 Camera-ready summary due to publisher
 Sunday, 13 January 2008 	 Tutorial date


Submission

Those interested in presenting a tutorial should submit a proposal to
the Tutorial Chairs by email with a maximum length of 5 pages in PDF. A
tutorial proposal should contain the following information:

   1. *Title.* Title of the tutorial
   2. *Description.* A brief description of the tutorial, suitable for
      inclusion in the conference registration brochure, including both
      a one-sentence and a one-paragraph description.
   3. *Justification.* An explanation of why the tutorial topic would be
      of interest to a substantial part of the IUI audience.
   4. *Duration.* Duration of your tutorial (half- or full-day).
   5. *Audience.* Characterization of the potential target audience for
      the tutorial, including prerequisite knowledge.
   6. *Objective.* Indicate which of the objectives listed above are
      best served by the proposed tutorial.
   7. *Outline.* A detailed outline of the tutorial including a
      tentative schedule of topics to be dealt with with time
allocations.
   8. *Instructor Biography.* A brief resume of the instructor(s), which
      should include name, postal address, phone and fax numbers, e-mail
      address, background in the tutorial area, any available example of
      work in the area (ideally, a published tutorial-level article or
      slides on the subject), evidence of teaching experience, and
      evidence of scholarship in IUI, AI, and/or HCI.
   9. *Requirements.* List any materials needed to run the tutorial,
      such as audio/visual needs, supplies for each participant, and/or
      limitations on the number ofparticipants.

If the proposed tutorial has been given previously, the proposal should
include information about where the tutorial has been given and how it
will be modified for IUI 2008. If the tutorial has been given at a
previous IUI conference, describe how changes to the tutorial will
address comments from previous attendees. Additional materials may be
submitted, but they will not necessarily be taken into consideration in
the review process.


Tutorial Notes

The presenters will be asked to prepare substantial tutorial notes,
which should include:

    * An introduction to the topic
    * Copies of all overhead transparencies and slides
    * An annotated bibliography
    * Copies of relevant background material or scholarly papers (for
      which the instructors have obtained any necessary reprint
permission)
    * Material for any tutorial exercises (+ solutions)

Printing of tutorial notes will be done by the conference organization.


Review Criteria

Tutorial proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their estimated
benefit for prospective participants and on their fit within the
tutorial program as a whole. Factors to be considered include:

    * Relevance, timeliness, importance, audience appeal, and attendance
      limits
    * Suitability for presentation in a half-day or a full-day tutorial
      format
    * Use of presentation methods that offer participants direct
      experience with the material being taught
    * Past experience and qualifications of the instructors

Selection will also be based on the overall distribution of topics,
approaches (overview, theory, methodology, how-to), audience experience
levels, and specialties of the intended audiences.

A one page advance summary of each tutorial will appear in the IUI
printed proceedings.

Compensation for presenting a tutorial will include one complimentary
conference registration (assuming a minimum number of 10 participants at
the tutorial who are registered by the time the tutorials begin).

Tutorial proposals must be sent in electronic format (PDF preferred) by
email to (both) the Tutorials co-chairs by Monday 27th August 2007.
