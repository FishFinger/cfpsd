Abstract Format and Content 

In response to feedback from the participants at the 2005 conference in Berlin
submissions of abstracts are invited in one of two formats: symposia or posters. 

Note that the 2008 conference will not feature independent oral paper
presentations outside the symposia. Posters will have an equal status to
symposia presentations: they will have their own time slots at the conference
and will not be presented in parallel with symposia. 

Submission Instructions for Symposia and Poster Abstracts: 

- All abstracts must be submitted electronically at the conference website at
http://www.in-conference.org.uk/IASCL/abstracts.html 
- The abstract submission site will be open between 15 April 2007 and 15 October
2007. Late abstracts will not be considered. 
- If you are unable to submit your proposal electronically please contact In
Conference by e-mail IASCL@in-conference.org.uk well in advance of 15th October. 
- Notifications of acceptance/rejection decisions will be sent to the symposium
organiser or the first author of a poster submission by 15 February 2008. 
- Abstracts for both symposia and poster presentations will be double-blind
peer-reviewed by 3 referees. 
- The symposium organiser is responsible for ensuring the symposium chair and
first authors of individual papers are registered by 28th April 2008. The first
author of a poster submission must also be registered by the same date. Accepted
symposia or posters that do not comply with this rule will be removed from the
programme. 
- Please note that a maximum of 1 first-authored paper/poster and a maximum of 2
papers/posters in any authorship status will be selected for presentation by
each author. 
- No changes in authorship will be possible after the review process is completed. 
- All abstracts must be submitted in English.  

Topics 

We invite you to submit symposia or posters of original, previously unpublished
research on all aspects of child language.  

A. Symposia 

Symposia are collections of 3-5 individual paper presentations that relate to a
narrowly defined topic of interest. They are offered in 2-hour sessions, we
suggest each individual paper should be 20 minutes including discussion time. 

Each symposium session will have an organiser and a chair. Details on the
organiser and the chair should be included in the submission; the organiser and
the chair can be the same person.  

The organiser of each symposium is the person responsible for: 

- securing the cooperation of all the participants who are to be involved in the
symposium before the proposal is submitted deciding on the internal structure of
the symposium. 
- Important: The organiser will be the only person who receives the information
on the symposium and it is their responsibility to pass this information onto
the individual paper authors. The chair of each symposium is the person
responsible for chairing the session. 

Format and Content of Symposia Submissions: 

- Abstracts must represent original, unpublished research. 
- Proposals for symposia will include a summary of all studies with a clearly
defined common theme. Sufficient detail should be provided to allow peer
reviewers to judge the scientific merit of the proposal. 
- The symposium summary and individual paper abstracts should not be longer than
500 words each. 
- The symposium proposal and each abstract therein should be clearly titled and
include the individual paper titles, individual authors' names (including
information about the organiser and the chair) and professional affiliations.  

B. Posters 

Format and Content of Poster Submissions: 

- Abstracts must represent original, unpublished research. 
- Each submission should be clearly titled and include the names of the authors
and professional affiliations 
- Each abstract should not exceed 500 words: The abstract should include enough
detail to allow reviewers to judge the scientific merits of the study.
