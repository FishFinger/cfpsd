             TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES 2006
                  5th International Workshop

           Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                    http://www.tlt2006.org

                  3rd [FINAL] CALL FOR PAPERS


This the FINAL CALL for paper submission to the Treebanks and
Linguistic Theories '06 conference. We remind you there is about two
weeks remaining to polish and send off your submission!

The Guidelines for paper submission are available at
http://www.tlt2006.org, link "Instructions for Authors" (or directly
at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tlt2006/auth.html). The deadline for
submitting your papers is Sept. 8, 2006, as previously announced.

Workshop motivation and aims 
----------------------------

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the
phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important
for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language
processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and
linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going
projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that
still lack them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish,
Turkish) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks
for specific purposes for languages that already have them
(English). In addition, there are projects that go beyond syntactic
analysis to include different kinds of semantic and pragmatic
annotation. We specifically encourage submissions that discuss the
relations and links between, and possibly merging of, various aspects
of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contents/pragmatic
annotation; also, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks
and/or cross-language annotation schemas, theories and applications
are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved
that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other
dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the
Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil
HPSG Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank,
etc.). Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic
theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the
necessary information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of
co-located events surrounding it (for more information see
www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol,
Bulgaria in
September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the
second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December
2005 (http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html).

Topics of interest 
------------------

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and
linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks; 
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in
- NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development; 
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research; 
- semantically annotated treebanks; 
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks; 
- tools for creation and management of treebanks; 
- standards for treebanks.
