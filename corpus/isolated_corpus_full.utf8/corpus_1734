CALL FOR PAPERS



IJCNLP 2008 WORKSHOP ON NLP FOR LESS PRIVILEGED LANGUAGES

(http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlp-lpl-07)



BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION



While computing has becomes almost ubiquitous in the US and Europe, its
spread in Asia is more recent. However, despite the fact that Asia is a
dense area in terms of linguistic diversity (or perhaps because of it), many
Asian languages are very inadequately supported on computers. Even basic NLP
tools are not available for these languages. This is a major bottleneck in
the development of advanced NLP applications and language resources and it
also has a social cost.

NLP/CL based technologies are now becoming important and future intelligent
systems will use more of these techniques. Most of the NLP/CL tools and
technologies are tailored for English or European languages. Recently, there
has been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries. This is now
the right time to address the problem mentioned above, namely lack of
computing support and basic NLP tools for less privileged languages. Only
when a basic infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes
available can we hope for a more equitable availability of opportunities
made possible by language technology. There have already been attempts in
this direction (some of them are mentioned below) and this workshop will try
to take them further, especially in the Asian context.



WORKSHOP GOALS



The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
archiving language data, developing language resources, providing basic
computing support and creating natural language tools for less privileged
languages. Some of these languages are Malayalam, Gujarati, Maithili,
Assamese, Burmese, Nepali and even tribal languages. They may or may not be
low density languages, but the common feature among them is that they are
not adequately supported on the computers and not many CL/NLP tools or
resources exist for them. The workshop is open to any less privileged (in
the above sense) language of the world, even though the focus will be on
Asian languages.



We also invite novel approaches which can exploit the similarities among
many languages. One of these could be a relatively more privileged language
and can be treated as a pivot language around which resources and tools are
developed for related but less privileged languages with minimum effort. For
example, in the South Asian context, Hindi could be treated as the pivot
language and resources and tools for languages like Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati
etc. could be developed as extensions of the resources and tools for Hindi.
Perhaps minimally supervised algorithms could be used to achieve this.



Papers are invited on substantial, original and unpublished research on
following aspects of NLP for LPL, including but not limited to:



- Archiving and creation of interoperable data and metadata for less
privileged languages.



- Support for less privileged language on computers. This includes input
methods, display, fonts, encoding converters, spell checkers, more
linguistically aware text editors etc.



- Basic NLP tools such as sentence marker, tokenizer, morphological
analyzer, transliteration tools, language and encoding identifiers etc.



- Advanced NLP tools such as POS taggers, local word grouper, approximate
string search, tools for making development of language resources easier.



SUBMISSION



Paper submission is through the centralized workshop submission page at
https://www.softconf.com/ijcnlp/NLPLPL. Papers have to be written in
English. There are two categories of papers: long and short. Long papers can
be up to 8 pages long, while the maximum length for short papers is 5 pages
(including references, figures, tables etc.). All selected papers will be
published in the workshop proceedings.



The papers should be formatted using the LaTeX styles or MS Word templates
recommended for the main IJCNLP conference. These documents are available at
http://www.ijcnlp2008.org/callforpapers.htm. Reviewing will be blind. The
draft papers should not contain any information that can identify the
authors, as far as possible.



IMPORTANT DATES



- Paper Submission Deadline: Sept 21, 2007

- Notification of Paper Acceptance: Oct 26, 2007

- Camera Ready Submission Deadline: Nov 16, 2007
