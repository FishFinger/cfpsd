Concentric: Studies in Linguistics Vol.36 No.2

The journal Concentric: Studies in Linguistics is a refereed, international
journal published in English by the Department of English, National Taiwan
Normal University. Each year two issues are published, one in January and
one in July. We welcome research papers on all aspects of linguistics all
year round. However, for the manuscripts to be included in Concentric 36.2,
the deadline of submission is March 31, 2010.

Specific information for contributors:

Submissions
Manuscripts for publication, books for review, review articles, and
correspondence relating thereto should be addressed to the Editors of
Concentric: Studies in Linguistics (Department of English, National Taiwan
Normal University, No. 162, Sec. 1, Heping E. Road, Taipei City 10610,
Taiwan; concentric.ling@deps.ntnu.edu.tw).

Manuscripts
1. Preferably, articles should be submitted electronically, as e-mail
attachment, in Word for Windows (and in its PDF version if there are
special symbols included). Other formats are possible; please contact the
editors first.
2. Authors who are not native speakers of English are urged to have their
articles thoroughly proofread by a native speaker prior to submission.
3. To facilitate the blind review process, authors' names and affiliations
should appear only on a cover sheet, in a separate file, not on the title page.
4. Except for inset quotations and footnotes in single space, manuscripts
must be typeset in 12-point Times New Roman. Papers should follow the
format of the Language and Linguistics (ISSN: 1606-822X) style sheet, and
are normally limited to 30 single-spaced pages in length, including a
150-word abstract and some key words.
5. The journal will not consider for publication papers being
simultaneously submitted elsewhere.
6. The author(s) will receive one copy of the journal, fifteen off-prints
of the article, and the e-copy of the paper in its PDF version upon
publication.
7. It is the journal's policy to require assignment of copyright from all
authors.
