Call for papers: SKY Journal of Linguistics

SKY Journal of Linguistics, the annual publication of the Linguistic Association
of Finland (= SKY), is looking for contributors. SKY JoL welcomes unpublished
original works from authors of all nationalities and theoretical persuasions.
Every manuscript is reviewed by at least two anonymous referees. In addition to
papers on any linguistic topic, SKY JoL publishes short squibs (3-5 pages)
and book reviews. The languages of publication are English, French and German.
SKY JoL appears both in print and as a free-access web journal.  

If you would like to review a book for SKY JoL, contact one of the editors, who
will then request a review copy from the publisher.

The deadline for initial submissions is the end of May each year. Provided that
a manuscript is accepted for publication without major revisions, it will in
the normal course of events appear in January the next year. In case you have
difficulty meeting the deadline, please contact the editors.
