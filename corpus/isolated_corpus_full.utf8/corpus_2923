Subject: Call: Primary Sources on Khoesan Languages

Inspired by the work of the late linguist Tony Traill on preserving
recordings of extinct South African languages, a volume of primary sources
from existing Khoesan languages is being planned.  The editors are seeking
contributions in the form of texts, recordings, or video content in Khoesan
languages, including any of the following:  |Xam, !Xóõ, =Hoan, Griqua,
|Gui, ||Gana, N|uu (including the |'Auni dialect), Kwadi, Richtersveld
Nama, =Ungkwe, ||Xegwi and !Ora.  For any content submitted, please submit
a transcription (if a recording), and English translation, if available. 
We intend to include a comprehensive phonetic reference chart as a guide
for all the covered languages, as well as an accompanying DVD in the final
publication if there is substantial multimedia content submitted.

The intended date of publication is June of 2009, to be edited by Kems
Monaka and Charles Riley, and published by Athinkra.  Please note that this
anthology will be focused on putting primary sources into print that have
not previously been published, i.e. actual texts, recordings, etc.,
collected from fieldwork rather than commentary and secondary
interpretation, aside from reference notes.  Multimedia submissions (Video,
DVD, audio) are encouraged for submission and will be considered.

Please mail submissions to kemmonye[at]gmail[dot]com.  Text in a
Unicode-compliant font is preferred.  If you have any IPA characters not
representable in Unicode, please embed the font(s) used in your document
and consult us before sending your file.  Audio may be submitted in .aiff,
.wav, .mp3, or .ogg format; and video preferably as .mpeg, .ogv or .wmv. 
If conversion from analog is needed, please consult us for details.

Submission deadline:  June 30, 2008

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:
http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
