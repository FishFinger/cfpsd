   The event follows the series of the RCRA (Knowledge Representation
   and Automated Reasoning) annual meetings, held since 1994.
   The success of the previous events shows that RCRA is becoming a major
   forum for exchanging ideas and proposing experimentation methodologies
   for algorithms in artificial intelligence.

As in previous editions,  authors of papers presented at the event
will have the opportunity to participate to the selection of a

DATES

VENUE
  Reggio Emilia, Italy

AIMS AND SCOPE
   Many problems in Artificial Intelligence show an exponential 
explosion of the
   search space.  Although stemming from different research areas in AI, 
such
   problems are often addressed with algorithms that have a common goal: the
   effective exploration of huge state spaces.  Many algorithms 
developed in one
   research area are applicable to other problems, or can be hybridised with
   techniques in other areas. Artificial Intelligence tools often exploit or
   hybridise techniques developed by other research communities, such as
   Operations Research.
   In recent years, research in AI has more and more focussed on 
experimental
   evaluation of algorithms, the development of suitable methodologies for
   experimentation and analysis, the study of languages and the 
implementation of
   systems for the definition and solution of problems.

   Scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilisation of ideas 
stemming
   from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new challenging problems,
   comparing models and algorithms from an experimental viewpoint, and, in
   general, comparing different approaches with respect to efficiency, 
problem
   modelling, and ease of development.

   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
   * Experimental evaluation of algorithms for
        o knowledge representation
        o automated reasoning
        o planning
        o scheduling
        o machine learning
        o model checking
        o boolean satisfiability (SAT)
        o constraint programming
        o constraint satisfaction
        o quantified boolean formulae and quantified constraints
        o modal logics
        o logic programming
        o disjunctive logic programming
        o temporal reasoning
        o combinatorial optimization
   * Definition and construction of benchmarks
   * Experimentation methodologies
   * Metaheuristics
   * Algorithm hybridisation
   * Static analysis of combinatorial problems
   * Languages and systems for definition and solution of problems
   * Comparisons between systems and algorithms
   * Application experiences

SUBMISSIONS
   Authors are invited to submit either original papers, or papers that 
appear on
   conference proceedings (different than AI*IA 2009).

   Publications showing negative results are welcome, provided that the 
approach
   was original and very promising in principle, the experimentation was
   well-conducted, the results obtained were unforeseeable and gave 
important
   hints in the comprehension of the target problem, helping other 
researchers to
   avoid unsuccessful paths.

   At the time of submission, authors are requested to clearly specify 
whether their
   submission is original or already published.

   Workshop submissions must be in PDF format, do not exceed 15 pages, 
and should be
   written in LaTeX, using the RCRA 2009 style available on the workshop 
web site.
   Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the
   program committee.
   Papers accepted at the workshop will be electronically published on the
   workshop web site and as an issue of the CEUR Workshop Proceedings 
series.
   Submissions should be sent to the address: rcra.aixia.09@gmail.com


SELECTION FOR THE POST-PROCEEDINGS
   Few weeks after the workshop, authors of papers presented at the
   RCRA workshop will have the opportunity to participate to the selection
   for the post-proceedings by submitting an extended version of their work.

   Workshop post-proceedings will appear in a special issue of the
   Elsevier Journal of Algorithms in Cognition, Informatics and Logic, 
provided
   that a sufficient amount of high quality papers is collected.

   All candidate articles must be original: they cannot have already 
been published
   in journals, and must contain significant additional material with 
respect to any
   previous version already published in formal conference proceedings
   (including the proceedings of AI*IA 2009).

   Such papers will go through a second formal selection process, and 
will be
   reviewed by at least three reviewers. The selection process will be 
kept very
   short, and at most one re-submission stage will be allowed (cf. important
   dates). Hence, authors are invited to work on their paper mainly 
before the
   workshop date.
