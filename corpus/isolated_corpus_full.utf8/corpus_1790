General AA(A)CL Information

Previous conferences of the American Association for (Applied) Corpus
Linguistics have been held at different universities in the United States since
1998, including Northern Arizona University (2006, 2000), the University of
Michigan (2005, 1999), Montclair State (2004), IUPUI (2002), and Univ.
Massachusetts-Boston (2001).


Submission of Abstracts and Proposals

Faculty, graduate students, and independent scholars are invited to submit
abstracts for 20-minute papers on any aspect of corpus linguistics. Papers are
welcome from a range of subfields, including corpus creation, corpus annotation,
linguistic analyses of corpora, register/genre variation, lexicography, parallel
corpora, tagging and parsing, software development, and the use of corpora in
language learning and teaching.

Abstracts are due Sep 28, 2007. Abstracts for 20-minute papers should be no
longer than 350 words. Abstracts and proposals should be submitted as e-mail
attachments in MS Word format to <aacl2008@byu.edu>.

Abstracts will undergo anonymous review. Please provide author name and contact
info and the paper title in the body of the email to which the abstract is
attached, and omit author information from the abstract itself. Please send
abstracts as PDF files as well as MS Word files if they contain any specialized
fonts.

Meeting Description

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, knowledge
bases and ontologies, grammars, etc. support the development of language
processing applications that are increasingly important to the global society.
Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such resources for the
world's major languages over the past decades, and new projects are developing
similar resources for less widely-used languages. Some standards and best
practices have emerged for representing and linking language corpora and
annotations, efforts such as 'Global WordNet' and the development of framenets
in multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical and semantic
resources across languages, and there are efforts to integrate such resources
into general ontologies such as SUMO. As the need for cross-lingual studies and
applications grows, it is increasingly important to develop resources in the
world's languages that can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with common
software, and that contain linguistic information for the same or comparable
phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a 'global web' of language
resources, wherein, for example, linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple
languages are inter-linked via the use of common categories, or categories that
are mapped to one another; resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked
not only to versions in different languages, but also to each other; and common
representations enable analysis and use of resources in different languages and
of different types within available systems. 

Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following topics:
1. multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus on the
mechanisms enabling interoperability;
2. support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in systems/frameworks for
resource creation, annotation, use, and access;
3. existing and proposed standards for language resources, including standards
for linguistic annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
4. systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the development and
exploitation of interoperable language resources;
5. evaluation of existing resources, systems, and/or standards in terms of
support for interoperability;
6. harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language resources, including
corpora, wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;
7. web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-linkage, and access;
8. ontologies for language resources, especially for support of
multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and multi-modality.
