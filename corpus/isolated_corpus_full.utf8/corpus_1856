Conference on Language, Communication and Cognition
University of Brighton, August 4th-7th 2008, Brighton, UK

The conference on Language, Communication and Cognition aims to promote an
interdisciplinary, comparative, multi-methodological approach to the study of
language, communication and cognition, informed by method and practice as
developed in Cognitive Linguistics. The objective is to contribute to our

and multi-disciplinary methodologies, based upon cross-linguistic,
cross-cultural, and cross-population comparisons.

The conference will address the following themes: 
-Language, creativity and imagination
-Language in use
-Meaning and grammar
-Communication, conceptualisation and gesture
-Language and its influence on thought
-Language acquisition and conceptual development
-Origins and evolution of language and mind
