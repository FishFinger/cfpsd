Fourteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference

July 13-16, 2009

Trinity College, Cambridge, United Kingdom

Call for Participation

The 14th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be held at Trinity College, Cambridge, from July 13th to 16th, 2009.

Registration is now open at http://www.lfg09.net.

Please note that early registration will close on Thursday, June 25, 2009.

LFG 2009 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical-Functional Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the 'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel, constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and collaboration among researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple levels of structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the following sites:
http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/
http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/lfg/

Invited Speaker

Farrell Ackerman (UCSD) - Affix Ordering and the Morphosyntax of Object Marking in Moro

Public Lecture

Ron Kaplan (Stanford University & Powerset/Microsoft) - Deep Natural Language Processing for Web-scale Search

Workshop

Workshop and public debate on Dynamic Syntax and Lexical-Functional Grammar, with keynote contributions by the original developers of both formalisms:
