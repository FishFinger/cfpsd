Full Title: International Journal of Mind, Brain and Cognition 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2009 

Manuscripts are invited for the first issue of IJMBC to be published in 2009 in
various areas of cognitive science and allied disciplines. The journal is an
international peer reviewed journal and initially will have two issues per year.
Articles will include all major areas of cognitive science i.e. Cognitive
Science, Cognitive psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Neuropsychology,
Artificial Intelligence, Computer science, Philosophy and Anthropology etc. as
far as they are concerned with theoretical or experimental explorations on all
aspects of mind-brain-cognition. The journal will accept both empirical as well
as theoretical papers on any aspect of human or machine cognition and will be
open to new ideas. 

International Journal of Mind, Brain, and Cognitive Science is a biyearly
journal for the multidisciplinary study of minds and other intelligent systems.
It publishes articles on cognition from perspectives in artificial intelligence,
education, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology.
Editorial decisions are made on the basis of content, rather than discipline or
author, and papers in all areas of cognitive science are welcome. Research
reports, which are specifically written for a multidisciplinary audience, are
given the highest priority. Merely confirmatory research will be given less
importance. The journal is edited by Prof. Probal Dasgupta and has an
international panel of associated editors.

Types of articles
The following kinds of articles are appropriate for the journal: (a) theories or
theoretical analyses of cognitive processes and brain theory; (b) experimental
studies relevant to theoretical issues in cognitive science; (c) computational
models of neural and cognitive processes and (d) discussions of new problem
areas or methodological issues in cognitive science. The journal will publish
four categories of articles. Regular articles have a word limit of 10000 words.
Brief reports have a target length of about 4,000 words. Letters to the editor
will typically consist of approximately 1,000 words, and will be commentaries on
articles, responses to commentaries, and discussion items of general relevance
to the cognitive science community. Book reviews will typically be around 1000
words.
