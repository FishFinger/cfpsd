2nd Call for Papers

EACL 2009 Workshop on COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF COMPUTATIONAL LANGUAGE 
ACQUISITION

30 or 31 March 2009
Athens, Greece

http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cognitive/

-----------------------------------------------

Workshop Description
====================

This workshop is focused on the relevance of computational learning
methods for research on human language acquisition. Developing and
applying such computational techniques that can improve our
understanding of human language acquisition will not only benefit
cognitive sciences in general, but will also reflect back to NLP and
place us in a better position to develop useful language models.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from the diverse
fields of NLP, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
(psycho)linguistics, etc.  who are interested in the relevance of
computational techniques for understanding human language learning.

The workshop is intended to bridge the gap between the computational
and cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource sharing, and
help initiate interdisciplinary research projects. Success in this
type of research requires close collaboration between NLP and
cognitive scientists.  To this end, interdisciplinary workshops can
play a key role in advancing existing and initiating new
research. This was demonstrated by some successful events like the
previous edition of this workshop held at ACL 2007.


Areas of interest
=================

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning

- Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language
  acquisition

- Computational models of various aspects of language acquisition, and
  their interaction with each other

- Computational models of the evolution of language

- Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of
  human language acquisition

- Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment
  and its impact on the acquisition task

- Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information
  (related to e.g. speech, morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and
  discourse) and their relevance to research on human language
  acquisition

- Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and
  weakly-supervised methods for learning (e.g. machine learning,
  statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning,
  various hybrid models) from the cognitive aspect

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

Submission Information
======================

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of
completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with
previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions
will be judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of
presentation, usability, and significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the EACL 2009
main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages,
including references. We strongly recommend the use of either the
LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be found
at http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include
the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and
other references that could reveal the author's identity should be
avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than December
19, 2008 using the submission webpage that will be available soon.

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines
regarding how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers for
inclusion in the EACL workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.
