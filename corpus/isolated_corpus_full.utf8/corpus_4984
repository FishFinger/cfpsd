Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 10-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

NLP (Natural Language Processing) and CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning)
are two highly productive fields. Although both fields are concerned with the
study of language, the links between them are still relatively tenuous. Systems
such as ELEONORE, ALEXIA, FREETEXT or platforms such as EXILLS and MIRTO
integrate NLP methods and tools, but they tend to be the exception rather than
the rule and concern non-commercialised products. 

2nd Call for Papers

The session that we organise within the framework of WMSCI 2009 will enable
researchers from NLP and CALL to present their research on the use of NLP in
language learning, to encourage exchanges and collaborations, establish a common
area of study, draw a map of the projects in the fields and open up new research
avenues.

Topics
The conference welcomes proposals exploring all aspects (theoretical,
conceptual, applied) of the use of NLP in CALL. The list of topics below
includes a few examples of the aspects that may be tackled:
- Applications of (written or spoken) language processing in CALL
- Methodological issues relating to the design of NLP-based CALL systems
- Demonstration of NLP-based CALL tools
- Design and use of corpora for language learning
- Use of learner corpora; error annotation of learner corpora
- Diagnosis, feedback and remedial work
- Design and creation of tasks
- Linguistic resources for language learning
- Linguistic theory/formal linguistics and CALL

Submission Guidelines
- Format. Authors are invited to submit extended abstract (1000 to 2000 words)
on original, unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should
not exceeding 4 pages, including references, and be formatted according to the
WMSCI 2009 stylefile available at:
www.iiis2009.org/wmsci/Contents/AK-WMSCI-2009P.pdf
- Paper submission is to be made in doc format to mourad.marse.u-grenoble3.fr
- Each paper will be reviewed at least by two members of the Program Committee.

Registration
By submitting a paper at this session the authors agree that, in case the paper
is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors will attend the
conference and pay the WMSCI-2009 registration fee.

Publication
Accepted papers of registered authors will be published in the printed copy and
the CD versions of the proceedings. The proceedings will also be published via
web for Full Open Access. High quality papers might be selected for
multiple-authors book publications.

Awards will be granted to the best paper of those presented at this session. The
best 10%-20% of the papers presented at the conference will be invited to adapt
their papers for their publication in Volume 7 of JSCI Journal
(http://www.j-sci.com/Journal/SCI/). Libraries of journal author's organizations
will receive complimentary subscriptions of at least one volume (6 issues).

Important Dates
Submission deadline: May10th, 2009
Notification to authors: May 27th, 2009
Camera-ready papers: Jun 7th, 2009
Conference date: July 10th - 13th, 2009

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
