                  FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     CONTEXT'07

The Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on
             Modeling and Using Context

                 August 20-24, 2007
            Roskilde University, Denmark

               Submissions deadlines:
         Full papers:                        March 15, 2007

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and
Using Context (CONTEXT'07) will provide a forum for presenting and
discussing high-quality research and applications on context. The
conference will include paper and poster presentations, system
demonstrations, workshops, and a doctoral consortium. The conference
invites researchers and practitioners to share insights and cutting-edge
results from a wide range of disciplines including:

     Computer Science, especially
          Artificial Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing

     Cognitive Science           Linguistics

     Organizational Sciences     Philosophy

     Psychology        =20

     Application areas such as Medicine and Law

Context affects a wide range of activities in humans and animals as well
as in artificial agents and other systems. The importance of context is
widely acknowledged, and "context" has become an area of study in its
own right, as evidenced by numerous workshops, symposia, seminars, and
conferences on this area. CONTEXT, the oldest conference series focusing
on context, is unique in its emphasis on interdisciplinary research.
Previous CONTEXT conferences have been held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
(CONTEXT'97), Trento, Italy (CONTEXT'99, LNCS 1688), Dundee, Scotland
(CONTEXT'01, LNCS 2116), Palo Alto, U.S.A. (CONTEXT'03, LNCS 2680), and
Paris, France (CONTEXT'05, LNCS 3554).
Each of these brought together researchers and practitioners from many
disparate fields to discuss and report on context-related research and
projects.

CONFERENCE EVENTS
-----------------

CONTEXT'07 will include paper presentation sessions, a poster and
demonstration session, two days of workshops, and a doctoral
consortium. Workshops and the doctoral consortium will circulate separate
calls for papers and participation, which will also be available at the
conference web site.


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND SUBMISSION CATEGORIES
---------------------------------------------

Because CONTEXT'07 will be an interdisciplinary forum, all submissions wi=
ll
be evaluated both for their technical merit and for their accessibility t=
o
an interdisciplinary audience. Works that transcend disciplinary boundari=
es
are especially encouraged.

Submissions may be for full papers, poster abstracts, or demonstration
abstracts. Full papers will be accepted either for oral presentation or f=
or
presentation at a poster session. All accepted full paper submissions wil=
l
be published in the proceedings. Accepted posters and demonstrations will=
 be
presented at the poster session, and the associated abstracts will be
published in a brochure distributed to attendees. For additional details
see the conference web site.

For a paper to appear in the proceedings, at least one author must regist=
er
for the conference by the deadline for camera-ready copy.


SUBMISSION PROCEDURES
---------------------

Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files. Submissions cannot
exceed 14 pages in the Springer LNAI format. Detailed formatting and
submissions instructions, as well as LaTeX and Word templates, will be
available in the author instructions section of the conference Web
site.

All accepted authors will have the option of presenting a system
demonstration at the poster session. Authors wishing to present a
demonstration without an accompanying paper must submit a demonstration
abstract. Demonstration abstracts should describe cutting-edge systems no=
t
described in paper submissions. Demonstration abstracts should summarize
the system's behavior and significance, and should include at least one
screen shot. If desired, they may also include the URL of an informal vid=
eo
on the web. Demonstration abstracts should be at most 2 pages long.


MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS POLICY
---------------------------

CONTEXT'07 will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is
under review for or has already been published or accepted for publicatio=
n
in a journal or another conference. This restriction does not apply to
submissions for workshops and other venues with a limited audience.
