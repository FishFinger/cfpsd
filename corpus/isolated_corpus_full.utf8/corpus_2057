Linguistic Field(s): Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description

Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT) is the major North-American conference on
formal semantics as a subfield of linguistics. 

We invite submissions of abstracts for 30-minute presentations (plus 10-minute
discussions) on any topic pertaining to natural language semantics with
relevance to linguistic theory. Abstracts must be anonymous and should be at
most 2 pages (A4 or US Letter) in length, including examples and references,
using a 12pt font with 1-inch (2.5 cm) margins on all four sides. These
limitations will be strictly enforced.

SALT 18 will feature a poster session. We ask that you indicate in your
submission email whether you would like your abstract to be considered for
poster presentation. Poster presentations will be published as regular papers in
the proceedings.

Policies

Authors may be involved in at most two submissions and may be the sole author of
at most one abstract. No single author will be allowed to give more than one
presentation at the conference.

SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been
published or have been accepted for publication. In addition, preference will be
given to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We
therefore request that authors indicate prior or planned presentations of their
papers along with their contact information when they submit their abstracts.
