Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
The purpose of the Fifth International Symposium on the Acquisition of Second
Language Speech is to continue the tradition of the New Sounds symposiums
organized by Allan James and Jonathan Leather at the Universities of Amsterdam
and Klagenfurt in 1990, 1992, 1997, and 2000. 

We invite abstract submissions for twenty-minute talks or poster presentations
reporting research on (1) the perception and/or production of second/foreign
language sounds or (2) research on the effect of second/foreign language
pronunciation teaching/training. The target L2 can, of course, be any language.
Following the tradition of the New Sounds conferences, the talks and posters
will be preferentially in English, but in order to allow greater participation
of researchers within Brazil, Portuguese will also be accepted.

Abstracts should be submitted by e-mail in two files as follows:
(1) Complete abstract: with title but without author's name(s), text of 200 to
300 words long in font Arial 12, 1.5 spaces between lines. File name: first
author's last name in caps - hyphen - first context word of the title
capitalizing only the first letter - hyphen - COMP.
(2) Short abstract for the symposium program: with title, author's name(s) and
affiliation(s) at the top, text of up to 50 words in Arial 10 and single-spaced.
File name: first author's last name in caps - hyphen - first context word of the
title capitalizing only the first letter - hyphen - SHORT.

Examples of file names:
(1) FLEGE-Perceiving-COMP
(2) FLEGE-Perceiving-SHORT

Files can be .doc, .txt or .pdf. The two files should be sent to
newsounds@cce.ufsc.br.

Subject: Empirical Approaches to Morphological Case 

	

Full Title: Empirical Approaches to Morphological Case 

Date: 25-Jul-2007 - 25-Jul-2007
Location: Stanford, CA, USA 
Contact Person: Cathryn Donohue
Meeting Email: donohue@unr.edu
Web Site: http://www.unr.edu/homepage/donohue/case 

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 18-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
The aim of this workshop is to establish greater awareness of the benefit of
different empirical approaches to the study of morphological case, the insights
that such studies provide, and how they inform theoretical models. The workshop
is part of the LSA Summer Institute, Stanford, CA. 

Second Call for Papers

In recent years, new and varied approaches to the empirical study of
morphological case have significantly increased our understanding of this
empirical phenomenon. These approaches have informed more refined theoretical
models which necessarily address interface questions, especially the interface
of morphological case with semantics. Such studies may rely on corpora,
experimental evidence, and the investigation of (synchronic and diachronic)
variation and how it bears on synchronic analyses.

Possible research questions may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
- expanding our understanding of case phenomena through novel empirical methods 
- investigating how morphological case interfaces with other aspects of the grammar 
- hypothesizing on how this interface should be modelled theoretically 

Invited presentations will be given by: 
- Andrew Spencer (Essex)
- Miriam Butt (Konstanz)
- Joan Maling (Brandeis) and Jong Sup Jun (Hankuk)

Abstract guidelines: 
We are soliciting abstracts for 25 minute talks relevant to any of the topics
mentioned above. Abstracts should be in 11pt font, or larger, consisting of one
text page with a second page (only) for data, examples, charts, and references.
(Anonymous) abstracts should be submitted electronically in Word (.doc) or Adobe
Acrobat (.pdf) format to: case07@gmail.com. 
The author(s) of the abstract should not be identified in the abstract itself;
the body of the submission message should include the title of the abstract, the
names(s) of the author(s), the(ir) affiliation, and e-mail address(es).

Deadline for submission: 
March 18th, 2007. The conference program will be announced in early April.

Outlines:
As there will be special sessions for discussion of the papers, we will ask that
you provide us with an outline of your paper in advance of the workshop, no
later than July 7th.

Important dates: 
March 18 - Abstracts due (send to: case07@gmail.com) 
April 1 - Notification of acceptance 
July 7 - Outline of papers due (send to: case07@gmail.com)
July 25 - Workshop 

Publication: 
We plan to collect as many papers from the workshop as possible for publication
with a major publisher on the theme of new empirical approaches to morphological
case.

More information about the workshop, including the final program, will be posted
on the website in due course: http://www.unr.edu/homepage/donohue/case

For any questions about the workshop, please email your queries to either of the
organizers:
Cathryn Donohue (donohue@unr.edu) or Jóhanna Barðdal (johanna.barddal@uib.no).
