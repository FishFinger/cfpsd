Meeting Description

Cycles of language change have not been studied in generative linguistics and
only sporadically in other frameworks. This workshop is an attempt to bring
together linguists who do work on these cycles and discuss their current
research. It also aims to come up with (a) description of linguistic cycles (in
as many languages as possible) in terms of structural principles, and (b)
explanations of the internal changes, e.g. by applying insights from language
acquisition to this debate. 

Linguistic Cycles Workshop
Arizona State University 
25-26 April 2008

Call for Papers

Background
Grammaticalization was identified early on in linguistics, as well as the fact
that this kind of linguistic change leads to loss and renewal. Works such as
Lehmann (1982) and Heine & Traugott (1991) inspired many linguists to pay closer
attention to this phenomenon again, especially in a functionalist framework.
Recently, however, structural accounts have started to appear (e.g. Roberts &
Roussou 2003; van Gelderen 2004) accounting for the cyclicity of the changes
involved. Van Gelderen, for instance, uses Economy Principles that help the
learner acquire a grammar that is more economical, and as a side-effect more
grammaticalized. Grammaticalization is a descriptive term and it is more
appropriate to use reanalysis to emphasize the role of the child acquiring the
language. A child listens to a particular language and will analyze the
linguistic input in the most economic way. This may result in an internal
grammar different from that of an earlier generation. In such a view,
grammaticalization and cyclical change is seen as following from Universal
Principles and the task of the linguist is to unearth these principles.
Cycles have been discussed by Hodge (1970) and Tauli (1956). Some well-known
cycles involve Negatives, where an initial single negative such as not gets to
be reinforced by nothing or replaced by never, and subjects, where full pronouns
are reanalyzed as endings on the verb. Clauses, aspect markers, articles, and
copula verbs also undergo cycles of internal change followed by external change.
In these cycles, both internal and external mechanisms are involved: internal
because, for example, all languages have negatives that `weaken', but also
external since the renewal may be determined by social factors.
Cycles of language change have not been studied in generative linguistics and
only sporadically in other frameworks. This workshop is an attempt to bring
together linguists who do work on these cycles and discuss their current
research. It also aims to come up with (a) description of linguistic cycles (in
as many languages as possible) in terms of structural principles, and (b)
explanations of the internal changes, e.g. by applying insights from language
acquisition to this debate.

Full Title: 2008 SLA Graduate Student Symposium 

Date: 11-Apr-2008 - 12-Apr-2008
Location: Madison, WI, USA 
Contact Person: Barbara Bird
Meeting Email: slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2007 

Meeting Description

2008 SLA Graduate Student Symposium
'Evolving Perspectives in SLA'
Friday, April 11, 2008 & Saturday, April 12, 2008
Lowell Hall, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison)
Co-sponsored by the University of Iowa (U of I) 

Call for Papers 

The field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is evolving to include a variety
of both cognitively- and socially-based perspectives. As is stated in the
Introduction to the December 2007 Focus Issue of The Modern Language Journal (in
press), ''some basic premises within these two traditions may be different, but
they both ask interesting and crucial questions, the answers to which can lead
to a deeper appreciation of the complex forces are work in [second language] L2
learning'' (Lafford, B. (in press). Second language acquisition
reconceptualized?: The impact of Firth and Wagner (1997). Modern Language
Journal, 91.). 

We seek proposals from graduate student research, both theoretical and
empirical, that reflect the differing perspectives and methods currently used in
SLA research. The research may be interdisciplinary in nature. 

Invited Speakers from the Sponsoring Institutions 
Sally Sieloff Magnan (UW-Madison):
http://frit.lss.wisc.edu/frit/faculty/magnan.html 
Roumyana Slabakova (U of I): http://www.uiowa.edu/~linguist/faculty/slabakova/ 

Invited Panel Discussion Moderator 
Barbara Lafford (Arizona State University): http://www.public.asu.edu/~blafford/ 

The six-member panel of professors and graduate students from the U of I and the
UW-Madison will be led by Barbara Lafford, Guest Editor of the Focus Issue of
The Modern Language Journal (MLJ, 91, 5, 2007), which revisits the Firth &
Wagner debate (MLJ, 81, 3, 1997). The panel will address questions such as the
following: 
Can cognitively- and socially-oriented perspectives have something to offer each
other? 
What is the future of SLA research, and how may a ''global multilingual
reality'' impact it? 
Is SLA still part of Applied Linguistics? 
What does this debate, if anything, add to the field of SLA? 

Submission Guidelines: 
We invite proposals for papers and posters from graduate students at any level
of graduate study. Paper presentations will be 30 minutes with a 10-minute
discussion period following. Poster presentations will be displayed at a 1-hour
session during which poster authors will stand by their posters to discuss their
work. 

Please submit abstracts by November 30, 2007 to:
slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu 
Notification of acceptance by December 21, 2007 

Please adhere to the following format. 

I. In the body of the email message, please fill all of the following fields in
the given order: 
1. Title of presentation (maximum 10 words) 
2. Presenter's name (family, given) 
3. Department & affiliation 
4. Mailing address (including city, state, zip code) 
5. Phone/Fax 
6. Preferred email address for correspondence

II. Also in the body of the email message, please copy one of the following
options: 
1. I wish my abstract to be considered for presentation at the 2008 SLA Graduate
Student Symposium, but if not selected for presentation, I would like it to be
considered for presentation as a poster. 
2. I wish my abstract to be considered only as a poster presentation at the 2008
SLA Graduate Student Symposium. 

III. As an attachment, please include an abstract. The attachment must be a
Microsoft Word document and must not exceed 300 words. Please place the title as
the first line of the document. Author and institution names should be blinded
for review. 

Evaluation of Proposals: 
I. Choice and clarity of topic, perspective, and/or method 
II. Quality of research (literature, methods, and conclusions) 
III. Contribution to field, originality 
IV. Relevance to current issues in SLA 

Please contact slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu with questions. A website
will be forthcoming.
