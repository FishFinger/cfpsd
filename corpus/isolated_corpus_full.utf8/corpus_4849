Call for Papers

The 2009 Faculty of Arts Annual Conference aims to stimulate a debate on the
theme 'The Humanities and the Challenges of Nation-Building'. It is common for
social and political analysts to refer to the modern nation as a social,
economic, political and geographical construct invented by and/or imposed on a
people, as has been the experience of most contemporary African nations. The
very concept of nationhood is therefore always a negotiated idea and/or ideal,
often between unequal partners, given the fact that belonging to the same nation
may not necessarily imply that the constituents share a common origin, culture
or civilization.  Managing conflicts which may arise from such diversity and
making a nation a viable entity entail creating enduring social institutions and
targeting sustainable human capital and natural resource development.  

Today, as basic traditional concepts of nationhood, identity and development
become increasingly complex, and virtual ethnic and national boundaries continue
to challenge their physical counterparts, while diasporal nationhood represents
a critical factor in the race for the attainment of the Millennium Development
Goals, some questions naturally arise.  These include: How ought we to conceive
the notion of nation-building? What exactly is involved in nation-building? What
ought to be the focus of nation-building? What ought to be the theoretical and
practical tools for nation-building? Who are the nation-builders? Answers to
these and other questions are expected to be provided by the conference. The
faculty is convening, especially as they relate to the humanities, and the
sub-themes include, but are not limited to, the following: 
- Indigenous Languages, Orature and Nation-Building
- Foreign Languages, Diplomacy and National Security
- The Performing Arts, Visual Arts and Nation-Building
- Traditional Medicine and National Development
- Identity, Cultural Rejuvenation and National Reformation
- Gender and National Development
- Philosophy, Law and Nation-Building
- Religion, Morality and National Development
- Education and Nation-Building
- Economy and Nation-Building
- Political Ethics in National Development

Interested persons are to send abstracts of not more than 250 words
electronically by 30 April, 2009, while full papers are expected by 20 May,
2009. Each abstract or paper should include the name(s) of the author(s), their
contact address, e-mail and phone number, and should be sent to any of the
following, who can also be contacted for further information:
- Dr. J.A. Afolabi (Email: bayoafolabis@yahoo.com or aafolabi@oauife.edu.ng,
Phone: +234-8052622030)
- Dr. O.M.A. Daramola (E-mail:  yomolu77@oauife.edu.ng or yomusik77@yahoo.com,
Phone: +234-8035787164)
- Professor Y.K. Yusuf (E-mail: yyusuf@oauife.edu.ng, Phone: +234-8034028057)

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
