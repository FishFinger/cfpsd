FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

GENERATION OF REFERENCES IN CONTEXT (GREC) TASKS 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

Part of Generation Challenges 2009, in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

Generation Challenges 2009 is being organised to provide a common forum for=
 a number of different NLG Shared Tasks (see http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk=
/research/genchal09/).

As part of Generation Challenges 2009, we are organising two GREC Shared Ta=
sk Competitions.  The first is the GREC-MSR (Main Subject
References) Task which uses the GREC-2.0 Corpus of 2,000 Wikipedia introduc=
tion sections where references to the main subject of the Wikipedia article=
 have been annotated, and the task is to develop a system that can select (=
from a given list) an MSR that is appropriate in the context.  The second i=
s the GREC-NEG (Named Entity Generation) Task which uses the new GREC-Peopl=
e Corpus of 1,000 Wikipedia introduction sections about people in which sin=
gle and plural references to all people mentioned in the text have been ann=
otated. The task in GREC-NEG is to select appropriate referential expressio=
ns for all mentions (singular and plural) of people.

Submissions to both tasks will be evaluated using a range of intrinsic and =
extrinsic measures, some assessed automatically, some manually.
Submitted systems and evaluation results will be presented in a special ses=
sion at ENLG'09, and published in the ENLG'09 proceedings.


1. Background
--------------

There has been increasing interest recently among text summarisation resear=
chers in postprocessing techniques to improve the referential clarity and c=
oherence of extractive summaries, and among language generation researchers=
 in generating referential expressions in context.  The GREC tasks are aime=
d at researchers in both of these groups, and the objective is the developm=
ent of methods for generating chains of referential expressions for discour=
se entities in the context of a written discourse, as is useful for postpro=
cessing extractive summaries and repeatedly edited texts (such as Wikipedia=
 articles).


2. Data
--------

The GREC data resources consist of introduction sections collected from Wik=
ipedia articles in which three broad syntactic categories of overt referenc=
e to named entities have been annotated: subject NPs, object NPs and geniti=
ve subject-determiners (such as "Faraday's" in "Faraday's law of induction"=
). The annotations include features encoding basic syntactic and semantic i=
nformation.

The GREC-2.0 corpus consists of 2,000 texts in five different domains (citi=
es, countries, rivers, people and mountains).  In this corpus, only referen=
ces to the single entity that is the main subject of a Wikipedia article (e=
.g. "Michael Faraday") have been annotated.

The new GREC-People corpus consists of 1,000 texts in just one domain, peop=
le. Here, all references to all people mentioned in a text have been annota=
ted.  GREC-People therefore includes explicit coreference annotation for on=
e or more coreference chains (whereas in GREC-2.0 texts there is always jus=
t one annotated coreference chain).

For GREC-2.0 and GREC-People we have test sets of 200 and 100 texts, respec=
tively, where referential expressions have been selected by participants in=
 an elicitation experiment. In these test sets, there are three versions fo=
r each corpus text, in each of which the referential expressions have been =
manually selected by a single participant in the experiment.


3. The GREC'09 Tasks
--------------------

The GREC-MSR Task has the same task definition as the GREC shared task at R=
EG'08.  Participating systems need to select the referential expression (RE=
) from a given set of alternatives that is most appropriate in the given co=
ntext, which may involve e.g. ensuring that pronouns can be resolved.  Syst=
ems will be evaluated both against the REs in the corpus and against human-=
selected topline solutions for this task.  Results and descriptions of part=
icipating systems from the
REG'08 run of this task can be found here:
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W08/#1100

The new GREC-NEG Task is an extension of GREC-MSR in that it requires parti=
cipating systems to select appropriate referential expressions for all disc=
ourse entities of the same type (people in this round) as the main subject =
of the article.


4. Evaluation
-------------

For both tasks, the data will be randomly divided into training, developmen=
t and test data.  Participants will compute evaluation scores on the develo=
pment set (using code provided by the organisers), and the organisers will =
perform evaluations on the test data set.

We will use a range of different evaluation methods, including intrinsic an=
d extrinsic, automatically assessed and human-evaluated.
The intrinsic methods will include string-accuracy, feature-accuracy and st=
ring-similarity measures, as well as human-produced quality assessments.  T=
he extrinsic methods will include a reading/comprehension experiment and me=
asuring coreference resolver success (for details about the previous editio=
n, see http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W08/W08-1127.pdf).

Full details of the evaluation methods for GREC'09 will be given in the Par=
ticipants' Pack that will be distributed to registered participants.


6. Participation
----------------

Registration is now open at the GREC'09 homepage (http://www.nltg.brighton.=
ac.uk/research/genchal09/grec).  Once registered, participants in the GREC-=
MSR Task will receive the complete training and development set, evaluation=
 software and detailed documentation (collectively known as the Participant=
s' Pack) for this task.  Participants in GREC-NEG will first receive a samp=
le of the training and development data, to enable them to start building s=
ystems; they will receive the complete Participants' Pack for GREC-NEG by t=
he end of September 2008.


7. Proceedings and Presentations
--------------------------------

The Generation Challenges 2009 meeting will be held as a special session at=
 ENLG 2009. The session will include overviews of all the shared tasks, inc=
luding the GREC'09 Tasks. The participating systems will additionally be pr=
esented as papers in the ENLG'09 proceedings, and as posters during the ENL=
G'09 poster session.

GREC'09 papers will not undergo a selection procedure with multiple reviews=
, but the organisers reserve the right to reject material which is not appr=
opriate given the participation guidelines.
