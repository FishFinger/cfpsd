Meeting Description

In conjunction with RANLP 2007 

Third Call for Papers

International Workshop
A Common Natural Language Processing Paradigm for Balkan Languages

In conjunction with RANLP-2007
http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007
September 26, 2007 
Borovets, Bulgaria 

The workshop is partially supported by the European Commission via the project 
BIS-21++, FP6 contract no. INCO-CT-2005-016639

Many things have changed at the Balkans for two years, since the previous
workshop ''Language and Speech Infrastructure for Information Access in the
Balkan Countries'' was held in conjunction with RANLP'05. The languages spoken
in this unique region attract more attention, due to the rapidly developing
field of communication and translation, and the interest to language
technologies for these languages is increasing. New markets appear, together
with newly established collaboration and new opportunities to extend the
application areas of natural language processing.

In the last decade, numerous activities aimed at incorporating the Balkan NLP
research into the widely applied models of other European languages in the form
of joint projects like MulText East, BALRIC-LING, BalkaNet, INTERA and others.
Language resources and grammatical knowledge for different Balkan languages have
been incorporated and processed within the international NLP standards like MTE,
XCES, WordNet, INTERA. As a result of joint bilateral projects, the linguistic
knowledge for some Balkan languages has been processed according to well-known
systems and models - INTEX, GATE, etc.

The unified NLP paradigm for Balkan languages ensures the development of a
common idea for creation of a Balkan multilingual pool for NLP in monolingual or
multilingual - parallel or contrastive - perspective. Not all Balkan languages
are at the same distance from the achievement of that goal. That is why the main
task of this workshop is, along with the overview of present achievements
related to the development of a common NLP paradigm of the Balkan languages, to
suggest a roadmap for the multilingual research and development carried out in
joint activities of the members of the traditional Balkan language union.

Specific topics of interest for the proposed workshop are:

- NLP-driven models of large language data sets, for instance, grammatical
dictionaries, syntactic collections, text categories, ontologies; 

- collection and representation of large lexical resources conforming to
international standards; 

- compilation of large multilingual collections where a given Balkan language is
paired to a wide-spread European language, or another Balkan language; 

- evaluation of the results of using wide-spread NLP tools for the Balkan
languages; 

- investigation/evaluation of the results of mapping the well-known and widely
used NLP-driven models of the different Balkan languages.

Rightward Movement in a Comparative Perspective

The workshop is part of the 29th Annual Meeting of the German Society
for Linguistics (DGfS) at the University of Bamberg, Germany
(27th-29th February, 2008)

Organizers:
Manfred Sailer (University of Goettingen)
Heike Walker (University of Goettingen)
Gert Webelhuth (University of Goettingen)

Goals and background:

Phenomena of Rightward Movement (e.g. Extraposition, Heavy-NP-Shift)
still raise a lot of questions and problems in linguistic theory. The literature
provides competing analyses in which the constituent that
appears in non-canonical position is (1) base-generated and interpreted in situ,
or it undergoes a movement process (2) in the syntactic component or (3) on the
level of PF (Göbbel 2007). These theories make different predictions whether
movement to the right is subject to syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
restrictions at all (see the discussion in Buering and Hartmann 1997) and
differ, partly extremely, with respect to the mechanisms they provide for the
semantic interpretation of the dislocated constituent. Another controversial
discussion concerns the cause of these movements: in addition to purely
syntactic triggers, prosodic and psycholinguistic (e.g. Hawkins 1994) arguments
are proposed (Gesetz der wachsenden Glieder, preferences in production and
parsing, etc.). The goal of the workshop is to collect linguistic and
psycholinguistic studies from different languages in order to cast light on the
following questions.

We invite contributions which address the following questions:

Can all phenomena of rightward movement be described as a uniform
cross-linguistic type of construction that is subject to universal restrictions
and which contrasts systematically with the type of leftward movement? Does each
rightward movement process need a trigger and what are possible triggers? Why
does rightward movement often correlate with the complexity of the moved
constituent and are the criteria for complexity the same across languages? In
which grammatical component does movement take place? Can a prosodic or
psycholinguistic trigger induce movements in the syntactic component? What is
the status of the moved constituent with respect to the semantic integration and
the discourse? Does word order in the sentence influence the possibility and the
characteristics of rightward movement?
