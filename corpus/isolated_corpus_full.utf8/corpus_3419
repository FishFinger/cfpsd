Meeting Description:

Us and Them - Them and Us: Constructions of the Other in Cultural Stereotypes 
- Perceptions, Challenges, Meanings,  May 6-8, 2009, University of Szczecin, Poland 

Call for Papers

We encounter ''them'' every day often unaware of ''their'' constructed nature
which results from our cultural standards and the perception of ourselves.
Preconceptions of the Other are chiefly articulated through stereotypes. For
sociologists stereotypes can initially assist in coming to terms with a complex
world. Then they might serve as a first key to access the previously unknown. In
intercultural communication their value is defined by their potential of either
opening new vistas of other cultures or impeding them. In short stereotypes are
ambivalent and ambiguous and contribute to shaping identities.

At worst auto- and heterostereotypes have left their traces on cultural
relations between European countries or within allegedly homogeneous cultures as
in the United Kingdom. Though ultimately not the cause of wars, stereotypes
helped pave the way to open (World War I and II) and concealed warfare (Cold
War). But even if not taken to the extremes, stereotypes seem to live a life of
their own against all the odds of rational knowledge. 

The conference seeks to examine the constructedness of stereotypes from the
angles of many disciplines and will put its focus on cultural relations between
Europe and anglophone cultures and on patterns of preconception within the
anglophone world. Language, literature and the arts are major construction sites
of stereotypes and cultural identities as are children's and classroom books.
Translation activities may be considered an original border country of cultural
encounters and so are (inter) cultural studies. While media tend by their very
nature to foster stereotypes, recent intercultural teaching strategies in the
foreign English language classroom strive for the opposite.

The English Philology Department of Szczecin University is pleased to announce a
conference on the issues of identity, stereotypes and linguistic rights. Twenty
years after the fall of the Iron Curtain the organizer conclude that the city of
 Szczecin, at the crossroads of important European transit routes and located in
a sensitive cultural border zone, seems to be an ideal site for this conference.
Under the rule of Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Germany and France, the city
has always adjusted well to its inhabitants and their ways of life. Szczecin
therefore is ready to bring together East and West and North and South!
