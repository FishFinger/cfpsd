Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their full paper
   (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by March 4, 2007 (hra@cs.uga.edu). E-mail submissions
   in MS Doc or PDF formats are preferable (postal mail submissions
   are also fine.) All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable
   (later, the authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a
   particular typesetting format to prepare their papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to
   7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously published
   or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The first page of
   the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,
   postal address, email address, and telephone number for each author.
   The first page should also identify the name of the author who will
   be presenting the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical
   keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally,
   the name of the conference/track that the paper is being submitted to
   must be stated on the first page.

   Each paper will be refereed by two experts in the field who are
   independent of the conference program committee.  The referees'
   evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of the program
   committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
   the paper has been submitted to.  The track chair will make the final
   decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one
   member of the program committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy
   of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing; artificial
   intelligence; imaging science; databases; simulation; software
   engineering; embedded systems; internet and web technologies;
   communications; computer security; and bioinformatics.) Many members
   of the program committee for individual conferences include renowned
   leaders, scholars, researchers, scientists and practitioners of the
   highest ranks; many are directors of large research laboratories,
   IEEE Fellows, heads/chairs of departments, deans and provosts.
   Each committee also includes two Student Members (in their final stages
   of their PhD programs) who are identified as such.  Refer to the
   conference web sites for the list of members of program committee.

Co-Sponsors (a partial list):

   Academic Co-Sponsors of WORLDCOMP'07 include:
     - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Laboratory,
       MIT (Cambridge, Massachusetts)

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the tracks of WORLDCOMP are considered to be
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
   fields.  We anticipate to have 2000 or more attendees from over 75
   countries participating in the 2007 event.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
   among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
   inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
   outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
   applications) will be covered during the conferences.

Important Dates:

   March 4, 2007:     Submission of full/draft papers (about 5 to 8 pages)
   April 4, 2007:     Notification of acceptance
   April 27, 2007:    Camera-Ready papers and Registration due
   June 25-28, 2007:  The 2007 World Congress in Computer Science,
                      Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
                      (WORLDCOMP'07)
