Meeting Description

Last Call for Papers and Deadline Extension

The goal of the second workshop on "Computational Approaches to Arabic
Script-based Languages", held in conjunction with the LSA 2007 Linguistic
Institute, is to bring together researchers working on the computer processing
of Arabic script-based languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi and Dari),
Pashto, Urdu and Kurdish. The usage of the Arabic script and the influence of
Arabic vocabulary give rise to certain computational issues that are common to
all these languages despite their being of distinct language families, such as
right to left direction, encoding variation, absence of capitalization, complex
word structure, and a high degree of ambiguity due to non-representation of
short vowels in the writing system. The workshop will provide the participants
with an opportunity to exchange ideas, approaches and implementations of
computational systems, to highlight the common challenges faced by all
practitioners, to assess the state of the art in the field, and to identify
promising areas for future collaborative research in the development of NLP
resources and systems for Arabic script languages. 

Workshop Topics 

Authors of papers in any area of NLP in Arabic script-based languages are
invited to apply. We also accept proposals for demonstrations of computational
systems. Preference would be given to papers that extend their results and
analyses to other Arabic script-based languages. Papers and demos could be on -
but not limited to - any of the following topics: 

- Knowledge bases, corpora, and development of resources 
- Transliteration, transcription and diacritization 
- Morphological analysis 
- Syntactic ambiguity resolution 
- Shallow and deep parsing 
- Machine translation from and to Arabic script languages 
- Sense disambiguation 
- Homograph resolution 
- Semantic analysis 
- Semantic web and inferences 
- Named entity recognition 
- Information retrieval 
- Text mining 
- Summarization 
- Text-to-speech systems 

Submission Requirements 

Papers should be original, previously unpublished work and should not identify
the author(s). They should emphasize completed work rather than intended work.
Papers that are being submitted to other conferences must reflect this fact on
the title page. 

Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages (including figures and references).
Email submissions (ps or pdf) are preferred and should be sent to both
Ali.Farghaly@oracle.com and karine@mitre.org by midnight of the due date.
Submissions should be in English. The papers should be attached to an email
indicating contact information for the author(s) and paper's title. Formatting
requirements for the final version of accepted papers will be posted as soon as
they become available. 

Important Dates Note: Deadline Extended to March 5th

Submissions due: March 5, 2007 
Notification of acceptance: April 16, 2007 
Camera ready submissions: June 15, 2007

Location: Essen, Germany 
Contact Person: Bernd Rüschoff
Meeting Email: bernd.rueschoff@uni-due.de
Web Site: http://www.aila2008.org 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

The conference theme of AILA 2008 is 'Multilingualism: challenges and
opportunities' and detailed information relating to the Call for Papers is
available on the conference website at www.aila2008.org both in English and
in German. 

Second Call for Papers - AILA 2008 - Final Deadline extension

AILA 2008 - the 15th World Congress of Applied Linguistics - is extending
the deadline for its call for papers, symposia and poster presentations to
April 15, 2007. This extension is in response to multiple requests from
colleagues for more time to submit abstracts.

AILA 2008 invites proposals for presentations that are related to policy,
research, and theory in any area of applied linguistics. A detailed list of
the proposed thematic strands is published on the conference website.

However, as we intend to complete the screening procedures by the end of
July 2007, despite the extended deadline we would still like to invite
colleagues to submit their proposals as early as possible. We are planning
to inform successful proposals before the summer break, so that those
colleagues planning to apply for financial assistance to their local
agencies have enough time to prepare their applications. As stated on the
AILA 2008 website (www.aila2008.org) - exact details as to conference fees
and other costs will be posted after the next planning meeting of the AILA
2008 organising committee in mid-March.
