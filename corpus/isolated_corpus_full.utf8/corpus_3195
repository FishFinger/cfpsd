========================= CALL FOR PAPERS =========================

Second International Workshop SMR2 2008 on Service Matchmaking and 
Resource Retrieval in the Semantic Web
             http://www-ags.dfki.uni-sb.de/~klusch/smr2-08/index.html

Co-located with the 7th International Semantic Web Conference ISWC 2008
October 26 or 27, 2008 Karlsruhe, Germany

+ Aims & Scope:
One challenge of service coordination in the semantic Web is concerned 
with how to best connect the ultimate service requester with the 
ultimate service provider? Like intermediaries in the physical economy, 
a special kind of software agents, so called middle-agents, is supposed 
to solve this problem based on the declarative characterization of the 
capabilities of both service requester and provider agents. In fact, the 
standard Web service interaction pattern includes a central role for a 
classical service matchmaking capability.

More generally, resource retrieval extends the notion of service 
matchmaking to the process of discovering any kind of resource 
(services, data, information, knowledge, even persons and organizations) 
for given settings, participating entities, and purposes. It is at the 
core of several scenarios in the Semantic Web area, spanning from 
web-services, grid computing, and Peer-to-Peer computing, to 
applications such as e-commerce, human resource management, or social 
networks applications such as mating and dating services.

The main objective of the SMR2 workshop is to bring together researchers 
and industry participants who tackle semantic service matchmaking and 
resource retrieval from various points of view, in order to not only 
further analyse these challenges and problems but moving towards their 
resolution.

+ Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Advanced searching of services and other resources in the semantic Web
- Approaches to matchmaking and brokering in the semantic Web, with a 
particular emphasis on semantic web services
- Semantic retrieval of resources and services in P2P and Grid networks
- Matchmaking in e-commerce scenarios: auctions, e-marketplaces, supply 
chains
- Matchmaking in other application scenarios: e-government, biopharma, etc.
- Composition planning of semantic Web services
- Negotiation of semantic Web services and resources
- Interleaving of discovery, composition, and negotiation of semantic 
Web services
- Semantic Web services selection
- Formal description and handling of semantic Web services, queries, and 
resources
- Non-functional service properties and their use for discovery (and 
composition)
- Trust issues of semantic Web service discovery
- Prototypes and tools for semantic Web services engineering
- Practical and user-oriented issues and experiences of implementing SW 
service retrieval tools
- Experimental comparative evaluation of implemented SW service 
retrieval tools

+ Going to Practice: The Second Semantic Service Selection (S3) Contest
The SMR2 workshop also integrates the second edition of the open 
international contest on semantic service selection (S3). The S3 contest 
is executed in collaboration with the Semantic Web Service Challenge.
