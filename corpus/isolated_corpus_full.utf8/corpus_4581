Call for Papers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Intelligent computing covers a hybrid palette of methods and techniques
derived from classical artificial intelligence, computational
intelligence, multi-agent systems a=2Eo=2E Distributed computing studies
systems that contain loosely-coupled components running on different
networked computers and that communicate and coordinate their actions
by message transfer=2E The emergent field of intelligent distributed
computing is expected to pose special challenges of adaptation and
fruitful combination of results of both areas with a great impact
on the development of new generation intelligent distributed
information systems=2E The aim of this symposium is to bring together
researchers involved in intelligent distributed computing to allow
cross-fertilization and synergy of ideas and to enable advancement
of researches in the field=2E

The symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning
all aspects of intelligent distributed computing ranging from
concepts and theoretical developments to advanced technologies
and innovative applications=2E Papers acceptance and publication
will be judged based on their relevance to the symposium theme,
clarity of presentation, originality and accuracy of results
and proposed solutions=2E Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Intelligent service composition and orchestration
- E-service and Web intelligence
- Multi-agent systems
- Information extraction and retrieval in distributed environments
- Data mining and knowledge discovery in distributed environments
- Semantic and knowledge grids
- Intelligent integration of data and processes
- Distributed problem solving and decision making
- Ontologies and meta-data for describing heterogeneous resources
  and services
- Autonomic, adaptive and self-organising distributed computing
  and systems
- Intelligence in mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing
- Intelligence in cooperative information systems, groupware
  and workflows, virtual enterprises, social networks
- Intelligent distributed applications in e-business/e-commerce,
  e-learning, e-health, e-science, e-government, crisis management
- Intelligence in Peer-to-Peer systems
- Emerging behaviours in complex distributed systems
- Modelling and simulation of intelligent distributed systems
