  SECOND CALL FOR EVALUATION RESOURCES

 >> LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE  =

2008) <<

  endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)


Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco
Deadline: Friday, 1 Feb 2008 (resources) / Friday, 29 Feb 2008 (papers)

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

########################################################

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our  =

understanding of
multiword expressions (MWE), the development of algorithms for their  =

automatic
extraction from corpora, and the automatic identification of additional
properties such as morphosyntactic preferences or the interpretation of
semi-compositional expressions.

It is difficult to compare results of the many published studies on  =

MWEs and
obtain a broader perspective, though, because algorithms and implemented
systems have been evaluated on vastly different gold standards and  =

corpora, in
different languages, for different subtypes of MWEs, etc. In order to  =

make the
next big step forward, the field of MWE research needs a shared task  =

in which
different approaches are applied to the same data sets, allowing  =

completely
new insights to be gained. Since there is as yet not a clear and  =

universally
accepted definition of multiword expressions, the first instalment of  =

this
shared task will be of a more exploratory nature than the  =

competitions that
have been carried out in other areas of computational linguistics.

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for  =

collecting, sharing
and exploiting MWE evaluation resources.  We solicit contributions of  =

such
resources from the MWE community, in particular:

  (1) manually annotated data sets (MWE candidates marked as true and  =

false
      positives, or as different subtypes of MWEs);

  (2) data sets of MWEs annotated with additional properties; and

  (3) lists of known MWEs, e.g. from machine-readable dictionaries.

In addition, candidate data obtained from corpora with sophisticated
proprietary NLP tools may be of interest, helping researchers to  =

apply their
statistical MWE identification techniques to a broad range of languages.

The contributed resources will be made available freely for research  =

purposes
on multiword.sf.net, and should be accompanied by documentation (e.g.
annotation guidelines) on the SourceForge project wiki. Contributors  =

will be
invited to submit a short paper (4 pages) describing their resource and
summarising previous research carried out on these data.

After collection of the resources, teams participating in the shared  =

task can
evaluate their MWE extraction algorithms on multiple data sets and  =

discuss
implications for their generalisability and further development. At the
workshop, the evaluation results of the different teams will be  =

summarised and
compared. A call for papers and participation in the shared task is  =

being
distributed separately.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

**Evaluation Resources**

Please send your resource and documentation to Nicole Gr=E9goire
(Nicole.Gregoire@let.uu.nl). You will then receive an account for the
MWE wiki on which  you can publish basic information about your  =

resource.

The resources will be made available as a downloadable package on our  =

SourceForge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiword) under a  =

suitable
open-source license (please specify if you require different  =

licensing terms).
A list of all available resources will be published on the  =

multiword.sf.net Web site.

To give shared task participants sufficient time to re-evaluate their  =

models,
we set the deadline for submitting resources on 1 February 2008.   =

Submissions made
before the deadline are invited to submit a short paper for the  =

workshop proceedings.
Resource submissions after the deadline (and even after the workshop)  =

are of course
possible and welcome.

**Paper**

Short papers describing evaluation resources must adhere to the  =

format of LREC proceedings
(preferably using the style files provided on the conference Web  =

site) and must not exceed
four (4) pages, including references. Only submissions in PDF format  =

will be considered.

The papers must be submitted no later than 23:59 GMT on February 29,  =

2008.
Papers submitted after that time cannot be reviewed.

Please submit your paper here: https://www.softconf.com/LREC2008/ =

MWE2008/submit.html


IMPORTANT DATES

Resource submission deadline: February 1, 2008
Paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
Notification of acceptance: March 28, 2008
Camera-ready papers due: April 4, 2008
Workshop date: June 1, 2008
