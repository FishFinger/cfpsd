Traditionally workshop themes for GLOW, typically staged in the west of Europe, have been dominated by issues pertinent to Germanic and Romance languages. Here in Wroc?aw we would like to add a pinch of local colour: let's go Slavic!

This workshop centers around the issue of the theoretical description of the syntax, morphosyntax and semantics of Slavic languages. This branch of languages from the Indo-European Family shows a number of fascinating properties, including among others:

-Information structure-driven word order
-A rich system of nominal case
-Multiple Wh-movement
-An intricate system of the aspectual marking of the verb through prefixation
-Long-distance anaphoric binding
-Null subjects
-Determiner-less nominal phrases
-Left Branch Condition violations
-Pronominal clitics/weak pronouns
-Negative concord and NPIs
-Numerous insightful analyses of these properties have repeatedly fuelled agitated debates within the linguistic 
-Community and considerably contributed to our current understanding of the mechanics of the syntactic derivation and the logical/semantic interpretation. 

Call for Papers:

We invite contributions dealing not only with properties typical of Slavic languages as such but also touching upon more general features of natural language that are exemplified by some of the phenomena mentioned in the conference description.

Abstracts should be sent in two copies: one with a name and one without as attached files (the name(s) should also be clearly mentioned in the e-mail) to: wjacek@amu.edu.pl in .pdf format.

Only electronic submissions will be considered. Deadline for submissions: November 1, 2009. Abstracts may not exceed two pages of text with at least a one-inch margin on all four sides (measured on A4 paper) and must employ a font not smaller than 12 point. Each page may include a maximum of 50 lines of text. An additional page with references may be included.

Deadline for abstract submission: 1st November 2009 

Abstracts submitted to: wjacek@amu.edu.pl
