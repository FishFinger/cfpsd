Meeting Description:

Non-Classical Formal Languages In Linguistics

ForLing 2008

September 19-20, 2008, Tarragona (Spain) 

Call for Participation at the Second International Workshop

This is the second edition of the Workshop on Non-Classical Formal Languages in
Linguistics. The first ForLing was hold in 2007, as a co-located workshop of the
16th International Symposium on Fundamentals of Computation Theory (FCT) that
was hold in the Benczúr Hotel in Budapest (Hungary) on August 31, 2007.

Aims and Scope:
Formal Language Theory was born in the middle of 20th century as a tool for
modelling and investigating syntax of natural languages. After 1964, formal
language theory developed as a separate branch with specific problems,
techniques and results and with an internal self-motivated life. So, formal
languages, which started being a tool to be applied to natural languages, became
rapidly a theory that studied formal systems independently of possible
linguistic applications. On the other hand, classical formal language theory,
due to its abstract and formal properties, has been applied to a wide range of
fields (besides initial linguistic motivation): economic modelling,
developmental biology, cryptography, sociology... Non classical models of formal
languages present the same abstractness that has facilitate the application of
classical models to many issues, and, in addition, present, several advantageous
features: natural inspiration, parallelism, distribution, cooperation, etc.
Therefore, recently many researchers claim that application of non-classical
models of formal languages can provide approaches to linguistics that can
improve the description, analysis and processing of natural languages. In fact,
the aim of this workshop is to discuss the possible applications of
non-classical formal languages in linguistics.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different areas
that have in common the use of formal language theory to approach different
aspects of natural language.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
Mathematical Linguistics
Linguistic Applications of Formal Languages
Formal Analysis of Linguistic Theories and Frameworks
Model-Theoretic and Proof-Theoretic Methods in Linguistics
Probabilistic and Statistical Models of Language
Linguistic Applications of FSA
Logics and Language

Submissions:
Authors are invited to submit a paper of at most 12 pages in plain LaTeX format
to one of the following e-mail addresses mariadolores.jimenez@urv.cat or
gemma.bel@urv.cat

Accepted papers will be included in a preproceedings volume edited as a GRLMC
report.

Selected papers will be published in a well-ranked journal after the workshop.

Important Dates: 
Submission deadline: June 30, 2008 
Notification of acceptance: July 30, 2008 
Final version due: September 1, 2008 
Workshop: September 19-20, 2007
