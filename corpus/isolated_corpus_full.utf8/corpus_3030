CALL FOR CHAPTER PROPOSALS
Proposal Submission Deadline: May 30, 2008
Open Information Management: Applications of Interconnectivity and
Collaboration
A book edited by Samuli Niiranen, Jari Yli-Hietanen and Artur Lugmayr
Tampere University of Technology, Finland

Introduction
Computers, the Internet and other contemporary digital tools have
revolutionized the storing, transfer and processing of information.
However, chiefly for reasons of adaptability, alternatives to current
formalisms in information management are needed for domains where the
operational environment is complexly coupled, principally unbounded and
constantly evolving.  This is especially true when information to be
managed is closely related to the domain of human collaboration and where
hierarchical organizations are still required in the management of complex
activities. Natural language based mechanisms give tools for a
fundamentally new kind of organization of complex activities. An
iteratively, collectively and semi-autonomously built ability to link
pieces of information together enables each user of an information mass to
obtain an individualized meaning and to understand various possibilities
for utilizing the information. This ability also enables the emergence of
ad hoc, self-organized networks of micro-enterprises and, even more
essentially, makes them competitive compared to large hierarchical
enterprises with employees having time-based salary compensation. The
competitive advantage of these micro-enterprises comes from the automation
of venture management and the possibility to avoid overheads associated
with the utilization of employees having a time-based salary.
Design-while-use, fluent use of natural language and goal-orientation are
projected key artifacts of open information management. Open Information
Management provides tools to handle richer information masses than earlier
management systems, resulting in potentially more efficient improvements
and advances, especially, for example, in the fields of medicine and the
life sciences. In addition, ubiquitous, pervasive and ambient technologies
will help to further embed the use of information management tools in the
natural human environment. The goal of the book is to collect a group of
visionary thinkers coming from fields such as technology, science, and art
to present emerging technologies that reshape the way we think about
information management.

Objective of the Book
The book gives a practical-level reference on and discusses the impact of
an emerging trend in information technology towards solutions capable of
managing information within open, principally unbounded, operational
environments. These developments - evident in many contemporary areas of
research including artificial intelligence, computational linguistics,
pervasive and ubiquitous media - are projected to bring about a new breed
of tools for the management of information going beyond the conventional
paradigms. The emergence of search-driven information management, best
known through the GoogleTM search engine, is one initial illustration of
this trend.

Target Audience
The book is primarily intended for scientists, professionals and
consultants in touch with cross-disciplinary research and strategic
management in information technology, marketing, media, manufacturing,
education and the life sciences and medicine. The approach is
multi-disciplinary, including perspectives from the following fields:
information technology, business, education, health sciences and media
studies. It also draws from research in sociology and psychology. The book
can be utilized in advanced courses as supplements to course materials in
knowledge management, information technology, and business education, and
also serve as an addition to library reference sections. A secondary market
is the lay public following trends in technology, business and society.

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
-	Hierarchical organization as a facilitator of information management in
human collaboration
-	Self-organization in different human activities in the context of
information management
-	Complexity of information management in human collaboration
-	The history of information management tools and impact on man
-	Natural language as a tool in human and machine-human collaboration 
-	Search-driven information management in contrast to tailored software
applications
-	Natural language and modern computing
-	The power of massive linking as an information management mechanism - or
how everything relates to everything
-	Human-machine interface as an information exchange process
-	Emerging media technologies, such as ambient/pervasive media or
ubiquitous computation embedding technology seamlessly into the natural
human environment
-	Productivity, workflow and information management 
-	Creativity and information management and tools to improve artistic creation
-	Personalized marketing from the point of view of information management
-	Logistics and process optimization from the point of view of information
management 
-	Manufacturing mass-customization from the point of view of information
management
-	Comparison of information management in micro-enterprises and
hierarchical corporations
-	Information exchange and feedback: mass media vs. consumer-driven media
-	Information exchange and feedback: mass education vs. need-driven learning
-	Information management in consumer-driven, personal health care
-	Biological systems as emergent entities exchanging and processing information

Submission Procedure
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before May 30,
2008, a 2-3 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the mission and
concerns of his or her proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals will
be notified by June 10, 2008 about the status of their proposals and sent
chapter guidelines. Full chapters are expected to be submitted by August
10, 2008. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind review
basis. This book is scheduled to be published by IGI Global (formerly Idea
Group Inc.), publisher of the "Information Science Reference" (formerly
Idea Group Reference) and "Medical Information Science Reference" imprints.
