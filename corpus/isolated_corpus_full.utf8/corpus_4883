   	          TIME 2009 - Final Call for Papers

		 Sixteenth International Symposium on
		Temporal Representation and Reasoning

		  Brixen, Italy, July 23-25, 2009

	    http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/time-2009/


The TIME symposium series is a well-established annual event that
brings together researchers from all areas of computer science that
involve temporal representation and reasoning. This includes, but is
not limited to, artificial intelligence, temporal databases, and the
verification of software and hardware systems. In addition to fostering
interdisciplinarity, the TIME symposia emphasize bridging the gap
between theoretical and applied research.

TIME 2009 encompasses three tracks, but has a single program
committee. The conference will span three days, and will be organized
as a combination of technical paper presentations, poster sessions,
and keynote lectures.

* IMPORTANT DATES

* PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions of high quality papers describing research results or
on-going work are solicited. Submitted papers should contain original,
previously unpublished content, should be written in English, and must
not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submitted papers will be refereed by at least three reviewers for
quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Accepted papers will
be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, which
will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Acceptance of a
paper is contingent on one author presenting the paper at the
symposium.

Submissions should be in PDF format (with the necessary fonts
embedded). They must be formatted according to the IEEE guide-
lines described at

ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/
                    proceedings/8.5x11 - Formatting files/

and must not exceed 8 pages; over-length submissions may be
rejected without review.

Papers are submitted electronically via Easychair:
