E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: call for submissions.

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
Information. Submissions are invited for 2005. The prize will be awarded to
the best dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. in the year 2005. The
dissertations will be judged on technical depth and strength, originality,
and impact made in at least two of the three fields of Logic, Language, and
Computation.

Who qualifies

Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree in
the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st, 2005 and
December 31st, 2005. There is no restriction on the nationality of the
candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was granted. After a careful
consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only dissertations written in
English. Dissertations produced in 2005 but not written in English or not
translated will be allowed for submission, after translation, also with the
call next year (for 2006).

Prize

The prize consists of

- a certificate
- a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
- an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to the
new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be published by
Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further information on this
series is available on the FoLLI site)

How to submit

Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are required:

   1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
   2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
   3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. Self-nominations
are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by the thesis
supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely describe the scope
and significance of the dissertation and state when the degree was
officially awarded;
   4. two additional letters of support, including at least one letter from
a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that awarded the
Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to

                beth_award@dimi.uniud.it

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.

In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack of notification
within three working days after submission, nominators should write to
policriti@dimi.uniud.it or areces@loria.fr

Important dates

Deadline for Submissions: July 31, 2006.
Notification of Decision: November 15, 2006.
