Meeting Description:

Workshop on Late Modern-English dialect lexicology: Wright's English Dialect dictionary, The Survey of English dialects and beyond 

Final Call/Reminder

The workshop intends to encourage research on historical English dialect lexicology. Synchronic contributions should have a clearly methodological focus. We invite topics ranging from the reappraisal of data (e.g. of Late Modern-English dictionaries) to the discussion of compilation strategies and corpus linguistic methods. Furthermore, papers are considered that deal with the relationship between regional and other, in particular, social dimensions of dialect words. Contributions are also welcome on any of the core aspects of dialectal lexis, such as phonological variation, word formation, phrasal units, semantic and pragmatic patterns, as well as aspects of visualisation by means of dialect maps.

Henk Zeevat, henk.zeevat@uva.nl

The workshop is organised in cooperation with the SIG Dialogue Systems of the Gesellschaft für Linguististische Datenverarbeitung (GLDV, http://www.gldv.org).

Workshop Purpose and Topics:
Discourse particles and modal adverbs form a borderline case between semantics and pragmatics and so can be the source of new insights in these areas. The use of particles has been connected with discourse relations and other coherence relations, the relation between semantic content and discourse context, especially the mutual knowledge and the common discourse goals of the discourse participants, with expression of speaker beliefs, desires and intentions and with the control of interpretations that go beyond semantic content, i.e. explicatures and implicatures. And, last but not least, particles and modal adverbs can contribute to expressive and other non-truth-conditional aspects of meaning. From the perspective of computational linguistics, these words are a promise, because it would seem that their treatment would help NLP systems to get a better grasp on the intentions of the user in interpretation and to achieve natural and comprehensible output in generation. However!
 , they are also a challenge, because their analysis seems to involve concepts beyond current levels of sophistication.

The workshop proposes to collect contributions to the formal description and implementation of discourse particles and modal adverbs. This third edition of workshop will in addition have a focus on the experimental investigation of the use and interpretation of discourse particles and modal adverbs, with a special view to the validation of formal and computational approaches.

The workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers (including advanced PhD students) to present and discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who work in the broad subject of the disciplines relevant for particles and modal adverbs, as represented in ESSLLI.
