                  WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS



           ACL2007 - A Broader Perspective on Multiword Expressions



             Endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)





Date:      June, 28 (AM), 2007

Location:  Prague, Czech Republic



Workshop web page: http://www.let.uu.nl/~Nicole.Gregoire/personal/ACL07-MWE/

########################################################################



In recent years, the NLP community has increasingly become aware of the problems

that multiword expressions (MWEs) pose. A considerable amount of research has

been conducted in this area, some within large research projects dedicated to

MWEs. Although progress has been made especially in the area of multiword

extraction, a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered.



Following up workshops on various aspects of MWEs at previous ACL conferences,

we want to address these questions in this year's MWE workshop:



- Is it sufficient to use purely statistical methods for the extraction of MWEs

from corpora, or is it necessary to harness human knowledge and linguistic insights?

- Is fully automatic MWE extraction feasible, or will manual validation always

be required?

- What is the nature of MWEs, and how can they be defined formally?

- To what extent can definitions and extraction procedures be generalised to other

languages, other text types and other types of MWEs?

- Can and should we distinguish subtypes of MWEs for NLP applications?



In addition to these fundamental issues, we want to address the practical question

of what is needed for a successful treatment of MWEs in NLP:



- What properties should be specified for MWEs or subtypes of MWEs in the lexicon?

- Can we detect these properties automatically with sufficient accuracy?

- How can existing grammars be adapted in order to deal better with MWEs?

- What role do the semantics of MWEs play in NLP applications and can they be

determined automatically from large corpora?



We therefore solicit papers describing linguistically motivated approaches to MWEs,

comparative studies across languages or different subtypes of MWEs, and the

treatment of MWEs in NLP applications. This includes (but is not limited to) research

on:



- Linguistic, Empirical and Cognitive Properties of MWEs: research into the definitions

and characteristic properties of MWEs and the impact that such information has on NLP

applications.



- Classes of MWEs: investigating classes (or subtypes) of MWEs and the extent to which

computational techniques transfer to different classes and different languages.



- Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs: combining the computational

treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic and/or psycholinguistic analysis.





SUBMISSION INFORMATION



Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should not

exceed eight (8) pages, including references.



As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and

affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to projects,

corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided. For

example, instead of "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", write "Smith previously

showed (Smith, 1991) ...".



Submission will be electronic, using the workshop's START paper submission webpage

(http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS6/submit.html). The only accepted format for

submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 7pm US

Eastern time March 26, 2007 (23:59 GMT March 26, 2007). Papers submitted after

that time will not be reviewed.





WORKSHOP FORMAT



This is a half-day workshop. The accepted papers will be presented as 20-minute talks

followed by a 10-minute discussion.





IMPORTANT DATES



Paper submission deadline: March 26, 2007

Notification of acceptance: April 30, 2007

Camera ready papers due: May 9, 2007

Workshop date: June 28 (AM), 2007
