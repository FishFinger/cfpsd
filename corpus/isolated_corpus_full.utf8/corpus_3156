Modeling, Design, and Analysis for Service-oriented Architectures 
Workshop; 3rd edition (mda4soa'08)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 13 June 2008 ====


http://events.deri.at/mda4soa2008/

co-located with the 12th Enterprise Computing Conference (EDOC 2008)

17 September 2008, München , Germany


GENERAL OVERVIEW

A new paradigm  service-orientation  is currently emerging for 
distributed computing
and e-business processing; it has evolved from object-oriented and 
component-based
computing to enable building agile networks of collaborating business 
applications
distributed within and across organizational boundaries. This new 
paradigm utilizes
services (autonomous platform-independent computational elements that 
can be described,
published, discovered and accessed over the Internet using standard 
protocols) as
fundamental elements for developing applications/solutions; services 
will be important
for customers and not the specific software or hardware component that 
is used to implement
the services. In this context, services become the next level of 
abstraction in the process
of creating systems that would enable automation of e-businesses. This 
paradigm shift is
changing the way the computer software is developed and used (designed, 
architected,
delivered, consumed, and analysed), and this way of reorganizing 
software applications
and infrastructure into a set of interacting services is usually 
referred to as Service-oriented Architecture s (SOA).

In recent years, various forms of service-oriented architectures have 
appeared; amongst
them, Web services, Grid services, Semantic Web Services, and e-Services 
are the most
important. Although they share some of the principles of 
service-oriented architectures,
they differ in many other aspects, which is an undesirable situation in 
the context of
service-oriented architectures. Since standard protocols are a basic 
principle of SOA,
this undesirable situation is partly due also to the fact that there are 
currently no
mature methodologies and techniques to support analysis for 
service-oriented architectures.
Moreover, all these forms of service-oriented architectures have 
developed different conceptual
models, resulting in different methodologies for modelling and designing 
service-oriented architectures.

In this context, this workshop aims to tackle the research problems (as 
well as practical
experiences) around methods, concepts, models, languages and technology 
that enable computing
in service-oriented environments. Of particular interest are the 
architectural, technical,
and developmental foundations of service-oriented architectures, and 
showing how they combine
synergistically to enable distributed computing on the scale required by 
today's Internet-connected
enterprise.

The focus of the workshop is broader than, but includes, the OMG MDA 
(Model Driven Architecture)
approach for service oriented architectures. MDA was for the first 
international workshop,
mda4soa'06, used as short for Modeling, Design and Analysis.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry 
practitioners (e.g. leading
modelers, architects, system vendors, open-source projects, developers, 
and end-users)
addressing many of these issues (including recent developments in tools 
and techniques, and
real-world implementations of service-oriented distributed 
applications), and promote and
foster a greater understanding of how service-oriented architectures can 
assist business
to business and enterprise application integration, thus helping people 
develop and manage
business processes more efficiently and effectively.

analysis of service-oriented architectures



WORKSHOP FORMAT AND ATTENDANCE

The program will occupy a full day, and will include presentations of 
papers selected from the full papers category (see 'submissions' below).
Please note that at least one author of each accepted submission must 
attend the workshop. The EDOC 2008 conference formalities are applied 
for fees and respective organizational aspects. Submission of a paper is 
not required for attendance at the workshop. However, in the event that 
the workshop cannot accommodate all who would like to participate, those 
who have submitted a paper (in any category) will be given priority for 
registration.


SUBMISSIONS

The workshop invites different types of contributions:

    * Papers
    * Demos
    * Posters / Position papers

Papers:The papers should not exceed 8 pages and should have the IEEE layout.

Demos: Detailed description plus sufficient number of screenshots or a 
video of the demo are required. For paper-based submissions, please 
follow the IEEE layout. Please note that at the workshop itself no 
technical support is provided except possibly Internet connection and 
power (to be confirmed).

Posters/Position papers: The posters/position papers should not exceed 4 
pages and should have the IEEE layout.

All contributions will be peer reviewed by a program committee that will 
incorporate well recognized experts in the area of service-oriented 
architectures.

All submissions should be formatted in the IEEE layout, and should be 
submitted in electronic format using the link: 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=MDA4SOA2007.

All accepted full papers and all position papers of attendees will be 
published in the proceedings of the workshop. Workshop proceedings will 
be published with IEEE Computer Society Press and will be available at 
the workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES
    * Paper submission deadline: 13 June 2008
    * Paper acceptance notification: 18 July 2008
    * Camera ready of papers: 28 July 2008
