Meeting Description

The International Linguistic Association announces its 53rd Annual Conference to
be held at SUNY College at Old Westbury in Old Westbury, NY (Long Island) on
April 11-13, 2008 on the topic of Language Policy and Language Planning. 

Language Policy involves any action established by a society regarding language
use and form in public contexts as determined by convention and/or laws
administered within national and local governments, the courts, the workplace,
the media, and education systems. Matters of interest to Language Planning
include policies on official language, the use and form of minority languages,
which languages will be taught in the school system, and bilingualism planning;
as well as the linguistic industries driven by the market in the process of
globalization. Under this rubric, abstracts of not more than 425 words are
solicited on such topics as:

Language Planning and Globalization 
Spanish in the United States
French and English in Canada 
Indigenous/ Endangered/ Minority languages
Languages in Contact
Pidgins and Creoles			
Language Planning in Education

Policies on Bilingualism
Official Language Policy
Creoles and Standardization
Human and Machine Translation Industry
Language Planning and Human Development
Immigrant Languages
Dialects and Standardization
 
While papers on the main topic are particularly welcome, individuals are
encouraged to submit abstracts on any subject in theoretical and applied
linguistics.

Submit abstracts in an anonymous, titled, single-spaced attachment of not more
than 425 words in length, with name, address and affiliation in the body of an
email. Please send abstract as a camera-ready attachment (in a Microsoft Word
file, if possible) to the conference coordinator, Annika Wendt
(annikawendt@yahoo.com). Within the body of the email, please also indicate any
audio-visual equipment needed. 

Those wishing to propose panels or special sessions should contact the
conference chair, Kathleen O'Connor-Bater (oconnorbaterk@oldwestbury.edu) before
submitting an abstract for the panel together with abstracts for each of the
constituent papers.

Time allotted will be 20 minutes for delivery of the paper plus 5 minutes
discussion.  
Deadline for receipt of abstracts is January 15, 2008.

For up-coming conference information, see ILA website (www.ilaword.org).

Meeting Description

Title of the workshop:
Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge

Web site:
http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/

The workshop seeks to explore methodologies developed from scratch for a variety
of languages, and perhaps their reapplication to the processing of English
texts. We invite submissions on the topics we list below, and on closely related
topics in the general spirit of the workshop. We target the problem of automatic
extraction of some form of natural language semantics from corpora and
application of the knowledge extracted in that way in systems that deal with
natural language. Work on any language is welcome; we particularly encourage
submissions related to 'less privileged' languages. 

First Call for Papers

Title of the workshop:
Language Diversity and the Acquisition of Linguistic Semantic Knowledge

The host conference:
6th International Conference on Multimedia and Network Information Systems,
Wroclaw, Poland, September 18-19, 2008

Web site:
http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/MISSI2008/LDALSK/

The proportion of Web pages written in English keeps decreasing, but a majority
of text-handling tools and techniques have been developed for English and tested
on English resources. Many languages have been reasonably well served by the
existing systems, but large typological differences (complex morphology, rich
inflection, freer-order syntax, not to mention cultural biases) tend to make
those tools and resources less than fully adequate. This may be particularly
true of deeper processing, including the acquisition of natural language
semantics from text.

The workshop seeks to explore methodologies developed from scratch for a variety
of languages, and perhaps their reapplication to the processing of English
texts. We invite submissions on the topics we list below, and on closely related
topics in the general spirit of the workshop. We target the problem of automatic
extraction of some form of natural language semantics from corpora and
application of the knowledge extracted in that way in systems that deal with
natural language.

Work on any language is welcome; we particularly encourage submissions related
to ''less privileged'' languages. The workshop will be held in English, to
ensure the broadest dissemination of its contributions. We have room for up to
50 papers, including posters, so there will be ample opportunity to report on
work in progress. To suit the host conference, papers on applications of the
semantic knowledge extracted from text will also be considered; such
applications include
machine translation, parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval,
information extraction, and text mining.

All submissions must present original work. There will be a strict reviewing
process. (Submission instructions will be announced later.) The proceedings will
be printed by IEEE.

Topics:

Distributional semantics, semantic relatedness, semantic similarity
Extraction of lexico-semantic relations
Extraction of logical models for natural language semantics
Extraction of selectional restrictions
Lexicon extraction from corpora
Pattern-based methods in lexical knowledge acquisition
Recognition of expressions of opinions and emotions in text
Resources and tools for word-sense disambiguation
Software support for lexical knowledge acquisition
Thesaurus construction, extension and critique

Schedule:

submission March 27, 2008
reviews in April 30, 2008
acceptance May 7, 2008
camera-ready May 21-28, 2008

All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published by
IEEE.

The format of the papers will be announced soon.
