     Back Talk: The Language of Defiance, Denial, Distortion, and Development
     Scheduled Publication Date: January 15, 2007

     Imus's use of the power of the language to reduce successful young
     women to objects of racial epithet got him fired. In a South Philadelphia
     neighborhood, a cheesesteak restaurant owner becomes the subject of a
     national debate about whether the language of immigrants is valid and
     whether it should retain power in the United States, even the simple power
     to order a sandwich. Meanwhile, America as a whole asks the question
     on the world stage of whether the power of words is permitted to 'enemy
     combatants', and even to Congress as they attempt to end the war in Iraq.
     President Bush uses the power of words in the form of signing statements,
     accompanying each veto of congressional legislation that he sends out.
     Internationally, the people of war-torn lands such as Darfur struggle to
     find a voice to ask for aid and the women of many countries cry out for
     protection against institutionalized rape. Speaking out has been an
     important concept in feminism from the beginning. Who owns language?
     Who can use its power? And how is that power used in a modern,
     technological, global world? How can it be harnessed for good? In this
     issue of MP Journal, we seek papers that explore language and its
     power and how that relates to national and international issues.
