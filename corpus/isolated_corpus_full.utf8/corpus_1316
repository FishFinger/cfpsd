Call for papers - Special Issue of Terminology on Pattern-Based
Approaches to Semantic Relation Extraction 14(1), 2008

Guest editors:	
Alain Auger (Defence Research and Development, Canada)

In the context of computational terminology, especially for the task
of generating or updating specialized ontologies, important snippets
of definitional information can be found in text, as expressed
explicitly in natural language utterances. Such utterances have been
called knowledge-rich contexts (KRCs) and a popular way of identifying
KRCs has been by looking for so-called ?knowledge patterns? (KPs),
which are the natural language instantiations of semantic relations
(Meyer, 2001).

It is the main strategy of pattern-based approaches to relation
extraction from free text to compile lists of reliable patterns
instantiating specific semantic relation types and use these lists to
find new instances and gradually improve the coverage of (existing)
ontologies.

Automatically extracting semantic relations - the building blocks of
ontologies - from free text is a way of minimizing the labor-intensive
phase of manual knowledge engineering and thus overcoming the
long-standing knowledge acquisition bottleneck.  Specialized
ontologies can be seen as the end-product of the terminological tasks
of conceptual clarification and knowledge structuring.

Pattern-based approaches to semantic relation extraction pioneered by
Hearst (1992) have inspired the work of many and are getting more and
more attention in the scientific community. Investigation of automatic
ways of finding semantic relations using such approach is represented
by recent work from Cimiano and Staab (2005), Pantel & Pennacchiotti
(2006), Malaisé et al. (2005), Marshman (2006), Aussenac-Gilles and
Bourigault (2005), to name a few.

Beyond automatic extraction techniques, applying these approaches in
terminology raises a series of particular issues.  For example, some
particular types of semantic relations are favored.  Some relations
are domain specific ?  in fact the domain-specificity of knowledge
patterns has been a long debate.  Corpora must be specialized corpora
and might present the data sparseness problem more than general
corpus.  The task of term extraction is very much linked to that of
semantic relation extraction in the purpose of ontology construction.

This special issue of Terminology on the topic of semantic relation
extraction, is primarily interested in pattern-based approaches, but
would also welcome articles suggesting other methods (applied in a
terminological context) for semantic relation extraction if put in a
comparative setting with pattern-based approaches.

Topics of interest include:

- the importance of semantic relations in terminological databases

- the relation between the semantic relation extraction task and the
term extraction task

- the expression of semantic relations explicitly (using knowledge
patterns) versus implicitly (as in the implicit relation between
components of noun compounds)

- the value of explicit knowledge in text for terminological studies

- the quantification of explicit knowledge in specialized corpus

- domain dependency of knowledge patterns and semantic relations

- text genre dependency of knowledge patterns and semantic relations

- techniques to build, infer or compile knowledge patterns

- noise analysis of knowledge patterns

- evaluation approaches for knowledge retrieved through the use of
knowledge patterns

- comparison of knowledge pattern approaches to other approaches of
semantic relation extraction

- terminology applications which include semantic relations analysis

- terminology applications and the representation of ontological
knowledge

- knowledge structuring approaches related to semantic relation
extraction

Papers dealing with knowledge extraction of general knowledge (such as
methods to recreate a Wordnet-like ontology) will not be accepted.
The purpose must be domain-specific (application) even if the method
could be general.

Submissions:  
Papers should be written with Word and comprise between 20-30
pages. More information on formatting requirements can be found on the
John Benjamins website (www.benjamins.com). English is preferred but
submissions in French, Spanish or German will be considered.

Please send submissions to Alain Auger: (Alain.Auger@drdc-rddc.gc.ca)
Each issue of Terminology contains six articles.
