                  TIME 2009 - Second Call for Papers

                 Sixteenth International Symposium on
                Temporal Representation and Reasoning

                   Brixen, Italy, July 23-25, 2009

            http://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/events/time-2009/


The TIME symposium series is a well-established annual event that
brings together researchers from all areas of computer science that
involve temporal representation and reasoning. This includes, but is
not limited to, artificial intelligence, temporal databases, and the
verification of software and hardware systems. In addition to
fostering interdisciplinarity, the TIME symposia emphasize bridging
the gap between theoretical and applied research.

TIME 2009 encompasses three tracks, but has a single program
committee. The conference will span three days, and will be organized
as a combination of technical paper presentations, poster sessions,
and keynote lectures.

* PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions of high quality papers describing research results or
on-going work are solicited. Submitted papers should contain original,
previously unpublished content, should be written in English, and must
not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submitted papers will be refereed by at least three reviewers for
quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Accepted papers will
be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, which
will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Acceptance of a
paper is contingent on one author presenting the paper at the
symposium.

Submissions should be in PDF format (with the necessary fonts
embedded). They must be formatted according to the IEEE guide- lines
described at

 ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/
                    proceedings/8.5x11 - Formatting files/

and must not exceed 8 pages; over-length submissions may be rejected
without review.

Papers are submitted electronically via Easychair:
