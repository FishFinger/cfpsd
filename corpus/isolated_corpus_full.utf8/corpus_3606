Meeting Description:

EACL 2009 workshop on Computational Linguistic Aspects of Grammatical Inference

30 or 31 March 2009
Co-located with The 12th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association
for Computational Linguistics
Athens, Greece

Call for Papers

Scope
There has been growing interest over the last few years in learning grammars
from natural language text (and structured or semi-structured text). The family
of techniques enabling such learning is usually called "grammatical inference"
or "grammar induction".

The field of grammatical inference is often subdivided into formal grammatical
inference, where researchers aim to proof efficient learnability of classes of
grammars, and empirical grammatical inference, where the aim is to learn
structure from data.  In this case the existence of an underlying grammar is
just regarded as a hypothesis and what is sought is to better describe the
language through some automatically learned rules.

Both formal and empirical grammatical inference have been linked with
(computational) linguistics.  Formal learnability of grammars has been used in
discussions on how people learn language.  Some people mention proofs of
(non-)learnability of certain classes of grammars as arguments in the
empiricist/nativist discussion.  On the more practical side, empirical systems
that learn grammars have been applied to natural language.  Instead of proving
whether classes of grammars can be learnt, the aim here is to provide practical
learning systems that automatically introduce structure in language.  Example
fields where initial research has been done are syntactic parsing, morphological
analysis of words, and bilingual modeling (or machine translation).

This workshop at EACL 2009 aims to explore the state-of-the-art in these topics.
 In particular, we aim at bringing formal and empirical grammatical inference
researchers closer together with researchers in the field of computational
linguistics.

Topics
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of grammatical inference in relation to natural language (such as,
syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology, phonetics), including, but not limited to
- Automatic grammar engineering, including, for example, parser construction,
parameter estimation, smoothing, ...
- Unsupervised parsing
- Language modeling
- Transducers, for instance, for morphology, text to speech, automatic
translation, transliteration, spelling correction, ...
- Learning syntax with semantics
- Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning of linguistic knowledge
- Learning (classes of) grammars (e.g. subclasses of the Chomsky Hierarchy) from
linguistic inputs
- Comparing learning results in different frameworks (e.g. membership vs.
correction queries)
- Learning linguistic structures (e.g. phonological features, lexicon) from the
acoustic signal
- Grammars and finite state machines in machine translation
- Learning setting of Chomskyan parameters
- Cognitive aspects of grammar acquisition, covering, among others,
developmental trajectories as studied by psycholinguists working with children,
characteristics of child-directed speech as they are manifested in corpora such
as CHILDES, ...
(Unsupervised) Computational language acquisition (experimental or observational)

Submission
Papers should present original, completed and unpublished research, not
exceeding 8 pages.  All submissions are to be formatted using the EACL 2009
style files (http://www.eacl2009.gr/conference/authors).

Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than Friday 19 December,
2008. The only accepted format for submitted papers is PDF.

The reviewing process will be blind; thus papers should not include the authors'
names and affiliations or any references to web sites, project names etc.
revealing the authors' identity.  Each submission will be reviewed by at least
two members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.

Important dates
19 December, 2008 - Deadline for paper submission
30 January, 2009 - Notification of acceptance
12 February, 2009 - Camera-ready copies due
30 or 31 March, 2009 - Computational Linguistic Aspects of Grammatical
Inference workshop held at EACL-09 (exact date to be announced)

Meeting Description:

EACL 2009 Workshop 
GEMS : GEometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics
Athens, Greece; March 30 or 31, 2009 
URL: http://art.uniroma2.it/gems/ 

Call for Papers

Submission Deadline:  December 19, 2008 

Distributional models and semantic spaces represent a core topic in contemporary
computational linguistics for their impact on advanced tasks and on other
knowledge fields (such as social science and the humanities).

The goal of the GEMS workshop is to further stimulate research on semantic 
spaces and distributional methods for NLP, by adopting an interdisciplinary 
approach to allow a proper exchange of ideas, results and resources among 
often independent  communities. In particular, the workshop will provide a
common ground for a fruitful discussion among experts of distributional
approaches, collocational corpus analysis and machine learning; researchers
interested in the use of statistical models in NLP applications (e.g. question
answering, summarization and textual entailment) and in other fields of science;
and experts in formal computational semantics.

The workshop aims at gathering contemporary contributions to large scale
problems in meaning representation, acquisition and use, based on distributional
and vector space models. The workshop aims also to shed new light on the use of
such  techniques  on complex linguistic tasks, such as linguistic knowledge
acquisition, semantic role labeling, textual entailment recognition, question
answering, document understanding/summarization and ontology learning.

The workshop is endorsed by SIGLEX, the ACL Special Interest Group on the 
Lexicon.

Topics of Interest
We invite submissions on any topic of current interest related to the
application of semantic spaces to NLP and related disciplines, such as:
- Document-based, Collocational and Syntagmatic spaces
- Eigenvector methods (e.g. Singular Value and Tucker Decomposition)
- Higher order tensors and Quantum Logic extensions
- Feature engineering in machine learning models
- Computational complexity and evaluation issues
- Graph-based models over semantic spaces
- Logic and inference in semantic spaces
- Psychological and cognitive theories of semantic space models
- Applications in the humanities and social sciences

We also especially encourage submissions on the empirical evaluation of the 
above computational models within the  following NLP tasks:
- Word sense disambiguation and discrimination
- Selectional preference induction
- Acquisition of lexicons and linguistic patterns
- Conceptual clustering
- Kernels methods for NLP (e.g. relation extraction and textual entailment)
- Quantitative extensions of Formal Concept Analysis
- Modeling of linguistic theories and ontological knowledge:

Submission Instructions
Authors are invited to submit papers on original, unpublished work in the topic
area of this workshop. In addition to long papers presenting completed work, we
also invite short papers and demos: 
- Long papers should present completed work and should not exceed 8 pages. 
- Short papers/demos can present work in progress or the description of a
system, and should not exceed 5 pages. 

As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. The papers
should not include the authors' names and affiliations or any references to web
sites, project names etc. revealing  the authors' identity.
Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided.  Each submission will be reviewed by at
least two members of the program committee.  Accepted papers will be published
in the workshop proceedings. 

All submissions are to be formatted using the EACL 2009 style files.
Submission will be electronic, via a web-service to be announced later. 
Please consult the Workshop web page for more details.
