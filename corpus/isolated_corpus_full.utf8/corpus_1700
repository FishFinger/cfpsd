ADCS 2007 Call for Papers
-------------------------------------

ADCS 2007 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
document management and information retrieval to meet and present their
work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document Computing --
issues ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and
standards for markup, through storage, management, retrieval,
authentication and workflow, to active and virtual documents. The
symposium will emphasize both commercial and academic issues by
encouraging a variety of submissions.

The Twelfth Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS 2007) will
be hosted at the Melbourne Zoo by the School of Computer Science and
Information Technology at the RMIT University on Monday 10 December,
2007. It will fall on the middle day of the 2007 Australasian Language
Technology Workshop (ALTW2007), which will also be held at The Zoo.
There will be a joint keynote speaker and dinner for both conferences on
Monday night.

Website

http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/~aht/adcs2007/index.html

Topics of interest

The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:

* Digital Librairies
* Document Databases
* Document Management
* Document Standards (XML, SGML etc)
* Document Workflow
* Information Retrieval
* Multimedia Document Management
* Multimedia Resource Discovery
* Personalised Documents

Important dates

Deadline for submissions: 8 October 2007 Notification of acceptance: 12
November 2007 Final version due: 19 November 2007
Symposium: 10 December 2007

Submissions

All the submissions must be sent to the Program chair Professor Amanda
Spink at adcs2007@rmit.edu.au.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should
the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the
symposium to present the work. Please note that it is insufficient for
an author to register and pay for the symposium to be regarded as
fulfilling his/her obligation.


Full papers

Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
issues. 
These papers should be at most 3000 words long. Please refer to the
guidelines for papers on the conference web page.

Posters, Short papers and Industry Status Reports

To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for work
of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short papers,
up to a maximum of 1500 words. A typical proposal might describe a
leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document management.
Short papers follow the same format as for full papers. The mode of
presentation of short papers is via a poster session. Accepted short
papers will be included in a separate section of the proceedings.

Demonstrations

If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please submit
an abstract following the same format as for full papers. Printed paper
proceedings will be distributed to participants at the symposium. 
Electronic copies of the papers will be made available on the website
after the symposium.
