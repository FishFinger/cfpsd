                        Final Call for Papers

   ------------------------------------------------------------
           Fifth Workshop on Constraint Handling Rules
                             CHR 2008

                           July 14, 2008
                         Hagenberg, Austria

          Co-located with the International Conference on
          Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA 2008)
    ------------------------------------------------------------

        http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/pm/research/events/chr2008

  Introduction
  ------------

  The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language has become a
  major declarative specification and implementation language for
  constraint reasoning algorithms and applications. Algorithms
  are often specified using inference rules, rewrite rules,
  sequents, proof rules or logical axioms that can be directly
  written in CHR.  Its clean semantics facilitates program
  design, analysis and transformation.  See the CHR website
  (http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/projects/CHR/) for more
  information.

  Previous Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules were organized in
  May 2004 in Ulm (Germany), in October 2005 in Sitges (Spain) at
  ICLP, in July 2006 in Venice (Italy) at ICALP, and in September
  2007 in Porto (Portgual) at ICLP.


  Topics of Interest
  ------------------

  The workshop calls for full papers and short papers describing
  ongoing work, on all aspects of CHR, including topics such as:

   - (Logical) Algorithms
   - Applications
   - Comparisons with Related Approaches
   - Constraint Solvers
   - Critical Assessment
   - Expressivity and Complexity
   - Implementations and Optimization
   - Language Extensions (Types, Modules)
   - Program Analysis
   - Program Transformation and Generation
   - Programming Environments (Debugging)
   - Programming Pearls
   - Retractable Constraints
   - Semantics
   - Programming Tools
   - Language Extensions (Debugging)


  Submission Information
  ----------------------

  All papers must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages
  in Springer LNCS format. The authors are encouraged, although
  not obliged, to submit their papers already in Springer LNCS
  format. General information about the Springer LNCS series and
  the LNCS authors' instructions are available at the Springer
  LNCS/LNAI home page.

  Submissions should be sent to chr2008@uni-ulm.de and mention
  'CHR 2008 Submission' in the subject. Every submission should
  include the names and e-mail addresses of the authors (with the
  corresponding author indicated), the paper abstract in ASCII format
  and the actual paper in postscript or PDF format. The submission
  should also indicate whether it is a full paper or a short paper.

  Accepted papers will be published in a technical report.
