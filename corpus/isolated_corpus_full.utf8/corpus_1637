The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories
December 7-8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway

http://tlt07.uib.no

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

The Sixth International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories 
will be held on December 7-8, 2007 in Bergen, Norway. Submissions are 
invited for papers, posters and demonstrations presenting high quality, 
previously unpublished research in the topics described below. 
Contributions should focus on results from completed as well as ongoing 
research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and 
perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or 
computational. Papers and poster abstracts will be published in paper 
as well as online proceedings.

Workshop motivation and aims

Treebanks are language resources that include annotations at levels of 
linguistic structure beyond the word level. They typically provide 
syntactic constituent or dependency structures for sentences and 
sometimes functional and predicate-argument structures. Treebanks have 
become crucially important for the development of data-driven 
approaches to natural language processing, human language technologies, 
grammar extraction and linguistic research in general. There are a 
number of ongoing projects aiming at compiling representative treebanks 
for specific languages. In addition, there are projects that develop 
tools or explore annotation beyond syntactic structure and beyond a 
single language.

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown that 
there is a relation between formal linguistic theory and the practice 
of syntactic annotation. Therefore the connection between treebank 
development and linguistic theories and paradigms merits attention.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and 
advanced students working in these areas. We encourage interested 
potential participants to read the proceedings of the previous 
workshops. See the webpage for links to previous workshops.

Workshop topics

The workshop invites submissions that discuss relevant innovative work 
in treebanking, including the relations and links between, and possibly 
merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and 
pragmatic annotation; furthermore, submissions describing work on 
parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation schemas, on the 
relation between linguistic theory and the practice of annotation, and 
on applications of information in treebanks are encouraged as well.

Invited speaker

An invited lecture will be presented by Julia Hockenmaier (University 
of Pennsylvania).
