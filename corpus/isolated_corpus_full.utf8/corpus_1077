    "Speech and language technology for less-resourced languages"

      Special Session at INTERSPEECH 2007, Antwerp, Belgium
     =20
                   www.interspeech2007.org

Speech and language technology researchers who work on less-resourced =
languages often have very limited access to funding, equipment and =
software. This makes it all the more important for them to come together =
to share best practice, in order to avoid a duplication of effort. This =
special session will therefore be devoted to speech and language =
technology for less-resourced languages.

In view of the limited resources available to the targeted researchers, =
there will be a particular emphasis on "free" software, which may be =
either open-source or closed-source. However, submissions are also =
invited from those using commercial software.

Topics may include (but are not limited to) the following:

    * Examples of systems built using free or purpose-built software =
(possibly with demonstrations).
    * Presentations of bugs in free software, and strategies for dealing =
with them.
    * Presentations of additions and enhancements made to the software =
by a research group.
    * Presentations of linguistic challenges for a particular =
less-resourced language.
    * Descriptions of desired features for possible future =
implementation.=20

Submission

Researchers who are interested in contributing to this special session =
are invited to submit either a paper or a demo or both, as follows.
