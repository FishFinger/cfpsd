=20
   =20
** OVERVIEW
=20
A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised=20
by the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA).=20
This event will be the fifth annual installment of the workshop in its=20
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop=20
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

The ALTA Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Australian=20
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues=20
ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards=20
for markup, through various aspects of document processing.=20

The goals of the workshop are:=20
=20
 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community=20
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;=20
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community=20
   and with the wider international LT community;=20
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;=20
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;=20
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research=20
   and projects;=20
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence=20
   community to become aware of local LT research;=20
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand=20
   and overseas.=20
=20
As with the 2006 Workshop, there will be poster presentations=20
in addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive

discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage=20
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any=20
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the=20
same status in the proceedings.
=20
** Topics
=20
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished=20
research on all aspects of natural language processing,=20

 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,=20
   and discourse;=20
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;=20
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;=20
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;=20
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;=20
