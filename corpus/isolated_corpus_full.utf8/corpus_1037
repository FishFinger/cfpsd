Call for papers: 

Lexicography discussion group session, MLA 2007, Chicago
150 Years of the OED

In 1857, the Philological Society of London decided to embark on a new
dictionary project. From its inception, the project was both a specialized,
philologically rigorous endeavor and a collaborative undertaking driven by
popular energy and national pride in the English language. It would grow beyond
the society's imaginings to become a hallmark of historical lexicography: the
Oxford English Dictionary. This session invites proposals that discuss the
historical construction, cultural reception, research applications, and/or
methodological considerations of the dictionary in its paper or electronic
editions. Abstracts by March 20 to Colette Moore (cvmoore@u.washington.edu).
