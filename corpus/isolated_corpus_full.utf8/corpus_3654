Meeting Description:

Converging and Diverging Evidence: Corpora and other (cognitive) phenomena?
Proposal for a workshop at the Corpus Linguistics Conference 2009, Liverpool,
20-23 July 2009
Dagmar Divjak (University of Sheffield) and Stefan Th. Gries (UCSB) 

Call for Papers

Over the last decade, it has become increasingly popular for (cognitive)
linguists who believe that language emerges from use to turn to corpora as a
source of authentic usage data (for an overview, see Gries & Stefanowitsch
2006). Recently, a trend has emerged to supplement such corpus analyses with
experimental data that presumably reflect aspects of cognitive representation
and/or processing (more) directly. If converging evidence is obtained, the
cognitive claims made on the basis of corpus data are supported (Gries et al.
2005, to appear; Grondelaers & Speelman 2007; Divjak & Gries 2008; D?browska in
press) and the status of corpora a legitimate means to explore cognition is
strengthened. Yet, recently, diverging evidence has been made available, too:
frequency data collected from corpora sometimes make predictions that conflict
with those made by experimental data (cf. Arppe&Järvikivi 2007, McGee to appear,
Nordquist 2006, to appear) or do not quite as reliably approximate theoretical
concepts from cognitive linguistics such as prototypicality and entrenchment as
one would have hoped (cf. Gilquin 2006; Divjak to appear; Gries to appear;
Wiechmann to appear). This crushes hopes that the linguistic properties of texts
produced by speakers can reveal the way linguistic knowledge is represented in
their heads.

In this workshop, we want to focus on the question to what degree corpora can
(or should) be up to the task of predicting cognitive phenomena. Despite the
importance attributed to frequency in contemporary linguistics, the relationship
between frequencies of occurrence in texts on the one hand, and status or
structure in cognition as reflected in experiments on the other hand has not
been studied in great detail, and hence remains poorly understood. It is the aim
of this workshop to explore the relationship between certain aspects of language
and their representation in cognition as mediated by frequency counts in both
text and experiment. Do certain types of experimental data fit certain types of
corpus data better than they fit others? Which established corpus-derived
statistics correlate best with experimental results? Or should corpus data be
analyzed radically differently, i.e. by means of advanced multifactorial
techniques, in order to make them reveal the wealth of cognitive information
they (might) contain?

For this workshop we invite papers that report on converging as well as
diverging evidence between corpus data and experimental data and interpret the
implications of this from a cognitive-linguistic or psycholinguistic
perspective. Contributions from all domains (e.g., language acquisition,
processing, or representation) and linguistic subdisciplines (phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) will be considered.

Meeting Description:

An international conference at the University of California, Los Angeles on the
languages of Southeast Asia

January 30-February 1, 2009

This conference aims to bridge the gap between linguists research languages of
Southeast Asia and specialists in Southeast Asian area studies. By providing a
forum for presentations of new research and the exchange of ideas, we aim to
create fresh conversations between scholars and teachers of Southeast Asian
languages.  Building on the 2000 UCLA Conference on Heritage Language Research
Priorities, we also hope to stimulate new research linkages with scholars and
teachers working among Heritage language communities. 

Second Call for Papers

UCLA - UC Berkeley Joint Conference on Southeast Asian Studies
"Languages of Southeast Asia"
University of California, Los Angeles
January 30-February 1, 2009

Keynote speakers: Bernard Comrie (Max Planck Institute / UC Santa Barbara)
Andrew Simpson (University of Southern California) John Hartmann (Northern
Illinois University)

The linguistic map of Southeast Asia is extraordinarily rich, embracing a wide
range of ethnic and typological groups, including Austronesian, Hmong-Mien,
Mon-Khmer, Tai-Kadai, Tibeto-Burman, and the many language families of New
Guinea. The shifting boundaries of Southeast Asian polities over time, historic
cross-regional migration, and colonization have all added to the complexity of
language genealogies in the region, making Southeast Asia a particularly fertile
field not only for the study of specific language types and groups but also for
the testing and development of theoretical frameworks and models of linguistic
analysis. Recent outward migrations to the US, Europe and elsewhere, and the
concomitant rise in Hmong, Khmer, Lao, Tagalog and other heritage language
groups, present further opportunities for the study of Southeast Asian languages.

Despite the critical place of language studies in the development of area
studies, and the diverse implications and applications of linguistics for other
fields, the conversation between scholars of Southeast Asian linguistics and
specialists in Southeast Asian area studies is surprisingly thin. And, within
the U.S., Southeast Asian language communities such as Hmong, Khmer, Vietnamese,
Lao and Tagalog risk being sidelined in the emerging body of scholarship on
Heritage Language learning and teaching, whose focus gravitates towards larger
communities such as Spanish and Chinese speaking communities.

This conference aims to bridge this gap. By providing a forum for presentations
of new research and the exchange of ideas, we aim to create fresh conversations
between scholars and teachers of Southeast Asian languages.  Building on the
2000 UCLA Conference on Heritage Language Research Priorities, we also hope to
stimulate new research linkages with scholars and teachers working among
Heritage language communities.

We invite papers on Southeast Asian languages in any area of
linguistics­phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
typology, diachronic and comparative linguistics, sociolinguistics,
anthropological linguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis or
language teaching. We particularly encourage papers that engage with other
disciplines. Submissions from early career researchers and graduate students are
strongly encouraged. In addition, a special poster session for undergraduate
research will be held. Limited competitive financial assistance for travel is
available.

Abstracts of no more than 500 words should be sent to the UCLA Center for
Southeast Asian Studies <cseas@international.ucla.edu> by Monday, November 3,
2008. Include name, affiliation and full contact information. Please indicate
whether the submission is for a talk or for the undergraduate poster session.
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by December 1, 2008.

The Center for Southeast Asian Studies at UCLA and the Center for Southeast Asia
Studies at UC Berkeley are a consortium U.S. Department of Education Title VI
National Resource Center for Southeast Asian Studies.
