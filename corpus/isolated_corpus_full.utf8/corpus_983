The conference is organized by the Institute of Formal and Applied
Linguistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in
Prague ("Univerzita Karlova v Praze"), Czech Republic, the oldest
University in Europe north of the Alps (founded in 1348).

The conference will take place in the TOP HOTEL Praha, located in the
quiet neighborhood of the Prague 4 district, only 15-20 minutes from the
historic center of Prague. The hotel can accommodate up to 1000
participants on-site (with a small number of dormitory rooms available
nearby). The hotel offers one auditorium, three large lecture rooms,
number of smaller rooms for tutorials and workshops, several restaurants
and cafes and lot of open air space for walks and informal discussions.
The conference banquet and a conference concert will take place in the
historic buildings in the city center -- one in the Municipal Hall
(built in the Art-nouveau style of the early 20th century) and the other
in the 14th century main University Hall.

lexical semantics and ontologies; word segmentation, tagging and
chunking; parsing; generation and summarization; language modeling,
spoken language recognition and understanding; linguistic, psychological
and mathematical models of language; document retrieval, question
answering, information extraction, and text mining; machine learning for
natural language; corpus-based modeling of language, discourse and
dialogue; multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation
aids; multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and to receive feedback both from the
general audience and from selected panelists -- experienced researchers
who prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the
presentation.

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop.
As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis
is on work in progress. Original and unpublished research is therefore
invited on all aspects of computational linguistics including, but
not limited to, the following topic areas:

- pragmatics and discourse
- semantics and lexicons
- syntax and grammars
- phonetics, phonology, and morphology
- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language
- information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering
- summarization and paraphrasing
- speech recognition and speech synthesis
- corpus-based language modeling
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids
- spoken and written natural language interfaces and dialogue systems
- multi-modal language processing and multimedia systems
- narrative understanding systems

For further information regarding requirements, reviewing, formatting
and submission details, see the conference web site:

Travel Grants:

Some funding will be available for students whose work is accepted to
the Student Research Workshop. For more information about travel
