Call for Participation

   ICCL Summer School 2008
   
   COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE	
   
   Technische Universität Dresden
   August 24 -- September 6, 2008

   http://www.computational-logic.org/iccl-ss-2008


TOPIC
 
  The summer academy will focus on the long-lasting controversy of the
  relationship between modern formal logic (including its use for
  automated reasoning and computation) and, on the other hand, the
  rationality and common sense underlying human reasoning.
  Traditionally, a huge gap is perceived between the symbolic
  representation of knowledge used in modern logic and the
  sub-symbolic representation considered dominant in human reasoning.
  Psychological experiments of the past even suggested that people
  often don't reason logically and, in general, that logic seems to
  play only a minor role in human reasoning.  However, recently, new
  ways of explaining human reasoning seem to revive its relatedness to
  logic.  For this reason this summer academy attempts to bring
  together researchers from both sides for an exchange of views.


REGISTRATION  
 
   If you want to attend the summer school, we'd prefer that
   you register by April 1, 2008. 
   (See the online registration on the web page mentioned
   above.) 
   For all who want to apply for a grant, this deadline is
   obligatory. 
   After April 1, 2008, registration will be possible as
   long as there are vacant places.    
   (Since we intend to restrict participation to about 60
   people, in case of excessive demand, we will have to
   close the registration to the summer school.)

   People applying until April 1, 2008, and applying for a
   grant will be informed about respective decisions on
   grants at latest by end of April 2008.
   
   
FEES  

   We ask for a participation fee of 200 EUR. 


GRANTS

   A limited number of grants may be available, please indicate
   in your application if the only possibility for you to
   participate is via a grant. Applications for grants must
   include an estimate of travel costs (to be filled in the
   respective part of the online registration form).
   

INTEGRATED WORKSHOP

   It will be possible for some participants to present their research
   work during a small workshop integrated in the summer school. If
   you would like to do so, please register by means of the online
   workshop registration form on the web page mentioned above: (The
   title of your proposed talk, and, in addition, an extended abstract
   or a full paper of at most 10 pages in postscript or pdf format
   must be submit by April 1, 2008.)
   
   A program committee consisting of the summer school lecturers will
   select among the submissions.
   
   Notification of acceptance of a talk at the integrated workshop
   will be at latest by end of April 2008.

   Please note that participation at the summer school is a
   prerequisite for participation at the workshop.
