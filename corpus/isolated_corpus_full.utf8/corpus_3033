Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition (PsychoCompLA-2008)

July 23rd at CogSci 2008  - Washington, D.C.

Submission Deadline: June 15, 2008

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated computational models o=
f =

language acquisition. That is, models that are compatible with research in =

psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics. =


Invited Speakers:

* Rens Bod, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of
            Amsterdam, Netherlands
* Damir Cavar, University of Indiana, USA and Zadar University, Croatia
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Jeffery Lidz, University of Maryland, USA
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Josh Tenenbaum, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA

Workshop History:  =


This is the fourth meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human Langu=
age =

Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, held in Geneva, Switzerla=
nd =

as part of the 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics =

(COLING-2004), PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the =

Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in Ann Arbor, =

Michigan where the workshop shared a joint session with the Ninth Conferenc=
e =

on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), and PsychoCompLA-2=
007 =

held in Nashville, Tennessee as part of the 29th meeting of the Cognitive =

Science Society (CogSci-2007).


Workshop Description:

The workshop will present research and foster discussion centered around =

psychologically-motivated computational models of language acquisition, wit=
h =

an emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades there has been =
a =

thriving research agenda that applies computational learning techniques to =

emerging natural language technologies and many meetings, conferences and =

workshops in which to present such research. However, there have been only =
a =

few (but growing number of) venues in which psychocomputational models of h=
ow =

humans acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus. =

Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular intere=
st =

in light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest that ve=
ry =

young infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an audible inp=
ut =

stream. Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical 'machinery' =
to =

the task of grammar acquisition, with or without an innate language compone=
nt, =

remains an open and important question. One effective line of investigation=
 is =

to computationally model the acquisition process and determine =

interrelationships between a model and linguistic or psycholinguistic theor=
y, =

and/or correlations between a model's performance and data from linguistic =

environments that children are exposed to. =


Special Theme:

Although the workshop program speaks to many facets of psychocomputational =

language acquisition modeling, the theme of the workshop this year is: =


* Computational resources: How much is just right, and does it matter? =


The computational resources (e.g., number of calculations per input datum, =

size of memory store, etc.) employed by current psychocomputational modelin=
g =

efforts vary tremendously from model to model. However, two important =

questions have rarely been addressed. How well do a particular acquisition =

model's resources parallel the resources employed by a human language learn=
er? =

And, how relevant (or not) is it to establish such a relationship? =


Topics and Goals:

Abstracts that present research on (but not necessarily limited =

to) the following topics are welcome:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that =

incorporate psychologically plausible constraints; =

* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported =

studies; =

* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
* Models that address learning bias in terms of innate =

linguistic knowledge versus statistical regularity in the =

input;
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus =

linguistics;
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
* Models of language change and its effect on language =

acquisition or vice versa;
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing =

linguistic or developmental theories (e.g., principles & =

parameters, optimality theory, construction grammar, etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such =

as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from cognitive psycholo=
gy, =

computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical sciences, linguistic=
s =

and psycholinguistics working on all areas of language acquisition. Diversi=
ty =

and cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal. =

Submission details:

Authors are invited to submit abstracts of 1 page plus 1 page for data and =

Publication:

The accepted abstracts will appear in the online workshop proceedings. Full =

papers of accepted abstracts will be considered in Fall 2008 for inclusion =
in =

an issue of the new Cognitive Science Society Journal - topiCS - whose focu=
s =
