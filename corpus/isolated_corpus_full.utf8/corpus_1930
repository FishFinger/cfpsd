CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS:

GLOBENG: International Conference on Global English.
February 14 - 16 2008  - University of  Verona, Italy

website: http://profs.lingue.univr.it/globeng/index.html


The Department of English Studies of the University of Verona is proud to a=
nnounce GlobEng: International Conference on Global English.
The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of res=
earch discussing issues related to the role of English as a global language=
.

The debate over the status of English as an International language has flou=
rished over the past few decades and is still open to new developments.
Starting from the awareness of the undisputedly prominent role of English a=
s a Lingua Franca in international communication, the fact that native spea=
kers are currently a minority, compared to second-language users of the lan=
guage, has been repeatedly highlighted.
The changing status of English has led to the emergence of a new linguistic=
 scenery. On the one hand, the native varieties have become highly differen=
tiated and acquired greater autonomy, while on the other, the rapid growth =
of a community of non-native speakers, thanks to increasing international e=
xchanges, has triggered a reflection on the possible rise of a new Internat=
ional English, as opposed to the current native varieties.

A wide range of issues are brought to the fore in this connection, especial=
ly focusing on the possible evolution of the current scenario, both in Euro=
pe and in the rest of the world, with a reflection on (and a possible revis=
ion of) the notion of Standard, and the crucial implications that prospecti=
ve developments might have on English Language Teaching (ELT).

The programme includes plenary lectures by renowned scholars in the field, =
such as David Crystal, Adrian Holliday, Jennifer Jenkins, Alan Maley, Barba=
ra Seidlhofer, and Simon Sweeney.



Papers are encouraged which address the following topics:

- Pronunciation models: new vs. standard
- Implications of new morphosyntactic models
- Semantic and pragmatic implications of globalising English
- Cultures, media and globalisation
- Identities and international communication
- Language policies in the European Community
- English and other languages in the classroom
- The teaching of English as a foreign/second language and as a specialised=
 language
- Terminological issues and new taxonomies


Contributions are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus discussion). Ab=
stracts should not exceed 300 words in length (references excluded). They s=
hould be anonymous and should be sent as email attachments (preferably in p=
df format or rtf) to:=20
