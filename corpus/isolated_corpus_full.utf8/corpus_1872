Meeting Description:

The conference continues the tradition of annual meetings of teachers and
researchers in the area of phonetics and phonology of English in Poland. In
connection with the main theme of the conference, the major aim is to
stimulate the exchange of ideas between specialists in the field of native
accent variability and non-native speech, including linguistic,
socio-linguistic and pedagogical aspects of accent studies in native and
non-native speakers. The main topics for the conference are the following:

-        native accents of English

-        non-native accents of English

-        native- non-native accent continuum

-        model accents for English teaching

-        accents and Lingua Franca Core

-        variability in spoken language

-        methodology of accent studies

-        teaching English pronunciation

The list of topics is by no means exclusive, as we hope to provoke
discussion on a variety of issues related to the application of accent
studies to second and foreign language learning and teaching. 

The extended deadline for abstract submission is September 15, 2007. Please
send abstracts of about 500 words  to accents@uni.lodz.pl. An abstract
should also include the name, affiliation of the author, and the intended
type of presentation: paper (20 minutes + 10 minutes for discussion),
workshop (45 minutes) or poster presentation). After the process of
peer-revision, e-mail notifications will be sent out by  October 15, 2007
