Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 25-Dec-2009 

Meeting Description:

The organizing committee of the 3rd International ELT conference "Telling ELT Tales out of School" would like to invite practicing teachers, teacher educators and teacher researchers to share their tales about learners, learning, teachers, teaching, and innovative practices in their contexts.

Since ELT has been one of the major concerns of Applied Linguistics, we believe that our conference, specifically its subthemes related to learner language, teacher language and multiple literacies, will be of particular interest to linguists, who have much to say to language teachers.

Themes: 

Maximizing Learning:

-Learner-centered Instruction
-Learning Process
-Learning Outcomes
-Individual Learner Differences
-Learner Autonomy/Independence
-Learner Language/Interlanguage
-Learner strategies

Empowering Teachers:

-Teaching Strategies
-Teacher Training
-Professional Development
-Teacher Talk
-Teacher Motivation

Exploiting Resources:

-Curriculum/Syllabus Design
-ELT Management
-Materials/Aids/Realia
-Information and Communication
-Technology (ICT)
-Common European Framework
-Corpora in Language Education

Fostering Cultural Awareness:

-English and Englishes
-English as a Lingua Franca
-Cross-cultural Awareness
-Critical Thinking Skills
-Multiple Literacies 

Call for Papers:

On behalf of the ELT Department of Education Faculty at the Eastern Mediterranean University, we would like to invite you to tell ELT "tales out of your school", to share tales from different settings, learners and teachers, as well as e-tales about innovative practice in your context. We genuinely believe that at our convention we will all learn lessons from these tales about maximizing learning, empowering teaching, exploiting resources and fostering cultural awareness.
