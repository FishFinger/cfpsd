Paper Submission

We welcome submissions from both research and industrial communities addressing the main conference themes.
Submitted papers must describe an unpublished origal work, emphasizing completed or advanced research, possibly with releted experiments. A parallel submission to other venues should be clearly indicated to the program committee.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. The submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation.
Papers can be submitted in two categories: full papers and short papers, where full papers are appropriate for describing substantial research with related evaluations and short papers will typically describe ongoing research and preliminary results. All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.
Long papers must not exceed 12 pages (5000 words), in one column format, starting with an abstract. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (2500 words), in one column, starting with an abstract.
Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.
The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees, and through the CID after the conference.



CALL FOR APPLICATIONS

The RIAO conferences are meeting places for both scientific and industrial specialists in information retrieval.
The facilities allow to present high-level peer-reviewed scientific research conferences and prototypes and of innovative products, selected by a special call for innovative applications. The displayed products 
are chosen uniquely on the basis of their innovativeness. The general topic of the Call for Applications is:

INNOVATIVE TOOLS PROVIDING PERSONNALIZED ACCESS TO MULTIMEDIA AND/OR 
MULTILINGUAL DATA.

Companies whose product fulfills the criteria of novelty and of innovativeness can fill in a submission document designed by the conference organizers that describes their submitted product. In addition to the submission document, product submitters will have to provide access to an online or CD version of the product that demonstrates the claimed innovative functionalities of the product.
Every chosen company will be provided with a demonstration space (including table and chair) free of charge. Each company may also be given a special time slot (15 minutes) to give a short presentation 
about the product. Descriptions of the products demonstrated during RIAO 2010 will be published in the proceedings. The selected companies will also be invited to an event organized with Cap Digital business cluster 
(http://www.capdigital.com) providing B2B meetings with top members of the cluster followed by a networking event at La Cantine coworking space
