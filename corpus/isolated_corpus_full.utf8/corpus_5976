Meeting Description:

The International Linguistic Association (ILA), a professional organization=
 founded in October 1943 as the Linguistic Circle of New York, is devoted t=
o the study of all areas of linguistics and their roles in society.=20

Call for Papers:

Teachers and students are invited to submit abstracts for papers for the 55=
th annual conference to be held in conjunction with the American Dialect So=
ciety=97Northeast region, at the State University of New York at New Paltz,=
 April 15-17, 2010.

Papers in any area of linguistics are appropriate; however, the theme of th=
is year's conference is 'dialects' (regional or social). Periodically, the =
ILA has held conferences on this topic in the past. The study of dialect as=
 a major field in linguistics has been developing for nearly 400 years. Tho=
mas Jefferson recognized the importance of language change as an integral p=
art of society; Thomas Pickering wrote in the second decade of the 19th cen=
tury of what he found odd in American speech. Bloomfield, Sapir, the Grimms=
, Bloch, Kurath, Cassidy, and more recently Hall, Preston, Labov, and Wolfr=
am, to name but a few, have furthered the study of dialect. In a distinctiv=
e setting where American Indian languages, Dutch, French, German, English a=
nd just about every other language of people settling in the early colonies=
 coexisted and blended for centuries, this conference will facilitate furth=
er exchange in the subject.

Please submit proposals (400 word maximum) for individual papers to be rece=
ived no later than January 15, 2010. Proposals for panels or poster session=
s must include topics and a summary for each speaker. Proposals should be a=
ppropriate for publication in the meeting program.

Send proposals to abstracts@ilaword.org The word "Abstract" must be include=
d in the subject line of the e-mail message. Authors of submissions will be=
 notified of acceptance by February 15, 2010.

Presenters are expected to be current members of either ILA or ADS. Submiss=
ions for papers from ADS members will be considered for presentation in the=
 ADS session(s). ADS and ILA members will be admitted to all conference ses=
sions, plenary sessions, and events but must submit to the ILA registration=
 fee.
