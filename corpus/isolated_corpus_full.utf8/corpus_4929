Meeting Description:

Amsterdam Graduate Philosophy Conference 2009
Department of Philosophy - ILLC
Universiteit van Amsterdam
1-3 October 2009 

Call for Papers

Theme: Meaning & Truth
The conference is dedicated to exploring new ideas on what has been and remains
a fundamental theme in the philosophy of language, namely, the relation between
meaning and truth. We invite papers from young researchers who have an original
contribution to make regarding the role of truth in a theory of meaning, the
role of meaning in a theory of truth, or even the question of whether meaning
and truth are actually related in an interesting way. 

The conference is motivated by the ongoing debates and discussions that pose 
new challenges on how to conceive of meaning and of truth, and the relation 
between them. Some areas of interest here include: truth-functional vs. proof-
theoretic semantics; semantic theories of truth; the role of context in
interpretation; semantic normativity; deflationism; meaning as use;
inferentialism; compositionality; vagueness; the semantics-pragmatics interface;
language evolution.

Confirmed Invited Speakers
- Kathrin Glüer-Pagin (Stockholm)
- Alex Miller (Birmingham)
- Peter Pagin (Stockholm)
- François Recanati (Paris / St Andrews)
- Martin Stokhof (Amsterdam)

Submission Information
We invite submissions in the form of short papers (not longer than 4000 words) 
accompanied by short abstracts (not longer than 500 words). The deadline for 
submission is June 10 and it should follow the on-line submission form,
available on the conference website. Candidates eligible for submission are
graduate students and those who have completed a doctoral dissertation within
the last three years. 

Successful candidates will be allotted a 45-minute time slot, comprising of a
25-minute presentation, a short commentary by an appointed speaker and 
discussion with the audience. Candidates will be notified by July 15 of whether
their paper has been accepted for presentation. The speakers will have the
chance to send a revised version of their paper, as well as a revised version of
their abstract for publication in the conference book of abstracts.

Please note that submitting an abstract does not automatically count as
registration for the conference. Those who wish to participate must formally

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
