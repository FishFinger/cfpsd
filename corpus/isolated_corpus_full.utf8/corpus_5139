	   GL2009: Generative Lexicons: From Theory to Implementation
    5th International Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon

			  Second Call for Papers

		  ILC-CNR, Pisa, Italy, Sept. 17-19 2009

			  http://www.gl2009.org/


The goal of the GL conferences is to bring together diverse
contributions from theoretical and computational linguistics, computer
science, cognitive science, and lexicography, which explore
compositionality from the point of view of generative approaches to
the lexicon.  Historically, contributions have assumed, as a starting
point, the view outlined in Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky,
1995, 2001). This year's GL conference  will be in a new format,
combining both an open call for papers and a workshop on semantic
annotation.

The conference will be held over a period of three days and will be
organized as a combination of technical paper presentations and
posters, break-out sessions, and keynote lectures. The first day will
be devoted to the annotation workshop and the second day to conference
papers. The final day will be dedicated to the presentation of results
from the workshop and an open discussion of remaining issues.

The workshop and the open discussion are jointly supported by the
EC-FLaReNet and the NSF-SILT projects, with the goal of identifying
common future directions of research.

This conference is endorsed by the following ACL Special Interest Groups:
	SIGANN, SIGSEM, and SIGLEX (pending).



* IMPORTANT DATES

Papers due: June 1, 2009
Acceptance notice: July 1, 2009
Camera-ready version due: August 1, 2009
Conference: Sept. 17-19, 2009



* INVITED SPEAKERS

Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO USA
Johan Bos, University of Roma La Sapienza, Italy
Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh, UK
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA



* TOPICS


Track 1: Open conference


Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Polysemy and sense shifting
- Co-compositionality and creation of new word senses
- Type coercion and argument selection phenomena
- Argument realization: mapping from lexicon to syntax
- Cognitive foundations for semantic categories
- The trade-off between pragmatics and lexical knowledge
- Presupposition and commonsense knowledge
- Underspecification and word sense disambiguation

These topics can be approached from either a theoretical or
computational perspective. Computational issues relating to the above
phenomena include:

- Automatic knowledge acquisition
- Computational models of compositional phenomena
- Robust semantic annotation
- Evaluation of algorithms and annotation schemes



Track 2: Semantic Annotation Workshop


The annotation workshop will address general issues in the
identification and markup of semantic content in text.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Compositional mechanisms of argument selection and coercion
- Named entity classification including named entities, events, and
temporal and spatial expressions
- Lexical substitution
- Metonymy resolution
- Textual entailment
- Word sense disambiguation
- Semantic role labelling
- Qualia in argument selection and modification constructions
- Type selection in modification of dot objects (complex types)
- Annotation environments and tools


The workshop is intended to provide feedback and training for the
upcoming 2010 SemEval tasks, with a special focus on the "Argument
Selection and Coercion" task, which deals with identifying the
compositional operations involved in argument selection by a
predicate.



* SUBMISSION INFORMATION


GL2009 will be using EasyChair for electronic submission.  All papers
should be submitted using the following website:

    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgl2009

Please indicate whether your submission is intended for the open call
or for the workshop. The final submission deadline is June 1, 2009
11:59 EST.

All submissions must be in PDF and must follow the two-column format.
The maximum length of a manuscript is eight (8) pages. Submissions
must be anonymized, i.e. no author information should be included, and
obvious self-references should be avoided.  Please use the ACL style
guidelines, as specified here:

    http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/paperformat.html

Regular and poster papers should follow the same guidelines.  The
appropriate presentation format will be determined at the time of
acceptance.



* AUTHOR SUPPORT

A limited number of fellowships to student authors travelling from the
U.S.will be available to offset the cost of travel if the paper is
accepted.
