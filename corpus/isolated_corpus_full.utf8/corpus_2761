Call for Papers
---------------
This year, the 13th International Conference on Applications of Natural =

Language to Information Systems
(NLDB 2008) is organizing a Doctoral Symposium. This is intended to encoura=
ge =

Ph.D. students, or those
who intend to apply for a Ph.D. studentship, in the area of Natural Languag=
e =

Processing and Management
as related to Information Systems, to share and discuss their research =

proposals, research direction
and methodology under the guidance of a panel of leading academics in Compu=
ter =

Science and
Information Systems. It will also provide an opportunity to liaise and netw=
ork =

with other doctoral
students, researchers and academics.

Contributions are welcome in all topics covered by NLDB 2008:

http://www.wmin.ac.uk/page-14805


Submissions
-----------
In order to present at the symposium, Ph.D. students should submit a paper =

describing their research proposal
and direction of their work. The paper should not exceed 4 pages in PDF or =

Postscript format. The paper should
be formatted according to the LNCS formatting guidelines, since we intend t=
o =

include accepted papers in the
proceedings to be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series=
 of =

publications by Springer-Verlag.

In contrast to regular conference papers, submissions to this Doctoral =

Symposium should clearly address:

   * The motivation behind the proposed research
   * A clear formulation of the research problem to be solved
   * An outline of the current knowledge of the problem domain, by
     briefly citing and describing any existing solutions
   * A proposed methodology and any preliminary ideas and results
     achieved so far
   * The aspired contributions of the current proposal

Similar to a Ph.D. thesis, only a single author is allowed per submission t=
o =

the symposium.
The Ph.D. advisor is not stated as co-author but should be separately menti=
oned =

as a footnote
in the first page of the paper attached on the title of the paper.


Submission Procedure
---------------------
Ph.D. students should submit their research paper via the paper submission =
and =

reviewing system at:
http://www.nldb.org or by sending an email to the organisers:

Georgia Koutrika, Stanford University, USA: koutrika@stanford.edu
Anastassia Angelopoulou, University of Westminster, UK: agelopa@wmin.ac.uk
