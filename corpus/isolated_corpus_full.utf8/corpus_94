Workshop on the Integration of Heterogeneous, Interactive Systems
21. Sept 2005, Bonn, Germany (together with Informatik 2005)

Call for Papers

Description:
In contrast to the tremendous increase of information generation and 
distribution, there is a lack of precise working-means that sight 
available informatio
n flexibly, under the consideration of the context and with respect to 
its relevance for the user. However, there is a need for means that can 
interpret,
analyze and pre-process relevant information. The mass of information 
that users have to examine in order to separate relevant from irrelevant 
information
in a time-consuming process increases constantly. This goes along with 
the risk of a decreasing efficiency of information systems.

Overview of the topics:
The efficiency of information systems can be significantly improved if 
these systems are equipped with components that use semantics-based 
methods in order
to evaluate, to interpret and to classify information automatically and 
that prepare and present the information according to the users demands. 
At prese
nt, the efforts toward the development of such components still stand at 
the beginning. However, they came in focus in connection with the 
considerations
to the "Semantic Web". Concrete realization of these components and 
their integration into IT-systems will sharpen the understanding of 
problems and solut
ions that are connected with the development of these components. An 
exchange of experiences learned from prototypical developments and the 
final realizat
ions of the components as well as of their integration into IT-systems 
thus promises a beneficial insights regarding semantics-based IT 
components. Contri
butions for the workshop should take this to its reference.

The following aspects are thereby of special interest:
 Automatic generation of semantic contexts
 Data integration and semantic web
 Information retrieval in connection with semantic contexts
 Context sensitive user support
 Development, use and fusion of ontologies
 Interoperability of heterogeneous information systems
 Information extraction in connection with natural language
 Use of ontological components in dialogue systems


Addressees:
The workshop is designed for computational linguists, operators, 
developers and researchers in the area of interactive information 
systems that execute ana
lysis processes in a better quality or support a higher level of 
interoperability with other information systems due to the application 
of semantic compone
nts. Participants will obtain the opportunity to gather and exchange 
information about projects and trends as well as technologies and 
methods in a field
of interest with a rapidly growing relevance.

Schedule:
12.05.2005 Due for contributions (extended deadline, send to the 
workshop organisation)
27.05.2005 Notification (acceptance/refusal)
24.06.2005 Issue of finished manuscripts (send to the workshop organisation)


Contributions:
Contributions of maximally 5 pages extent are accepted. The 
contributions have to be sent by the 29th of April 2005 in electronic 
form as a pdf file to wu
nder@fgan.de (reference: "GI Workshop"). Submitted contributions are 
carefully examined by the program committee. Accepted articles are 
published in the
GI edition "Lecture Notes in Informatics". Please consider absolutely 
and already during the first submission the author guidelines of the GI 
edition: "Le
cture Notes in Informatics", to be found under 
www.gi-ev.de/LNI/autorenrichtlinien/index.html .
At least one authors of each contribution has to register at the 
conference and is expected to be present at the workshop for the whole time.

Workshop-languages are German and English.
