                       CALL for PAPERS

                     ACL 2007 Workshop on

                EMBODIED LANGUAGE PROCESSING

                       Thursday,28th June, 2007
                    Prague, Czech Republic

              http://ctsb.northwestern.edu/ELP/

*********************************************************

Workshop Description

There has been a growing interest within the ACL community in extending
the traditional focus on text and speech beyond the confines of natural
language towards the inclusion of paralinguistic and non-verbal modes of
communication, and beyond the confines of task-oriented language towards
the inclusion of social and psychological variables such as attitude and
affect. Studies of embodied dialogue systems, emotional expressiveness
in speech, and personality detection in text are just a few examples of
such research. These new extensions to computational linguistics have
found a home in a number of different applications, from analysis of
military videos to the development of Ambient Intelligent applications,
where natural modes of interaction between humans and machines are
envisioned that exploit the full bandwidth of human communication.

These studies in embodied language processing have close connections
with other fields of inquiry such as Affective Computing and Embodied
Conversational Agents. In all of these fields the many modalities
through which we communicate besides language, such as facial
expressions, gestures, posture, play a prominent role. These and other
related studies of nonverbal language processing offer complementary
insights to traditional work in computational linguistics.
After all, human-human communication is inherently multimodal, and
unimodal spoken communication is really just an artifact of
communications technology, specifically the telephone ... so surely the
mechanisms of speech and language processing need to apply not just to
word sequences but to natural (multimodal) human language distributed
over multiple input streams (speech, hand gesture, gaze ...).  It is
increasingly clear that integrating the theories, models and algorithms
developed in areas such as these with work in mainstream CL, will lead
to a richer processing model of natural communication.=20


Target Audience

Various and dispersed communities are pursuing the embodied language
processing programme, each from its own perspective, background and
interests. The aim of this workshop is to seek points of possible
integration, i.e. to facilitate cross-overs, and to set a research
program for the next several years.

Besides participants from the ACL community working on these topics, we
would therefore like to invite individuals concerned with these same
issues but who tend to present their work in other communities
(affective computing, intelligent virtual agents, for instance).


Areas of Interest

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* The automatic analysis of nonverbal or paralinguistic information.
* Generation of nonverbal or paralinguistic information.
* Analysis and synthesis of attitude and affect in verbal, nonverbal
  and paralinguistic forms of interaction
* Data collection, construction of corpora, methodology, evaluation.

Issues to be addressed could include

* How do we relate the representation of nonverbal and paraverbal
information to traditional linguistic representations?
* What is the role of social and psychological variables in linguistics?
* How do algorithms for analyzing and generating non-symbolic forms of
communication (iconic gestures, for instance) differ from the symbolic
signs in natural language?



Submission Information

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the state of
completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with
previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will
be judged on correctness, innovation, technical strength, clarity of
presentation, generalizability, and significance/relevance to the
workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL 2007
main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages,
including references. We strongly recommend the use of either the LaTeX
style file or the Microsoft-Word Style file, which can be found at
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self- citations and other
references that could reveal the author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no later than March 26,
2007 using the submission webpage
http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS14/submit.html.

Submissions will be reviewed by 2 members of the Program Committee.
Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding how to
produce camera-ready versions of their papers for inclusion in the ACL
workshop proceedings.

Notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author.


Important Dates

Paper submission deadline: 26 March 2007 Acceptance notification sent:
