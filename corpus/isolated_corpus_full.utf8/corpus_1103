                   CALL FOR PAPERS

                      FG-2007:
         The 12th Conference on Formal Grammar
    http://www.dei.unipd.it/~fgrammar/fg/current.html

            Dublin, Ireland, August 4-5, 2007

         Collocated with the European Summer School
              in Logic, Language and Information=20



Background

FG-2007 is the 12th conference on Formal Grammar, to be held in
conjunction with the European Summer School in Logic, Language and
Information, which takes place in 2007 in Dublin, Ireland.=20

Previous Formal Grammar meetings were held in Barcelona (1995),
Prague (1996), Aix-en-Provence (1997), Saarbruecken (1998), Utrecht
(1999), Helsinki (2001), Trento (2002), Vienna (2003), Nancy (2004),
Edinburgh (2005) and Malaga (2006).=20


Aims and Scope

FG provides a forum for the presentation of new and original research
on formal grammar, mathematical linguistics and the application of
formal and mathematical methods to the study of natural language.=20
Themes of interest include, but are not limited to,

o formal and computational phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics
 and pragmatics;
o model-theoretic and proof-theoretic methods in linguistics;
o logical aspects of linguistic structure;=20
o constraint-based and resource-sensitive approaches to grammar;
o learnability of formal grammar;
o integration of stochastic and symbolic models of grammar;
o foundational, methodological and architectural issues in grammar;=20
o mathematical foundations of statistical approaches to linguistic
 analysis.

Previous conferences in this series have welcomed papers from a wide
variety of frameworks.


Submission Details

We invite **electronic** submissions of original, unpublished 30-minute
papers (including questions, comments, and discussion). Papers should
report original work which was not presented in other conferences.
However, simultaneous submission is allowed, provided that the authors
indicate other conference to which the work was submitted on the paper
submission form. Of course, accepted papers can only be presented in
one of the venues.=20

Papers, written in English, should be **anonymous** and refrain from
self-reference. They should be no longer than 12 A4 pages, with wide
margins so that the printed area is not larger than 11x18 cm., single=20
column, point size 11 or 12.
Preparation of the manuscript in LaTeX, using the available style
files at http://www.dei.unipd.it/~fgrammar/fg07/FG2007.tar.gz, is
highly recommended.  Revised versions will be required to be in
LaTeX. The format of submissions is PDF.

The submission deadline is **April 7th,** 2007. Papers must be submitted =

electronically at http://www.easychair.org/FG2007/


Proceedings

Submissions will be blindly reviewed by at least three reviewers.=20
Accepted papers will be available on the FG-2007 webpage before the
conference. No paper proceedings will be available at the conference,
but a book of (short) abstracts will be printed and distributed to
participants. Full, revised versions of accepted papers will be=20
published after the conference as CSLI Publications Online
Proceedings.
