Announcement
-------------------------------------------------------
Call for Papers/Abstracts and Invited Sessions Proposals for The 2nd =
International Multi-Conference on Engineering and Technological =
Innovation (July 10th-13th, 2009 - Orlando, Florida, USA). =
http://www.2009iiisconferences.org/IMETI

Deadlines:
Papers/Abstracts Submissions and Invited Sessions Proposals: September =
24th, 2008
Authors Notifications: November 17th, 2008
Camera-ready, full papers: February 4th, 2009
-------------------------------------------------------

All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing =
processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, =
and (3) participative peer reviews. These three kinds of review will =
support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be =
accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to =
be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have =
access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the =
reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so =
they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. =
Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their =
respective submissions.

Registration fees of an effective invited session organizer will be =
waived according to the policy described in the web page 'Benefits of =
Invited Session Organizers' (click on 'Invited Session', then on =
'Benefits for the Organizers of Invited Sessions'), where you can get =
information about the ten benefits for an invited session organizer. For =
Invited Sessions Proposals, please go to the conference web site, or =
directly to http://www.2009iiisconferences.org/IMETI/organizer.asp

Authors of the best 10%-20% of the papers presented at the conference =
will be invited to adapt their papers for their publication in the =
Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics.

There will also be corresponding e-conferences during the 15 days before =
and after the conference, where each session to be included in the =
conference program will have a corresponding electronic pre-conference =
and post-conference virtual session for 15 days. In the electronic =
pre-conference sessions, authors will have access to the papers to be =
presented at their session and to an associated electronic forum, so =
they can be better prepared for their face-to-face conference  session. =
Similarly, electronic post-conference sessions will complement and =
support a follow-up of the respective conference sessions, via an =
electronic forum and the possibility of evaluating papers presented at =
the associated session. These evaluations will also support the =
selection process for the papers to be published in the JSCI journal.

Best regards,

Organizing Committee
