Meeting Description:

A special panel on 'Comparing child L2 and SLI: Crosslinguistic perspectives'
will be held at SLRF 2008, with the aim of bringing together researchers working
on the comparison between child L2 and Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in
different languages within a linguistic framework. Abstracts are invited for
20-minute talks within this panel. 

Final Call for Papers

Second Language Research Forum (SLRF) 2008
17-19 October 2008
University of Hawai`i at Manoa

Special panel on ''Comparing child L2 and SLI: Crosslinguistic perspectives''
Call deadline: 15 April 2008

Abstracts are invited for a special panel on ''Comparing child L2 and SLI:
Crosslinguistic perspectives'' to take place as part of SLRF at the University
of Hawai`i, 17-19 October 2008.

Recent work in a variety of linguistic frameworks has shown remarkable
similarities between children acquiring a nonnative language (L2) and children
diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (SLI): Similar grammatical phenomena
appear to be vulnerable in both cases. The aim of this panel is to bring
together researchers working on child L2 and SLI in different languages within a
linguistic framework, in order to address and discuss questions such as the
following:

- To what extent are similarities/differences between child L2 and SLI observed
crosslinguistically?

- What domains of the grammar seem to be particularly (in)vulnerable in child L2
and SLI crosslinguistically?

- Are there aspects of grammatical development that clearly distinguish child L2
learners from children with SLI?

- To what extent are the vulnerabilities grammatical phenomena and/or processing
phenomena?

- What are the implications of these similarities/differences for developmental
theories of child L2 and SLI, and for linguistic theorizing more generally?

Individual papers will be allotted 20 minutes (plus time for discussion).

Submission Instructions:
(NB: Do not submit abstracts for this panel through SLRF's online submission
system.)

- Abstracts should be anonymous, clearly titled and no more than 500 words. The
text of the abstract should fit on one page, with a second page for examples,
figures/tables and references. (Please include a word count at the bottom of the
page.)

- The title should be no longer than 12 words.

- Each submission must also include a 50-word summary, to be published in the
conference program.

- In a single e-mail message to theres.gruter@umontreal.ca, send the abstract as
a pdf file and the summary as a Microsoft Word or RTF file by 15 April 2008.

- Title of the paper, author name(s), affiliation(s) and contact information
should be included in the body of the e-mail message.

Notification of acceptance is anticipated to be by mid-May.

For questions and further information regarding this panel, please contact
Theres Grueter (theres.gruter@umontreal.ca).
