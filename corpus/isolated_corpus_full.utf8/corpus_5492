Meeting Description:

Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)
2nd UIMA@GSCL Workshop

September 30, 2009
Potsdam, Germany

http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/gscl09/workshops.de.html

For many decades, NLP has suffered from low software engineering standards
causing a limited degree of re-usability of code and interoperability of
different modules within larger NLP systems. While this did not really hamp=
er
success in limited task areas (such as implementing a parser), it caused se=
rious
problems for the emerging field of language technology where the focus is o=
n
building complex integrated software systems, e.g., for information extract=
ion
or machine translation. This lack of integration has led to duplicated soft=
ware
development, work-arounds for programs written in different (versions of)
programming languages, and ad-hoc tweaking of interfaces between modules
developed at different sites.

In recent years, the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA=
)
framework has been proposed as a middleware platform, which offers integrat=
ion
by design through common type systems and standardized communication method=
s for
components analysing streams of unstructured information, such as natural
language. The UIMA framework offers a solid processing infrastructure that
allows developers to concentrate on the implementation of the actual analyt=
ics
components. An increasing number of members of the NLP community thus have
adopted UIMA as a platform facilitating the creation of reusable NLP compon=
ents
that can be assembled to address different NLP tasks depending on their ord=
er,
combination and configuration.

This workshop aims at bringing together members of the NLP community that a=
re
users, developers or providers of either UIMA components or UIMA-related to=
ols
in order to explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges in using U=
IMA
as a platform for modern, well-engineered NLP. In the context of an emergin=
g
NLP-oriented UIMA community, the challenge to create not only reusable, but=
 also
interoperable components raises particular interest. From a methodological
perspective, interoperability relies largely on UIMA type systems. Technica=
lly,
it includes issues related to the packaging and distribution of UIMA compon=
ents.
Also, tools are important, for example to assemble complex processing work
flows, to manage the bodies of data that are to be analysed and to visualiz=
e,
explore, and further deploy the analysis results. Finally, interoperability=
 is
also affected by legal issues, such as potentially incompatible licenses of
components and tools.

The availability of ready-to-use components plays a major role in choosing =
UIMA
over other alternatives. To accentuate this, the workshop puts a focus on
UIMA-based components and tools that are freely available for research.=20

Call for Papers:=20

News: a one-hour beginners tutorial on UIMA will be held prior to the works=
hop
at the same day.

Topics:

Participants are invited to present applications realized using UIMA, gener=
al
experiences using UIMA as a platform for natural language processing, as we=
ll as
technical papers on particular aspects of the UIMA framework. Alternatives =
to
and comparisons of other frameworks with UIMA are of interest, too. More
specifically, workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

-UIMA components with a special focus on genericity and type-system indepen=
dence
-Repositories of ready-to-use UIMA-based components
- (Generic) type systems for UIMA
-Distribution of UIMA components: documentation, licensing and packaging
-Sophisticated tools to build and manage complex processing pipelines
-Experience reports combining UIMA-based components from different sources =
as
well as solutions to interoperability issues
-Processing of very large data collections: scale-out, parallelization, and
performance optimization
-Analysis of results: exploration, evaluation, visualization, and statistic=
al
analysis
-Developing for UIMA: simplified APIs, debugging, unit testing, and limitat=
ions
of UIMA

Submissions:

We invite submissions of full papers, limited to 8 pages of text, and posit=
ion
papers or papers describing ongoing work as short papers, limited to 4 page=
s.
Both kinds of papers will be orally presented. Double submissions (whether
verbatim or in essence) should indicate this fact and name the workshop or
conference event also addressed. Reviewing will not be anonymous but author=
s
wishing to keep their anonymity may hide their identity on demand. All
submissions must be in English and follow the Springer LNCS style [1] and s=
hould
be created using LaTeX. Submissions must be sent in PDF format to
uima.gscl2009@googlemail.com no later than July, 6th.

Accepted submissions will appear in the GSCL conference proceedings.
