Humour, inherently associated with funniness, amusement and laugher, has 
attracted scholarly interest for centuries. Over the past three decades, humour 
studies have been developing at full tilt, with innumerable insightful 
publications released each year.

The conference is convened to provide a forum for linguists interested in the 
area of humour research. The primary objectives will be to explore the nature 
of multifarious humorous phenomena and to enhance methodological tools used in 
humour studies across a variety of linguistic disciplines.
