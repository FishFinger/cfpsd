Journal of Natural Language Engineering

*** Call for special issue proposals ***


The area of Natural Language Engineering is following the trend of
many other areas, becoming highly specialised with a number of
application-orientated and narrow-domain topics emerging or growing in
importance. These developments, often coincident with a lack of
related literature, necessitate and warrant the publication of
specialised volumes focusing on a specific topic of interest to the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research community.

The journal of Natural Language Engineering (NLE) invites proposals
for special issues on a competitive basis on any topics about applied
NLP which have emerged as important developments in Natural Language
Engineering and which have attracted the attention of a number of
researchers or research groups. After the Call for Proposals for
special issues in 2006 which has resulted in two very high quality
special issues, we are pleased to announce another such call this
year.

Topics could cover a variety of NLP methods, tasks and resources as
well as NLP-related applications but should focus on the practical
implications of operation on the large scale. Topics covering NLP
methods, tasks and resources could include but are not limited to POS
tagging, parsing, semantic role labelling, word sense disambiguation,
anaphora and coreference resolution, named entity recognition, natural
language generation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, multimodal
processing, statistical methods in Natural Language Engineering,
machine learning, evaluation methodologies, corpora and
ontologies. Topics covering NLP applications could include but are not
limited to machine translation, translation memory and translation
tools, summarisation, information retrieval, information extraction,
question answering, text and web mining, opinion mining and NLP for
biomedical texts.

Calls for special issue proposals may be based on a successful
workshop or a body of work associated with a particular group or
section of the community. In all cases, however, the reviewing process
of the accepted proposals will be rigorous and all submissions must be
reviewed by at least 3 members of the Guest Editorial Board or other
suitable reviewers agreed by the NLE Editors. In the case of papers
previously submitted to workshops, the Guest Editors will not be able
to re-use previous workshop reviews.  In addition, the call for papers
of the accepted proposals must be open to all interested parties and
all authors will be given equal treatment; in the case of proposals
based on previous workshops, submissions cannot be limited to workshop
participants only.

Interested editors have the option of preliminary feedback by emailing
expressions of interest accompanied by a brief description of the
intended special issue to the Executive Editor
(<mailto:R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk>R.Mitkov@wlv.ac.uk). He will give a brief
indication of whether the topic is appropriate to Natural Language
Engineering.

In the case of initial positive feedback, the prospective Guest
Editors will be asked to submit a proposal for a special issue which
will be reviewed by the Editors of the journal and by other members of
the Journal Editorial Board. At least one proposal will be selected on
a competitive basis for each call with the envisaged publication date
for the successful proposal(s) from this call on or after October
2009.

The proposal for a special issue should include a brief outline of the
field and rationale as to why it is important to launch a special
issue on the particular topic of interest. It should include a
relevant literature survey (related previous special issues, volumes,
workshop and conference proceedings) and should explain the added
value of the proposed special issue against the background of other
relevant or competing publications and volumes (if applicable). It is
desirable that a rough estimate on expected submissions to the special
issue be provided. The proposals should also include a tentative Guest
Editorial Board (it is desirable that one of the members of the Guest
Editorial Board be a member of the journal Editorial Board), tentative
time-scale for the production of the special issue and information
about the prospective Guest Editors (relevant experience, publications
etc.).
