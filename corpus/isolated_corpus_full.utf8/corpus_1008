http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 23 - August 3, 2007, Iasi, Romania

Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 7, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity for =
graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) =
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language =
Processing to present their current work and receive constructive =
feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general audience =
and the invited lecturers at the Summer School.=20

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4 =
consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in one of the two weeks of the =
EUROLAN 2007 Summer School. The final version of the accepted papers =
will be published in the Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral =
Consortium. During the Summer School the students will present their =
work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to current and future =
research directions from a panel of established researchers, and will =
benefit from the collaborative climate established among all =
participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Students will =
also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the Summer =
School.=20

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the =
Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to =
receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within =
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, however =
students working in the areas related with the theme of this year's =
Summer School like:
- computational semantics,=20
- ontology enriched NLP applications
- opinion and sentiment analysis,=20
- role of  sentiment analysis in multimodal human computer interaction=20
are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lectures of the =
school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The =
submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST be =
students.=20
The paper should include:=20
- the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;
- the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field;=20
- the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the =
methodology adopted;
- the future research plan.=20


3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The following formats are acceptable: PDF =
(.pdf), PostScript (.ps), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Microsoft Word =
(.doc). Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references and =
annexes and should follow the Springer format, soon available as a .dot =
