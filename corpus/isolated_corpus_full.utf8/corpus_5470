Full Title: DGfS-CL Computational Linguistics Fall School 

Date: 07-Sep-2009 - 19-Sep-2009
Location: Konstanz, Germany 
Contact Person: Miriam Butt
Meeting Email: miriam.butt@uni-konstanz.de
Web Site: http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/conferences/fallschool2009/index.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 21-Jun-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Computational Linguistics Fall School was established by the German Linguistics Association as a biennial event for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of techniques and methods used in natural language processing. The motivation is to give interested students an understanding of innovative and emerging fields in computational linguistics, including fields not traditionally taught in standard degree programs. All lectures will be in English. 
In 2009 the Fall School will be held at the University of Konstanz, Germany. 

Call for Participation:

Early Registration for the Fall School ends June 21, 2009.  

We still have a number of stipends to award. These stipends cover the registration fee.

Additionally, we can offer two stipends for women, preferably from countries in which computational linguistics programs are just being developed. These two stipends are intended to cover the registration fee, travel and accommodation.
