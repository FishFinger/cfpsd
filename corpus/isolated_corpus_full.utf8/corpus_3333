*** SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED: 1st August, 2008 *** 

 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

CFP: FIS 2008 POSTERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS

 <http://www.fis2008.org/> http://www.fis2008.org

To be held as part of 1st Future Internet Symposium 28-30 September 2008,
Vienna, Austria.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To complement the main symposium programme FIS 2008 will hold a combined
Poster and Demonstration session. The Poster/Demo Session is an opportunity
for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and
speculative or innovative work in progress. Posters and demos are also
intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to network
with each other and to engage in technical discussions about the work.
Technical posters, reports on Future Internet software systems, descriptions
of completed work, and work in progress are all welcome. Demonstrations are
intended to showcase innovative Future Internet related implementations and
technologies.


Important Dates
--------------------------
* August 1, 2008: Deadline for submissions [Extended]
* September 3, 2008: Notification of acceptance
* September 15, 2008: Camera ready abstracts due

(time: 23:59 pm GMT-10 (Hawaii))

Submission Information
-----------------------------
Authors must submit an abstract (up to 3 pages) for evaluation. The abstract
must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Future Internet. Submissions will
be evaluated for acceptability by a set of reviewers. Decisions on
acceptance will be based on relevance to the Future Internet, originality
potential significance, and clarity. A poster may be accompanied with a live
software demonstration. Standalone demos (without a poster) are also
acceptable. For demos the authors are requested to indicate any special
technical requirements which need to be taken into account at the event.

A detailed list of suggested topics can be found in the main call for papers
for the Future Internet Symposium.

Authors submitting a full paper to another track in FIS 2008 may also submit
the same work for consideration in the Demo/Poster track, either before or
after result notification for the full paper. For example, a demo can be
provided for an accepted paper, or a poster can be used to present work that
was insufficiently mature for the research track.

At least one of the Poster/Demo authors must be a registered participant at
the conference, and attend the Poster/Demo Session to present the work. The
abstracts for all accepted posters and demos will be given to all conference
attendees and published on the conference web site. They will not be
included in the formal proceedings.

A best Poster or Demo award will be granted at the symposium. The selection
of the winner will be facilitated by the Demo and Poster session visitors.

Poster and demo abstracts should follow the LNCS Style - see
 <http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0>
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0. Additionally
abstracts must be submitted in PDF format. Abstracts that exceed the page
limit or are not submitted as PDF will be rejected without review. Please
submit papers at the FIS 2008 submission page:
 <http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fis2008>
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fis2008.

Copyright forms will be required for all accepted papers. Details will be
sent with notifications of acceptance.
