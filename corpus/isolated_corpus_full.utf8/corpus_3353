Meeting Description:

AILA Migration and Language Research Network
3rd International Seminar on Language and Migration

Theme: Institutions, Language and Migration: Processes, Power and Control

February 2 - 3, 2009
Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona 

Call for Papers

The third AILA Migration and Language Research Network seminar takes up the
theme of language and migration in connection with social institutions (for
social welfare, justice, health, administration, education) involved in the
construction of the nation-State and its citizen populations. Language provides
a privileged angle for examining the challenges to the functioning of social
organizations represented by neoliberalism and the increased mobility of human
and material resources. The present seminar examines the changes in both
established institutional domains of the nation-State and in newly emerging
forms of social organization (NGOs, communication networks, tourism,
supranational agencies and so on) with special attention dedicated to
institutional process, power and control and to the challenges posed by
linguistic diversity.

Papers are invited on:  
- Multilingualism and the new economy
- Globalization and the shaping of new language practices
- The management of (language) multilingualism in private, public and non-
governmental organizations
- Language in the exercise of agency, power and institutional control
- Institutional ideologies, communication practices and processes of social 
exclusion/inclusion
- Theoretical and conceptual frames for explaining language, migration and 
institutions

Abstracts:
Abstracts of approximately 300 words may be sent to:
