Call for Papers

ISLOJ 2
The Second International Symposium on The Languages of Java

4-5 June 2009 
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, Senggigi, Lombok, Indonesia

Keynote Speakers: 
Dr. Thomas Hunter: The interaction of irrealis with the symmetrical voice system
of Old Javanese. 
Dr. Husni Muadz, Universitas Negri Mataram: A topic on Sasak TBA 

The island of Java is home to several major languages. Javanese -- spoken mainly
in Central and East Java -- is the world's 10th or 11th largest language in
number of native speakers. It has one of the oldest and fullest recorded
histories of any Austronesian language. It also has been of considerable
interest to scholars because of the system of speech levels or speech styles
found in a number of varieties of Javanese. Sundanese -- spoken in West Java --
has over 27 million speakers, and Madurese -- spoken on the neighboring island
of Madura and throughout parts of East Java -- has over 13 million speakers.
Varieties of both of these languages have speech level systems and such systems
can also be found in the geographically, historically, and linguistically
related languages on the neighboring islands of Bali and Lombok. Each of these
languages displays a range of dialects, isolects, continua, and contact
varieties and yet they have received relatively little attention from linguists.
With this symposium, we offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect
of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese and Sasak to come together and share
their findings. We aim to encourage and promote continued research on these
important and unique languages.  

Abstracts are invited for papers to be presented on any linguistic topics
dealing with the languages of Java and its environs -- Javanese, Sundanese,
Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak. Given the location of the conference, papers on
Sasak are especially encouraged. Papers on other languages will be judged
according to their relevance to the symposium topic. Papers are welcome from any
subfield of linguistics and using any approach or theoretical background.
Studies of non-standard(ized) versions, dialects, and isolects, including
contact varieties, are particularly welcome. All papers are to be presented in
English.

Persons wishing to present papers at the symposium are invited to submit a
one-page [data and references may be on a second page] abstract in electronic
form (PDF AND MSWord) to Thomas Conners at the following address:
oranghutan@cbn.net.id

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2009

Please note that the 13th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian
Linguistics (ISMIL 13) will be held immediately following ISLOJ, also at the
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, on 6-7 June, 2009. For more information see:

Location: Venice, Italy, Italy 
Contact Person: Johan Bos

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 06-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

Symposium on Semantics in Systems for Text Processing.
September 22-24, 2008 - Venice, Italy 

Step 2008: Call For Short Papers

Short Paper Submission Deadline: June 6, 2008

Symposium on Semantics in Text Processing

http://project.cgm.unive.it/html/STEP2008/index.htm

September 22-24, 2008

Auditorium Santa Margherita Venice (Italy)

Endorsed by SIGSEM, the ACL special interest group on computational semantics

Workshop Scope:
The goal of the STEP workshop is to provide a forum for anyone active in
semantic processing of text to discuss innovative technologies, representation
issues, inference techniques, prototype implementations, and real applications.
The preferred processing targets are large quantities of texts -- either
specialised domains, or open domains such as newswire text, blogs, and
wikipedia-like text. Implemented rather than theoretical work is emphasised in
STEP. In particular, relevant topics are:

- wide-coverage semantic/logical analysis of text
- computation and use of discourse relations
- use of lexical-conceptual and semantically related resources
- thematic role labelling in semantic representations
- word sense disambiguation in semantic representations
- implementations of specific semantic phenomena
- anaphora or ellipsis resolution in semantic representations
- implementations of sentiment analysis
- automatic detection of subjective and non-literal language
- acquisition of lexical knowledge and paraphrase from raw corpora
- background knowledge acquisition, representation, and selection
- semantic lexicons and ontologies for text interpretation
- learning semantic representations from raw text
- automated reasoning in the service of semantic analysis of text
- creation of gold standard meaning representations
- evaluation of semantic representations
- textual entailment and consistency checking
- systems that extract, represent or manipulate text meaning
- applications of semantic analysis in text processing

Applications include, but are not limited to, machine translation, text
understanding, question answering, summarisation, information extraction, and
the semantic web.

Submissions:
Authors are now invited to submit short papers presenting system descriptions,
position papers, project descriptions, or ongoing work. Selected short papers
will be presented at the workshop during the poster session.

Submissions should be in Abobe PDF format, not exceed four A4-sized
pages, written in English and typeset in a 11 point font. Detailed guidelines
and a latex stylefile package are available at the STEP 2008 web page. Paper
submission will be electronic using the EasyChair system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=step2008

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the programme
committee. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. 

Invited Speaker:
Harry Bunt (University of Tilburg)

Important Dates:
Short Paper submission: June 6, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 23, 2008
Camera-ready version due: July 25, 2008
