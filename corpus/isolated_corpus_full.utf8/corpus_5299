=09First International Conference on 'Networked Digital Technologies' =A0(ND=
T2009)
Czech Republic, July 28-31, 2009

   The proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore

   http://arg.vsb.cz/ndt2009/Default.aspx[1]

   The proposed conference on the above them will be be held at the =20
VSB-Technical University, Ostrava, Czech Republic from July 28 to July =20
31 2009 which aims to enable researchers build connections between =20
different digital applications.

   Currently a number of institutions across the countries are working =20
to evolve better models to provide collaborative technology services =20
for scholarship by creating shared cyberspace thro expert =20
collaboration, but this is a challenge for the institutions for a =20
number of reasons. In the last few years, the landscape of digital =20
technology applications projects for the various disciplines in =20
humanities, social sciences, and sciences appears induced by many =20
initiatives. For the creation of research clusters, the research =20
community has thousands of databases, websites, local computing =20
clusters, and web-based tools around individual themes, interests and =20
projects. In most cases, these tools and resources are and were =20
created to meet the specific needs of a particular community. In many =20
cases, the funding and support for these critical initiatives is =20
fragile and temporary, and directed in piecemeal fashion. There is a =20
need to provide concerted efforts in building federated digital =20
technologies that will enable the formation of network of digital =20
technologies.
