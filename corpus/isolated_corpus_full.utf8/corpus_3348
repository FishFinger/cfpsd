Meeting Description:

Annual Conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies 2009

The annual conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies (BASEES) will take place at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge
(UK), between 28-30 March 2009. Abstracts are invited for individual 20-minute
papers or for entire panels (3 papers) in any area of Slavonic linguistics and
philology, including applied linguistics and translation studies. We are
particularly keen to receive proposals for complete panels but we are also happy
to receive paper proposals that the organising committee will try to put
together into panels. The working languages of the conference are English and
Russian. 

Call for Papers

At this year's conference we had around thirty papers in theoretical
linguistics, historical linguistics, applied linguistics, language teaching, and
translation studies presented by academics and graduate students from
institutions in the UK and abroad. The annual convention as a whole brings
together scholars from a wide range of disciplines including literary studies,
linguistics, cultural studies, history, economics, politics, sociology, film and
media studies as they pertain to Central and Eastern Europe and to the former
Soviet Union.

To propose a panel or a paper you will need to fill in a proposal form,
available from the BASEES website at http://www.basees.org.uk/conference.shtml.
There are separate forms for panels and papers and each is in .rtf format. You
should download the appropriate form and fill it in electronically, and send it
electronically to the stream organiser for linguistics (David Willis,
dwew2@cam.ac.uk) and to the conference email address
(basees.conference@lbss.gla.ac.uk).

We are particularly keen to hear from postgraduate students. Postgraduate
members of BASEES who present papers are eligible to apply for financial support
towards their conference costs. All enquiries regarding membership should be
addressed to the membership secretary, Dr Jenny Mathers (zzk@aber.ac.uk). The
application procedure is described on the website.
The deadline for submission of abstracts is 15 September 2008.

Further details are available on the website at www.basees.org.uk.

Apologies for cross-posting of this notice.

Focus Marking Strategies and Focus Interpretation 

The necessity of a strict distinction between focus as a category of information
structure related to the presence of alternatives in the interpretation context
and focus marking as the grammati-cal coding of focus is widely discussed in the
literature (Krifka 2007). Different focus marking strategies may, however, have
different effects on the interpretation of focus. A well-known example is
Hungarian, in which in-situ and ex-situ focus differ with regard to exhaustivity
and contrast (É.Kiss 1998). Similar findings have been reported on Finnish,
Turk-ish etc. Such findings support the hypothesis that focus interpretation
depends on the marking strategy in languages with several strategies of focus
marking at their disposal. However, re-search on other languages suggests that
this hypothesis may not hold universally. In Hausa (Chadic), for instance, any
interpretation available for ex-situ focus is also available for in-situ focus
(Hartmann & Zimmermann 2007). Moreover, even for Hungarian it has been argued
that the semantic difference between in-situ and ex-situ focus is related to a
specific syntactic posi-tion in the left periphery that may actually be
independent of focus (Horváth 2007).

These observations give rise to the following questions:
(i.) Can a general notion of focus as an underspecified information structural
category (often associated with prosodic prominence) with a unified semantic
interpretation mechanism in terms of alternatives (e.g. Rooth 1992) be
maintained? I.e., can we derive the differ-ences in meaning that are observable
with different strategies of focus marking from the different grammatical
structure of the respective sentences plus pragmatic principles?
or
(ii.) Do we need more fine-grained notions of information structure, such as
e.g. contrast, exhaustivity, newness, that divide the more general notion of
focus into subclasses, such that languages would use different marking
strategies for expressing them?

The workshop invites syntactic, semantic and typological work on different
strategies of focus marking and focus interpretation. In addition, we would also
encourage the presentation of diachronic data related to the evolution of
different strategies of focus marking. The workshop is of interest for
researchers working on linguistic interfaces. We are looking forward to
applications that provide data on and analyses of the effects of structural
encoding on the semantic and/or pragmatic interpretation.
