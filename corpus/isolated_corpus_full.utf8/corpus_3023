Meeting Description:

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual workshop
designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working in research
related to spoken dialogue systems in both academia and industry. The roundtable
provides an open forum where participants can discuss their research interests,
current work and future plans. The workshop is meant to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about current issues in spoken
dialogue systems research, and help create a stronger international network of
young researchers working in the field.  The workshop is co-located with ACL
2008 and will occur the day after the 9th SIGdial workshop. 

Final Call for Participation
Extended Deadline: Tuesday 13th May

Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems
June 21st, 2008, Columbus, Ohio,

Sponsored by VoiceObjects, Nuance, AT&T,
Microsoft Research, & SpeechStorm

Workshop Format:
Workshop events will include small informal discussion groups, a larger Question
& Answers style discussion with senior researchers from academia and industry,
and an opt-in demo presentation session. There will also be time for
participants to have informal discussions over coffee with senior researchers on
potential career opportunities. The small discussion groups are intended to
allow participants to exchange ideas on key research topics, and identify issues
that are likely to be important in the coming years. The results of each
discussion group will then be presented and discussed in plenary sessions. The
topics for discussion are still open and will be determined by participant
submissions and finalized online before the workshop. Potential participants
should submit a short paper, as described below in the submission process, to
get accepted to the workshop.

In addition to the traditional one day event, a half day extension on the topic
of  ''Frameworks and Grand Challenges for Dialog System Evaluation'' is under
consideration for the morning of June 22nd, 2008. The aim of this extra session
is to provide an opportunity for dialog systems researchers to discuss issues of
evaluation, and hopefully determine an agenda for a future evaluation event or
framework. Organization of this extended event will depend on interest; we
therefore, as described below, invite potential participants to indicate their
interest with their YRR08 submission.

Submission Process:
We invite participation from students, post docs, and junior researchers in
academia or industry who are currently working in spoken dialog systems
research. We also invite participation from those who are working in related
fields such as linguistics, psychology, or speech processing, as applied to
spoken dialogue systems. Please note that by 'young researchers' the workshop's
organizers mean to target students and researchers in the field who are at a
relatively early stage of their careers, and in no way mean to imply that
participants must meet certain age restrictions.

Potential participants should submit a 2-page position paper and suggest topics
for discussion and whether they would be interested in attending the extended
session on Sunday morning. A template and specific submission instructions are
available on http://www.yrrsds.org/. Submissions will be accepted on a rolling
basis until the maximum number of participants for the workshop (50) is reached,
or until the submission deadline (May 13th, 2008) is reached.  Proceedings from
previous years' workshops are also available on our web site. Specific questions
can be directed to the organizing committee at
yrr08-organizers__AT_googlegroups_DOT_com

Financial Support through ISCA:
The Young Researchers Roundtable is to be supported this year by ISCA, the
International Speech Communication Association, who will consider applications
for a limited number of travel grants for the roundtable. Applications should be
send directly to grants@isca-speech.org, details of the application process and
forms are available from http://www.isca-speech.org/grants.html. Closing date
for applications is May, 24th.

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 15-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

As part of the Conference on Bilingual Acquisition in Early Childhood
(http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/lin/conference/baec/), a workshop on sign bilingualism
will be held at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on 10 December 2008. The
workshop is organized by the Centre for Sign Linguistics and Deaf Studies. 

Call for Papers

The workshop aims at attracting researchers from all over Asia-Pacific region
who are interested in language development of Deaf and hard of hearing children
who grow up in a sign bilingual environment. Over the past two decades there has
been a growing awareness of the need for Deaf children to have a natural sign
language as their first language and learn spoken language (written / oral) as
their second language. The bilingual acquisition of Deaf children may be a
different process and may have a different pathway from that of hearing
children. We are interested in the properties of the language input that Deaf
children receive and also the impact of their first language on the development
of their second language. We would like to invite papers on theoretical issues
concerning the development of sign bilingual Deaf children learning any
combination of sign language and spoken language, including written language,
within the Asia-Pacific region. 

We hope that this workshop will create a platform for educators of the Deaf and
researchers to work together in discussing the theoretical issues that arise
from the sign bilingual model, so that we can arrive at a better understanding
on the language development of Deaf and hard of hearing children. 

Programme:
10 December 2008 (Wed)

Paper presentation:
Each author may submit one proposal as the first author and another as
co-author. Each presentation will be 15 minutes in length, followed by 15
minutes of discussion.
