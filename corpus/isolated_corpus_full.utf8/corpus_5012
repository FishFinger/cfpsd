A Workshop on Head Movement and Locality is held as part of the Minimalist
Approaches to Syntactic Locality (MASL) conference.

Invited speakers of the MASL conference and the workshop:
Adriana Belletti (Siena)
Cedric Boeckx (Harvard>Barcelona)
Carlo Cecchetto & Caterina Donati (Milano & Roma)
Marcel den Dikken (CUNY)
Gisbert Fanselow (Potsdam)
Gereon MÃ¼ller (Leipzig)
Norvin Richards (MIT)
Eric Reuland (Utrecht)
Luigi Rizzi (Siena)
Ian Roberts (Cambridge)

Head Movement, a syntactic transformation affecting head-level syntactic
elements, figured prominently in much of the research carried out within the
frame of GB theory as well as within early minimalism. The restrictive character
of the minimalist program, however, prompted a critical re-examination of this
operation, which exhibits several features that make it appear different from
other syntactic movements. Central among these properties is the nature of the
locality that Head Movement appears to be characterized by.

Various alternative approaches to head movement (HM) phenomena are currently
being explored within the minimalist framework, some reducing it to phrasal
movement, some others retaining Head Movement proper in narrow syntax, and again
others treating it at the PF interface. These different approaches put
intriguing new questions on the research agenda, and permit old ones to be
formulated and addressed in novel ways. Of these issues, some outstanding ones
directly pertaining to the conference theme of syntactic locality will be
discussed at the workshop, to which abstracts are invited for 40-minute
presentations (30'+10').

Possible questions for discussion include, but are not limited to, the following:

- How do genuine syntactic head movement, phrasal (remnant) movement, and PF
accounts of 'head movement' phenomena fare in capturing their salient empirical
properties, including the nature of their locality?
- What arguments can be found that strongly argue in favor of, or against, one
of these accounts or another? 
- How can the general strict locality of head movement, and any (possibly
apparent) exceptions therefrom, be reduced to elementary properties of the grammar?
- What symmetries and asymmetries exist between HM and phrasal movement, and
what do they derive from?
- How are the locality properties of HM related to its trigger?
- In what component of the grammar are 'affix lowering' phenomena to be treated?
- Does covert syntactic HM exist?
- How do 'head movements' and phrasal movements interact?
- Does HM affect (e.g., extend) local domains? If so, how?
- How is the 'Mirror Principle' generalization, and any (possibly apparent)
exceptions therefrom, to be properly derived in lexicalist or in 'late lexical
insertion' models?
- Are overt incorporation phenomena to be analyzed as syntactic head movement?
- How are they to be treated in lexicalist or in 'late lexical insertion' models?

Deadline for Abstracts: 25 April 2009

Selected papers from the conference and workshop will be considered for
peer-reviewed (book or special journal issue) publication. Authors of selected
high quality abstracts that do not make it into an oral presentation will be
invited to give their paper as a poster.

Abstract Submission:
An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract (to the main MASL
conference session and to the workshop, taken together). Abstracts must be
uploaded in pdf format through the interface accessible from the conference
website. Abstracts should be anonymous, and at most two A4 pages (including data
and references) in 12-point font with 1-inch margins all around.

Important Dates:
Deadline for abstracts: 25 April 2009
Notification of acceptance: cca. 10 May 2009
Conference: 26-28 August 2009
