Meeting Description:
It is proposed to conduct a National Seminar on Malayalam Grammatical Theories -
Tradition to the Present. The three day seminar is anticipated to assess the
current status of grammatical theories in general and Malayalam grammar in
particular in the knowledge ITC era from different perspectives. The syntactic
theories from descriptive model to transformational and cognitive models are
used or applied for various purposes - including in Language technology,
language teaching and NL applications. Paninian Model (Indian Tradition) to
Chomskyan Models (Western theories) and models like Case Grammar, Categorical
Grammar,  Lexical Functional Grammar, Tree Adjoining Grammar, Minimalist
Programme, etc. are notables because of different reasons.
One or more of the above models have been attempted in Malayalam also. The
grammar of Malayalam has got a tradition from 14th Century by Leelathilakam and
gone through Gundart, Keralapanini, and so many other works. The language has
undergone vast changes for these years, from its scripts to grammar, semantics
and usage. Malayalam scripts have undergone changes at different stages and
latest according to the UNICODE standards. Thousands of lexical items have come
to Malayalam from different languages and the dictionaries and lexicons are
getting enriched and updated in a regular interval. Usages, proverbs, word
formation, etc. have also got so many changes and need special attention. From
the Sanskrit approach to the Western models and the grammar of Malayalam still
in no where. The Malayalam language computing team demands suitable models of
grammar of Malayalam for diverse applications. Cyber Malayalam is a major area
demands more research and solutions in solving linguistic issues.  
Malayalam Language teaching in schools and other levels is adopting many
methodological changes. The language in print, electronic and cyber media is
different from many ways and new concepts and usages are being introduced day by
day.  Malayalam in Scientific and technical documents show different patterns
because of many influences. Coinage and translation of Technical terminology
also demands special attention. Systems of Machine Translation from and to
Malayalam are attempted at different ways and that also demands a grammar model
particular to such application. Online Dictionary with word formation and
grammar checking are other areas which look in this direction. Migration of
large number of Malayalees to different parts of the world has made a state that
Malayalam got the official status in various countries. Printing and publishing
of Malayalam books, journals, magazines and Newspapers are also being done even
in foreign countries. Cyber Malayalam or Malayalam in Internet, for chatting and
SMS and latest Malayalam in Cell phone also demand clarification and solution 
in their models.  Malayalam language computing initiative by the Govt. of Kerala
is another major area which require basic language model to apply in the
language software and products. 
To know, discuss and exhibit all the above the proposed seminar is aimed for.

The topic of the conference will be grammatical theories in general and
Malayalam Grammar in particular. 

Papers or proposals for discussion are invited in the following fields:
- grammatical theories and models
- Indian and Western grammatical models
- traditional and modern theories
- advantage and disadvantages of different models
- suitable theory for language technology, language teaching, etc.
- Malayalam grammatical theories/ models
- grammatical categories and their description
- grammar for lexicon, translation, media, etc

Meeting Description:

A workshop at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea,
University of Lisbon, 9-12 September, 2009.

"Quotative Markers: Origins and Use" 

Call for Papers

Tom Guu?ldemann (University of Zu?rich / Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology, Leipzig)

Quotative markers are linguistic signs conventionally signaling the presence of
an adjacent representation of reported discourse, i.e. the quote. Semantically,
they are largely similar to generic speech verbs, such as say and tell in
English, with which they share the feature of reference to an utterance.
Functionally, however, they differ from the latter in being conventionalized in
relation to reported discourse. That is, either they are not used in other
contexts at all or they lack (fully or partially) the feature of reference to an
utterance when no representation of reported discourse is adjacent. Consider,
for instance, _be like_ in English in _And he's like: "That's great!"_.
Following Güldemann (2008), the quote frame based on a quotative marker or/and a
speech verb is called a quotative index. Güldemann (2008) also provides a
detailed classification of quotative markers. Thus, syntactically, quotative
markers can be either predicative or nonpredicative elements.
Morphosyntactically, predicative quotative markers may behave as regular verbs
and are then classified as quotative verbs. Those predicative quotative markers
that do not fully qualify for the status of verb in a given language are
referred to as quotative predicators. Nonpredicative quotative markers are often
referred to as quotative complementizers, especially when they are also used for
purposes of clause combining.

Historically, quotative markers may derive from a large number of sources, such
as generic speech verbs, generic verbs of equation, inchoativity, action, and
motion, markers of similarity and manner, markers of focus, presentation and
identification. Somewhat surprisingly, according to Güldemann (2008:295), at
least in African languages, generic speech verbs appear to be "far less
important" as sources of quotative markers than is usually assumed in the
literature. At the same time, it is remarkable that quotative markers of various
nonpredicative origins often tend to gradually acquire verbal features up to
becoming full-fledged verbal lexemes through their conventionalized use as core
elements of quotative indexes. In many African languages, quotative markers are
also regularly employed for purposes of clause combining and extended to
constructions expressing intention and various kinds of modal meanings.

The proposed workshop is intended to bring together scholars interested in the
origins and use of quotative markers in individual languages, language families
or linguistic areas from any part of the world. Particularly welcome are papers
based on data from spontaneous and spoken language use and data from less
documented languages. Authors are also encouraged to situate their findings in a
broader cross-linguistic perspective, both as regards the known sources of
quotative markers as well as their typical secondary extensions to contexts not
involving instances of reported discourse in the strict sense.
