AIMS

The current trend of information exchange on the Internet to become =20
ever more multilingual has stimulated new important developments in =20
the field of multilingual NLP. The present workshop is concerned with =20=

the problem of automatic management of lexical resources, which lie =20
at the heart of many multilingual technologies.

Recently there has been an increased interest in the automated =20
discovery of equivalent expressions in different languages. New =20
interesting directions have sprung up, such as the use of the Web and =20=

comparable corpora for this task, and new kinds of lexical phenomena, =20=

such as multiword expressions and named entities, have come into focus.

This workshop will bring together researchers working on a broad =20
range of problems related to the management of multilingual lexical =20
resources - their acquisition, maintenance, customization, and re-=20
use. The scope of the workshop includes evaluation of multilingual =20
lexicons intended for a broad range of applications: from =20
personalized glossaries for a translation project to large-scale =20
machine-readable dictionaries and databases.


TOPICS

Specific topics of interest for the proposed workshop are:

* Acquisition of lexical knowledge from parallel and comparable =20
corpora, and from the Web
* Porting, merging and domain customisation of existing lexical =20
resources using NLP technologies
* Acquisition of domain terminology
* Acquisition of multi-word expressions
* Acquisition of translations for polysemous words
* Acquisition of multilingual lexical taxonomies
* Named Entity transliteration
* Acquisition of cognates and loanwords
* Extraction of equivalent phrases and sentences from comparable corpora
* Applications of multilingual lexicons and their evaluation within:
       - Statistical Machine Translation
       - Computer-Aided Translation
       - Information Retrieval (Question Answering, Text Retrieval, =20
Text Classification and Clustering)
       - Knowledge Management


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

* Format. Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, =20
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop. Papers should be =20=

submitted as a PDF file, formatted according to the RANLP 2007 =20
stylefiles and not exceeding 8 pages. The RANLP 2007 stylefiles are =20
available at:

http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/submissions.htm

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the =20
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that =20
reveal the authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not =20
conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

* Submission procedure. Submission of papers will be handled using =20
the START system. Specific submission guidelines will be posted on =20
the workshop site shortly.

* Reviewing. Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members =20=

of the Program Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed =20=

comments, and to score submitted papers on the following factors:
       - Relevance to the workshop
       - Significance and originality
       - Technical/methodological accuracy
       - References to related work
       - Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

* Accepted papers policy. Accepted papers will be published in the =20
workshop proceedings. By submitting a paper at the workshop the =20
authors agree that, in case the paper is accepted for publication, at =20=

least one of the authors will attend the workshop; all workshop =20
participants are expected to pay the RANLP-2007 workshop registration =20=

fee.
