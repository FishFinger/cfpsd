KOREA UNIVERSITY 
WORKING PAPERS IN LINGUISTICS

Korea University Working papers in Linguistics (KLING) are published by the
organization of linguistics graduate students at Korea University. KLING
aims to serve as a forum for works in progress and of circulating
promising, new scholarly work of both our affiliates and non-affiliates.  
KLING is pleased to issue an ongoing call for papers for its inaugural
working paper series.

Guidelines and call for papers

We welcome submissions of papers on all topics in the field of linguistics.
Papers are invited for both theoretical and applied linguistics research
areas. Note that being a working papers volume, publication does not
necessarily preclude later publication of an adapted version of the paper.

Papers must be:
Received by 31 December 2006
No longer than 20 pages
Submitted electronically either as a PDF document (preferred) or MS Word
to: kling@korea.ac.kr

With the body of the email message, please include:
Title of submission, name(s) of author(s), and affiliation(s)
Each author's contact information: work address, email, phone

All submissions are reviewed by an editorial board comprised of staff and
affiliated faculty members of the Korea University. For more information,
please consult the KLING website (www.kling.or.kr) or contact the
organizers at: kling@korea.ac.kr
