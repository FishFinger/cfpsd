                           CALL FOR PAPERS


TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
---------------------

The past  years have witnessed  unprecedented levels of  investment in
the e-Health sector, both in terms of research effort, and in terms of
funding, as well  as a great public interest.  e-Health can be broadly
defined as the application of IT (especially Internet technologies) to
improve  the  access, efficiency,  effectiveness  and  quality of  any
processes (clinical and business alike) related to health care. In the
e-Health vision, intelligent systems would, for example, enable:

* citizens  to take  more control  of their  well-being,  by accessing
   personalised  and  qualified health  information,  both medical  and
   pedagogical,  and  accessing  appropriate  medical care  from  their
   homes;
* health professionals  to manage their activity  more efficiently, by
   receiving relevant and timely updates; and
* teams  of health  professionals to  work together  more effectively,
   coordinating  their activities,  sharing their  knowledge  about the
   patients they are collectively taking care of, and ensuring the best
   coordinated care is provided.

The  2nd   workshop  on   Personalisation  for  e-Health   intends  to
consolidate the  trend started with  the 1st edition of  the workshop,
which was held at UM 2005 in Edinburgh, and which successfully brought
together   researchers   from   both   the   computational   and   the
medical/public  health  perspectives  to  share  theoretical  results,
experiences, and best practices.  Like the past edition, this workshop
will focus on the many aspects of personalisation for health delivery,
related to e-Health environments.

A non exhaustive list of issues of interest is:

- adaptive  and personalised  e-Health information  systems (including
   adaptive content, search and interface)
- tailored health education and advice (written and online) 
- promoting trust and compliance to health advice
- personalised    assistance,   including    for    special   citizens
   (e.g. disabled, elderly)
- personalisation in chronic care (e.g. asthma or diabetes management)
   as opposed to acute care (e.g. ICU setting)
- privacy issues for health related user models 
- personalisation  based  both on  biometric  or  genomic factors  and
   clinical information
- tailored decision support (for patients and practitioners) 
- supporting  the  implementation   of  guidelines  and  protocols  in
   healthcare  models   of  user  learning,   knowledge,  attitude  and
   behaviour change (including compliance)
- patient/citizen models 
- business models (personalisation to various stakeholders) 
- ontologies for user models for tailored health care delivery
- methods  for  evaluating  user  satisfaction  with  ehealth  systems
   (weblog  analysis,  tracking  users,  quantitative  and  qualitative
   methods)
- reports on evaluation studies of personalised eHealth systems.

The workshop welcomes contributions from diverse perspectives, such as
knowledge   engineering,  multi   agent   systems,  natural   language
processing, cognitive  modelling, human factors,  mobile computing, as
well  as  public health  and  medical  informatics. Contributions  may
describe applications, approaches, and evaluation studies.

Special  attention   will  be  dedicated   to  system  demonstrations:
submissions should be accompanied by short written reports.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------
The workshop encourages submissions in three categories:

- Long papers, describing mature research (up to 6000 words) 
- Short papers, describing work in progress (up to 3000 words) 
- Demonstrations  of  an  implemented  system:  submission  should  be
   accompanied by  written reports (up  to 3000 words).  Authors should
   contact the organisers to ensure suitable equipment is available.

Papers  should be  in  PDF format,  and  submitted electronically  via
EasyChair at: http://www.easychair.org/Pers4eHealth07/
