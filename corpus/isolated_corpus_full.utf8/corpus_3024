                   Prague Stringology Conference 2008

               13th event of the Prague Stringology Club

                      http://www.stringology.org

                           Call for Papers

              Prague, Czech Republic, September 1-3, 2008

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PSC'08 is the 13th event of the Prague Stringology Club. It is an
international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It
is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club, a research group
in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Czech
Technical University in Prague.


TOPICS:

Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the
processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years
and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last fifteen
years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due
in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms
make important contributions. The topics of the conference include but
are not limited to:

  * algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees
  * data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching
    in strings, images and trees
  * coding and data compression
  * bioinformatics
  * information retrieval
  * string processing algorithms in databases
  * searching for regularities
  * natural language processing



INVITED TALK:

  * The Road Coloring and Cerny Conjecture
    A. Trakhtman, Bar-Ilan University, Israel



SUBMISSION:

Authors are cordially invited to submit their full papers (PostScript
or PDF format, 10-15 pages, A4 page format) by May 12, 2008. The paper
should start with the title, each author's name, affiliation, and
e-mail address, and a one-paragraph summary of the results and
ideas. The paper should be submitted via submission server. For
details see conference web page http://www.stringology.org/event/2008.

For their final version the papers are required to be prepared using
our new LaTeX style available at http://www.stringology.org/pscproc2
which has an interface compatible to LNCS style.

  * Submission of Papers: May 12, 2008
  * Notification of Acceptance: June 26, 2008

HISTORY:

PSC'08 was preceded by Prague Stringology Workshops in 1996-2000 and
by Prague Stringology Conferences in 2001-2006. Each year proceedings
are prepared for the conference. They are published by Czech Technical
University in Prague and are also available from the PSC web
pages. Selected papers from the later workshops were also published in
a special issue of the journal Kybernetika. Selected papers from the
2002-2006 conferences were then published in the Nordic Journal of
Computing, Journal of Automata, Languages, and Combinatorics, and
International Journal of Foundations in Computer Science.


LOCATION:

PSC'08 will be held in the Department of Computer Science &
Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague on September
1-3, 2008. The working language is English. As usual, accepted papers
will appear in conference proceedings published by the Czech Technical
University in Prague and distributed at the conference. After further
refereeing, selected papers will then be published in an international
journal.

The conference venue is located in the historical center of Prague on
which all cultural epochs left their mark and it is for centuries a
political, social, and cultural center of European significance.
