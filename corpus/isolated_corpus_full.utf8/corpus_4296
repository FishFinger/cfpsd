Intetain 2009, Amsterdam, 22-24th June 2009 
Third International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for 
Interactive Entertainment

==================
==== OVERVIEW ==== 
==================
The Human Media Interaction (HMI) department of the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering  (ICST) are pleased to announce the Third International Conference on Intelligent Technologies for Interactive Entertainment to be held on June 22-24, 2009 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

INTETAIN 09 intends to stimulate interaction among academic researchers and commercial developers of interactive entertainment systems. We are seeking long (full) and short (poster) papers as well as proposals for interactive demos. In addition, the conference organisation aims at an interactive hands-on session along the lines of the Design Garage that was held at INTETAIN 2005. Individuals who want to organise special sessions during INTETAIN 09 may contact the General Chair, Anton Nijholt (a.nijholt@ewi.utwente.nl).

The global theme of this third edition of the international conference is âPlayful interaction, with others and with the environmentâ.

Contributions may, for example, contribute to this theme by focusing on the Supporting Device Technologies underlying interactive systems (mobile devices, home entertainment centers, haptic devices, wall screen displays, information kiosks, holographic displays, fog screens, distributed smart sensors, immersive screens and wearable devices), on the Intelligent Computational Technologies used to build the interactive systems, or by discussing the Interactive Applications for Entertainment themselves.

========================
==== CALL FOR DEMOS ====
========================
We actively seek proposals from both industry and academia for interactive demos to be held during a dedicated session at the conference. Demos may accompany a long or short paper. Also, demos may be submitted at a later deadline instead, with a short, two page extended abstract explaining the demo and showing why the demo would be a worthwhile contribution for the INTETAIN 09's demo session.

== Format ==
Demo submissions should be accompanied by the following additional information:
 * A short description of the setup and demo (2 paragraphs)
 * Requirements (hardware, power, network, space, 
     sound conditions, etc, time needed for setup)
 * A sketch or photo of the setup

Videos showing the demonstration setup in action are very welcome.

== Review ==
Demo proposals will be reviewed by a review team that will take into account aspects such as novelty, relevance to the conference, coverage of topics and available resources.

== Topics == 
 * Topics for demo submissions include, but are not limited to:
 * New technology for interaction and entertainment
 * (serious) gaming
 * New entertainment applications
 * BCI
 * Human Music Interaction
 * Music technology
 * Edutainment
 * Exertion interfaces
