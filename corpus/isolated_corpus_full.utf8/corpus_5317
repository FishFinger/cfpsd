IATL 25, the 25th annual meeting of the Israel Association for Theoretical
Linguistics, will be held at Ben Gurion University of the Negev on October
12-13, 2009. Submissions are invited for papers presenting high quality,
previously unpublished research in all areas of theoretical linguistics
(interpreted broadly to include psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics). IATL
publishes on-line proceedings in which all accepted and alternate papers appear.

Submission:
Please submit abstracts (maximum length 2 pages, including references) via our
on-line submission site at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iatl25

Register at the site as an author, and when you receive a password, you can
enter the site and submit your abstract. The abstract should be submitted *in
PDF format* through the 'Upload Paper' section near the bottom of the page.
(Note: Higher up on the page, in the 'Title and Abstract' section, there is a
box for a plain-text abstract. Since we do not require a shorter abstract, you
may simply retype the title of the paper in the abstract box.)

Deadline: May 31, 2009. Submissions received after this date will not be considered.

Not more than one single-authored abstract per person, plus one co-authored
abstract.

Important Dates:
May 31, 2009: abstract submission deadline
