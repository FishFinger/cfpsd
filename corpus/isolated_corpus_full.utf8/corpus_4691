What: An international first Australian Workshop on Afro-Asiatic Linguistics
(AWAAL). All disciplines welcome. Papers -- by established scholars, as well as
by promising graduate students -- will analyze Semitic languages (e.g. Arabic,
Amharic, Aramaic, Hebrew, and to a certain extent Israeli) and other
Afro-Asiatic languages (e.g. Berber, Somali, Oromo, Omotic). 

Where: Great Court, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Brisbane,
Queensland, Australia (Driving distance from Byron Bay, Montville, Noosa and
Sunshine Coast, Fraser Island, Stradbroke Island, Surfers Paradise and Gold
Coast...)

When: 11-13 September 2009

Why then: (1) On Saturday, 12 September 2009, in the evening, participants will
have the opportunity to watch the spectacular QBE RiverFire (see links below);
(2) The weather in bustling and beautiful Brisbane -- also known in Ashkenazic
Hebrew as Bris bane haBesorim) "covenant between the parts" (see Genesis 15) --
is superbly moderate, especially in April-October; (3) This year blooming and
booming Queensland celebrates 150 years of independence from New South Wales.

How: Abstracts should be emailed to Ghil'ad Zuckermann at gz@uq.edu.au 
(http://www.zuckermann.org/)  BY 1 May 2009. (Notifications will be sent BY 11
