Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

CSEDU 2010 (the 2th International Conference on Computer Supported Education - http://www.csedu.org) has an open call for papers, whose deadline is at October 21st. We hope you can participate in this prestigious conference by submitting a paper reflecting your current research.

Organized by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communications (INSTICC) and technically co-sponsored by Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), CSEDU 2010 is becoming an important yearly meeting place of top researchers and practitioners.

CSEDU will be held in Valencia, Spain next year, on April 7-10, 2010 and is co-located with WEBIST 2010 (6th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies - http://www.webist.org) which is an added-value for those delegates who share an interest in topic areas of both conferences.

The conference program will include a number of Keynote Lectures delivered by distinguished world-class researchers. Their names will be announced soon at the conference website.

Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and CD-ROM support. The proceedings will be indexed by several major international indexers, including INSPEC, DBLP and we are awaiting the confirmation of indexation by EI and Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

Best paper awards will be distributed during the conference closing session.

All published papers will be also available at the INSTICC's Digital Library, which will be made available shortly.

Please check further details at the CSEDU 2010 conference web site (http://www.csedu.org). There you will find detailed information about the conference structure and its main topic areas. 

Workshops and special sessions are also invited. If you wish to propose a workshop or a special session, for example based on the results of a specific research project, please send a proposal to the CSEDU secretariat. Workshop chairs and Special Session chairs will benefit from logistics support and other types of support, including secretariat and financial support, to facilitate the development of a valid idea.

Should you have any question or suggestion please don't hesitate to contact me.


Kind regards,
Bruno Encarnacao
