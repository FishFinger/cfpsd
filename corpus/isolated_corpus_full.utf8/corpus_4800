of language to present new research and participate in workshops and data
sessions with plenaries and local faculty.  Both paper and panel submissions
should address the relationship of language to culture and society.

Panel proposals of up to 250 words should be submitted by April 21, and will be
posted to the conference website for those interested in coordinating papers on
a particular topic (panel submissions do not need to be accompanied by paper
abstracts).  Abstracts of 500 words for 20-minute papers may be submitted for an
individual panel or independently, and should be submitted before May 7. 

Submissions should be sent as attachments (DOC or PDF) via email to

the paper. The body of the email should contain the following information:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
