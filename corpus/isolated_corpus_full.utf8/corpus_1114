Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
Since the turn of the century there has been a heightened activity within a
series of type-theoretical formalisms bearing a family resemblance to one
another. All of these adopt the pheno/tecto distinction or undirectedness in one
way or another and claim various descriptive and formal advantages. The workshop
intends to bring together researchers in this now very active field.

Workshop Organizer:
    Reinhard Muskens

Workshop Purpose:
    In 1961 Haskell Curry published his by now famous paper on 'Some
    Logical Aspects of Grammatical Structure'. In this paper (large
    parts of which had already been written in the 1940's) he made a
    distinction between the 'tectogrammatics' and 'phenogrammatics' of
    language (a distinction similar to that between abstract syntax
    and concrete syntax in compiler theory), while also arguing against
    directionality in the type system used for language
    description. In 1953 Bar-Hillel had introduced a distinction
    between categories seeking material to their right and categories
    seeking material to the left. To date most categorial grammarians
    follow Bar-Hillel in this, but in Curry's architecture
    phenogrammatical structure can take care of word order, making
    directionality unnecessary.

    Curry's proposal was part of a classical phase in categorial
    grammar that started with Ajdukiewicz's paper on syntactic
    connexity and also included Joachim Lambek's pivotal work on the
    introduction of hypothetical reasoning. It led to many
    follow-ups. For example, in Richard Montague's work the
    tectogrammatics/phenogrammatics distinction reappeared as one
    between analysis trees and surface strings, while Montague also
    added a level of meaning as a third component. The grammatical
    architecture thus became one in which a central abstract component
    is interpreted on two levels. An explicit connection between
    Montague's set-up and that of Curry was given in David Dowty's
    work in the 1980's. Also in the 1980's, Aarne Ranta used the idea
    in a constructive type theory setting, while Reinhard Muskens used
    it for his Partial Montague Grammar and Johan van Benthem explored
    the logical and linguistic implications of LP, the undirected
    version of the Lambek Calculus, or, in other words, the logic of
    simply typed linear lambda terms. Later years brought Richard
    Oehrle's insight that the interpreting levels of the theory (not
    only semantics but also phenogrammar) can be represented with the
    help of lambda terms. Since the central abstract component
    consists of LP derivations in Oehrle's set-up, equivalent with
    linear lambda terms, in fact all levels of the grammar can now be
    represented with the help of lambda terms and the typed lambda
    calculus becomes the central mechanism for grammatical description
    (as it had been in Cresswell's lambda-categorial languages).

    We mention 
    Abstract Categorial Grammars (de Groote), De Saussure     
    Grammar (Kracht), Minimalist Categorial Grammars (Lecomte, Retore),
    Lambda Grammars (Muskens), Higher Order Grammar (Pollard),
    and the Grammatical Framework (Ranta).
    The workshop intends to bring together researchers in this now very active   
    field. It aims to provide a forum for advanced PhD students
    and researchers, enabling them to present their work and to discuss
    it with colleagues who work in the broad subject areas
    represented at ESSLLI.

Workshop Topics:
    We solicit contributions on all aspects of undirected
    type-theoretic grammars, including their parsability, their
    learnability, their psycholinguistic adequacy, and various
    applications in syntax and semantics. We are also interested in
    practical issues relating to natural language processing and more
    theoretical issues such as the abstract/concrete syntax
    distinction in linguistics and computer science, the relation to
    compiling theory and the relation of undirected type-theoretic
    grammars to other linguistic formalisms. Particularly welcome are
    also contributions discussing the minimal requirements the
    approach imposes on the type theory that is used.

Submission Details:
    Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract describing
    original work. The extended abstract should not exceed two pages
    and should be in the PDF format. Since reviewing will be
    anonymous, please make sure that your abstract does not contain
    author's names or references from which author identities can
    easily be deduced. Please upload your submission at the EasyChair
    website of the workshop, www.easychair.org/NDTTG2007/, by the
    deadline listed below. Submissions will be reviewed by the
    workshop's programme committee and additional reviewers. The
    accepted papers, which can be worked out to a maximum of 4000
    words, will appear in the workshop proceedings published by
    ESSLLI.

Workshop format: 
    The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI
    participants. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over
    five consecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI. There will be 2
    slots for paper presentation and discussion per session. On the
    first day the workshop organizer will give an introduction to the
    topic.

Invited Speakers:
    David Dowty
    Richard Oehrle

Local Arrangements:
    All workshop participants including the presenters will be
    required to register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors
    presenting a paper will correspond to the early student/workshop
    speaker registration fee. Moreover, a number of additional fee
    waiver grants will be made available by the ESSLLI organizing
    committee on a competitive basis and workshop participants are
    eligible to apply for those.

    There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and
    accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding
    funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for
    the possibilities of a grant.
