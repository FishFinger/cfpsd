			     3rd CALL FOR PAPERS

		ACL 2005 WORKSHOP ON DEEP LEXICAL ACQUISITION

     Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)

				30 June, 2005

				Ann Arbor, USA

		 http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/acl2005/

		     Submission deadline: 11 April, 2005


WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

In natural language processing (NLP), there is a pressing need to
develop deep
lexical resources (e.g. lexicons for linguistically-precise grammars,
template
sets for information extraction systems, ontologies for word sense
disambiguation). Such resources are critical for enhancing the
performance of
systems and for improving their portability between domains. For
example, to
perform reliably, an information extraction system needs access to
high-quality lexicons or templates specific to the task at hand.

Most deep lexical resources have been developed manually by
lexicographers. Manual work is costly and the resulting resources have
limited
coverage, and require labour-intensive porting to new tasks. Automatic
lexical
acquisition is a more promising and cost-effective approach to take, and
is
increasingly viable given recent advances in NLP and machine learning
technology, and corpus availability.

While advances have recently been made in some areas of automatic deep
lexical
acquisition, a number of important challenges need addressing before
benefits
can be reaped in practical language engineering:

 * Acquisition of deep lexical information from corpora

 While corpus data has been successfully applied in learning certain
types of
 deep lexical information (e.g. semantic relations, subcategorization,
 selectional preferences), there remain a broad range of lexical
relations
 that corpus-based techniques have yet to be applied to.

 * Accurate, large-scale, portable acquisition techniques

 One of the biggest current research challenges is how to improve the
 accuracy of existing acquisition techniques further, at the same time
as
 improving both scalability and robustness.

 * Use of deep lexical acquisition in recognised applications

 Although lexical acquisition has the potential to boost performance in
many
 NLP application tasks, this has yet to be demonstrated for many
important
 applications.

 * Multilingual deep lexical acquisition

 For theoretical and practical reasons it is important to test whether
 techniques developed for one language (typically English) can be used
to
 benefit research on other languages.



TARGET AUDIENCE

The workshop will be of interest to anyone interested in automatically
acquired deep lexical information, e.g. in the areas of computational
grammars, computational lexicography, machine translation, information
retrieval, question-answering, and text mining.  Areas of Interest

 * Automatic acquisition of deep lexical information:
   o subcategorization
   o diathesis alternations
   o selectional preferences
   o lexical / semantic classes
   o qualia structure
   o lexical ontologies
   o semantic roles
   o word senses
     etc.

 * Methods for supervised, unsupervised and weakly supervised deep
lexical
   acquisition (machine learning, statistical, example- or rule-based,
hybrid
   etc.)

 * Large-scale, cross-domain, domain-specific and portable deep lexical
   acquisition

 * Extending and refining existing lexical resources with automatically
   acquired information

 * Evaluation of deep lexical acquisition

 * Application of deep lexical acquisition to NLP applications (e.g.
machine
   translation, information extraction, language generation,
   question-answering)

 * Multilingual deep lexical acquisition



IMPORTANT DATES

    Paper submission deadline: 11 April, 2005

    Notification date: 2 May, 2005

    Camera-ready submission deadline: 16 May, 2005

    Workshop date: 30 June, 2005



SUBMISSION DETAILS

Requirements

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of
completion
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation
results
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness,
originality,
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and
interest
to the attendees.

A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop, cannot be presented
or have
been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other conferences or
workshops
must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain
significant
overlap with previously published work.  Reviewing

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Each submission will be
reviewed by
at least three programme committee members.  Submission Information

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should
not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend
the
use of ACL-05 LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files. They are
available at http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/styles/. A description of the
format is also available in case you are unable to use these style files
directly. Papers must conform to the official ACL-05 style guidelines,
and we
reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these
styles
including font size restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's
identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith,
1991)
...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected
without review.


*** REVISED SUBMISSION INFORMATION ***

Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format via the START
Conference Manager at:

    http://www.softconf.com/start/ACL05_DLA/

The contact author of the paper will receive an auto-generated
notification of
receipt via email.

Address any queries regarding the submission process to:

    dla-acl2005@unimelb.edu.au
