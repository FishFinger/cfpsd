Call for Papers

Genericity: Interpreation and Uses (Conference I)
May 11-12-13, 2009
ENS (Ecole Normale Supérieure)
Paris - France

Invited Speakers:
Nicholas Asher (IRIT / University of Texas at Austin)
Ariel Cohen (Ben Gurion University)
Francis Corblin (Université Paris Sorbonne)
Veneeta Dayal (Rutgers University)
Carmen Dobrovie-Sorin (CNRS / Paris VII)
Manfred Krifka (ZAS Berlin)
Christopher Piñón (Université Lille III)

Since the publication of the collective work 'The Generic Book' (Carlson &
Pelletier (ed.), 1995), research on genericity has developed in various
directions. The principal merit of 'The Generic Book' was to establish a unified
terminology, which paved the way for very detailed and specific studies, whose
results are intended to be cumulative. 

Since then, much of the research has focused on syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic issues and important advances have been made in each of these fields
and at their interfaces. The goal of the conference is to bring together
theoreticians of different horizons articulating linguistic issues with logical
and philosophical ones. 

The conference welcomes papers on different languages clearly articulating
empirical and formal issues, including but not limited to the following topics: 
ILP SLP distinction 
Kind terms
Generic Determiners
Generic Quantification
Focus
Frequency Adverbs
GEN / HAB distinction 
Dispositions
Tense and Aspect in generic sentences
Free choiceness and genericity
Genericity and modality

Call for Papers

Workshop Description
The Innovative Use of NLP in Educational Applications workshops have fostered
interaction and collaboration among researchers in intelligent tutoring systems
(ITS) using text and speech, scoring of free-response assessments and
proofreading tools. This workshop will continue to explore NLP technologies with
the goal of identifying novel use of NLP techniques and tools for the
development of educational applications.

We are increasing the scope of the workshop to (1) include a demo and poster
session and (2) begin to plan for the first shared task of the workshop:
grammatical error detection and correction of articles and prepositions (for
2010 workshop).

Full paper, demo and poster submission topics will include, but will not be
limited to the following:
1) Automated scoring/evaluation for oral and written student responses
- Content analysis for scoring/assessment
- Grammatical error detection and correction
- Discourse and stylistic analysis
- Plagiarism detection
- Machine translation for assessment, instruction and curriculum development

2) Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods
- Dialogue systems in education
- Hypothesis formation and testing
- Multi-modal communication between students and computers
- Generation of tutorial responses
- Knowledge representation in learning systems
- Concept visualization in learning systems

3) Learner cognition
- Assessment of learners' language and cognitive skill levels
- Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional states
- Tools for learners with special needs

4) Use of corpora in educational tools
- Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
- Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement

5) Tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers
- NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
- Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify appropriate texts
- Tools that automatically generate test questions - such as multiple choice or
short answer
- Processing of and access to lecture materials across topics and genres
- Adaptation of instructional text to individual learners' grade levels assist
in text-based curriculum development
- E-learning tools for personalized course content
- Language-based educational games

6) Issues involving the shared tasks for the 2010 Workshop: Grammatical
error detection and correction

7) Issues concerning the evaluation of NLP-based educational tools

8) Descriptions of implemented systems
