Workshop on Designing the Australian National Corpus 

Description

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December 1st-5th 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Designing the Australian National Corpus.

This workshop focuses on current developments and emerging possibilities in corpus construction and usage for researchers working in Human Communication Sciences. Its aim is to bring together researchers with expertise in data representation and corpus building, as well as corpus annotation and interrogation, in a single forum in order (1) to disseminate leading work on corpus construction and usage to the broader research community in Australia and thereby contribute to collective knowledge about data collection and representation, and (2) to work towards the design and construction of an Australian National Corpus that is innovative in exploiting the full potential of the interface between language and technologies.

The workshop will include a keynote address by Professor Nancy Ide (Vassar College) who is the Technical Director of the American National Corpus. Professor Ide is the Co-Editor-in-Chief of Language Resources and Evaluation and of the Text, Speech and Language Technology book series (Springer), and has published widely in the areas of computational linguistics and corpus construction. The workshop will also include keynote addresses by Professor Pam Peters, author of the Cambridge Guide to English Usage and the Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage (CUP) and Director of the Dictionary Research Centre and Style Council Centre; and Dr Steve Cassidy, co-author of Techniques in Speech Acoustics (Kluwer) and a member of the Executive of the Australian Speech Science and Technology Association. 

Intended Audience

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers with expertise in corpus linguistics and language documentation, including those with a particular focus on English and other languages spoken in Australia, as well those with expertise in corpus building, corpus annotation and corpus interrogation. Those who are users of corpora in linguistics, language technologies and other disciplines are also warmly welcomed.

For enquiries about the workshop, contact Michael Haugh at m.haugh@griffith.edu.au.
