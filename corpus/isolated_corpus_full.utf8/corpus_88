COLLOQUIUM OVERVIEW

The Computational Linguistics and Language Technologies Group of the
Departments of Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering at The
Ohio State University are pleased to sponsor the second meeting of the
Midwest Computational Linguistics Colloquium (MCLC). This colloquium
offers a less formal forum for computational linguistics researchers to
get together and present ideas and work. The first meeting of MCLC was
successfully held at University of Indiana Bloomington in 2004, and with
this second installment it is on its way to becoming an annual event.
