VENUE

The conference will be held in Barceló Hotel Sants. The Barceló Hotel Sants is a deluxe hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. It stays about 15 minutes from the airport, 4 minutes to Plaza de Catalunya and 500 meters to the Fira de Barcelona. Considering the hotel is exactly above the train station, it allows traveling to anyplace. Most important is the fact that all the noise from the train station is undetected because the hotel is soundproofed. The Barcelo Hotel Sants also offers on site dining and is convenient to many shopping and entertainment venues.
