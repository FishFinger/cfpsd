FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

IceTAL 2010 - 7th International Conference on Natural Language
Processing
Reykjavik, Iceland
16-18 August 2010

Web page: http://icetal.ru.is


CONFERENCE OVERVIEW
-------------------
IceTAL 2010 - 7th International Conference on Natural Language
Processing - will take place on August 16-18, 2010, in Reykjavik,
Iceland. The conference is organized by the Iceland Centre for Language
Technology (ICLT) and will be held at the new premises of Reykjavik
University.

IceTAL is the seventh in the series of the TAL conferences, following
GoTAL 2008 (Gothenburg, Sweden), FinTAL 2006 (Turku, Finland), EsTAL
2004 (Alicante, Spain), PorTAL 2002 (Faro, Portugal), VexTAL 1999
(Venice, Italy) and FracTAL 1997 (Besan=E7on, France).

The main purpose of the TAL conference series is to bring together
scientists representing linguistics, computer science and related
fields, sharing a common interest in the advancement of computational
linguistics and natural language processing.


SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE
-----------------------
Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished
research on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural
language and speech processing, including, but not limited to:

    * phonetics, phonology, and morphology
    * speech recognition and speech synthesis
    * word segmentation, tagging, and chunking
    * syntax, parsing, and grammar formalisms
    * lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation
    * pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue
    * lexicon, lexical databases, and ontologies
    * generation and summarization
    * information retrieval, question answering, and information
extraction
    * machine translation, translation aids, and multilingual systems
    * dialogue systems and multimodal systems
    * language resources and tools
    * linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language
    * corpus linguistics
    * corpus-based language modeling
    * language learning and therapy
    * simulation and visualization
    * knowledge acquisition and representation
    * text and speech interfaces
    * text and speech classification
    * systems evaluation


PAPER SUBMISSION
-----------------------
We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic
that is of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging
research emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay
between linguistics, computer science and application domains such as
biomedicine, communication systems, public services, and educational
technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or
well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion
of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate,
results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical
significance for quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should
contain original material that has not been previously presented to the
scientific community. A parallel submission to other publication fora as
well as a significant overlap in contents with previously published work
should be clearly indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance,
technical quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two
categories:

    * full papers, describing substantial research with well-evaluated
results
    * short papers, typically describing ongoing research and
preliminary results

All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
conference proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented
as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions will be made using EasyChair. The URL will be given as soon
as the IceTAL submission service opens (in January).
The lengths and styles of submissions will also be specified then.


PROCEEDINGS
-----------
The previous four TAL conferences had proceedings published by Springer
as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series
(LNAI), a subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).
For IceTAL, this has not yet been confirmed (as of October 15th, 2009).
