Full Title: Biolinguistics 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics; Genetic Classification; Language Acquisition; Linguistic Theories; Morphology; Neurolinguistics; Philosophy of Language; Phonetics; Phonology; Psycholinguistics; Semantics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2007 

Second Call for Papers

Submissions to the new journal Biolinguistics are invited. 

The first issue of Biolinguistics is expected to come out in March 2007 and
we are inviting contributions to the sections 'Articles' (full-fledged
contributions), 'Briefs' (at most 2 pages commentaries, criticisms,
puzzles, suggestions), and 'Forum' (discussion, reports, overviews, surveys).

Like most journals, Biolinguistics is open for submission any time, hence
there is no fixed deadline, but for the first issue(s) we cannot reasonably
expect and accept any material submitted after the deadline indicated (31
January 2007). 

Focus and Scope

Biolinguistics is a peer-reviewed journal exploring theoretical linguistics
that takes the biological foundations of human language seriously. The
editorial board is made up of leading scholars from all continents in the
fields of theoretical linguistics, language acquisition, language change,
theoretical biology, genetics, philosophy of mind, and cognitive psychology.

Biolinguistics seeks to disseminate research globally to theoretically
minded linguists, linguistically minded biologists, cognitive scientists in
general, and anyone else with an interest in the scientific study of
language. The journal is concerned with the exploration of issues related
to theory formation within the biolinguistic program of generative grammar
as well as results drawn from experimental studies in psycho- and
neurolinguistics or cognition at large.

- Biolinguistics is conceived as an interactive online journal, not an
electronic version of a traditional print publication.
- Biolinguistics considers only original manuscripts and does not review
articles that have been published or are under consideration for
publication elsewhere.
- Biolinguistics has its own ISSN (1450-3417) and will shortly be
abstracted and indexed in the usual places.
- Access to the journal is free.

Peer-Review Process

Potential authors will have to register online in order to submit their
work, and the entire process will be dealt with electronically. Every
submission will be screened for relevance and topicality by the journal's
co-editors. Suitable submissions will be sent to two external
peer-reviewers, and at least one of the editors will also write a report in
coordination with the peer reviews received. Peer reviews can be expected
within 6-8 weeks of submission.

For further information, please visit the journal's website
(http://www.biolinguistics.eu) or contact the editors
(editors@biolinguistics.eu). 

Note: You have to be registered as 'author' to submit to the journal and as
'reader' to access the published issues. You can tick both boxes in your
initial registration, or you can contact the editors at a later stage to
add another role. Please do not subscribe twice!
