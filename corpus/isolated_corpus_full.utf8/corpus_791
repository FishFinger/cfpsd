                  FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     CONTEXT'07

The Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on
             Modeling and Using Context

                 August 20-24, 2007
            Roskilde University, Denmark

               Submissions deadlines:
         Full papers:                        March 15, 2007
         Poster and Demonstration abstracts: March 15, 2007

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sixth International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling
and Using Context (CONTEXT'07) will provide a forum for presenting and
discussing high-quality research and applications on context. The
conference will include paper and poster presentations, system
demonstrations, workshops, and a doctoral consortium. The conference
invites researchers and practitioners to share insights and
cutting-edge results from a wide range of disciplines including:

     Computer Science, especially
          Artificial Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing

     Cognitive Science           Linguistics

     Organizational Sciences     Philosophy

     Psychology         

     Application areas such as Medicine and Law

Context affects a wide range of activities in humans and animals as
well as in artificial agents and other systems. The importance of
context is widely acknowledged, and "context" has become an area of
study in its own right, as evidenced by numerous workshops, symposia,
seminars, and conferences on this area. CONTEXT, the oldest conference
series focusing on context, is unique in its emphasis on
interdisciplinary research.  Previous CONTEXT conferences have been
held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CONTEXT'97), Trento, Italy
(CONTEXT'99, LNCS 1688), Dundee, Scotland (CONTEXT'01, LNCS 2116),
Palo Alto, U.S.A. (CONTEXT'03, LNCS 2680), and Paris, France
(CONTEXT'05, LNCS 3554).

Each of these brought together researchers and practitioners from many
disparate fields to discuss and report on context-related research and
projects.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------

The following list illustrates sample research areas whose
perspectives on context are solicited for the conference. This is not
an exhaustive list, and contributions addressing context from other
perspectives are welcome.  The conference scope includes the
contextual issues related to areas such as:

Analogy and Case-Based Reasoning    Intelligent/Semantic Web Systems 
Autonomous Agents and Agent-based   Knowledge Engineering and Management
    Systems                         Knowledge Representation 
Cognitive Modeling                  Language Understanding and Production
Concepts and Categorization         Learning 
Context-Aware Applications and      Memory, Representation and Access 
    Systems                         Multiagent Systems and Interagent 
Databases                               Communication
Distributed Information Systems     Neuroscience 
Formal Semantics and Pragmatics
Formal Theories of Context          Ontology Management 
Heterogeneous Information           Organizational Theory and Design 
    Integration                     Perception 
Human Decision-Making and Decision  Philosophical Foundations of Context
Support Systems                     Problem Solving and Planning
Human-Centered Computing            Reasoning
Human-Computer Interaction          Relevance Computation and Relevance
Information Management                  Theories
Intelligent Tutoring Systems        Situated and Distributed Cognition
Intelligent User Interfaces         Ubiquitous Computing


CONFERENCE EVENTS
-----------------

CONTEXT'07 will include paper presentation sessions, a poster and
demonstration session, two days of workshops, and a doctoral
consortium. Workshops and the doctoral consortium will circulate
separate calls for papers and participation, which will also be
available at the conference web site.


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND SUBMISSION CATEGORIES
---------------------------------------------

Because CONTEXT'07 will be an interdisciplinary forum, all submissions
will be evaluated both for their technical merit and for their
accessibility to an interdisciplinary audience. Works that transcend
disciplinary boundaries are especially encouraged.

Submissions may be for full papers, poster abstracts, or demonstration
abstracts. Full papers will be accepted either for oral presentation
or for presentation at a poster session. All accepted full paper
submissions will be published in the proceedings. Accepted posters and
demonstrations will be presented at the poster session, and the
associated abstracts will be published in a brochure distributed to
attendees. For additional details see the conference web site.

For a paper to appear in the proceedings, at least one author must
register for the conference by the deadline for camera-ready copy.


SUBMISSION PROCEDURES
---------------------

Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files. Submissions
cannot exceed 14 pages in the Springer LNAI format. Detailed
formatting and submissions instructions, as well as LaTeX and Word
templates, will be available in the author instructions section of the
conference Web site.

All accepted authors will have the option of presenting a system
demonstration at the poster session. Authors wishing to present a
demonstration without an accompanying paper must submit a
demonstration abstract. Demonstration abstracts should describe
cutting-edge systems not described in paper submissions. Demonstration
abstracts should summarize the system's behavior and significance, and
should include at least one screen shot. If desired, they may also
include the URL of an informal video on the web. Demonstration
abstracts should be at most 2 pages long.


MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS POLICY
---------------------------

CONTEXT'07 will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission,
is under review for or has already been published or accepted for
publication in a journal or another conference. This restriction does
not apply to submissions for workshops and other venues with a limited
audience.
