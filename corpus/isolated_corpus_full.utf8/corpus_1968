Association for Slavonic and East European Studies 2008 

Final Call: Deadline for Abstracts is 1 October 2007.

Annual Conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies 2008

Call for Papers in Languages and Linguistics

The annual conference of the British Association for Slavonic and East European
Studies (BASEES) will take place at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge
(UK), between 29-31 March 2008. Abstracts are invited for individual 20-minute
papers or for entire panels (2-3 papers) in any area of Slavonic philology,
linguistics, language teaching, and translation studies. The working languages
of the conference are English and Russian.

At this year's conference we had around thirty papers in formal linguistics,
historical linguistics, applied linguistics, semiotics, language teaching, and
translation studies presented by academics and graduate students from
institutions in the UK and abroad. The annual convention as a whole brings
together scholars from a wide range of disciplines including literary studies,
linguistics, cultural studies, history, economics, politics, sociology, film and
media studies as they pertain to Central and Eastern Europe and to the former
Soviet Union.

Abstracts (250 words or less) for languages and linguistics papers or panels
should be sent using a form available at www.basees.org.uk by 1 October 2007 via
email to David Willis at:
dwew2@cam.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description
The workshop addresses the issue of using 'metadata' of different kinds
(e.g. captions, accompanying text, user-generated tags/labels, etc.) for
organizing, sharing and processing images. 

Second Call for Papers

International Workshop on

''Metadata Mining for Image Understanding'' (MMIU)
http://www.visapp.org/MMIU.htm

A Satellite event of the
3rd International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications
(VISAPP),
22 - 25 January, 2008, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal
http://www.visapp.org/index.htm

Chairs
Gabriela Csurka, XEROX Research Centre Europe, France
Katerina Pastra, Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Greece

Scope
The number of digital images being generated, stored, managed and shared
through the internet is growing at a phenomenal rate. Press and photo
agencies receive and manage thousands or millions of images per day and
end-users (e.g. amateur reporters) can easily participate into the related
professional workflows. In an environment of approximately one billion
photos, searchable in online databases worldwide, finding  the most
relevant or the most appealing image for a given task (e.g. to illustrate a
story) has become an extremely difficult process. In these huge
repositories, many images have additional information coming from different
sources.

Information related to the image capture such as date, location, camera
settings or name of photographer is often available from the digital camera
used to take the photograph. The owner can further add a relevant title,
filename or/and descriptive caption or any other textual reference. If the
image is uploaded to a shared photo collection, additional comments are
frequently added to the image by other users. On the other hand, images
used in documents, i.e. web pages, frequently have captions and surrounding
text. All this information can be considered image metadata and is of value
for organizing, sharing, and processing images.

However, it is not always evident how to exploit the information contained
in such metadata in an intelligent, generic or task-specific way. Linking
this information with the actual image content is still an open challenge.
The aim of this workshop is to offer a meeting opportunity for researchers,
content providers and related user-service providers to elaborate on the
needs and practices of digital image management, to share ideas that will
point to new directions on using metadata for image understanding and to
demonstrate related technology representative of the state of the art and
beyond. 

Research paper topics that may be addressed include, but are not limited to:

- image metadata pattern discovery and mining  
- interaction of image metadata and visual content
- image and video metadata enrichment
- automatic metadata creation
- hybrid collaborative and machine learning techniques for metadata
creation and/or fusion
- cross image-text categorization and retrieval
- image auto-captioning  and annotation transfer
- learning user preferences, aesthetical and emotional measures from
opinion mining
- integration of camera settings with image categorization, retrieval or
enhancement
- application-specific issues of metadata mining:
integration of visual  and geo-location information for improved virtual
tourism
stock-photo
web-based image retrieval

Important Dates
Full Paper Submission: October 15, 2007
Authors Notification: November 7, 2007
Final Paper Submission and Registration: November 19, 2007

Submission of Papers
Prospective authors are invited to submit papers in any of the areas listed
above. All papers must be written in English, and the length should not
exceed 10 pages for oral presentations and 6 pages for posters (including
figures and tables).

available at the following web page: http://www.grapp.org/paper_templates.htm

Papers (preferably in PDF format) should be submitted electronically via
the web-based submission system at: http://www.grapp.org/paper_submission.htm

Workshop Proceedings

proceedings book with an ISBN reference, which will be issued by INSTICC
Press. The proceedings will be available at the time of the workshop. There
will be also a CD-ROM publication.

Publication
