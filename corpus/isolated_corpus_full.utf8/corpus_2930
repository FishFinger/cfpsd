Dear colleague,

We would like to draw your attention to the International Workshop on Architectures, Concepts and Technologies for Service Oriented Computing (http://www.icsoft.org/ACT4SOC.htm) whose paper submission deadline is approaching rapidly - next April 15. If you need a couple more days please inform the secretariat. 
The goal of this workshop is to focus on the fundamental challenges related to SOA, to discuss what architectural/theoretical foundation is needed, and how this foundation can be supported by new or (extensions of) available technologies and infrastructures. The workshop aims at contributing to the dissemination of research results, establishment of a better understanding, and  identification of new challenges, by bringing together academic and industrial researchers interested in the future of service-oriented architecture. 
Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
Service usage issues
     - service registration, update, de-registration
     - service discovery, matching, selection
      - service invocation, interaction
     - service mediation, orchestration
Service design issues
     - model-driven development, platform-independence
     - service interoperability, matching and composition
     - ontology-centered design
     - requirements-functionality alignment
Service infrastructure issues
     - architectural patterns
     - service registry management
     - quality-of-service management
      - cross-domain service delivery
Service technology issues
     - specific technology platform solutions
      - language-specific solutions
      - tool support
      - applicability and performance experiences

Best regards
ACT4SOC Secretariat
