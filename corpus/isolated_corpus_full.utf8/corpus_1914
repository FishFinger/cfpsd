linguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives that will be held at Università

your view on linguistic and sociolinguistic phenomena involving the contact of
Berber languages whether within the Berber phylum or with languages of other
phyla, in North Africa or in the Diaspora, in ancient or present times. We
suggest that, during this two-day international conference, the exchange of
different approaches and data can shed light on the complexity of this theme.

Meeting Description:

A postgraduate translation symposium exploring the relationship between theory
and practice. 

The objective of the third postgraduate symposium, organized by the School of
Literature and Creative Writing, is to explore the current relevance of theory
to the practice of translation. There are theorists who maintain that a thorough
grounding in translation theory provides translators with the means to select
appropriate strategies and methods in their translation work. If this is the
case, which of the current theoretical pronouncements on translation are most
relevant to translation practice in today's society? And if so, how? Since the
integration of cultural and gender theories in the 20th Century and of cognitive
theories in this century how has research in translation studies changed? How
does learning translation theory develop a translator's cognitive capacities? Or
does theory merely describe practice? On the other hand many professional
translators are still widely dismissive of theory and its application to
real-life assignments; to what extent is there still a dichotomy between theory
and practice?

Turning to translation in the future, what kind of theoretical knowledge is it
necessary for translators to have in the modern day translation industry? The
growing connections between theory and practice means that translation
programmes have to balance theoretical and practical components in their
translator training curricula. So is theory a tool for more effective training?
Or, conversely, should translator training focus more on the development of
practical translation skills such as text interpretation, composition,
researching and editing? 

Areas for consideration:

The relationship between theory and creativity
Translation theories for the 21st Century: cultural studies; gender studies;
cognitive studies
Translation and its relation with linguistics
Functional theories of translation 
Postcolonial translation and identity
Domesticating and foreignizing texts
Descriptive translation studies approach: historical, social, political and
ideological factors
Corpus-based translation studies

Abstracts of max 300 words (with bibliographical references) for a 20 minute
paper should be sent by 10th November 2007 to translation.theory@uea.ac.uk .
Notification of acceptance of proposals will be given at the beginning of December.
It is the intention that selected papers will be submitted for publication. 

Organising committee: Karla Guadarrama and Rebecca Hyde Parker
