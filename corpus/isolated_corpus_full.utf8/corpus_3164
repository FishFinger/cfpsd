#####################################################################

2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on 
Web Intelligence (WI-08)

December 9-12, 2008, Sydney, Australia

http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/wi08/html/wi/

Sponsored By
IEEE Computer Society
Web Intelligence Consortium (WIC)
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

##################################################################
# (Papers Due: *** 10 July 2008 ***
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# by the IEEE Computer Society Press, which are indexed by EI.
##################################################################

WI 2008 provides a leading international forum of scientific research
and development to explore the fundamental roles as well as practical
impacts of Artificial Intelligence (e.g., knowledge representation,
planning, knowledge discovery and data mining, intelligent agents, and
social network intelligence) and advanced Information Technology
(e.g., wireless networks, ubiquitous devices, social networks, and
data/knowledge grids) on the next generation of Web-empowered
products, systems, services, and activities.

WI 2008 will be jointly held with the 2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT-08).  The two
conferences will have a joint opening, keynote, reception, and
banquet. Attendees only need to register for one conference and can
attend workshops, sessions, tutorials, panels, exhibits and
demonstrations across the two conferences. We are also planning a
joint panel, joint paper sessions, and doctor symposium that discuss
common problems in the two areas.

On-Line Submissions and Publication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

High-quality papers in all WI related areas are solicited. 
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 7 pages in the
IEEE 2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the
Author Guidelines of last year at
http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/AuthorKit.asp?Community=CPS&Facility=CPS_Nov&ERoom=WI+2007).  
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee 
on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity. 

Note that WI'08 will accept ONLY on-line submissions, containing 
PDF versions. Please use the Submission Form on the WI'08
website to submit your paper. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that are
indexed by EI.

Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 7 pages in the
proceedings and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference. 
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4
pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.

All co-authors will be notified at all time, for the submission,
notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper
to the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted,
at least one author should attend the conference to present the
paper. The acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published
on-line. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a
notification. 

A selected number of WI'08 accepted papers will be expanded and
revised for inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems: An
International Journal (http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and in
Annual Review of Intelligent Informatics
(http://www.wi-consortium.org/annual.html).

The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application
paper. Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the
best application paper award. 

More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form can be
found from the WI'08 homepage: http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/wi08/html/wi/.
