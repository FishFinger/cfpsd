Spanish and foreign researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). The conference will provide a forum for discussion and communication to
facilitate an effective exchange of knowledge and scientific materials that are

of means of collaboration with national and international Institutions that are
active in this field.

Call Deadline: 25-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

Session 'Migration and Language in Early-Modern Europe', European Social Science
History Conference (ESSHC), Lisbon, 27 February - 1 March 2008.
The aim of the session is to bring together social historians and linguists
working on issues concerning language in the context of migration and
urbanization in early-modern Europe, and to bring about an inter-disciplinary
exchange. 

Migration and Language in Early-Modern Europe, ESSHC

Proposals for papers are invited for a session on ''Migration and Language in
Early-Modern Europe'', as part of the Ethnicity and Migration Network, at the
European Social Science History Conference (ESSHC) in Lisbon, 27 February - 1
March 2008 (see http://www.iisg.nl/esshc).
 
Migration is relevant to the diachronic study of the European languages in that
it is one of the dimensions of the socio-historical space in which various
dialects and languages developed and influenced each other (cf. e.g. the project
''Variation and standardisation: the influence of language contact on the
emerging Dutch standard language (1400-1700)'', see
http://oase.uci.ru.nl/~varstan/en/index.html). 
At the same time, linguistic factors may have played a role in migratory
patterns on various scales.

The aim of the session is to bring together researchers working on issues
concerning language in the context of migration and urbanization in early-modern
Europe, and to bring about an inter-disciplinary exchange between social
historians and linguists.

Please send proposals for contributions (400 words max.) to Adrienne Bruyn
<mailto:a.bruyn@let.ru.nl> by 25 March 2007 at the latest.
