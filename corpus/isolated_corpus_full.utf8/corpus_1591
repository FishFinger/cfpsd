Meeting Description
This workshop is part of the 30th meeting of the German Linguistic Society
(DGfS), Bamberg 2008. 

Against a background of growing convergence among syntactic theories, the goals
of the workshop are: 1) to bring together researchers working on the local
modeling of non-local dependencies from different theoretical points of view; 2)
to discuss advantages and disadvantages of local treatments of non-local
dependencies; and 3) to compare different theoretical approaches. 

Local Modeling of Non-Local Dependencies in Syntax

Workshop, 30th meeting of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS)

February 27-29, 2008
Universität Bamberg 

Non-Local Dependencies
Syntactic dependencies may be non-local in the sense that they involve two
positions in a phrase structure whose correspondence cannot be captured by
invoking notions like ''clause-mate relation'' or (non-extended)
''predicate/argument structure''. A classic example that instantiates such a
non-local relation is the existence of long-distance movement dependencies in
natural languages (e.g., wh-movement, topicalization, etc.), where the displaced
item and its base position can in principle be separated by arbitrarily many
intervening clause boundaries. However, there are many other syntactic
dependencies that can also be non-local in this sense. For instance,
reflexivization is often confined to minimal predicate/argument structures, but
it may also apply non-locally in certain contexts, in certain languages (without
necessarily being amenable to an account in terms of logophoricity). Control of
the subject of an infinitive by an argument belonging to a matrix clause also
emerges as a non-local operation, at least in some analyses. Furthermore, many
languages (among them, e.g., Tsez, Itelmen, and Hindi, but also, strictly
speaking, Icelandic) exhibit instances of non-local agreement. Case assignment,
too, may in principle be non-local (i.e., it is not necessarily confined to
minimal predicate/argument structures); and tense relations between clauses are
non-local almost by definition. Finally, a particularly clear example of a
non-local dependency is the binding of pronouns that are interpreted as variables.

Local Modelling
By postulating successive cyclicity in the case of displacement phenomena (i.e.,
Comp-to-Comp movement), a non-local dependency was (to some extent) modeled as a
local phenomenon in classic transformational grammar. Subsequently, an even more
local treatment of movement dependencies was developed by Gerald Gazdar in the
framework of GPSG, by adopting Slash features that are passed on in minimal
subtrees; essentially, this kind of approach is still maintained in HPSG
analyses. Interestingly, recent analyses within the Minimalist Program
(including some of Chomsky's own work) converge with Slash feature percolation
approaches in that they assume that displacement phenomena involve minimal local
movement steps - not only to the edge of each phase (i.e., clause or predicate
phrase), but actually to the edge of each XP (see Jan Koster's recent work on
gap phrases). In the same vein, it has recently been proposed that
reflexivization should be modeled in a strictly local way (by invoking feature
percolation or extremely local movement steps) - both within HPSG analyses and
Minimalist analyses. Analogous considerations apply in the case of the other
non-local dependencies mentioned above.

Goals of the Workshop
Against the background of growing convergence among syntactic theories, the
goals of the workshop are: 1) to bring together researchers working on the local
modeling of non-local dependencies from different theoretical points of view; 2)
to discuss advantages and disadvantages of local treatments of non-local
dependencies; and 3) to compare different theoretical approaches. As far as this
last point is concerned, we believe that it may turn out that local analyses of
non-local phenomena developed in different kinds of syntactic theories (and
spanning the generative/declarative dichotomy) can be shown to not only share
identical research questions, but also, to a large extent, identical research
strategies. Needless to say, these considerations may apply not only to HPSG and
the Minimalist Program, but also to syntactic theories in which local approaches
to non-local dependencies are either an important building block per se (e.g.,
LFG, categorial grammar, in some sense also TAG), or in which local analyses
have recently come to the fore as viable alternatives to standard, non-local
approaches (e.g., optimality theory). Recurring questions arising in this
general area of research include the following: How can asymmetries between
different kinds of (basically non-local) dependencies be accounted for (e.g.,
displacement may often be non-local to a higher degree than reflexivization)?
And how can asymmetries between different languages with respect to the same
kinds of (basically non-local) dependencies be accounted for?

Call Deadline: 06-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description

The conference will be a venue for bringing together scholars, writers, language
teachers, researchers and other practitioners from around the world to discuss
issues pertaining the role of Filipino as a global language. Participants can be
teachers, researchers, program administrators/coordinators and other
practitioners who are directly involved in the promotion and nurturing of the
Filipino language,
literature and culture. This first conference is geared towards establishing a
tradition of scholarly meetings of this kind among practitioners in the field of
Filipino language, literature and culture studies.
