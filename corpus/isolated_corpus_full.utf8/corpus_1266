Meeting Description:

This ESSLLI 2007 workshop aims at bringing together linguists working to expand
their exemplar-based models by computational modeling, and computational
linguists interested in extending exemplar-based models to aspects of language
cognition. 

Final Call for Papers
Revised Deadline for Submissions; 22nd March
Exemplar-Based Models of Language Acquisition and Use
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~davec/workshop.htm
13 - 17 August 2007

organized as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organizers:
Rens Bod                rb@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
Dave Cochran                davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk

Workshop Topics:
- Unsupervised exemplar-based systems for parsing and other NLP  tasks;
Statistical grammar induction; bootstrapping in exemplar-based  models of
language, in computers and infants.
- The interaction between language and other cognitive modalities in 
exemplar-based systems; exemplar based semantics and pragmatics.
- The nature of linguistic knowledge and representations in exemplar- based systems.
- Distributional learning; Pattern matching and language acquisition
- Statistical, item-based and corpus-based language acquisition
- Exemplars, recency and priming.
- Cognitive consequences of the problems of computational complexity  in
exemplar-based algorithms and their solutions.
- Computational approaches to exemplar-based construction grammar; 
computational approaches to usage-based linguistics.
- Comprehension and generation in exemplar-based systems.
- Learning as abstraction vs. learning as storage; or, proposals for  integration.
- General theoretical/philosophical considerations regarding the  relation of
computational models to experimental cognitive research

We are particularly eager to receive submissions of an  interdisciplinary nature,
especially those bridging the gap between  computational and experimental
approaches.

Submission details:
Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of 1000-2000 words.  The
following formats are accepted: PDF, PS, and MS Word. Submissions  must be
suitable for anonymous review; reviewing will be double- blind. Please do not
include name, contact details, affiliation, or  any self-identifying references
(eg; ''We proved in Smith 2003?'',  rather than ''Smith 2003 proved?'') in the
text of the submission;  please include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment)
containing  the title of your submission, your name, contact details and 
affiliation. Please send your submission electronically to 
davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk by the deadline listed below. The  submissions will be
reviewed by the workshop's programme committee  and additional reviewers. The
accepted papers will appear in the  workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI.
The format for the final  versions will be MS Word.

Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI  participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over  five consecutive days in the
second week of ESSLLI. There will be 2  slots for paper presentation (30
minutes) and discussion (15 minutes) per session. On the first day the workshop
organizers will give an  extended lecture to familiarize the audience with the
topic.

the early student/workshop speaker  registration fee. Moreover, a number of
additional fee waiver grants  will be made available by the OC on a competitive
basis and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those.
