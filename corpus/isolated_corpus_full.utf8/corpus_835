         CALL FOR PAPERS

         ESWC 2007
         4th European Semantic Web Conference

         3 - 7 June 2007
         Innsbruck (Austria)

The vision of the Semantic Web is to enhance today's web via the
exploitation of machine-processable meta data. The explicit
representation of the semantics of data, enriched with domain theories
(Ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new
level of service. It will weave together a large network of human
knowledge and makes this knowledge machine-processable.  Various
automated services will help the users to achieve their goals by
accessing and processing information in machine-understandable
form. This network of knowledge systems will ultimately lead to truly
intelligent systems, which will be employed for various specialized
reasoning subsystems to accomplish complex tasks. Many technologies
and methodologies are being developed within Artificial Intelligence,
Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Databases, Multimedia
Systems, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering and Information
Systems that can contribute towards the realization of this vision.

The 4th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2007) will
present the latest results in research and application of Semantic Web
technologies, including knowledge mark-up languages, Semantic Web
services, and ontology management. ESWC 2007 will also feature a
special industry-oriented event, a forum for gaining a better
understanding of these new technologies and their business
aspects. The conference will offer a tutorial program to get up to
speed with European and global developments in this exciting new area.

Several distinguished scientists will give an invited talk at the
conference; among them, prof. Stefano Ceri (Tech. Univ. of Milan,
Italy), prof. Georg Gottlob (Oxford Univ., UK), prof. Ning Zhong
(Maebashi Institute of Technology, Japan).

ESWC 2007 is sponsored by ESSI - a group of European Commission 6th
Framework Programme projects. Together these projects aim to improve
world-wide research and standardisation in the area of the Semantic
Web. For more information on ESSI, please visit www.essi-cluster.org.


Submissions

ESWC 2007 welcomes the submission of excellent original research and
application papers dealing with all aspects of the Semantic Web,
particularly those related to the subject areas indicated by the
topics below. We particularly encourage the submission of papers on
industrial efforts and experiences with Semantic Web projects. We
encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications
papers.

The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Paper submission and
reviewing for ESWC 2007 will be electronic, via the conference Web
site: http://www.eswc2007.org/.  Papers, due 15 December, 2006, should
not exceed fifteen (15) pages in Springer LNCS format.

Papers may be accepted as (i) full papers, or as (ii) short papers
with poster presentation.

Abstract Submission: 8 December, 2006
Full Paper Submission: 15 December, 2006
Notification: 26 February, 2007

Conference Topics of Interest

Topics of interest to the conference include (but are not restricted  
to):

     * Ontology Management (creation, evolution, evaluation, etc.)
     * Ontology Alignment (mapping, matching, merging, mediation and
       reconciliation)
     * Ontology Learning and Metadata Generation (e.g. HLT and ML
       approaches)
     * Multimedia and Semantic Web
     * Semantic Annotation of Data
     * Semantic Web Trust, Privacy, Security and Intellectual Property
       Rights
     * Semantic Web Rules and Query Languages
     * Logics for the Semantic Web
     * Reasoning on the Semantic Web
     * Behavior in the Semantic Web
     * Searching, Querying, Visualizing, Navigating and Browsing the
       Semantic Web
     * Personalization and User Modelling
     * User Interfaces and Semantic Web
     * Semantic Grid and Middleware
     * Semantic Web Services (description, discovery, invocation,
       composition, choreography, etc.)
     * Semantic Web-based Knowledge Management (e.g. Semantic Desktop,
       Knowledge Portals)
     * Semantic Web for e-Business, e-Culture, e-Government, e-Health,
       e-Learning, e-Science
     * Database Technologies for the Semantic Web
     * Data Semantics and Web Semantics
     * Semantic Interoperability
     * Semantic Workflows
     * Semantic Web Mining

We particularly welcome application papers which clearly show benefits
of Semantic Web technologies in practical settings.
