Germans don't bullshit around much either. If we mean no, we say no
and if we mean yes we say yes. No flowery "Oh that would be lovely,
but unfortunately it is impossible for me to commit to this suggestion
due to....!"
It took me years of being snubbed as an impolite German until I
rememberd one of the first English lessons when I was ten: In Egnlish
you can NEVER use the words "yes" or "no" by themselves! Even if you
want to say just that, you'll have to add "it isn't" or "it is" or
"thank you"... I'm getting there I hope.

Ok, email off now, or I'll never get this paper done!
