Meeting Description

Conference 'Theoretical and Computational Perspectives on Underspecification'

Hosted by the SFB 732 'Incremental specification in context' at the
University of Stuttgart (Germany)

November 2-3, 2007

The SFB 732 Incremental specification in context, established in July 2006,
brings together scientists from the areas of linguistics, computational
linguistics and signal processing at the University of Stuttgart. Their
common scientific goals are to achieve a better understanding of the
mechanisms that lead to ambiguity control/disambiguation as well as the
enrichment of missing/incomplete information and to develop methods that
are able to fully describe these mechanisms. The basic hypothesis in the
SFB is that such processes generally involve specification of an
underspecified input.

As part of the SFB's effort to further external links, this conference aims
to bring together researchers from all areas of theoretical and
computational linguistics who are working on issues related to
underspecification. 

We are particularly interested in investigating the question of when and
where underspecification is a linguistically legitimate way of dealing with
ambiguity.

We are pleased to have the following invited speakers:

Rens Bod (St. Andrews)
Rita Manzini (Florence)

Call for papers for the conference 'Theoretical and Computational
Perspectives on Underspecification'

November 2-3, 2007

We invite unpublished contributions from all fields of linguistics
(including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonology, morphology, phonetics,
computational linguistics, processing).

Submissions

We invite abstracts for thirty-minute talks (followed by ten minutes of
discussion) on theoretical and computational approaches to
underspecification. We are particularly interested in investigating the
question of when and where underspecification is a linguistically
legitimate way of dealing with ambiguity.

Abstracts should not exceed two pages (letter-size/A4) in total length
(including data and references), with one-inch (2.54cm) margins all around,
typed in at least 11-point font. Submissions are restricted to one
individual and one joint abstract per author.

Please send an email to:
underspec[ at ]ifla.uni-stuttgart.de

The abstract itself should be attached as a PDF file and should be
completely anonymous. The email should use the subject header ''Abstract''
and should contain the following information in the body:

- Name(s) of author(s)
- Affiliation of author(s)
- Title of paper
- Email address for correspondence

The deadline for submissions is July 27, 2007. We will send out
notifications around September 15, 2007.
