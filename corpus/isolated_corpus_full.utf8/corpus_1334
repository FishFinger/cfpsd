Full Title: Semantic Content Acquisition and Representation 
Short Title: SCAR 

Date: 24-May-2007 - 24-May-2007
Location: Tartu, Estonia 
Contact Person: Magnus Sahlgren
Meeting Email: mange@sics.se
Web Site: http://www.sics.se/~mange/scar2007 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 02-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop provides a forum for researchers to present and discuss theories
and methods for semantic content acquisition and representation. Participants
will also be encouraged to apply their methods, or relate their theories, to a
specific test corpus. In this workshop, the relevance of an approach to meaning
is judged only by what it can tell us about real language data. 

Final Call for Papers
Workshop on Semantic Content Acquisition and Representation
(SCAR 2007)
http://www.sics.se/~mange/scar2007/
Pre-conference workshop NODALIDA
Thursday, May 24, Tartu, Estonia

Note: Deadline has been extended to April 2

Text (and language in general) has aboutness; it has meaning, or semantic
content. We as (computational) linguists are highly adept at dissecting text on
a number of different levels: we can perform grammatical analysis of the words
in the text, we can detect animacy and salience, we can do syntactic analysis
and build parse trees of partial and whole sentences, and we can even identify
and track topics throughout the text. However, we are comparatively inept when
it comes to identifying the semantic content, or meaning, of the text. Or, to
put matters in more concise terms, even though there are theories and methods
that claim to accomplish this, there is a striking lack of consensus regarding
both acquisition, representation, and practical utility of semantic content.

The aim of this workshop is not only to provide a forum for researchers to
present and discuss theories and methods for semantic content acquisition and
representation. The aim is also to discuss a common evaluation methodology
whereby different approaches can be adequately compared. As a first step in this
direction, participants will be encouraged to apply their methods, or relate
their theories, to a specific test corpus that will be available in several of
the Nordic languages and English. Participants will be expected to demonstrate
what kind of results their methods can yield. In this workshop, the relevance of
an approach to meaning is judged only by what it can tell us about real language
data. The overall purpose of this workshop is thus to put theories and models
into action.

Questions of interest include:

- Is there a place in linguistic theory for a situation- and speaker-independent
semantic model beyond syntactic models?

- What are the borders, if any, between morphosyntax, lexicon and pragmatics on
the one hand and semantic models on the other?

- Are explicit semantic models necessary, useful or desirable? (Or should they
be incidental to morphosyntactic and lexical analysis on the one hand and
pragmatic discourse analysis on the other?)

We encourage submissions in the following areas:

- Discussions of foundational theoretical issues concerning meaning and
representation in general.

- Methods for supervised, unsupervised and weakly supervised acquisition
(machine learning, statistical, example- or rule-based, hybrid etc.) of semantic
content.

- Representational schemes for semantic content (wordnets, vectorial, logic etc.).

- Evaluation of semantic content acquisition methods, and semantic content
representations (test collections, evaluation metrics etc.).

- Applications of semantic content representations (information retrieval,
dialogue systems, tools for language learning etc.).

Submission procedure:

Online submission is now open at http://www.easychair.org/SCAR2007/.
Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, and should use the ACL style
files available at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/. Since reviewing will
be blind, papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations, and
self-references should be avoided. Proceedings will be published electronically.

Important Dates:

Submission deadline: April 2
Notification of acceptance: April 26
Final papers due: May 7
Workshop: May 24

Location:

NODALIDA 2007, Tartu, Estonia.

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 07-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

Due to many requests, the following deadline has been extended 
Paper submission deadline: April 7, 2007 (FIRM)
The 2007 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration
(IEEE IRI-2007)
Sponsored by: The IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society
August 13-15, 2007,
Hilton Hotel, Las Vegas, USA
 http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~iri07/

With the rapidly increasing volumes of information in digital form, we are
constantly faced with newer challenges with regards to efficiently using it and
extracting useful knowledge from it. Information reuse and integration (IRI)
seeks to maximally exploit such available information to create new knowledge
and to reuse it for addressing newer challenges. It plays a pivotal role in the
capture, maintenance, integration, validation, extrapolation, and application of
knowledge to augment decision capabilities in various application domains. The
IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration conference
serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and
government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world
problems with real-world solutions. 

The IEEE IRI will feature contributed as well as invited papers. Theoretical and
applied papers are both included in this call. The conference program will
include special sessions, open forum workshops and keynote speeches. Several
funding agency program directors - including NSF, ONR, et al. - will present an
open panel discussion entitled Funding Opportunities in Information Reuse and
Systems Engineering.

The conference includes, but is not limited to, the areas listed below:
- Large Scale Data and System Integration
- Component-Based Design and Reuse
- Unifying Data Models (UML, XML, etc.) and Ontologies
- Database Integration
- Structured/Semi-structured Data
- Middleware & Web Services
- Reuse in Software Engineering

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $55,000. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2007 
LINGUIST List Superhero Adventure for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/donation/fund-drive2007/ 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
