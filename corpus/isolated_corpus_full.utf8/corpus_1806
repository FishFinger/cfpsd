                            ALTA WORKSHOP
       (Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop)
 
                    to be held in conjunction with
             the Australian Document Computing Symposium
 
                         Melbourne, Australia
 
               http://www.alta.asn.au/events/alta2007/
         
                     *** December 10-11, 2007 ***
    
** OVERVIEW
 
A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA).  This event
will be the fifth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

The ALTA Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Australian
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues ranging
from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards for
markup, through various aspects of document processing.

The goals of the workshop are: 
 
 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community 
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; 
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community 
   and with the wider international LT community; 
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; 
 * to encourage dissemination of research results; 
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research 
   and projects; 
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence 
   community to become aware of local LT research; 
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand 
   and overseas. 
 
As with the 2006 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in
addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive

discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the
same status in the proceedings.
 
** Topics
 
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:
 
 * speech understanding and generation; 
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, 
   and discourse; 
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language; 
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language; 
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval; 
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling; 
 * summarisation; 
 * machine translation and translation aids; 
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems; 
 * natural language and multimodal systems; 
 * message and narrative understanding systems; 
 * evaluations of language systems; 
 * computational lexicography. 
 
We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.
 
** Submission Format
 
Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages; this limit does not include
references (the aim being to encourage thorough citation of related
work, as is the policy in EMNLP
<http://www.cs.jhu.edu/EMNLP-CoNLL-2007/your-final-paper.html> this
year). We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or
Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's conference. The
style files and example documents are available from the workshop
website. We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not
conform to these styles including font and page size restrictions.
 
The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems,
please contact the organisers beforehand.
 
If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable.  All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations.  (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.)
 
Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the
workshop website.
Contact the organisers (workshop AT alta DOT asn DOT au) for any
questions regarding this process.
 
**Proceedings
 
A proceedings containing all papers (presentations and posters) will
be produced in paper and/or CD-ROM format. Each format will have an
ISBN number.

**Important Dates
 
 * Paper submission: September 3, 2007 
 * Submission date for Hons/Ugrad students: Sept 17, 2007 (see below) 
 * Notification of acceptance: October 5, 2007 
 * Camera-ready copy: October 19, 2007 
 * Workshop: December 10-11, 2007 
 
Note that we have instituted a later submission deadline for papers
with **first-named** authors that are current Honours or Undergraduate
students. If you qualify for this condition and plan to submit to this
deadline then you must register an "Intention to Submit" with the
workshop chairs by the normal submission due date (Sept 8).  Send an
email to the organisers (workshop AT alta DOT asn DOT au) with title,
authors, and abstract.
 
Also, note that ALTA is planning on subsidising students.
