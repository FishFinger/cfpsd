                       First Call For Papers
           AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTW)

                    November 30-December 1, 2006
                         Sydney, Australia
              http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2006/

                to be held in conjunction with the
                        HCSnet SummerFest
                      http://hcsnet.edu.au


Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event
will be the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

ALTW will be held in conjunction with the HCSnet SummerFest, a
multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of workshops, invited
courses and presentations around the theme of Human Communication
Science. The courses, offered at both introductory and more advanced
levels, will include topic areas aimed specifically at Language
Technology students and researchers.

The goals of the workshop are:

  * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community
    in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;
  * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community
    and with the wider international LT community;
  * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;
  * to encourage dissemination of research results;
  * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing
    research and projects;
  * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
    community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally,
  * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand
    and overseas.

As with the 2005 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in
addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive
discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the
same status in the proceedings.


Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:

  * speech understanding and generation;
  * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and
  * discourse;
  * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
  * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
  * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
  * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
  * summarisation;
  * machine translation and translation aids;
  * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
  * natural language and multimodal systems;
  * message and narrative understanding systems;
  * evaluations of language systems;
  * computational lexicography.

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.


Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and
example documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve
the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles
including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems,
please contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the
workshop website. Contact the organisers (workshop@alta.asn.au) for
any questions regarding this process.
