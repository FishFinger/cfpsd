Full Title: Exploring New Horizons in East Asian Literary and Linguistics 

Date: 10-Sep-2009 - 10-Sep-2009
Location: National Institutes of Chinese abnd Japanese Studies, Sheffield,
United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Workshop Newhorizons
Meeting Email: newhorizonsworkshop@gmail.com

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Ling & Literature; Text/Corpus

Call Deadline: 01-Jul-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop will be held in conjunction with Joint East Asian Studies
Conference, hosted by the British Associations of Chinese, Japanese and Korean
Studies. 

Call for Papers

The workshop calls for papers representing original and up-to-date research
pursued in the fields of Asian linguistics and literary studies which exemplify
the use of modern language corpora and related computational technology. 

Papers focusing on the importance of corpus material and methodology in
empirical literary and linguistic studies in East Asian languages, i.e. Chinese,
Japanese and Korean, will be particularly welcome. 

The rapid and conspicuous progress made by natural language engineering in
generating and processing quantitative linguistic data has provided us with a
solid and promising technical platform for modern humanistic research. However,
it would seem that when compared with contemporary linguistics in major western
languages, the great potential brought about language technology has not been
fully explored in modern literary and linguistic research in Asian languages. 

Therefore, the main purpose of the workshop is to explore the various
possibilities of using corpora and computer-aided tools in studying
literary/non-literary/translated texts, e.g. the construction and annotation of
purpose-specific language corpora; the extraction of meaningful units from
corpus texts; the use of quantitative methods in the detection and analysis of
stylistic variations in literary texts, etc. Authors of accepted abstracts will
be encouraged to submit a full version of their papers for possible publication
with an established academic publisher.

The deadline for abstract submission is 1st July, 2009.
Notification of abstract submission is 1st August, 2009

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any

that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
