International Conference
AMAZONICAS III: Phonology and Syntax
Date: April 19 - 24, 2010
Place: Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot=E1

The first two Amazonicas meetings, held in 2007 and 2008, were the successf=
ul
outcome of an international project between several linguistic research cen=
ters:
the Chair of Amazonian Languages at the VU University Amsterdam, CELIA
(CNRS-IRD) Paris, INPA Manaus and UFAM Manaus. The third edition, hosted by=
 the
Universidad Nacional de Colombia UNAL in Bogot=E1 and supported by the Inst=
ituto
Franc=E9s de Estudios Andinos IFEA, will be co-organized by the former team=
s and a
French-Colombian ECOS-Nord project (UNAL - U. Toulouse 2) focusing on
phonological and grammatical typology of Colombian languages.=20

Call for Papers

The focus topics of this meeting are:
1) The phonetics and phonology of laryngeal features (coordinators: Leo Wet=
zels,
Elsa Gomez-Imbert, Frantom=E9 Pacheco)
2) Valency increasing strategies (coordinators: Francesc Queixal=F3s, Ana C=
arla Bruno)
3) Lexical categorization (coordinators: Elsa Gomez-Imbert, Ana Mar=EDa Osp=

Thematic Information:

1. The phonetics and phonology of laryngeal features

In the indigenous languages of South-America, the features that specify the
glottal states of sounds (voice [+/- voice], aspiration [+/- spread glottis=
],
glottalization [+/- constricted glottis]) often interact with other feature=
s.
For example, glottalization may cause a creaky voice realization of contigu=
ous
vowels, implosivization or (pre)nasalization are often seen in combination =
with
voicing, voicelessness of onsets or codas may restrict the number of contra=
stive
tones in a syllable etc. Similarly, from a diachronic perspective,
glottalization may lead to a creaky voice opposition in vowels (or both),
aspiration may devoice consonants and vowels, prenasalized consonants may
develop into a series of plain nasal consonants, glottalization and aspirat=
ion
as well as voicing may lead to tonal oppositions. In a context where the
theoretical status of tone features is under debate (see the conference Ton=
es
and features, in honor of G. Nick Clements, Paris, 18-19 June 2009), the
synchronic interaction processes of phonological tones with laryngeal featu=
res
observed in several Amazonian languages is of great relevance for this deba=
te.
Also important is the fact that laryngeal features may present a strong ten=
dency
to function as prosodic features, as tones do, and may be used as devices t=
o
identify morphemic classes. The phonological session of the conference welc=
omes
papers that deal with the phonetics and phonology of laryngeal features and
tone, from a synchronic or diachronic perspective. Submissions may address
interactions of the kind exemplified above, but may also study different ki=
nds
of problems related to glottal features.

Anonymous submissions should be send to: Leo Wetzels wlm.wetzels@let.vu.nl
and Elsa Gomez-Imbert gomezimb@univ-tlse2.fr.

2. Valency increasing strategies

The languages of the Americas are rich and diverse with regard to the two m=
ain
mechanisms for valency increasing, i.e. causative and applicative (see Shib=
atani
2002, and Craig & Halle 1988, respectively). The Amazon is no exception in =
this
respect, and in fact, in this area, constructions such as the comitative
causative are found particularly frequently (Rose & Guillaume, forthcoming)=
. We
propose to collect original Amazonian data with respect to valency increasi=
ng,
and discuss the question of how the languages of this region contribute to =
the
knowledge of these mechanisms at the general typological level. Below we su=
pply
a few more specific topics that would be interesting to address in submissi=
ons
and during the discussions. At first sight, causative and applicative do no=
t
have much in common besides the introduction of a new central participant i=
n the
conditions of existence described by the predicate. In languages in which t=
here
is a clear hierarchy of grammatical relations, this new participant usually
enters the scene through the top (subject) in the causative, and through th=
e
bottom (object) in the applicative. Both, however, have a similar effect on=
 the
object position, since the latter should host the participant that is there=
by
being demoted (in the case of the causative) or promoted (for the applicati=
ve):
In verbs with a single argument the object position is created, whereas in =
verbs
that allow two object slots this brings about a competition between the
participant originally occupying the object position and the demoted / prom=
oted
participant.

On more formal grounds, it will be useful to test the idea that a verb deri=
ved
by an increase in valency cannot take more core arguments than the maximum
allowed by the non-derived verbs in the lexicon (Haspelmath & Muller-Bradey
2004). For example, a language without three-place verbs would not retain m=
ore
than two arguments in the applicative or causative of a two-place verb. The=
 most
interesting aspect of the morphosyntax of causatives is the fate of the cau=
see.
Usually, languages choose between two basic strategies, which we can refer =
to as
'leap-frog' and 'push-chain'. The first, attested in a way by =C9m=E9rillon=
 and
clearly identified long ago by Comrie (1974) in French, Turkish and other
languages, leads the causee, deprived of its subject position, to take the =
first
free position in a descending hierarchy of grammatical relations ((subject =
>)
direct object > indirect object > adjunct). The second, exemplified by Siku=
ani,
invariably forces the causee to take the direct object position, while the
participant that happened to be there moves to the indirect object position=
. A
three-place causativised verb should relegate an original indirect object t=
o an
adjunct role. This game of musical chairs in which the causative and the
applicative engage has an effect on case as well as on grammatical relation=
s,
and if a zone of objects is created as a consequence of it, the result in t=
erms
of ranking should be checked for both domains: The Korean causative creates=
 a
double accusative but not a double object, since only one has the syntactic
properties of the object of a divalent verb; the Bantu applicative results =
in
two objects whose hierarchy varies following the syntactic test we perform
(passivization and so on) on the applicative construction."

Several semantic subtypes of causative can co-occur in one and the same
grammatical system. The most common are the direct type - make X VRB - the
inductive - have X VRB - the permissive - let X VRB - the assistive - help =
VRB X
- and, as we have seen, the comitative - have X VRB while VRBing oneself. O=
ften,
these types make use of different formal material and rely on subtle
distinctions involving a difference in the controlling capacity of the caus=
er
and the causee. Recent Tupi-Guarani studies have shown that the well-known =
use
of two different constructions depending on the valence of the causativised=
 verb
does not rest, at least in certain languages, on the formal category of val=
ency,
but is instead dependent on the semantic clue of degree of agentivity retai=
ned
by the causee. This could shed light on an affinity often observed
cross-linguistically between the direct type of causative and single-argume=
nt
verbs. The applicative is commonly used to bring closer to the center of th=
e
scene a participant whose semantic role, given a particular verb, forces it=
 to
surface as an adjunct. A human entity, especially a speech act participant,
indirectly affected by or interested in the situation described, is the ide=
al
candidate for applicative promotion, but other roles are also eligible, suc=
h as
instrument or location.

On the diachronic side, the causative generally displays a stage on the axi=
s of
grammaticalization that goes from a bi-propositional construction where the=
 main
lexical verb is the non-finite complement of a causal verb of the type make=
 - a
periphrastic causative - up to a single propositional construction marking
causation by a mere affix. The semantics described above can take advantage=
 of
this formal difference when the latter is present in one single language.
Applicative morphemes often involve forms akin to adpositions, and less
commonly, etc. The morphology of the applicative, as we know, results from =
a
kind of incorporation, often involving adpositions, and less commonly verbs=
 or
even nouns (Baker 1988). Depending on the developmental diachronic stage of
grammaticalization, the etymology of the applicative morpheme is more or le=
ss
transparent. Because grammaticalization only represents the initial part of=
 the
axis of semantic demotivation that a given element undergoes, the process c=
an
extend up to lexicalization.

3. Lexical categorisation

In a typological perspective, the identification of universal lexical categ=
ories
is problematic. In amerindian languages, the universal status of noun and v=
erb
is already difficult to establish (see Lois & Vapnarsky 2006 for a synthesi=
s).
Still more problematic is the universality of adjectives. For Dixon (2004),
adjectives are a universal part of speech, while for Palancar (2006) and se=
veral
authors in the Lois & Vapnarsky volume, adjectives are not an independent
lexical class. We wish to explore more deeply the expression of property/qu=
ality
concepts in South-American languages, mainly the phonological, morphosyntac=
tic,
semantic and pragmatic criteria that contribute to their identification as =
a
class. We are particularly interested in the contribution of phonological
criteria such as prosodic minimality, tonal or accentual specification, to =
the
identification of lexical categories.

4. Expression of spatial notions

In South American languages, motion and location as co-events or associated
motion are expressed using different strategies which include verbal
serialization or composition (tatuyo, barasana, yuhup, hup), auxiliarizatio=
n
(sikuani), directionals and/or locatives affixation, associated motion,
adverbial adpositions etc. We propose first a general  exploration of the m=
any
ways of expressing equivalent spatial notions in languages appealing to the
strategies previously mentioned. Second, we are particularly interested in =
their
codification through serial verb constructions, a device recently identifie=
d as
recurrent in several Amazonian languages. Third, given that the series in t=
his
area are frequently of the contiguous and incorporating type, their status =
as
either series or compounds is a matter of debate we would like to pursue in=
 this
meeting.

5. Valency increasing strategies in Arawakan languages

In order to trigger comparison among Arawak languages and to foster tighter
cooperation among specialists of the family, we invite abstracts for papers=
 on
valency-increasing devices in Arawak languages. Arawak languages are known =
for
displaying a great variety of morphological valency-increasing devices,
especially causatives and applicatives (Wise 1990; 2002; Aikhenvald 1999; P=
ayne
2002). Surprisingly, several of them can sometimes occur simultaneously on =
the
same root. Interesting points to examine concern the form, position, and or=
igin
of the markers, their relation with thematic syllables, transitivizers,
so-called "attributives" and word-class changing derivations. The following
parameters are particularly worth looking at for causatives: compatibility =
with
root transitivity and semantic type of causation (direct, indirect, coercit=
ive,
sociative - according to the
involvement of the causer), and for applicatives:  semantic type (thematic =
role
of the applied object). The possibility for a verb root to take several suc=
h
markers could also be investigated. We welcome initial descriptions of
valency-increasing devices in underdescribed Arawak languages, as well as
in-depth studies of individual devices, and comparative papers.  Papers may=
 be
presented in English, Spanish, or Portuguese.
