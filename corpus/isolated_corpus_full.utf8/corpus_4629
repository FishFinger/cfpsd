CALL FOR PAPERS
FIRST VIGO-NEWCASTLE-SANTIAGO-LEUVEN INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON =93THE =

STRUCTURE OF THE NOUN PHRASE IN ENGLISH:
SYNCHRONIC AND DIACHRONIC EXPLORATIONS=94 (NP1)
Vigo, 2-3 October 2009

We are pleased to announce the First Vigo-Newcastle-Santiago-Leuven =

International Workshop on =93The structure of the noun phrase in English: =

synchronic and diachronic explorations=94 (NP1), to be held at the =

University of Vigo (Spain) on 2-3 October 2009.

Although there exists an enormous literature on many aspects of nouns =

and noun phrases (NPs) in English, there are still fundamental issues in =

their structure and distribution that remain unsolved. These involve =

matters like the structural relations between different types of NP =

elements, the relation between internal and external properties of NPs, =

the parallels (or lack thereof) between verbal and nominal constituents, =

the factors responsible for the textual frequencies of various =

NP-related phenomena, and the contribution of different types of NPs to =

the information structure of texts. This workshop aims at bringing =

together researchers who are currently looking at the English NP from =

different points of view (theoretical, structural, functional, textual =

and descriptive).

We would therefore like to invite presentations concerned with any topic =

involving NPs, including the following:
- NP complexity: the relationship between grammatical function and NP =

complexity
- NP types, including binominal phrases, discontinuous NPs and =

possessive constructions
- the structural representation of NPs and their constituents
- strategies of premodification, postmodification and complementation in =

the NP
- apposition in the NP
- headedness and NPs
- the exploration of the implications of particular theoretical =

frameworks for NP structure: diachronic, syntactic, construction-based, =

cognitive perspectives on all of the above

Invited speakers:
- Douglas Biber (Northern Arizona University)
- William Croft (University of New Mexico)
- Evelien Keizer (Universiteit van Amsterdam)
- John Payne (The University of Manchester)

Abstracts must be submitted in MS Word or RTF format as an e-mail =

attachment to np1@uvigo.es by 30 March 2009. The e-mail should use the =

subject header =93NP1 abstract=94. Abstracts should be one page in length =

(single-spaced), excluding references, and be written in standard =

12-point font. The page should be headed only by the title of the paper =

and not mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or addresses. =

The accompanying e-mail should include:
(a) Title of the paper
(b) Name(s) of the author(s)
(c) Institutional affiliation(s)
(d) E-mail address(es)
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 30 April 2009.

Publication:
Authors of papers accepted for presentation will be invited to submit =

their papers for publication in a special journal issue or volume with =

an international publisher. Papers will be subjected to refereeing.

Important dates:
30 March 2009: Deadline for abstract submission
30 April 2009: Notification of acceptance or rejection
1 September: (Re-)Submission of 1-page abstract for conference booklet
2-3 October: Workshop at Vigo, Spain

Workshop organisation: NP1 is organised by the Language Variation and =

Textual Categorisation (LVTC) research group at the University of Vigo =

(http://lvtcuvigo.blogspot.com), in cooperation with:
- the School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics at the =

University of Newcastle
- the VLCG Research Group at the University of Santiago de Compostela
- the Functional Linguistics Leuven (FLL) Research group at the =

University of Leuven.
Providing there is sufficient interest, we anticipate having follow-up =

workshops in later years.

Contact person: Javier Perez-Guerra (jperez@uvigo.es)

Workshop webpage: http://webs.uvigo.es/np1

This workshop is sponsored by the English Linguistics Circle (ELC), a =

network coordinated by Professor Teresa Fanego involving four research =

groups based at the Universities of Santiago de Compostela and Vigo =

(http://elc.org.es).
