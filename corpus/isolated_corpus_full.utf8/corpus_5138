Meeting Description:

The workshop is organized as part of this year's Conference of the German
Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL), hosted by
the Applied Computational Linguistics group in the Department of Linguistics at
Potsdam University. The GLDV Working Group on Hypermedia is offering a one-day
workshop dedicated to usability aspects for hypermedia systems and applications
in the E-Humanities (corpus retrieval frontends, web information systems,
community grids etc.).

Since Jakob Nielsen pointed out the main criteria for user-friendly hypermedia
systems - easy to learn, efficient to use, easy to remember, few errors,
pleasant to use - in the mid-nineties, usability research is engaged in the
statistical investigation and empiric validation of ranking methods. One goal is
the improvement of usability on the internet, currently focusing on up-to-date
topics like Web 2.0 and multimodal interfaces.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum for researchers and practitioners
interested in hypermedia systems in the context of natural language processing.
By offering paper presentations (30 min.) and discussion panels, we hope to
stimulate and facilitate an active exchange on unique and interdisciplinary
ideas, practices, and methods.
