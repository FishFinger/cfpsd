Doctoral Consortium at the 8th EUROLAN Summer School
* Second Call for Participation *

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 30 - August 2, 2007, Iasi, Romania

Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 14, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity for =

graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) =

investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language =

Processing to present their current work and receive constructive =

feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general audience =

and the invited lecturers at the Summer School.

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4 =

consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in the second week of the EUROLAN =

2007 Summer School, July 30 - August 2, 2007. The final version of the =

accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 =

Doctoral Consortium, at the University Al. I Cuza Publishing House. =

During the Summer School the students will present their work, will =

receive constructive comments wrt. to current and future research =

directions from a panel of established researchers, and will benefit =

from the collaborative climate established among all participants, thus =

enhancing future joint work among them. Students will also prepare a =

poster which will be on display throughout the Summer School.

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the =

Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to =

receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within =

Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, including but =

not limited to:

     * phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
     * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax, and the lexicon;
     * text understanding and generation;
     * computational semantics;
     * ontology enriched NLP applications;
     * multilingual NLP;
     * mutilingual question answering;
     * machine translation;
     * corpus-based language processing;
     * electronic dictionaries;
     * written and spoken natural language interfaces;
     * knowledge acquisition;
     * terminology;
     * text summarisation;
     * text classification;
     * computer-aided language learning;
     * human computer interaction;
     * language resources;
     * evaluation, assessment and standards in language engineering;
     * theoretical and application-oriented papers related to NLP of =

every kind.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lecturers of the =

school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The =

submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST be =

students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD).

The paper should include:

     * the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;
     * the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field;
     * the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the =

methodology adopted;
     * the future research plan.

3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The only format acceptable is PDF (.pdf). =

Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references and annexes =

and should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. The papers =

will be uploaded on a special page, announced on the web page of the =

Doctoral Consortium, where more submission guidelines are available.
