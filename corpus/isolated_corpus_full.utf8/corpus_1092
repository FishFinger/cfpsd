Call Deadline: 01-Apr-2007 

The journal Language Research was first published in 1965 by the Language
Education Institute (formerly, the Language Research Institute) of Seoul
National University in Seoul, Korea. It is one of the oldest and most
prestigious linguistic journals published in Korea. It has continually
published important papers in diverse areas of linguistics.

Submitted manuscripts should focus on linguistics. In addition to all
subfields within general/theoretical linguistics, papers addressing topics
in psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, historical/comparative linguistics,
and computational linguistics are welcome. Though we see topics in Korean
linguistics as the main area of concentration for the journal, papers need
not be restricted to issues related to Korean. 

Manuscripts may be submitted to either the domestic editor/associate editor
or the international editor/associate editor. Paper or electronic
submissions (PDF) are welcome, though we prefer electronic submissions
where possible. All papers submitted for the 2007 volume should be written
in English.

No page charges will be levied on submitted manuscripts, and the journal
will offer editorial assistance.
