CALL FOR PAPERS: EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE

Software engineering, testing, and quality assurance for natural
language processing
An ACL 2008 workshop
Columbus, OH
June 20, 2008

Natural language, as an input type, has unique characteristics that
present special problems for software testing, quality assurance, and
even requirements specification.  This workshop is intended to
stimulate research in all areas of software engineering for natural
language processing.  The goals of the workshop include raising
awareness of the need for good software engineering practices in NLP,
stimulating research on same, and disseminating the results of current
work in this area.

The target audience is researchers interested in natural language
processing software, including testing and standardization.

Submissions of full papers and poster abstracts are solicited in all
areas of software engineering, testing and quality assurance as they
relate to natural language processing.  Some suggested areas are:

* Patterns for design, coding, refactoring, and unit testing of
language processing systems
* Test suite design and generation
* Special issues in metrology for natural language processing
* Grammar/rule engineering
* Usability
* Standardization of tools and/or resources
* Design for and evaluation of reliability and robustness
* Scalability issues in training and deployment
* Reusability and toolkit design
* Concurrency and multithreading for NLP
* Theoretical issues in software engineering for NLP

IMPORTANT DATES

NEW SUBMISSION DEADLINE: Friday, April 4, 2008, 11:59 PM East Coast time
Notification of acceptance: Sunday, April 20, 2008
Camera-ready copy due: Saturday, April 26, 2008

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Full papers: Revised ACL guidelines for full papers this year allow
for 8 pages of text plus one page of references.  Full papers are
intended to be reports of original and mature research.

Poster abstracts: Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages.
Accepted abstracts will be published in a separate section of the
workshop proceedings.  Appropriate poster topics include preliminary
results, application notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Submission format: Submissions must be in PDF and should follow the
two-column format of the ACL proceedings.  Ensure that you are *not*
in A4 format.  Please see the conference website for detailed
typesetting specifications.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use
the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting
website at http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html.

Submit your paper or abstract via the workshop web site at
https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS04/ by 11:59 PM on Friday,
April 4, East Coast time.  Submissions need not be anonymous.  Authors
who cannot submit a PDF file electronically should contact the
workshop organizers well in advance of the submission deadline.

Papers may not be submitted to the software engineering, testing, and
quality assurance workshop if they are or will be concurrently
submitted to another meeting or publication and that other meeting or
publication prohibits dual submissions.  If your paper is or will be
concurrently under consideration by another meeting or publication,
please notify us of that fact in a footnote on the first page.
