Meeting Description:

The 23rd Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference (FLAIRS-23) will be held May 19-21, 2010 in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA. FLAIRS-23 continues a tradition of presenting and discussing artificial intelligence research in a convivial atmosphere within a beautiful setting. Events will include invited speakers, special tracks, discussion panels, and presentations of papers and posters.

Cognition and AI (C&AI) is a FLAIRS special track that spotlights theoretical and experimental research that explains, integrates, and models human cognition with various computational approaches. It is an open forum for interdisciplinary research that spans the domains of cognitive psychology, computer science, philosophy, and the learning sciences. If you use computational techniques to better understand cognitive phenomena, or are developing AI that instantiates cognitive processes, then this track is for you. 

Call for Papers:

Paper submission deadline: Monday, November 23rd, 2009.

FLAIRS encourages student authors to submit papers. In addition to a Best Paper award, there will be a Best Student Paper award for the best paper written primarily by students.

All accepted papers will be published as FLAIRS proceedings by the AAAI. Researchers presenting at the C&AI special track are also invited to submit their papers for publication in the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence (JETAI). To be eligible for selection, authors will be required to submit an expanded version of the original conference proceeding that contains significant theoretical or experimental additions.

Submission Guidelines for the C&AI Track:

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting guidelines. The papers should be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or submitted to another conference while in review). Papers should not exceed 6 pages (2 pages for a poster) and are due by November 23rd, 2009.

For FLAIRS-23, the 2010 conference, the reviewing is a double blind process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on submitted papers to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system, which can be accessed through the main conference web site (http://www.FLAIRS-23.info). Note, do not use a fake name for your EasyChair login - your EasyChair account information is hidden from reviewers. Authors should indicate the special track of ANLP for submissions. The proceedings of FLAIRS will be published by the AAAI. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a form transferring copyright of their contribution to AAAI. An author of each accepted paper is required to register, attend, and present the paper at FLAIRS.
