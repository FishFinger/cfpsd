Availability of Data

Continuing the tradition from the WWE'06=20
workshop, we are once again offering a large=20
blog dataset to conference participants. The=20
data release comprises a complete set of=20
weblog posts collected by Nielsen BuzzMetrics=20
for May 2006 (consisting of about 14M posts=20
from 3M weblogs). The data set includes the=20
full content of the posts plus mark-up and=20
represents an unprecedented collection for=20
blog researchers. Our hope is that a communal
dataset, approached from many different=20
directions, will yield many interesting=20
results. More information on the dataset,=20
which is available for immediate download, =20
can be found at:=20
http://www.icwsm.org/data.html=20

Call for Papers

Recent years have seen a flourishing of social=20
media - the promise of the WWW coming to fruition.=20
Across the world, individuals can share opinions,=20
experiences and expertise at the push of a button.=20
There has been a fundamental shift thanks to=20
significant advances in the ease of publishing=20
content. Creating web content was for years the=20
domain of tech-savvy people; now the barrier has=20
been torn down.

Perhaps the most visible among the successes of=20
social media in recent years is the blogosphere.=20
Tens of thousands of new blogs are created every day;
blog content is becoming ubiquitous, surfacing=20
in news portals, search results and corporate=20
public relations. Even those who are unaware of the=20
blogosphere are still influenced by its content.=20
Although blogs are highly visible currently, other=20
forms of conversational spaces continue to flourish,=20
especially message boards, mailing lists, review=20
sites and Usenet.

Social media covers all forms of sharing: from=20
photos, to videos, to recommendations. In the past=20
few years, many examples of social media have=20
become hugely successful. Flickr is a premier photo=20
sharing site; del.icio.us has become a touchstone=20
for sharing recommendations of websites; Web 2.0=20
applications in general abound with newcomers in=20
the social media space.

One of the fascinating aspects of social media=20
has been the drive from within to study the=20
ecology as it evolves. People act at once as=20
creators, observers and influencers of the space=20
in which they participate. At the same time,=20
businesses are quickly grasping the potential=20
benefit to attending to the new space of social=20
media. Monitoring the aggregate trends and=20
opinions revealed by social media provides=20
valuable insight to a number of business=20
applications: marketing intelligence, competitive=20
intelligence.

The fast growing blogosphere and social media space=20
is a fruitful area for investigations across many=20
disciplines. For example:

  * Natural language processing and machine learning=20
    researchers study the extraction of factual=20
    information from text; can blogs be processed in=20
    a robust manner and can knowledge bases be=20
    populated with facts from blogs?
  * Social network researchers and graph theory=20
    researchers are concerned with inferring=20
    community structure; analyzing the linkage=20
    patterns among blog entries can provide explicit=20
    community structure; can we infer implicit=20
    communities through the content of the blogs?
  * Political scientists are looking at ways of=20
    identifying influencers in a community; who are=20
    the influential bloggers whose voice is echoed=20
    by others?
  * Multimedia researchers are attempting to=20
    categorize audio and video content, aggregate=20
    information from diverse sources (textual, audio,=20
    video); can visual & audio social media be stored=20
    in a way that allows search across different=20
    modalities?
  * Market analysis researchers are concerned with=20
    what people think of the products and services=20
    of a company; can we process blogs automatically=20
    and find consumer complaints and breaking reports=20
    about vulnerabilities of products; also when does=20
    a burst of blogging activity become a trend?
  * Social psychologists study the response to=20
    current events, including emotional and=20
    attitudinal dimensions as well as content and=20
    patterns of influence.

Despite the growing relevance of blogs and social=20
media, existing research has only begun to address=20
the spectrum of issues that arise in their analysis.=20
Blogs, for example, are a different kind of document=20
than the relatively clean text that NLP research is=20
based on. Such differences in term of structure,=20
content and grammaticality will be a challenge=20
considering that blogs will likely represent the most=20
common way of publicly accessible personal expression.


AREAS OF INTEREST

The conference aims to bring together researchers=20
from different subject areas (e.g., computer science,
linguistics, psychology, statistics, sociology,=20
multimedia and semantic web technologies) and foster=20
discussions about ongoing research in the following=20
areas:

[01] AI methods for ethnographic analysis through=20
     social media.
[02] Blogosphere vs. mediasphere; measuring the=20
     influence of blogs on the media.
[03] Centrality/influence of bloggers/blogs; ranking/
     relevance of blogs; web pages ranking based on=20
     blogs.
[04] Crawling/spidering and indexing.
[05] Human Computer Interaction; social media tools;=20
     navigation.
[06] Multimedia; audio/visual processing; aggregating=20
     information from different modalities.
[07] Semantic analysis; cross-system and cross-media=20
     name tracking; named relations and fact=20
     extraction; discourse analysis; summarization.
[08] Semantic Web; unstructured knowledge management.
[09] Sentiment analysis; polarity/opinion=20
     identification and extraction.
[10] Social Network Analysis; communities=20
     identification; expertise discovery;=20
     collaborative filtering.
[11] Text categorization; gender/age identification;=20
     spam filtering.
[12] Time Series Forecasting; measuring=20
     predictability of phenomena based on social=20
     media.
[13] Trend identification/tracking.
[14] Visualization, aggregation and filtering.
[15] New social media applications, interfaces,=20
     interaction techniques
