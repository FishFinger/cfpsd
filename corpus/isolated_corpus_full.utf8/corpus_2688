FORMAT OF THE CONFERENCE

The conference program will include presentation of invited papers,
oral presentations, and poster/demonstration sessions. Papers will
be presented in plenary or topic oriented sessions.

Social events including a trip in the vicinity of Brno will allow
for additional informal interactions.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages
formatted in the LNCS style (see below). Those accepted will be
presented either orally or as posters. The decision about the
presentation format will be based on the recommendation of the
reviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the
on-line form accessible from the conference website.

Papers submitted to TSD 2008 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the
requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX
or LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final
versions of the papers that will be published in the Springer
Lecture Notes.  Authors using a WORD compatible software for the
final version must use the LNCS template for WORD and within the
submit process ask the Proceedings Editors to convert the paper
to LaTeX format.  For this service a service-and-license fee of
CZK 1500 will be levied automatically.

The paper format for review has to be either PDF or PostScript file
with all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance,
presenters will receive further information on submitting their
camera-ready and electronic sources (for detailed instructions on
the final paper format see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings.)

Authors are also invited to present actual projects, developed
software or interesting material relevant to the topics of the
conference.  The presenters of the demonstration should provide the
abstract not exceeding one page. The demonstration abstracts will not
appear in the conference proceedings.

LOCATION

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic with a
population of almost 400.000. The city is the country's judiciary and
trade-fair center. Brno is the capital of Moravia, which is in the
south-east part of the Czech Republic. Brno had been a Royal City
since 1347 and with its six universities it forms also a cultural
center of the region.

Brno can be reached easily by direct flights from London, Moscow,
Barcelona and Prague and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or
Vienna (130 km).

For the participants with some extra time, some nearby places may also
be of interest.  Local ones include: Brno Castle now called Spilberk,
Veveri Castle, the Old and New City Halls, the Augustine Monastery
with St. Thomas Church and crypt of Moravian Margraves, Church of St.
James, Cathedral of St. Peter & Paul, Cartesian Monastery in Kralovo
Pole, the famous Villa Tugendhat designed by Mies van der Rohe along
with other important buildings of between-war Czech architecture.

For those willing to venture out of Brno, Moravian Karst with Macocha
Chasm and Punkva caves, battlefield of Battle of three emperors
(Napoleon, Russian Alexander and Austrian Franz - Battle by
Austerlitz), Chateau of Slavkov (Austerlitz), Pernstejn Castle,
Buchlov Castle, Lednice Chateau, Buchlovice Chateau, Letovice Chateau,
Mikulov with one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in Central Europe,
Telc - a town on the UNESCO heritage list, and many others are all
within easy reach.

trade-fair center. Brno is the capital of Moravia, which is in the<br>
south-east part of the Czech Republic. Brno had been a Royal City<br>
since 1347 and with its six universities it forms also a cultural<br>
center of the region.<br>
