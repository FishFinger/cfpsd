            *** Final Call for Papers ***

        ***  Extended Deadline: 11 April  ***


Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition

Workshop at ACL 2005

29-30 June 2005 at University of Michigan Ann Arbor

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp


Workshop Topic
--------------

The workshop, which is a follow-up to the successful workshop held
at COLING in 2004, will be devoted to psychologically motivated
computational models of language acquisition -- models that are
compatible with, or motivated by research in psycholinguistics,
developmental psychology with particular emphasis on the acquisition
of syntax, though work on the acquisition of morphology, phonology
and other levels of linguistic description is also welcome.

The workshop will be taking place at the same time as CoNLL-2005
(http://cnts.uia.ac.be/conll/cfp.html) and we expect there to be sufficient
interest for a plenary session of papers that are relevant
to both audiences. There will also be a plenary session for
Mark Steedman's invited talk.

Invited Talks
-------------
   Mark Steedman, University of Edinburgh
   Brian MacWhinney, Carnegie Mellon University


Workshop Description and Motivation
-----------------------------------

In recent decades there has been a great deal of successful research
that applies computational learning techniques to emerging natural
language technologies, along with many meetings, conferences and
workshops in which to present such research. These have generally
been motivated primarily by engineering concerns. There have been
only a few venues in which computational models of human (first)
language acquisition are the focus.

In the light of recent results in developmental psychology,
indicating that very young infants are capable of detecting
statistical patterns in an audible input stream, statistically
motivated approaches have gained in plausibility. However, this
raises the question of whether or not a psychologically credible
statistical learning strategy can be successfully exploited in a
full-blown psychocomputational acquisition model, and the extent
to which such algorithms must use domain-specific knowledge.

The principal goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers
who work within computational linguistics, formal learning theory,
grammatical inference, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
linguistics, psycholinguistics and other fields, who have created or
are investigating computational models of language acquisition. In
particular, it will provide a forum for establishing links and common
themes between diverse paradigms.  Although research which directly
addresses the acquisition of syntax is strongly encouraged, related
studies that inform research on the acquisition of other areas of
language are also welcome.

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Formal learning theoretic and grammar induction models that
   incorporate psychologically plausible constraints;
* Models that employ language models from corpus linguistics;
* Models that address the question of learning bias in terms of
   innate linguistic knowledge versus domain general strategies
* Models that can acquire natural language word-order;
* Hybrid models that cross established paradigms;
* Models that directly make use of or can be used to evaluate
   existing linguistic or developmental theories in a computational
   framework (e.g. the principles & parameters framework, Optimality
   Theory, or Construction Grammar);
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora;
* Comparative surveys, across multiple paradigms, that critique
   previously published studies;

Paper Length: Submissions should be no longer than 8 pages (A4 or
the equivalent). High-quality short papers or extended abstracts
of 4 to 5 pages are encouraged. Submission and format details
