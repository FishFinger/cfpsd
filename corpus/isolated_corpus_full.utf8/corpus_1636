CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS:

GlobEng: International Conference on Global English
             February 14 - 16 2008  - University of  Verona, Italy
             website: http://profs.lingue.univr.it/globeng/index.html

The Department of English Studies of the University of Verona is proud to 
announce "GlobEng: International Conference on Global English".
The aim of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation of 
research discussing issues related to the role of English as a global 
language.

The debate over the status of English as an International language has 
flourished over the past few decades and is still open to new developments.
Starting from the awareness of the undisputedly prominent role of English as 
a Lingua Franca in international communication, the fact that native 
speakers are currently a minority, compared to second-language users of the 
language, has been repeatedly highlighted.
The changing status of English has led to the emergence of a new linguistic 
scenery. On the one hand, the native varieties have become highly 
differentiated and have acquired greater autonomy, while on the other, the 
rapid growth of a community of non-native speakers, thanks to increasing 
international exchanges, has triggered a reflection on the possible rise of 
a new International English, as opposed to the current native varieties.

A wide range of issues are brought to the fore in this connection, 
especially focusing on the possible evolution of the current scenario, both 
in Europe and in the rest of the world, with a reflection on (and a possible 
revision of) the notion of Standard, and the crucial implications that 
prospective developments might have on English Language Teaching (ELT).

The programme includes plenary lectures by renowned scholars in the field, 
such as David Crystal, Adrian Holliday, Jennifer Jenkins, Alan Maley, 
Barbara Seidlhofer and Simon Sweeney.

Papers are encouraged which address the following topics:

- Pronunciation models: new vs. standard
- Implications of new morphosyntactic models
- Semantic and pragmatic implications of globalising English
- Cultures, media and globalisation
- Identities and international communication
- Language policies in the European Community
- English and other languages in the classroom
- The teaching of English as a foreign/second language and as a specialised 
language
- Terminological issues and new taxonomies
