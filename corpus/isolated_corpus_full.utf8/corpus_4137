Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009

Meeting Description:

We invite papers that explore a wide range of interpretations of the
conference
theme: from the production of French knowledges to Francophone
representations
of the technical to culturally specific uptakes of new technologies. We are
especially interested in papers that reflect upon the discipline of French
and
Francophone Studies, its techniques, the technologies it employs and deploy=
s
and
thus its applications beyond itself as a discipline, and its appropriations
of
other disciplines into its fold, as French and Francophone Studies extends
beyond its own boundaries to use techniques and technologies that originate
in
other far flung fields.

Call for Papers

Tekhne, technique, technology: three terms which broach the divide between
knowledge and the world, between concepts and their applications. The
etymological base of its variants found in both French and English, tekhne
is
both an art or craft as well as the knowledge that comes from the practice
or
discipline of that art or craft as it is repeated over time. As such, it
signals
less a split between pure and applied knowledge than deconstructs the
distinction between them, since knowledge does not so much precede practice
but
as in an art or craftis is just as much a product of it.

Possible topics might include:
Technology in French and Francophone Studies today
technology of/in cinema; technology in literature; technology in language
learning; curriculum design; technologies of/in everyday life; cultural
history
of technology
The place of French and Francophone Studies in the current research context
inside and outside of Australia
The future of the Humanities; funding policy; interdisciplinary research.
Applications of French and Francophone Studies graduate destinations;
industry
links; applied linguistics; interdisciplinarity.
Discipline as technique
the concept of discipline; curriculum design; language pedagogy; Foucault
studies.
French ways of understanding philosophy; critical theory; film studies;
literary
studies; visual studies.

The participation of delegates from other disciplines in which knowledges
produced in French and Francophone cultures are used is greatly encouraged.

In addition, as is the custom of this conference, papers relating to French
and
Francophone Studies but not directly addressing the theme will also be
considered.

Abstracts of 250 words or panel proposals (3 x 20 minute papers on a common
theme with an abstract for each) with full contact details should be sent b=
y
31
January 2009 to Dr Juliana de Nooy at: j.denooy@uq.edu.au

Keynote speakers will be confirmed shortly. Conference registration will
open on
1 March 2009 and will include various tiers of earlybird registration fees.
Participation by postgraduate students is particularly welcome and the
Society
will once again be offering travel bursaries to postgraduate students
resident
in Australia and New Zealand on a competitive basis. Details will be found
on
the Society's website shortly: http://australiansocietyfrenchstudies.org

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Sociolinguistics

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2009

Meeting Description:

Today to an even larger extent than in the past centuries, communication
frequently takes place between individuals and institutions representing
different national and cultural backgrounds. This has resulted in a vast
body of
theoretical discussions on the relation between language, culture and
discourse
as well as in the emergence of empirical research on intercultural
encounters.

Call for Papers

The conference International Communication in the European Context aims at
presenting and discussing multiple approaches to cross-cultural
communication
within Europe, or involving European cultures and perspectives. The
organizers
welcome contributions on a wide range of subjects, such as e.g.
sociolinguistic
studies on biculturalism and migration, the effects of linguistic and
cultural
differences upon the process European integration, business communication,
new
media, and the communication aspect of political relations and cultural
exchange
between the European Union and the United States of America.

We welcome contributions on the role of pragmalinguistic differences and
different conventions of speech and text genres in encounters between
members of
different cultures, as well as on the effects of power relations upon the
forms
of intercultural discourse. Social change, international political
campaigning,
linguistic minorities, advertising, management, corporate internal
communication, tourism, youth culture, international diplomacy, internal
communication in the institutions of the EU, and public media discourse are
all
within the range of subjects which we expect to be dealt with at the
conference.
Contributions from empirical studies are most welcome.
In order to meet these objectives, the organizers also invite contributions
from
related non-linguistic disciplines such as international relations, busines=
s
studies and comparative social psychology.

Subtopics:
1. Minority discourses
2. European diversity and European integration
3. Communication between the European countries and the United States of
America
Ad 1) This section focuses upon the discourses involving cultural and
linguistic
minorities, their positioning in the mainstream discourse and the evolution
of
national cultures and styles of communication under the influence of
cultural
diversity within national borders.
Ad 2) As the process of European integration proceeds towards its declared
goal
of  coordinated standards of social, judicial and ethic policies,
differences of
cultural backgrounds as well as institutional and linguistic practices come
into
view. The questions to be addressed are among other things problems caused
by
the diversity and homogenization of Europe's cultures, international
business
relations and border-crossing developments in arts and mass media, as well
as
communication in foreign languages and the enrichment of individual and
social
repertoires of interaction practices brought about by intercultural
encounters.
Ad 3) The impact of American culture, economy and politics forms a clearly
visible aspect of globalization. On the other hand, the differences between
Europe and the USA in historical development, social and institutional
backgrounds and cultural assumptions lead to different discursive practices
and
may result in diverging approaches to a number of issues, including among
other
things global safety, ecology, medical ethics and institutional
interventionism
in economy and business. The issues to be addressed are intercultural
discourses
in any area and illustrating successful communication, mutual or one-sided
influences on discursive practices and obstacles to the achievement of
mutual
understanding.
Conference languages
Contributions will be accepted in English, German and Polish.

Submission of Abstracts
Deadline for submitting abstracts is 30th January 2009.
Please send your abstract in max. 300 words edited in MS Word to
hanna.pulaczewska@sprachlit.uni-regensburg.de. The academic committee will

communication in the institutions of the EU, and public media discourse are=
 all<br>
within the range of subjects which we expect to be dealt with at the confer=
ence.<br>
Contributions from empirical studies are most welcome.<br>
In order to meet these objectives, the organizers also invite contributions=
 from<br>
related non-linguistic disciplines such as international relations, busines=

studies and comparative social psychology.<br>

Subtopics:<br>
1. Minority discourses<br>
2. European diversity and European integration<br>
3. Communication between the European countries and the United States of Am=
erica<br>
Ad 1) This section focuses upon the discourses involving cultural and lingu=
istic<br>
minorities, their positioning in the mainstream discourse and the evolution=
 of<br>
national cultures and styles of communication under the influence of cultur=
al<br>
diversity within national borders.<br>
Ad 2) As the process of European integration proceeds towards its declared =
goal<br>
of &nbsp;coordinated standards of social, judicial and ethic policies, diff=
erences of<br>
cultural backgrounds as well as institutional and linguistic practices come=
 into<br>
view. The questions to be addressed are among other things problems caused =
by<br>
the diversity and homogenization of Europe&#39;s cultures, international bu=
siness<br>
relations and border-crossing developments in arts and mass media, as well =
as<br>
communication in foreign languages and the enrichment of individual and soc=
ial<br>
repertoires of interaction practices brought about by intercultural encount=
ers.<br>
Ad 3) The impact of American culture, economy and politics forms a clearly<=
br>
visible aspect of globalization. On the other hand, the differences between=
<br>
Europe and the USA in historical development, social and institutional<br>
backgrounds and cultural assumptions lead to different discursive practices=
 and<br>
may result in diverging approaches to a number of issues, including among o=
ther<br>
things global safety, ecology, medical ethics and institutional interventio=
nism<br>
in economy and business. The issues to be addressed are intercultural disco=
urses<br>
in any area and illustrating successful communication, mutual or one-sided<=
br>
influences on discursive practices and obstacles to the achievement of mutu=
al<br>
understanding.<br>
