Meeting Description:

Workshop on Third Language Acquisition: Developing a Research Base Across P=
aradigms
Conveners: Jason Rothman (University of Iowa) and Suzanne Flynn (MIT)
Conference Dates: June 7-11 2010
The weeklong workshop will take place at the University of Iowa from June 7=
th to the 11th, 2010.=20

This workshop, funded by the generous grant support of the Obermann Center =
for Advanced studies, brings together linguistic researchers interested in =
the acquisition and use of a third (L3) or more (Ln) language in adulthood.=
 The main focus of this workshop is to discuss and make efforts towards sol=
idifying a more comprehensive research base for the linguistic study of adu=
lt multilingualism. To that end, in bringing together scholars from several=
 different traditions of language acquisition and use, (e.g. generative, ps=
ycholinguistic, cognitive, functional and sociocultural), our hope is to bu=
ild bridges among these sub-disciples of linguistic inquiry and to discover=
 how each mode of inquiry can inform the others. We maintain that such an e=
ffort can contribute to developing a comprehensive understanding of multili=
ngual acquisition in adulthood as well as model cooperative efforts across =
overlapping domains of research. We believe this endeavor has the potential=
 to uniquely inform perennial debates in language acquisition theory, such =
as the so-called Critical/Sensitive Period(s) debate, the architecture/desi=
gn of the linguistic computational system, the structure of mental lexicon,=
 to name just a few.=20

The list of plenary speakers is as follows:
=20
Camilla Bardel (Stockholm University, Sweden)
Kees De Bot (University of Groningen, the Netherlands)
Jean Marc Dewaele (Birbeck College, UK)
Yvla Falk (University of Nijmegen, the Netherlands)=20
Mar=EDa del Pilar de Garc=EDa Mayo (University of the Basque Country, Spain=
)
Ulrike Jessner (Universit=E4t Innsbruck, Austria)
Judith Kroll (Pennsylvania State University, USA)
Christina Lundqvist   (University of Stockholm, Sweden)
Aneta Plavenko  (Temple University, USA)
Maria Polinsky (Harvard University, USA)
David Singleton  (Trinity College, Ireland)
Roumyana Slabakova (University of Iowa, USA)=20

Call for Papers:

Submission Deadline: January 15th, 2009

We seek high quality papers that contribute to these larger issues, but als=
o those that examine specific empirical questions related to the acquisitio=
n of L3/Ln morphosyntax, phonology, semantics, pragmatics, the lexicon, aff=
ective factors for language acquisition and use among others.

Abstracts must be 500 words or less (not including title, figures and refer=
ences) and fit on one page, with a second page possible for data and refere=
nces. Abstracts are due by 5 pm Eastern Standard time on December 15th 2009=
, sent to the following e-mail address:jason-rothman@uiowa.edu. Any questio=
ns you may have should also be directed to that e-mail. A limited number of=
 papers submitted via this open call will be selected upon review. Authors'=
 whose papers are accepted can expect to receive partial to full compensati=
on for travel and lodging, depending on the availability of funds and/or a =
demonstration of need. Graduate students are especially encouraged to submi=
t.
