2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on 
Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT-08)

December 9-12, 2008, Sydney, Australia

Official Site:
http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/wi08/html/iat/
Mirror Site:
http://www.maebashi-it.org/wi-iat08/iat08/index.html

Sponsored By

##################################################################
# (Papers Due: *** 10 July 2008 ***
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# by the IEEE Computer Society Press, which are indexed by EI.
##################################################################

IAT 2008 provides a leading international forum to bring together
researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, such as computer
science, information technology, business, education, human factors,
systems engineering, and robotics, to (1) examine the design
principles and performance characteristics of various approaches in
intelligent agent technology, and (2) increase the cross-fertilization
of ideas on the development of autonomous agents and multi-agent
systems among different domains. By encouraging idea-sharing and
discussions on the underlying logical, cognitive, physical, and
sociological foundations as well as the enabling technologies of
intelligent agents, IAT 2008 will foster the development of novel
paradigms and advanced solutions in agent-based computing.

IAT 2008 will be jointly held with the 2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Web Intelligence (WI-08).  The two conferences will have
a joint opening, keynote, reception, and banquet. Attendees only need
to register for one conference and can attend workshops, sessions,
tutorials, panels, exhibits and demonstrations across the two
conferences. We are also planning a joint panel, joint paper sessions,
and doctor symposium that discuss common problems in the two areas.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On-Line Submissions and Publication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

High-quality papers in all IAT related areas are solicited. 
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 7 pages in the
IEEE 2-column format, the same as the camera-ready format (see the
Author Guidelines of last year at
http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/AuthorKit.asp?Community=CPS&Facility=CPS_Nov&ERoom=IAT+2007). 
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on 
the basis of technical quality,  relevance, significance, and clarity. 

Note that IAT'08 will accept ONLY on-line submissions, containing
PDF versions. Please use the Submission Form on the IAT'08
website to submit your paper. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that are
indexed by EI.

Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 7 pages in the
proceedings and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference. 
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4
pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.

All co-authors will be notified at all time, for the submission,
notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper
to the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted,
at least one author should attend the conference to present the
paper. The acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published
on-line. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a
notification.

A selected number of IAT'08 accepted papers will be expanded and
revised for inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems: An
International Journal (http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and in
Annual Review of Intelligent Informatics
(http://www.wi-consortium.org/annual.html)

The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the
authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application
paper. Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the
best application paper award. 

More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form can be
found from the IAT'08 homepage: http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/wi08/html/iat/.
