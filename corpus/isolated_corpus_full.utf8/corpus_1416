Meeting Description:

The goal of the second workshop on "Computational Approaches to Arabic
Script-based Languages", held in conjunction with the LSA 2007 Linguistic
Institute, is to bring together researchers working on the computer processing
of Arabic script-based languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi and Dari),
Pashto, Urdu and Kurdish. The usage of the Arabic script and the influence of
Arabic vocabulary give rise to certain computational issues that are common to
all these languages despite their being of distinct language families, such as
right to left direction, encoding variation, absence of capitalization, complex
word structure, and a high degree of ambiguity due to non-representation of
short vowels in the writing system. The workshop will provide the participants
with an opportunity to exchange ideas, approaches and implementations of
computational systems, to highlight the common challenges faced by all
practitioners, to assess the state of the art in the field, and to identify
promising areas for future collaborative research in the development of NLP
resources and systems for Arabic script languages. 

Call for Demos and Posters:
Second Workshop on Computational Approaches to Arabic Script-based Languages

July 21-22, 2007
LSA 2007 Linguistic Institute
Stanford University
www.zoorna.org/CAASL2

Authors of proposals of demos and posters on all aspects of the automatic
processing of Arabic script-based languages are invited to submit an original
paper of no more than 4 pages including references to the organizers of the
workshop at karine@mitre.org and Ali.Farghaly@oracle.com no later than May 21,
2007. Notification of acceptance will be sent by June 1st, 2007. 

Proposals for demos should provide:
- an overview of what the demonstration aims to achieve 
- how the demo illustrates novel ideas or late-breaking results 
- any URLs that link to screen-shots, live demos, or related information 
- equipment or facilities required for the system demonstration 

Authors must indicate if their submission is a Poster or Demo paper. Demos and
the poster sessions will be held at special times on both days of the workshop.

purposes, please go to the workshop website at http://www.zoorna.org/CAASL2/
