Meeting Description:

We are happy to announce an international conference on natural language processing and more specifically the Amazigh language: The First International Symposium on Automatic Processing of the Amazigh Language SITACAM'09

Because the integration of information technology and communication in learning the Amazigh language is vital to having full citizenship in the digital world, we are convening a meeting of experts in the field of automatic processing of the Amazigh language. The promotion of Amazigh culture can help contribute to development and economic progress. Amazigh has been under-funded for computational efforts. Therefore, scientific and linguistic research efforts are being made to improve this situation. The design and implementation of applications that can handle Amazigh language data are increasingly required for the development and sustainability of Amazigh culture. This scientific event is part of this framework and provides a forum for dialogue between researchers and experts contributing to the implementation of strategies, models and systems able to deal with Amazigh characters, words and documents. The theme for this first conference is 'The Computerization of the Amazigh:!
  Challenges and Opportunities'. 

Call for Papers
