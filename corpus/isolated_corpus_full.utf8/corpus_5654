Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to invite you to submit a paper to the Language and 
Technology Conference 2009, Poznañ, Poland, in November 6-8.
Please do notice that the Conference is extended to November 5 by 
Less-Resourced Languages Workshop (LRL 2009) co-organised by FlaReNet 
and Elra/Elda (see below).

We hope to see you in Poznañ.
Best regards

Call for papers and participation

The 4th LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE: Human Language Technologies 
as a Challenge
for Computer Science and Linguistics (LTC 2009), a meeting organized by 
the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz 
University, Poznañ, Poland in cooperation with the Adam Mickiewicz 
University Foundation (co-organizer), will take place on November 6-8, 2009.

Human Language Technologies (HLT) continue to be a challenge for 
computer science, linguistics and related fields as these areas become 
an ever more essential element of our everyday technological 
environment. Since the very beginning of the Computer and Information  
Age these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. The European 
Union strongly supports HLT under the 7th Framework Program. These 
efforts as well as technological, social and cultural globalization have 
created a favorable climate for the intensive exchange of novel ideas, 
concepts and solutions across initially distant disciplines. We aim at 
further contributing to this exchange and invite you to join us at LTC 
in November 2009, as well as at the FlaReNet workshop (LRL 2009) on the 
theme "Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!".

Zygmunt Vetulani
LTC 2009 Chair

PAPER SUBMISSION

The conference accepts papers in English. Papers (5 formatted pages) are 
due by July 31, 2009 (midnight, any time zone) and should not identify 
the author(s)in any manner. In order to facilitate submission we have

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!

Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 -- 18h00) + cocktail

Theme:
Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the challenge 
of Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is necessary to have 
access to Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT performances. To this 
regard, the situation is very different across the different languages. 
Little or sparse data exist for languages in countries or regions where 
limited efforts have been devoted to such issues in the past, also known 
as Less-Resourced Languages (LRL). The workshop aims at reporting the 
needs, at presenting achievements and at proposing solutions for the 
future, both in terms of LR and of LT evaluation, especially in the 
European, Euro-Mediterranean and regional frameworks. This will allow to 
identity the factors that have an impact on a potential and shared 
roadmap towards supplying LR and LT for all languages.

Topics:
-    Experience in the production, validation and distribution of LR for 
less-resourced languages
-    Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced languages
-    Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in less-resourced 
languages
-    Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages, 
language clustering...)
-    To be completed...

Co-Chairs: Joseph Mariani (LIMSI-CNRS & IMMI-CNRS), Khalid Choukri(ELRA 
& ELDA), Zygmunt Vetulani (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan)

LRL Workshop Program Committee:

Nuria Bel (Univ. Pompeu Fabra, Spain)

LRL WORKSHOP: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!<br>
<br>
Name: Getting Less-Resourced Languages on-Board!<br>
<br>
Date: 5.11.2009, half-day (13h30 &#8211; 18h00) + cocktail<br>
<br>
Theme:<br>
Language Technologies (LT) provide an essential support to the
challenge of Multilingualism. In order to develop them, it is necessary
to have access to Language Resources (LR) and to assess LT
performances. To this regard, the situation is very different across
the different languages. Little or sparse data exist for languages in
countries or regions where limited efforts have been devoted to such
issues in the past, also known as Less-Resourced Languages (LRL). The
workshop aims at reporting the needs, at presenting achievements and at
proposing solutions for the future, both in terms of LR and of LT
evaluation, especially in the European, Euro-Mediterranean and regional
frameworks. This will allow to identity the factors that have an impact
on a potential and shared roadmap towards supplying LR and LT for all
languages.<br>
<br>
Topics:<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience in the production, validation and distribution of LR
for less-resourced languages<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience in the evaluation of LT for less-resourced languages<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infrastructures for making available LR and LT in less-resourced
languages<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternative approaches (comparable corpora, pivot languages,
language clustering&#8230;)<br>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be completed&#8230;<br>
<br>
