Full Title: Theoretical East Asian Linguistics 5 
Short Title: TEAL-5 

Date: 10-Sep-2008 - 11-Sep-2008
Location: Potsdam, Germany 
Contact Person: Daniel Hole
Meeting Email: teal5@ling.uni-potsdam.de
Web Site: http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/conference/teal-5.pdf 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 30-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

We welcome submissions that address problems of East Asian linguistics from a
theoretical perspective. A special session on 'Word-order variation and
universal grammar - areal, dialectal and information-structural perspectives'
will be held on the first day of the workshop. Each paper will be allotted 30
minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for discussion. 

Second Call for Papers

The TEAL Workshop was first launched in 1990 at the University of California,
Irvine as a mid-size workshop intended to foster research on East Asian
linguistics. It has been an important forum for presenting new theories and
exchanging novel ideas that bear on East Asian languages with theoretical
interests. Since 2002, the TEAL Workshop has been an international event. It was
held at Doshisha University, Japan in 2002, at National Tsing Hua University,
Taiwan in 2004, and at Harvard University, USA in 2005. Last year the TEAL
Workshop was held in conjunction with the Sixth GLOW in Asia.

General Session:
submissions from any domain of grammar are welcome

Special Session:
'Word-order variation and information structure - areal and dialectal perspectives'

Selection of papers is based on anonymous review of abstracts. A selection
committee will be formed to review the submitted abstracts which are considered
by the reviewers to be of high interest to the development of theoretical East
Asian linguistics and linguistic theory in general. Please follow these
guidelines to submit your abstracts:

All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two
single-spaced pages, complete with examples and bibliography. All texts should
fit within a US letter-size or A4 page, with 1-inch/2.5-cm margin all around.
Each abstract should start with the title (centered) at top, followed by 3
single-spaced blank lines, above the main text. Use font size 12 throughout,
preferably in Times or Times New Roman. Romanize all Asian texts, and avoid
Asian character fonts unless absolutely necessary.

The body of your email message should include the following information:

paper title
name(s) of the author(s)
affiliation(s)
(a single) e-mail address for correspondence
general session/special session [choose one]

Abstract submission is by email-attachment only. We cannot accept submissions by
postal mail. Save your abstract as a PDF, DOC, or RTF file. Documents in other
formats must be converted before submission. Name your abstract with your last
name followed by the suffix pdf, doc, or rtf (e.g., huang.pdf, kim.doc, or
watanabe.rtf). Send your abstract to:
teal5@ling.uni-potsdam.de 

Abstract selection is based on anonymous review. Please leave your name and
affiliation out of the abstract (but keep 3 blank lines between title and text).
The workshop will accept at most one single-authored work and one joint-authored
work by an individual.

Important Dates:
Deadline for abstract submissions: April 30th 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 15th 2008

July 17 - July 20, 2008 
Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Dongguk University, Seoul 

Call for Papers (2nd Call) 

Call Deadline: 04-Apr-2008  

The 10th Seoul International Conference On Generative Grammar 

Dongguk University, Seoul 
July 17 - July 20, 2008 
Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Dongguk University, Seoul 

Plenary Speaker: 
Hagit Borer (University of Southern California)

Invited Speakers: 
Marcel den Dikken (City University of New York)
Jason Merchant (University of Chicago) 
Peter Svenonius (University of Troms√∏)

Theme of General Session: Minimalist Explorations of the Syntax-Lexicon Interface 

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the general
session specified above, equal consideration will be given to papers from all
areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the
general session, one additional workshop, and a series of lectures from the
plenary speaker and the invited speakers. 

Abstracts should be anonymous and may not exceed 2 pages (A4), including 
examples and references, with 2.54 cm (1 inch) margin on all four sides and 
should employ the font Times New Roman 12 pt. Submissions are limited to a 
maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author. Please send a 
separate file containing the following information: (i) the title of the paper,
(ii) the author's name, (iii) affiliation, (iv) e-mail address, (v) telephone
number, and (vi) the preferred session (general or workshop). 

Abstracts should be sent electronically as Word or PDF attachments to Hee-Don
Ahn at hdahn@konkuk.ac.kr no later than April 4, 2008. 

Abstracts will be reviewed by readers, and authors will be notified by April 31,
2007. Each speaker of the general and the workshop session will be allotted 20
minutes followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Accepted papers will be published
in the Proceedings of 2008 Seoul International conference on Generative Grammar,
which will be distributed to the conference participants. All presenters will be
asked to provide camera-ready copies of their papers in publishable form by July
11, 2008. The text should be single-spaced and the general page limit is 20
pages including appendices and references. 

All the information about the conference is available on our website 
http://www.kggc.org. Participants are asked to check this web page to keep 
up to date regarding possible alterations and changes. Additional questions 
concerning the conference can be answered by sending a question to 
Myung-Kwan Park at parkmk@dgu.edu.  

Workshop: Structuring Lexical Information in Syntax

The characterization of words and structures and the division of grammatical
labor between them have been a major component of the generative linguistic
agenda. In recent years, a number of grammatical models have been advanced to
defend the view that the core syntactic properties of lexical entries can be
shouldered by various aspects of UG-determined structural templates (see Borer
2005 and Marantz 2001, among others). This view suggests that lexical entries,
in particular, has very limited, if not null, inherent formal properties and can
be just raw material which is pured into the structural mould to be assigned
grammatical properties. Thus, under this view syntactic structures essentially
provide unambiguous formulas for the semantics to interpret.

In this workshop, we invite papers that deal with the issues concerning this
particular neo-constructionist approach of nominal or verbal projections.
