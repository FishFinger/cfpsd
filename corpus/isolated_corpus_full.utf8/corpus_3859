                   ECOOP'2009
23rd European Conference on Object Oriented Programming
       July 6th - 10th 2009, Genova, Italy
            http://2009.ecoop.org

            CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

http://2009.ecoop.org/workshops.html

Workshops provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to meet 
and discuss focused issues in an atmosphere that fosters interaction, 
exchange, and problem solving. Workshops also provide the opportunity 
for representatives of a technical community to coordinate efforts and 
establish collective plans of action. All topics related to object-
oriented technology are potential candidates for workshops. More 
specifically, workshops typically fall into the following categories:

A workshop may address a specific sub-area of object-oriented technology 
in depth. Examples of such sub-areas include object-oriented analysis 
and design methods, object-oriented operating systems, distributed 
object programming or theoretical aspects of object-orientation.

A workshop may cover areas that cross the borders of several sub-areas 
in computer science, software engineering and related fields. Examples 
of such areas include testing of object-oriented software, management 
of object-oriented software projects, teaching object-oriented 
programming, requirements engineering, or aspect-orientation.

A workshop may focus on the applications and deployment of object-
oriented technology in areas such as telecommunications, e-commerce,
mobile computing or real-time systems. Workshops reporting on industrial 
experiences are particularly welcome.

Workshop topics are by no means limited to the examples mentioned above. 
However, in each case the proposed area is supposed to have enough 
impetus to yield new results which can be considered important and 
worth more detailed investigation.

The proposals will be reviewed by the ECOOP 2009 Workshop Co-Chairs, 
the workshop selection committee and possibly experts in the subject 
areas of the submitted proposals. Acceptance will be primarily based 
on an evaluation of the workshop's potential for generating useful 
results, relevance and expected level of interest in the topic, and 
the organizers' ability to lead a successful workshop.

For additional questions or clarification, or for your suggestions, 
please feel free to contact the ECOOP 2009 workshop chairs:
