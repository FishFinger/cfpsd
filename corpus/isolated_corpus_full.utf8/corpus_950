16th International Conference
on Software Engineering and Data Engineering
July 9-11, 2007
Imperial Palace Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada  USA
Sponsored by the International Society for Computers and their
Applications (ISCA)

The 16th SEDE Conference seeks high quality submissions in all areas
of Software Engineering (SE) and Data Engineering (DE).  This year the
conference puts special emphasis on the impact of parallel computing on
software engineering and data engineering.  Applied case studies will
report on exemplary solutions deployed in industries like automotive,
aerospace, telecommunications and finance. In the SE section particular
emphasis will be placed on techniques for software specification and
design of software/hardware components and the modeling of system
architectures. In the DE section, the emphasis this year is on high
performance algorithms that learn patterns from large volumes of data,
learn and predict events, adapt to situations, rationalize, provide
autonomous control, and assist in executive decision-making. The
conference also includes a BEST PAPER AWARD. The conference will cover a .....
