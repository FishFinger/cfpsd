MLMI'07 first announcement and call for papers:


                  4th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                    and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI'07)

                             28-30 June 2007
                          Brno, Czech Republic

                          http://www.mlmi07.org

The fourth MLMI workshop is coming to Brno in the Czech Republic, 
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005) and 
Washington, DC (2006).  MLMI brings together researchers from the 
different communities working on the common theme of advanced machine 
learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and human-computer 
interaction.  The motivation for creating this joint multi-disciplinary 
workshop arose from the actual needs of several large collaborative 
projects.

MLMI'07 will follow on directly from the annual conference of the 
Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/EACL 2007), which will 
take place in Prague on June 25-27, 2007.


* Important dates

Submission of full papers:  23 February 2007
Submission of extended abstracts:  23 March 2007
Submission of demonstration proposals:  23 March 2007
Acceptance decisions:  17 April 2007
Workshop:  28-30 June 2007


* Workshop topics

MLMI'07 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers), 
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit 
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine 
learning and multimodal interaction:
  - human-human communication modeling
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above


* Satellite events

MLMI'07 will feature special sessions and satellite events such as the 
Summer school of the European Masters in Speech and Language 
(http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/emasters/) and the PASCAL Speech Separation 
Challenge II (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlincol1/SSC2/).  To propose 
other special sessions or satellite events for MLMI'07, please contact 
the organizing committee.


* Guidelines for submission

In common with the previous MLMI workshops, revised versions of selected 
papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
series (cf. LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299).

Submissions are invited in one of the following formats:
  - full papers for oral or poster presentation (12 pages)
  - extended abstracts for poster presentation only (1-2 pages)
  - demonstration proposals (1-2 pages)

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at 
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi07/, following the Springer LNCS format 
for proceedings and other multiauthor volumes 
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0).


* Venue

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and the capital of 
Moravia.  Brno had been a royal city since 1347 and is the country's 
judiciary and trade-fair center.  With a population of almost four 
hundred thousand and its six universities, Brno is also the cultural 
center of the region.

Brno can be easily reached by direct flights from Prague, London and 
Munich and by trains or buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km).

MLMI'07 will take place at the Hotel Continental 
(http://www.continentalbrno.cz), a modern hotel located in a quiet part 
of the city within walking distance from the city center.  The local 
organizers are members of the Faculty of Information Technology 
(http://www.fit.vutbr.cz) at Brno University of Technology, which was 
founded in 1899 as the Czech Technological University.
