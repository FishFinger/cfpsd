Meeting Description:

Workshop on Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology (sfcm 2009)
http://sfcm2009.org
Workshop date: September 4, 2009
Location: University of Zurich, Switzerland
Submission deadline: March 1, 2009 

Call for Papers

From the point of view of computational linguistics, morphological resources are
the basis for all higher-level applications. This is especially true for
languages with a rich morphology like German. A morphology component should thus
be capable of analyzing single wordforms as well as whole corpora. For many
practical applications, not only morphological analysis, but also generation is
required, i.e., the production of surfaces corresponding to specific categories.

Apart from uses in computational linguistics, there are practical applications
that can benefit from morphological analysis and/or generation or even require
it, for example in text processing, user interfaces, or information retrieval.
These applications have specific requirements for morphological components,
including requirements from software engineering, such as programming interfaces
or robustness.

In 1994, the first Morpholympics, a competition between several systems for the
analysis and generation of German wordforms, took place at CLUE (Department of
Computational Linguistics at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen Nuremberg).

15 years later, some of the systems that participated in the Morpholympics still
exist and are being maintained. However, there are also new developments in the
field of computational morphology, for German and for other languages.
Unfortunately, the publications about morphologic analysis and generation are
spread over many different conferences and journals, so that it is difficult to
get an overview of the current state of the art and of the available systems. This
workshop tries to bring together researchers, developers, and maintainers of
morphology systems for German and of frameworks for computational morphology
from academia and industry.

This workshop concentrates on actual, working systems and frameworks of at least
prototype quality. To ensure fruitful discussions among workshop participants,
submissions on concrete morphology systems are preferrably for German;
submissions on morphological frameworks are relevant if the framework can be
used to implement components for different languages.

In contrast to, for example, Morphochallenge, this workshop focuses on systems
and frameworks based on linguistic principles and providing linguistically
motivated analyses and/or generation on the basis of linguistic categories.

The workshop has three main goals:
- To stimulate discussion among researchers and developers and to offer an
up-to-date overview of available systems for German morphology which provide
deep analyses and are suitable for generating specific wordforms.
- To stimulate discussion among developers of general frameworks that can be
used to implement morphological components for several languages.  
- To discuss aspects of evaluation of morphology systems and possible future
competitions or tasks, such as a new edition of the Morpholympics.

Topics
The topics of this workshop include both technical aspects, applications, and
uses of systems and frameworks for computational morphology. While purely
theoretical submissions may be relevant, the focus of the workshop is clearly on
actual, working systems and prototypes.

The workshop will mainly focus on German, but contributions for other languages
are encouraged in order to demonstrate open-source tools and runtime software
for full-scale morphologies. Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Frameworks for developing morphological components.
- Open-source tools and resources for morphology.
- Descriptions of systems for analyzing and generating wordforms, especially for
German.
- Suitability of morphological components for interactive use.
- Use cases for morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Reports on actual uses of morphological analysis and generation in applications.
- Methods and criteria for evaluating morphologic components with respect to
performance, quality, and coverage.
- Software engineering aspects: APIs, robustness, performance, hardware/software
requirements, resource usage.
- License models and legal aspects.

There will be opportunities for demonstrating systems.

Submissions
We invite researchers to submit full papers of up to 20 pages (including
references) or short papers of up to 10 pages. Long papers constitute an
excellent opportunity to publish citable, in-depth descriptions of systems and
frameworks. Submissions must be in English. Reviewing of papers will be
double-blind by the members of the program committee, and all submissions will
receive several independent reviews. Papers submitted at review stage must not
contain the authors' names, affiliations, or any information that may disclose
the authors' identity.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their research at the
workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the workshop
by Springer in their series Communications in Computer and Information Science.

The papers must use the Springer LNCS format. We recommend to use the LaTeX2e
format. Please strictly follow the Springer LNCS format guidelines. Papers must
be submitted electronically in PDF format. For paper submissions we use
EasyChair, see http://www.sfcm2009.org/?Submissions
