Linguistic Field(s): Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:

The general aim of the workshop 'Quantifiers and Modification' is to bring
together researchers of different fields (syntax, semantics, logic) and
thereby deepen our understanding of the role of modification in the diverse
landscape of natural language expressions of quantity. 

Final call for papers 
(note: updated information about fee grants below)

Quantifier Modification

is organised as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 http://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organisers:

Rick Nouwen (rick.nouwen@let.uu.nl)
Jakub Dotlacil (jakub.dotlacil@let.uu.nl)

Theme Description:

From the eighties onwards, logicians and linguists have studied the
properties of quantifying expressions by assigning them generalised
quantifier meanings. While this line of research has been successful in
isolating formal generalisations about the expression of quantity, it has
ignored the internal composition of complex quantifiers.

Recently, the modificational structures within complex quantifiers have
gained a fair amount of attention, mostly thanks to studies of a.o.
modified numerals, negative and negated quantifiers, focus-sensitive
operators, approximatives and except phrases. These studies yield a richer
analysis of natural language quantifiers than was possible given the coarse
level of generalisation of Generalised Quantifier Theory. Additionally,
these studies shed light on the cross-categorial application of some modifiers.

Workshop Topics:

The theme of the workshop brings up questions like the following:
- Is it tenable to retain a single analysis for any modifier? Or should its
use within the domain of quantifiers be seen as separate?
- What are the restrictions on the combinations of quantifiers and
modifiers and what is the nature (semantic, syntactic or other) of these
restrictions?
- Is there cross-linguistic variation w.r.t. these restrictions?
- What is the categorial status of a modified quantifier?
- How do the formal properties of modifiers relate to the formal results
familiar from generalised quantifier theory?

Submission details:

Authors are invited to submit an *anonymous* abstract describing completed
research or work in progress contributing to the above mentioned issues and
topics closely related to these. Submissions should not exceed 2 pages
(12pt font, A4 or US-letter, 2.5cm (1inch) margins on all four sides).
Abstracts should be formatted in PDF. Please send your submission
electronically to both of the following email addresses:
rick.nouwen@let.uu.nl, jakub.dotlacil@let.uu.nl. The body of your mail
should include the name of the author(s) and their affilitation(s), their
addresses and the title of the paper. The deadline for submissions is March
8, 2007.

The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme committee and additional reviewers. The accepted papers will appear in the workshop
proceedings published by ESSLLI. The format for the final versions will be
extended abstracts of maximally 6 pages.

Workshop format:

The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It
will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in
the first or second week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper
presentation and discussion per session. On the first day the workshop
organisers will give an introduction to the topic.

Important Dates:

Submissions: March 8, 2007
Notification: April 21, 2007
Preliminary programme: April 24, 2007
ESSLLI early registration: May 1, 2007
Final papers for proceedings: May 17, 2007
Final programme: June 21, 2007

Workshop dates: 13-17 August, 2007

Local Arrangements:

All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to
register for ESSLLI. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper
will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee.

For this workshop, there are up to two fee waiver grants available for authors who could otherwise not attend. If you think you are eligible for one of these waivers, please specify this along with your submission. The workshop organisers will decide who will receive the grants based on abstract quality and the motivation provided by the author.

Moreover, a number of additional fee waiver grants will be made available
by the OC on a competitive basis and workshop participants are eligible to
apply for those.
There will be no reimbursement for travel costs and accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should contact the local organising committee to ask for the possibilities for a grant.
