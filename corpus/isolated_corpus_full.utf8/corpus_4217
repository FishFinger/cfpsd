ASTON CORPUS CONFERENCE FOR POSTGRADUATE RESEARCHERS: THURSDAY 21 MAY 2009

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS: **DEADLINE 1st FEB**

The objective of the Corpus Conference for Postgraduate Researchers,
organized by the ACORN project team of the School of Languages and Social
Sciences at Aston University, is to enable postgraduates to present their
corpus-related research in a friendly environment. As with last year, we
are combining the conference with the Aston Corpus Symposium, which will
take place on the following day. Postgraduates will thus have the
opportunity to hear experts talk about their past and current projects.

Abstracts written in English of max 300 words (with bibliographical
references) for a 20 minute paper should be sent by 1 February 2009 to
tanguaye@aston.ac.uk. The preferred file formats are .doc and .pdf.
Author's name, affiliation, and contact details should be provided in a
separate attachment.

Presenters will also be invited to submit a 3,000-word conference paper to
be published in the online conference proceedings.

Authors of accepted abstracts will be notified by 1 March 2009.

Presentations can focus on any corpus-related topic.
