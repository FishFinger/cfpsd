Aims and Scope

 =


Since 1995, the NLDB conference, with high impact factor, has aimed at =

bringing

together researchers, industrials and potential users interested in =

various applications

of Natural Language in the Web and database driven information systems =

area. It has

contributed to many areas such as: improving the development process =

from the

viewpoints of the developers (e.g., the process of requirements =

engineering, conceptual

modeling, validation, etc.) the usability of applications (e.g., natural =

language query

interfaces, retrieval, semantic web, etc.) knowledge extraction and =

dissemination (e.g.,

text mining, knowledge discovery, etc.). To underline these inspiring =

connections,

NLDB 2009 will take place from June 23 to June 26 in Saarbr=FCcken, Germany.
