For the first time, the flagship conferences of the
Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) and Asian
Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP) -- the ACL
and IJCNLP -- are jointly organized as a single event. The
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 will cover a broad spectrum of technical
areas related to natural language and computation.
ACL-IJCNLP 2009 will include a rich array of the state of
the art: 120 full and 95 short paper presentations, 11
demonstrations, 6 tutorials, and 12 workshops.  We welcome
you to participate in the conference to discuss the latest
research findings. The 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods
in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) will also be
co-located with ACL-IJCNLP 2009 right here in Singapore,
which will also feature over 160 papers.

Singapore, the culturally and technologically vibrant Garden
City of Asia, is the stage set for the landmark joint
conference.  The conference will take place at Suntec
Singapore International Convention & Exhibition Centre,
which is only 20 minutes from Changi International
Airport. Suntec Singapore offers direct access to 5,200
hotel rooms, 1,000 shops, 300 restaurants and a world-class
performing arts centre.
