Call for Papers

Intelligent computing covers a hybrid palette of methods and techniques
derived from classical artificial intelligence, computational
intelligence, multi-agent systems a.o. Distributed computing studies
systems that contain loosely-coupled components running on different
networked computers and that communicate and coordinate their actions
by message transfer. The emergent field of intelligent distributed
computing is expected to pose special challenges of adaptation and
fruitful combination of results of both areas with a great impact
on the development of new generation intelligent distributed
information systems. The aim of this symposium is to bring together
researchers involved in intelligent distributed computing to allow
cross-fertilization and synergy of ideas and to enable advancement
of researches in the field.

The symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning
all aspects of intelligent distributed computing ranging from
concepts and theoretical developments to advanced technologies
and innovative applications. Papers acceptance and publication
will be judged based on their relevance to the symposium theme,
clarity of presentation, originality and accuracy of results
and proposed solutions. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Intelligent service composition and orchestration
- E-service and Web intelligence
- Multi-agent systems
- Information extraction and retrieval in distributed environments
- Data mining and knowledge discovery in distributed environments
- Semantic and knowledge grids
- Intelligent integration of data and processes
- Distributed problem solving and decision making
- Ontologies and meta-data for describing heterogeneous resources
  and services
- Autonomic, adaptive and self-organising distributed computing
  and systems
- Intelligence in mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing
- Intelligence in cooperative information systems, groupware
  and workflows, virtual enterprises, social networks
- Intelligent distributed applications in e-business/e-commerce,
  e-learning, e-health, e-science, e-government, crisis management
- Intelligence in Peer-to-Peer systems
- Emerging behaviours in complex distributed systems
- Modelling and simulation of intelligent distributed systems

All accepted papers will be included in the Symposium Proceedings, which
will be published by Springer as part of their series Studies in
Computational Intelligence. Papers should have at most 10 pages length
and must be formatted according to Springer format.

Submissions and reviews are automatically handled by a system provided
by the organizers. Please submit your paper here:
