Call Deadline: 17-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

The workshop will be held on 7 September, 2009, in San Sebastian, preceding
SEPLN, the Spanish NLP conference: http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/sepln2009/ 

Call for Papers

We invite papers on various topics concerning the use of Web resources for
corpus research and NLP applications, including (but not limited to) the following: 

Linguistic Web crawler technology and Web corpus collection projects
applications of Web-derived corpora and other kinds of Web data how far does the
'easy way' get you? (Using search engines, or Google's n-gram lists; we are
particularly interested in a critical discussion of the usefulness and
limitations of such approaches) methods and tools for 'cleaning' Web pages to
turn them into a corpus automatic linguistic annotation of Web data:
tokenisation, POS tagging, lemmatisation, semantic tagging, etc. (Established
tools often perform very poorly on Web data) search engine architectures for
linguists: bringing linguistics to commercial search engines, or
high-performance search technology to linguistics? Search engine-related topics
such as result ranking (e.g. how to identify 'typical' uses rather than
returning 50 very similar matches on the first page) duplicate detection,
interactive query refinement, etc. Reviews and clever uses of search engine APIs
(Google, Yahoo, Altavista, and in particular Microsoft's current generous Live
Search API) 

We particularly welcome submissions on the use of languages other than English. 
One of the bottlenecks in corpus linguistic research on a particular language
consists in availability of corpora for this language: translation studies for,
say, Ukrainian or Vietnamese are limited by the existence of diverse corpora for
these languages. The Web gives the opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, as
millions of Ukrainian or Vietnamese texts are available on the Web, but we still
do not know many parameters of what is there and how useful it is for
translation, language teaching, linguistics research, etc.

Submission Information
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop. Submissions should follow the format of ACL
proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files tailored
for this year's conference
(http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/). 

Submissions are managed via Easy Chair. In order to submit a paper, login at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wac5 (or register an account with
Easy Chair if you don't have one yet), then click New Submission and fill in the
standard fields.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
