Meeting Description:

The First Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (NLP4DL) workshop,
organised under the auspices of the CACAO project (eContentplus Programme of the
European Commission, ECP 2006 DILI 510035 CACAO), aims to collect all
fundamental and innovative research which is done in connection with Natural
Language Technologies applied to the digital libraries universe. 

Call for Papers

Digital libraries represent a crucial contact point among traditional libraries,
recent advances in Information Technology, and Natural Language Processing
technologies. In a sense, digital libraries represent a *perfect* crossroads:
they are mainly  built out of text, they are consulted by humans via natural
language, and one of the major tools  for accessing the information they hold,
metadata, is a mix of structured and unstructured information. 

Commission, ECP 2006 DILI 510035 CACAO), aims to collect all fundamental and
innovative research which is done in connection with Natural Language
Technologies applied to the digital libraries universe. The workshop will host
invited speakers together with talks/papers concerning:

- free text access to full-text digital libraries;
- access to digital resources via metadata;
- NLP techniques for harmonizing metadata in digital library (DL) federations;
- cross-language access to DLs;
- cross-language harmonization of metadata;
- discovery in DLs: hyperlinking, clustering, user-oriented categorization;
- management of digital collections via NLP-based algorithms;
- adaptation of linguistic resources to thematic DLs;
- fundamental issues: named entity extraction, word sense disambiguation,
translation disambiguation.

All abstracts papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted contributions will be
distributed on a CD at the workshop.  A volume from the conference will be
published in Fall 2009. Depending on the number of high quality submissions, a
poster/demo session may also be held. 

Practical Information
The conference will be held in Viareggio, Italy on 15 June  2009. More details
will be available soon at the conference website at
