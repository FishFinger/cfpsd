Full Title: Language Resources and Evaluation 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2007 

Multiword expressions: hard going or plain sailing?

Special issue of the International Journal of Language Resources and
Evaluation http://www.springer.com/journal/10579/ 

Guest editors:

Paul Rayson (Lancaster University, UK)
Begoña Villada Moirón (University of Groningen, The Netherlands)
Serge Sharoff (University of Leeds, UK)
Scott Piao (University of Manchester, UK)
Stefan Evert (University of Osnabrueck, Germany)

This special issue is concerned with language resources and evaluation in
the area of multiword expressions. For a number of years, the focus in the
natural language processing (NLP) community on the problems posed by
multiword expressions (MWE) was on English. Recently, for example at the
ACL and EACL workshops on multiword expressions, attention has expanded to
other languages including Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, German, Estonian,
Russian, Basque, Turkish and Hindi. This necessitates a re-evaluation of
earlier rule-based, statistical and hybrid techniques for MWE extraction
and classification. In English, MWE types such as phrasal verbs, light verb
constructions, noun compounds, proper names, and non-compositional idioms,
have been considered. However, in other languages some MWE types can be
represented as compound words, e.g. phrasal verbs in English are generally
expressed as verb-prefix in Russian. At the same time, research on MWEs for
languages other than English is confronted with new problems, such as the
number of word forms per lemma, case marking, word order or word segmentation.

The focus of this special issue is on the acquisition and analysis of
language resources related to MWE and the methods for evaluation of the
extraction procedures and resulting MWE resources. Language resources
include written or spoken corpora marked up for MWE, terminology or domain
specific databases and dictionaries of MWE, as well as software tools for
their acquisition and analysis.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:

* Linguistic analysis
* Typologies of MWE
* Extraction methods
* Evaluation strategies
* Compositionality
* Applications
