Linguistic Field(s): Ling & Literature 

Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

The overarching theme of the conference is the triple nexus between the study of
English literature, the English language, and the scientific study of language
known as linguistics. 

Call for Abstracts

Reshaping the Mould:
An International Conference on Literature and Language Studies

This is a call for abstracts for an international conference on literature and
language studies that the GC University, Lahore, Pakistan (www.gcu.edu.pk), is
planning to organize (pending approval of funding) in January 2009 in
collaboration with the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. The conference
proceedings will span three days, namely, 19-21 January.

The overarching theme of the conference is the triple nexus between the study of
English literature, the English language, and the scientific study of language
known as linguistics, a nexus that exists as it does today in many parts of the
world in large measure due to historical convenience. The situation in general
seems to be riddled with a number of paradoxes: for instance, often the
distinctions between (i) English literature and the literature of non-English
origins, i.e., literature in English and literature accessed through translation
into English, (ii) the study of English for the purposes of attaining functional
proficiency in the language, and (iii) the scientific investigation of language
as a universal human cognitive system, get blurred in pursuit of what has been
administratively the parent discipline in a large number of postcolonial
contexts, i.e., English literature or, more generally speaking, English studies.
Not infrequently the ambiguity of this situation makes people consider these
other more or less related disciplines as mere extensions of the study of
English language and literature within which the disciplines in question are
perceived to coexist as a result of an unwritten uneasy truce between them.

This conference aims to bring together researchers and writers who are keen to
discuss this state of affairs, not necessarily in a confrontational manner. In
addition, those who do not intend to directly challenge the status quo, or
present alternatives to it, will also have an opportunity to present their
research on a substantial aspect of any of these three areas of investigation,
as one of the major aims of the conference is to enhance an understanding of
some significant academic issues regardless of the boundary disputes implied
earlier, thus accepting their overlapping coexistence as an unavoidable
practical reality which should not prevent people from moving on within the
peculiar situation they find themselves in respectively, a strategy which might
result in some of the demarcational faculty disputes simply being left behind,
or in their disappearance from the academic scene altogether without any
definitive resolution. Thus, the conference is likely to envisage, indeed
encourage, a revisionist agenda, but not at the expense of the inherent value of
the research accomplished within the prevalent framework (such as it is!).

We invite abstracts (from literary scholars, linguists, language teachers, area
study specialists, etc., including graduate students) on the specific theme(s)
described above, but also on many other relevant themes, some of which are
listed below. It goes without saying that the abstracts submitted need not to be
confined to the following list, which is not intended to be exhaustive. The
conference presentations are likely to consist of sessions organized around
specific themes, and will in addition be interspersed with discussion sessions.
Each individual presentation will be expected to last 20 minutes (leaving aside
the keynote speakers), to be followed by a question-answer session of
10-minutes' duration.

1. Fundamental research and criticism; literary theory in general.
2. The humanizing role of literature in education.
3. The English language and its postcolonial discontents.
4. Literature and linguistics.
5. The significance of linguistics as a discipline.
6. The English language in South Asia.
7. The South Asian literature in English.
8. Educational implications of literature and linguistics.
9. Linguistics and language teaching.
10. Literature and language teaching.

Keynote Speakers:
The following have accepted the invitation to be the keynote speakers:

Graeme Cane, Aga Khan University
Vivian Cook, University of Newcastle
Muhammed Hanif (author of A Case of Exploding Mangoes)
Jason Harding, University of Durham
Alamgir Hashmi, PIDE
Tariq Rahman, Quaid-e-Azam University
Rajendra Singh, University of Montreal
Shaista Sonnu Sirajuddin, Punjab University

Abstract Submission: 
Two copies of each abstract should be sent: one anonymous, and the other with
the name and the affiliation of the author(s). These should preferably be
submitted through e-mail to the address specified below. Not exceeding 500 words
(excluding any references, data, tables, etc.), the abstracts must be in the
Word/A4 format, single-spaced, justified on both sides with a 1½ inch margin on
and the left and the right of the text and also at the top and the bottom of a
page. They should be typed in 12-point Times New Roman, with the title in bold
14-point of the same type of font. Authors may submit at most two abstracts,
individually or as a joint author. Likewise, no more than two abstracts may be
submitted by the same set of joint authors. Further, there is a possibility that
a selection of the papers presented will be submitted to a reputable publisher
as a volume to be published.

General Information: The delegates (with the exception of the keynote speakers)
will be expected to pay and arrange for their accommodation themselves. However,
the organizers will do their best to help them locate appropriate places.
Further detailed information regarding travel, accommodation and other
hospitality arrangements will be posted on the conference website in due course.
It might as well be mentioned that the neo-Gothic GCU campus, the venue of the
conference, was built around 150 years ago, and is located near the heart of the
historic city of Lahore (that is, just outside the walled inner city).

Registration: The participants whose abstracts have been accepted must
pre-register for the conference at least four weeks in advance. Other delegates
may register on-site. The registration fee is US$ 20.00 for international
participants, and PakRs 300.00 for Pakistani participants. This may be

be specified on the conference website.
