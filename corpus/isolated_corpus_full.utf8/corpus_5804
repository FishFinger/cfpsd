Full Title: 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation 
Short Title: PACLIC 23 

Date: 03-Dec-2009 - 05-Dec-2009
Location: Hong Kong, Hong Kong 
Contact Person: Olivia Kwong
Meeting Email: paclic23@cityu.edu.hk

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Aug-2009 

Meeting Description:

PACLIC 23 is organized by the Department of Chinese, Translation and Linguistics, and the Language Information Sciences Research Centre of the City University of Hong Kong, under the auspices of the PACLIC Steering Committee.

The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong Kong on 3-5 December 2009. The PACLIC series of conferences emphasizes the synergy of theoretical analysis and processing of language, and provides a forum for researchers in different fields of language study in the Pacific-Asia region to meet, to inspire and to be inspired.  According to the Computer Science Conference Ranking Website, as in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of 701 conferences in topic area II (AI and Machine Learning), roughly at top 7%. (http://www.cs-conference-ranking.or/conferencerankings/topicsii.html). 

Call for Papers:

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on all aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics. Topics include but are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, typology, corpus linguistics, formal grammar theory, natural language processing, natural language systems and related computer applications. Papers which showcase the synergistic effects offered by multi-disciplinary approaches on the construction of language resources and development of language processing applications are particularly encouraged. Different research topics could address the following issues in one way or another, to feature the mutual advancement among language, information and computation:

-How has formal linguistic analysis informed language technology and how is it deployed in advancing the development of language processing applications?
-What light has theoretical linguistics shed on the information demand of natural language processing, and how has it led to large-scale machine-usable language resources?
-How have linguistically-informed language resources improved the performance of language processing applications?
-What does the advancement in language technology have to offer theoretical linguists with respect to research methodology and analysis framework?
-What is the limit of pure computational methods like machine learning in language processing?  What roles do related disciplines such as cognitive science and psycholinguistics have to play in bridging the gap between human and computer language processing?

Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished work. Papers should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10) pages, including references. Please follow the formatting instructions and use the style files provided here. Accepted papers will be presented in one of the regular sessions or poster sessions as determined by the program committee. Such decisions will be based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. 

The submission deadline for PACLIC 23 is now extended to 15 Aug 2009 11:59PM Hong Kong time (GMT+8).
