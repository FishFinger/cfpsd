practical applications of linguistic theories, such as discourse analysis,
text linguistics, pragmatics, conversational analysis, sociolinguistics,
syntax, semantics, phonology, etc, to a wide range of digital or social
interactive technology discourses, such as written/oral computer-mediated
communication (electronic mail, Internet Relay Chat, weblog, discussion
board/forum, webzine, audio/video conferencing,  facebook, voice chat,
instant messaging, text messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
mobile voice communication, and so on). Preferably, contribution should
deal with digital discourses in English, but applications to other
languages will also be welcome, provided that the articles are written in
English. 

Articles for consideration, which should not be longer than 10.000 words,
should be submitted on or before April 15, 2009 in Microsoft Word format to
