Meeting Description:
YEMM was founded in 2003 by Alexandra Galani and Ryo Otoguro, who were then PhD
students at the University of York and the University of Essex, respectively. It
aims at giving the opportunity for informal discussion of a variety of issues in
morphology. The meeting is a place to exchange ideas from different theoretical
perspectives and familiarise people, particularly students, with different
frameworks. For these purposes, we invite specialists from various frameworks
working on morphology-related research topics. We also have a number of student
presentations. Previous meetings, held alternately at York and Essex, were very
successful. Everyone sharing the same interests is welcome to join us! 

The Fifth York-Essex Morphology Meeting (YEMM5), which will be held at the 
University of York (England) 9-10th February 2008, is organized jointly by the 
University of York and the University of Essex.
