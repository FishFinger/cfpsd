ld of Yiddish linguistics and General Linguists working on language change =
and language contact.

The following scholars have been asked to deliver a keynote talk at the wor=
kshop:

Steffen Krogh (University of Aarhus) - confirmed
Johan van der Auwera (University of Antwerp) - confirmed
Yaron Matras (University of Manchester) - confirmed
Gertrud Reershemius (Aston University) - confirmed

The workshop is also meant to be a forum to discuss the new project of an o=
n-line 'Corpus of Modern Yiddish' (CMY) which aims at compiling a balanced =
text corpus of Modern Yiddish of about 10 million words. The CMY is a joint=
 project of scholars from Regensburg and Moscow.

The conference languages will be English, Yiddish and German.
