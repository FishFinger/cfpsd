Workshop on Search and Information Extraction from Audio Data

Call for Papers:
Extension of Submission Deadline to 27th September.


Description

As part of SummerFest 2008, to be held at UNSW in the week of December
1st-5th 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research Network in Human Communication)
is organising a workshop on Search and Information Extraction from Audio
Data.

There is a vast amount of information embedded in audio data, most
notably in speech and music recordings. Due to the nature of this data,
it is time-consuming for people to assimilate this information; but the
ever-increasing quantity of data in this form means there is an
impending need for automated processes that can help humans to extract
relevant information from audio recordings. Yet machine-based
information search, browsing and extraction over audio data is still in
its early stages.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
developers in all areas related to the extraction of information from
sound recordings, retrieval of recordings, and their browsing and
summarisation. Special emphasis will be given to aspects related to
human-human and human-machine communication.


Keynote Speaker

Our Keynote Speaker for this event is Malcolm Slaney
(http://research.yahoo.com/Malcolm_Slaney); make sure you take
advantage of this rare visit by Malcolm to Australia.

Intended Audience

This workshop is relevant to any researchers or developers focusing on
the analysis or processing of speech or music, and in general in any
area related to the use of audio for communication between people or
between humans and machines. The workshop should be of particular
interest to HCSNet members engaged in the Priority Areas of
Next-generation Search Technology, Speech, and Perception and Action.
For enquiries about the workshop, contact Diego Molla.

Submissions

Submissions for presentation at the workshop are sought. Topics of
interest include but are not limited to:

Speech recognition
Speaker identification
Extraction of named entities
Question answering
Retrieval of speech data
Music retrieval
Music summarisation
Speech summarisation
Analysis of music, speech, sounds
Extraction of communicative features (e.g. prosody, formants, emotion,
turns, topic change, song chorus)

Submission Format

Submission is via a title and 250-word abstract via the HCSNet website
at http://sf08.hcsnet.edu.au/submissions.  A limited number of travel
bursaries will be available to Australian-based presenters of accepted
abstracts.
