The current networked world has created a global landscape and a mandate for
a significant change. The Internet has enabled communication and
collaboration across the world and brought many computing models. In that
landscape, people and organizations have been distributing the work, service
and technology anywhere in the world. The last decade is marked by the
development of many technologies and strategies in improving the efficiency
of computation. Heuristic-based methods and reasoning have also been
reported in the literature but little effort has been made by researchers to
combine all the available techniques. The proposed conference will discuss
what we can learn from computing systems and how we can implement the output
of computing systems in an intelligent way using the state-of-the-art
methods and technologies.

This conference will bring research across the countries at a broad level on
computing systems. The conference will have presentations, workshops and
industrial contributions on intelligent computing.

Topics

As the boundary line between Computing intelligence and other areas is
fluid, we invite original research in the following (but not limited)
themes.

Wireless communication
Intelligence Algorithms and Applications
Web Intelligence, Brain Informatics
Intelligent e-Technology such as e-Science, e-Business, e-Learning,
e-Finance, e-Government and related technologies
Grid Intelligence
Web Agents
Web Information Filtering and Retrieval
Web Mining and Farming
Multiagent Systems
Web4 (World Wide Wisdom Web)
Intelligent agents and Agents and Data Mining
Human-Computer Interface
Integrated data access
Ontology, Semantic Web, Ubiquitous Computing
Sensor Technologies
Applied Artificial Intelligence
Swarm Intelligence
Semantic web services
Context -aware intelligent computing
Visualization
Ubiquitous computers, networks
Semantic technologies, like XML, RDF, OWL
RFID
Problem solving intelligence
Integrated computer systems
Software integrated computer engineering
Cloud computing
Future Multimedia databases using intelligent computing
