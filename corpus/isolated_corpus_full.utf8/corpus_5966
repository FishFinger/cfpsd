Meeting Description:

The 17th Balkan and South Slavic Linguistics, Literature and Folklore Conference will take place at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA, April 15-18, 2010.

The conference will feature the Kenneth E. Naylor Memorial Lecture in South Slavic Linguistics on Friday April 16. This year's Naylor Lecturer will be Eric P. Hamp, Professor Emeritus from the University of Chicago. The conference will also be held concurrently with the Midwest Slavic Conference.

This conference highlights research on languages, literatures and cultures of the Southeast European region, both individually and in relation to one another. While a venue for research on areal linguistic convergence and contact, the scope of the conference extends to other South Slavic (but not properly Balkan) groups, and to other types of linguistic investigation. 

Call for Papers:

Abstract Submission Deadline: November 23, 2009

The conference organizers are now accepting proposals for papers that treat some aspect of Balkan and/or South Slavic linguistics, folklore, film studies, literature or culture. Abstracts should be maximum one page, including examples and bibliography if needed (12-point font, at least 1'' margins). Abstracts should be anonymous.

Abstracts should be submitted, in PDF format, by email to Andrea Sims (sims.120 at osu.edu). The paper title, author name(s), affiliation(s), and contact information should be given in the body of the email.

More information is available at http://bss17.osu.edu

Questions about the conference may be directed to Brian Joseph (joseph.1 at osu.edu) or Andrea Sims (sims.120 at osu.edu).
