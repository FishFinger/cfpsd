Meeting Description:

Speech Prosody 2010
Every Language, Every Style: Globalizing the Science of Prosody 

Call for Papers

Prosody is, as far as we know, a universal characteristic of human speech,
founded on the cognitive processes of speech production and perception. Adequate
modeling of prosody has been shown to improve human-computer interface, to aid
clinical diagnosis, and to improve the quality of second language instruction,
among many other applications.

Speech Prosody 2010, the fifth international conference on speech prosody,
invites papers addressing any aspect of the science and technology of prosody.
Speech Prosody is the only recurring international conference focused on prosody
as an organizing principle for the social, psychological, linguistic, and
technological aspects of spoken language. Speech Prosody 2010 seeks, in
particular, to discuss the universality of prosody. To what extent can the
observed scientific and technological benefits of prosodic modeling be ported to
new languages, and to new styles of spoken language? Toward this end, Speech
Prosody 2010 especially welcomes papers that create or adapt models of prosody
to languages, dialects, sociolects, and/or communicative situations that are
inadequately addressed by the current state of the art.

Topics
Speech Prosody 2010 will include keynote presentations, oral sessions, and
poster sessions covering topics including:
- Prosody of under-resourced languages and dialects
- Communicative situation and speaking style
- Dynamics of prosody: structures that adapt to new situations
- Phonology and phonetics of prosody
- Rhythm and duration
- Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics
- Meta-linguistic and para-linguistic communication
- Signal processing
- Automatic speech synthesis, recognition and understanding
- Prosody of sign language
- Prosody in face-to-face interaction: audiovisual modeling and analysis
- Prosodic aspects of speech and language pathology
- Prosody in language contact and second language acquisition
- Prosody and psycholinguistics
- Prosody in computational linguistics
- Voice quality, phonation, and vocal dynamics

Submission of Papers
Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length, four-page papers,
including figures and references, at http://speechprosody2010.org. All Speech
Prosody papers will be handled and reviewed electronically.

Venue
The Doubletree Hotel Magnificent Mile is located two blocks from North Michigan
Avenue, and three blocks from Navy Pier, at the cultural center of Chicago. The
Windy City has been the center of American innovation since the mid nineteenth
century, when a railway link connected Chicago to the west coast, civil
engineers reversed the direction of the Chicago river, Chicago financiers
invented commodity corn (maize), and the Great Chicago Fire destroyed almost
every building in the city. The Magnificent Mile hosts scores of galleries and
museums, and hundreds of world-class restaurants and boutiques.

Important Dates
Submission of Papers (http://speechprosody2010.org): October 15, 2009
Notification of Acceptance: December 15, 2009
Conference: May 11-14, 2010

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
