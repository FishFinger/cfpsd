Meeting Description:

Dialects & Dialogues

Fifteenth Annual Interdisciplinary German Studies Conference
at the University of California, Berkeley
March 16-18, 2007
http://german.berkeley.edu/germanconf/ 

Paper proposals are being accepted for the 15th Annual Interdisciplinary German Studies Conference, taking place March 16-18, 2007 at the University of California, Berkeley. 

With the conference theme Dialects & Dialogues, this conference aims to explore historical, 
(pop-)cultural, political, linguistic, and literary movements concerning the notions of dialect and German. 

Like a puzzle, the German language is made up of many pieces. Some pieces are easily recognizable creating the borders of the image, while others don't seem to fit at first glance, and still others have been scattered or lost on the floor.  No piece alone represents the entire picture, rather the dialogue of juxtaposition and interaction of all the varieties create the German language.

What role has dialect played in deciding history?  What is the relationship between communicator and dialect?  How does an author play with dialect?  To what extent do people interpret dialect as a social marker? How do dialects simultaneously create a dialogue of difference and commonality?  How do we measure what is and what isn't dialect? 
We invite scholars from all disciplines to submit paper proposals in German or English responding to these or similar questions related to dialect and the German language. Possible topics include but are not limited to the following:

- Portrayals of dialect in film, music, and popular culture;
- Perception of dialect from inside and outside;
- Dialect as alterity the ''Other'';
- Interplay of dialect and community;
- Immigration and Sprachinseln;
- Diachronic dialect development;
- Synchronic status of dialect;
- Representation of dialect in literature;
- Language preservation;
- Dialect and standardization;
- Dialect's place in the classroom.

Please send an abstract of not more than 250 words with a separate cover sheet indicating the proposed title, author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address to:

Joellyn Palomaki/Timothy Price
Department of German
