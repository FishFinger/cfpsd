Full Title: Workshop on Formal Approaches to the Phonology-Morphology-Syntax
Interfaces 

Date: 16-Dec-2009 - 16-Dec-2009
Location: Barcelona, Spain 
Contact Person: Cl√†udia Pons
Meeting Email: console18@uab.cat
Web Site: http://seneca.uab.cat/clt/ConsoleXVIII/workshop.html 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Morphology; Phonology; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Investigation of interface phenomena, be it phonology-morphology,
phonology-syntax, or morphology-syntax, has a central position in lingusitic
inquiry.  Interface investigations are not only important for discovering the
nature of the interfaces themselves, but also for illuminating properties of the
interfacing domains that might otherwise remain obscure. Moreover, an
integration of the results of studies of distinct interfaces offers the
potential for a higher level understanding of the nature of a linguistic
interface, an abstraction that can very well contribute to a deeper 
understanding of the organization of the faculty of language. 

Second Call for Papers

Workshop on Formal approaches to the phonology-morphology-syntax interfaces

NB: Although the workshop immediately precedes ConSOLE XVIII, it is not
restricted to students. The workshop is open to anyone who wishes to send an
abstract.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
