Meeting Description:

Identity is a broad, complex and increasingly topical issue in a variety of
fields such as sociolinguistics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, linguistic
anthropology and language learning and teaching, where identity is primarily
regarded as a social phenomenon. The conference on Dialogic Language Use 2 aims
at understanding the complexity of identity by bringing together scholars from
diverse theoretical and methodological backgrounds and creating theoretical and
methodological interfaces between macro- and microanalytic approaches,
quantitative and qualitative methods, spoken and written language, and the
synchronic and diachronic perspectives. 
The conference focuses on English, German and Romance languages.

Plenary Speakers:
Mary Bucholtz (University of California, Santa Barbara, USA)
Patrick Charaudeau (Université Paris-Nord - Paris XIII, France)
Gabriele Diewald (Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany)
