Meeting Description:

Congress Session: Language and Education.

Workshop: The Attraction of Words. Teaching the Language(s) of Persuasion
Organizers: Rosita Maglie and Annarita Taronna, Faculty of Education, Unive=
rsity of Bari

Language is how we get our opinions across and how we make others understan=
d our ideas, to persuade them to think and act the way we do. The basic ide=
a is that attitude change is dependent on the language people engage when t=
hey receive a persuasive communication. Indeed, as George Orwell has observ=
ed, no writing is truly free of "the desire to push the world in a certain =
direction, to alter other people's idea of the kind of society that they sh=
ould strive after."=20

The aim of this workshop is to investigate covert and overt rhetoric in ESP=
 discourse and its implication in language teaching models for a variety of=
 specific domains such as:
=20
-Science & Technology,=20
-Law and Politics;=20
-Tourism;=20
-Advertising and Marketing;=20
-Journalism=20

Call for Papers:

On this background, the present workshop wants to gather and encourage scho=
lars and teachers to discuss the following key-questions: how does language=
 function in personal and professional life? What is the "language of persu=
asion"? In what ways language is "persuasive"? And how is persuasion "lingu=
istic"?

In order to provide a common theoretical platform on these challenging issu=
es, participants are basically invited to figure out the implications of pe=
rsuasion in the psycho-pedagogy of language and in most current syllabuses =
within English Language Teaching (ELT). Specifically, drawing on one's own =
teaching experiences, they may illustrate how to teach students to recognis=
e persuasion and its rhetorical techniques through which language works its=
 magic on us, to analyse how texts are constructed using persuasive words, =
sentence and text-level terminology and then to articulate and reproduce su=
ch texts themselves.  Furthermore, such engaging discourse as the English f=
or Special/Specific Purposes (ESP) will be taken into account as a case-stu=
dy in which the language of persuasion achieves its most powerful effects.=
=20

In professional settings, specialists are indeed very skilled in the art of=
 persuasion. The most subtle and effective strategy consists in making the =
addressee think that s/he is not conditioned by the addresser, that there i=
s no rhetoric, that a research reporting, for instance, is indeed 'writing =
degree zero' and that the facts are really speaking for themselves. Other t=
echniques are available to the lawyer, politician, journalist or advertiser=
, who, to drive home a point, may repeat, exaggerate or understate her/his =
case, etc. Ergo, participating effectively in a professional English enviro=
nment requires a great effort on the part of the learners who should have n=
ot only a solid grasp of English grammar, but also an understanding of the =
international key communication factors used to promote a product in busine=
ss fields, for instance. Good English usage also depends on judging the sit=
uation well. Grammar is important. Knowing how to use various forms of the =
language in different situations and how to deviate from them can make the =
difference between communicating and communicating effectively. The task of=
 the ESP scholar and teacher should thus be to enable learners to engage in=
 and interpret a diverse range of conventional language events in their tar=
get-language lives thus making them able to effectively participate in inte=
rnational contexts where the knowledge of language and of its communication=
 skills are indispensable tools to skillfully attract and manipulate people=
s' mind. =20

Deadline for proposals: September 30th, 2009. Note: each proposal must incl=
ude the following information: name; status (teacher, student, professional=
); professional affiliation (university, institution); postal and e-mail ad=
dresses.
