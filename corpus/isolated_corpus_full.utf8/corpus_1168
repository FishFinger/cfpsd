Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This conference is the final event in a two-year European project (Covcell),
aimed at supporting language learning and teaching in an online environment by
adding tools which support collaboration and co-operation to the functionalities
already provided by the Moodle learning management system. 

COSELLO

Conference on Open Source in Education and Language Learning Online

Special Theme: The problem of language learning online - Is Moodle the answer?

Friday 28th to Saturday 29th September 2007

University of Iceland

Reykjav√≠k, Iceland

As well as showcasing the collaborative tools developed by the project, the
conference seeks to address critical issues in the field of online language
learning from two perspectives: (1) the pedagogical perspective of the
effectiveness of cohort-oriented, task-based approaches to language learning and
teaching in an online environment; (2) the technical perspective of open source
development of tools which support online language learning and teaching.

We therefore welcome papers in either of these two domains:

(1)   papers concerning current issues in the pedagogy of online language
learning and teaching, especially the effectiveness of approaches that allow
students to learn language while collaborating on tasks in cohort-supported
environments;

(2)   papers concerning the development of open source tools which support
language learning and teaching in an online environment and especially the
suitability of such tools for use with established open-source learning
management systems such as Moodle.

Papers that address the special theme of the effectiveness of Moodle for
language learning and teaching are particularly welcome. See below for
instructions on paper submission.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will also be eligible for
consideration for publication in a book related to the theme of the conference.

Information on registration plus other practical information will be available
shortly via http://covcell.org. There will be no registration fee for this
conference.

Important dates:

15th April 2007 - deadline for submission of abstracts

27th June 2007 - notification of acceptance

28-29th September 2007 - conference

in English.

The abstract should be no more than 2 pages of A4 including all references, data

in the case of multiple authors), e.g. whelpton-abstract.pdf

The abstract should be e-mailed no later than 15th April 2007 to both of the
following addresses:

whelpton@hi.is

mgu@hi.is

Call Deadline: 05-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
Bidirectional Optimality Theory - Foundations and Applications. 

Final Call for Papers!

Bidirectional Optimality Theory
May 4th-5th, 2007, 
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

URL: http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/events/biot07/

This conference will be held as the second part of the double conference on:

Contrast and Bidirectional Optimality Theory
May 3rd-5th, 2007, 
Centre for General Linguistics, Typology and Universals Research (ZAS),
Berlin, Germany

Bidirectional Optimality Theory (Bi-OT) emerged at the turn of the millennium as
a fusion of Radical Pragmatics and Optimality Theoretic Semantics. It stirred a
wealth of new research in the pragmatics - semantics interface and heavily
influenced e.g. the development of evolutionary and game theoretic approaches.
This conference is dedicated to discussions of foundational issues,
presentations of new linguistic applications, and comparisons with other
frameworks. We invite Bi-OT related original research contributions which could
address a wide variety of themes including, but not restricted to, the following
topics:
 
-	contrast and other discourse relations
-	argument structure
-	conversational implicatures
-	underspecification and semantic meaning
-	language acquisition
-	language evolution and history
-	language typology
-	embodiment of language
-	computational models
-	etc.

The organisers are planning to publish a selection of the results of the
conference either as a special issue of a journal or as a book. 

Invited Speakers:
Maria Aloni, Amsterdam
Reinhard Blutner, Amsterdam
Helen de Hoop, Nijmegen
Henk Zeevat, Amsterdam

Submissions:
Authors should submit an anonymous abstract. The length of abstracts for talks
should be at most 2 single-column pages including literature. All submissions
should include a separate cover page specifying the authors' names, affiliation,
address, e-mail address and title of the paper. The abstracts should be
submitted electronically (pdf, ps or doc format) to: biot07@zas.gwz-berlin.de
