*****Call for Tutorial Proposals*****

**************************************
Future Internet Symposium
FIS 2008

28th-30th September | Vienna, Austria
http://www.fis2008.org/

*Background*

The Future Internet Symposium will be highly interdisciplinary, open to all
scientific areas, with an emphasis on the technologies driving the
development of Web 3.0: semantics and services. 
Research should address the key challenges facing the Internet:
. Scalability in the face of peer-to-peer traffic, decentralisation, and
increased openness
. Trust when government, medical, financial, personal data are increasingly
trusted to the cloud, and middleware will increasingly use dynamic service
selection
. Interoperability of semantic data and metadata, and of services which will
be  dynamically orchestrated
. Pervasive usability for users of mobile devices, different languages,
cultures and physical abilities
. Mobility for users who expect a seamless experience across spaces,
devices, and velocities. 

An additional and equally important role for the Future Internet Symposium
is to be a home for the Future Internet community. In this respect the
Symposium will serve the interest of the emerging community and foster new
researchers (PhD students and fresh Post-docs) as they progress to become
the new leaders in this emerging field.
Further information is available on the portal www.fis2008.org

*Call for Tutorial Proposals*

We would like to invite tutorial proposals for FIS 2008. 
Tutorials in FIS2008 will complement the main conference by providing sound
state of the art background material. Tutorials should cover topics related
to the Future Internet and might cover cross-domain issues or take a
multidisciplinary approach. Tutorials may be either for a half day or full
day and should follow the agenda and the research key challenges of the main
conference.

Interested parties are invited to submit Tutorial proposals by email to
Claudia Guglielmina (claudia.guglielmina@txt.it) 
Presenters will be notified of the status of their proposal by the proposal
acceptance date below according to the Symposium Programme organisation.

*Tutorial organization*

Upon acceptance the tutorial organizers will be responsible for the
following:

. Producing a "Call for Participation" text for the tutorial. The call
should mention that all tutorial participants must pay the tutorial
registration fee.
. Publicising the tutorial, distributing the call to relevant newsgroups,
mailing lists, targeting the relevant interdisciplinary audience.
. Producing a Web page for the tutorial and submitting the URL for the Web
page to the tutorial chair no later than June 27.

The FIS2008 Organizing Committee will support the workshop organizers by:

. Providing publicity for the tutorial on the conference's Web page and
through additional dissemination channels.
. Providing logistics facilities for the tutorial at the conference venue
including hardcopies of the tutorial slides.
 
*Important Dates*

Call for Proposals opens: May 15, 2008 
Proposal submission deadline: June 15, 2008 
Proposal acceptance: July 15, 2008 
Handout PDF deadline: September 15, 2008 
Conference: September 28-30, 2008

must include the following information:
. Tutorial title. 
. Tutorial abstract 
. Tutorial outline, for review stating the relevance for the Future Internet
(include timing). 
. Presenter name(s) & contact information (email, telephone). 
. Tutorial format description (lecture, interactive lecture, Q&A session,
