Description 

Genres of spoken and written texts are being intensively studied from var=
ious angles, e.g., communication studies, discourse analysis, computation=
al linguistics, without arriving at a generally accepted definition. Many=
 corpora have been built to represent the language, but very few large co=
rpora indicate genres, and when they do the typology of genres varies wid=
ely. For instance, the Brown corpus famously uses 15 textual categories, =
from press reportage (a text genre) to religion or skills and hobbies (do=
mains), while the British National Corpus (BNC) uses 70 classes, such as =
academic or non-academic scientific texts or biography. Interestingly, ge=
nre classes in the BNC are an add-on proposed by David Lee (Lee, 2001) af=
ter the corpus construction, rather than a basic criterion of the corpus =
creation. The genre attribute was included in a few collections used in i=
nformation retrieval (TREC HARD 2003 and 2004, or TREC-2006 Blog Track), =
but the set of genres proposed was either debatable (e.g. the =91reaction=
=92 genre in TREC HARD 2003), or limited to a single genre (e.g. the blog=
 genre in TREC-2006 Blog Track).

The web is new, so it is even less not clear how to apply traditional not=
ions of genre to web documents. In corpus-based genre studies, the main t=
endency has been to build one's own genre collection according to subject=
ive criteria for corpus composition, genre annotation, and genre granular=
ity. Genre annotation has been based either on the common sense of a sing=
le rater, or on the agreement of few annotators. In brief, as it is now, =
web genre analyses remain self-contained and corpus-dependent. 

Building a reference corpus of web genres is certainly difficult because =
web documents are often characterised by a high level of genre hybridism,=
 by a fragmentation of textuality across several documents, by the impact=
 of technical features such as hyperlinking, posting facilities and multi=
-authoring. Since the web is a huge reservoir of documents that can be ea=
sily mined for building all sorts of corpora, it is important to overcome=
 the subjectivity that characterizes genre-related issues, in order to cr=
eate sharable resources. What should we consider when designing a referen=
ce corpus of web genres? Genres of web documents show some traits that ar=
e not accounted for in TREC collections or in the BNC and that are, inste=
ad, important on the web. For example: 

* Genre Hybridism and Individualization 
The fluidity and fast-paced dynamism of the web together with the complex=
ity of web pages cause unclear genre conventions, and favour genre mixtur=
e and authorial creativity. These two phenomena appear to be very common =
on the web. 
  
* Granularity of the Unit of Analysis 
How many granularities of the unit of analysis should be included? Only g=
enres representing web sites? Only genre representing web pages? Both? 
  
* Format of Web Documents 
An issue related to the previous one is represented by the 'format' that =
should be used to store the 'units of analysis' in a collection. In what =
form can a web page or a website be included in a corpus? In HTML format =
or in a text-only version? Including images or leaving them out? Removing=
 boilerplates or keeping them? In, a database-like form, as DOM trees, as=
 a net of graphs, in HTML format, or simply in a text-only version? 
  
* Genre Granularity and Similarity 
Genres can be accounted for at subgenre, genre and super-genre level: wha=
t level of genre granularity should be applied in the reference corpus? F=
urthermore, should similar genres, such as TUTORIAL and HOW-TO, be accoun=
ted for separately? 
  
* How to build a Genre Palette 
How many and which genres should be included in a genre reference corpus?=
 
  
* Validation and Evaluation of a Reference Corpus of Web Genres 
How can we validate and evaluate the quality of a genre corpus? 
  

Rationale for the Colloquium 

The rationale for this colloquium is to draw up an initial list of charac=
teristics and requirements for building, annotating and evaluating refere=
nce corpora of web genres. 

Building a genre-annotated reference corpus of web pages is arduous for a=
 number of reasons, and several solutions appear to be viable. In this co=
lloquium, we would like to make a first attempt to apply the concept of g=
enre to the development of sharable criteria for building genre corpora. =


The ambition of this colloquium, the first ever organized on this topic, =
is to bring together researchers from different communities such as corpu=
s linguistics, genre analysis, digital genre community, computational lin=
guistics, and information retrieval in order to promote the discussion an=
d development of new ideas and methods to create new corpora for language=
 studies and as evaluation resources.   

SHORT ABSTRACTS 

Alexander Mehler: A Corpus Model of Structure Formation in Hypertext Type=
s
This paper describes a web genre corpus model. Its starting point is a gr=
aph model of the logical document structure of hypertext types and of the=
 linkage of their constituents. We describe an XML-based serialization of=
 this model and provide a database mapping which retains a wide range of =
web genre data. This will be exemplified by three web genres. 

Barbara H. Kwasnik, Kevin Crowston, Joseph Rubleske and You-Lee Chun: Bui=
lding a Corpus of Genre-Tagged Webpages for an Information-Access Experim=
ent
This presentation reports on one phase of a larger study whose overarchin=
g aim is to determine how providing genre metadata can help in access to =
sources of information in a digital environment. We have built a corpus o=
f genre-tagged web pages and structured this particular experimental corp=
us in such a way as to provide the maximum control for our experiments. W=
e recognize, however, that much rich genre information was either too dif=
ficult to represent or had to be pared away.

Serge Sharoff: In the garden and in the jungle: comparing genres in the B=
NC and Internet
According to Adam Kilgarriff the BNC is a jungle when compared to smaller=
 Brown-type corpora, but it looks more like an English garden when compar=
ed to the Internet. In this presentation I will compare English and Russi=
an Internet corpora against their human-collected counterparts (BNC and R=
NC) using two methods: the first involves manual annotation of a subset o=
f Internet corpora, the second one uses probabilistic classifiers. The st=
udy shows that the Internet is not radically different from the BNC: Inte=
rnet corpora do contain a wide range of genres and approximate many genre=
s that exist in their printed form, the same is true for the audience lev=
el (texts for professional or layman texts).

Mark Rosso: Development of a Genre Palette
This presentation details the development of a genre palette used in the =
study of the effects of genre-annotated search results on the relevance j=
udgement process in a web search environment. This palette development wa=
s conducted in several phases: (i) a survey of user terminology; (ii) use=
r-based refinement of terminology into a tentative genre palette, and (ii=
i) user validation of the genre palette. 

Andrea Stubbe and Christoph Ringlstetter: Recognizing Genres
We introduce a two-level hierarchy of genres based on the definition of g=
enre in terms of form and function (or purpose). Thereby we provide suffi=
cient granularity with the possibility to return to a coarser scheme when=
 preferable. As some texts may naturally fall into more than one genre, a=
n assignment to multiple classes is possible. For those applications wher=
e a unique class is required, several techniques for the combination of c=
lassifiers were evaluated.

Andrea Stubbe, Christoph Ringlstetter, Tong Zheng, and Randy Goebe: Incre=
mental genre classification
In this presentation we will describe attempts to acquire data. These att=
empts have to consider the users explicitly and cooperatively. The user b=
ehaviour will be simulated using annotated corpus data. We will also form=
ulate different scenarios for information gain representing different lev=
els of uncertainty. Our goal is to integrate existing material of differe=
nt sources into a realistic application. 

Cornelius Puschmann: SchemaCMD: An XML-based storage schema for the compi=
lation of mixed-source CMD corpora
This presentation will outline an XML schema for the segmentation and sto=
rage of data from Internet sources, specifically those which utilize so-c=
alled web feeds (often associated with the RSS protocol). It is based on =
the faceted classification scheme recently proposed by Susan Herring and =
aims to make data from diverse sources accessible and comparable in a sin=
gle format.
