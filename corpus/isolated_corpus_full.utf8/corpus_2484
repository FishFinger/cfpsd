Linguistic Field(s): Morphology; Psycholinguistics; Syntax; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2008 

Meeting Description:

The goal of this workshop is to address empirical and theoretical aspects of
scales (or hierarchies), as they are relevant for grammatical phenomena like
argument encoding and diatheses (see, e.g., Silverstein 1976, Comrie 1981,
Aissen 2003), by bringing together research from typology, grammatical theory,
and psycholinguistics. 

Abstract Submission
Email to: scales@uni-leipzig.de

Abstracts should be anonymous, no more than one page, in pdf format; 12pt, at
least 2cm margins on all sides, for 30 minute talks (40 minute slots). Name,
affiliation, and title of the abstract should be included in the body of the email.

Reimbursement: Speakers will be partially reimbursed.

Deadline for abstract submission: January 31, 2008 (Notification of
acceptance: February 5, 2007)

The workshop will combine 10 presentations selected from the submitted abstracts
with contributions by members of Forschergruppe 742 (including Balthasar Bickel,
Petr Biskup, Ina Bornkessel, Michael Cysouw, Uwe Junghanns, Martin Haspelmath,
Andrej Malchukov, Gereon Mueller, Jochen Trommer).


Workshop Description:

Since the discovery of scales (or hierarchies) for grammatical categories in the
70s, many cross-linguistic generalizations have been noted in the
functional-typological literature, especially in domains such as person/number
marking, argument encoding by case or agreement (Silverstein 1976, Dixon 1979),
and diatheses and direction marking (Comrie 1981, DeLancey 1981). The
formulation of scales as ''implicational hierarchies'' has enabled researchers
in this area to formulate some of the most robust generalizations on language.
More recently, the concept of scales has received considerable attention in
grammatical theory as well. In particular, the work of Aissen (1999, 2003) has
triggered a surge of research occupied with the question of how the effects of
scales are related to general principles of morpho-syntactic theory.  Also,
recent work in psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theorizing has argued for
cross-linguistic principles of language processing which employ the notion of a
scale. The idea is that scales may help to guide incremental argument
interpretation by serving to shape the interpretive relations than are
established between different arguments online (Bornkessel & Schlesewsky 2006).

In this workshop we would like to discuss empirical and theoretical aspects of
scales including (but not restricted to) the following.

(i) How well-established is the cross-linguistic evidence for implicational
scales? Recently, different potential counter-examples have been discussed (see
Filimonova 2005, Haude 2007). The question is especially pressing as the
availability of large databases (WALS, TDS) and recent comprehensive field work
studies promise a better understanding of the relevant empirical
generalizations. Also, is there evidence for new scales that have so far gone
unnoticed? And could it be that scales are organized in a meta-hierarchy with
respect to each other?

(ii) What is the status of scales in grammatical theory? Are they part of
grammar itself (Noyer 1992, Aissen 1999, 2003) or rather epiphenomena? If the
latter, are they epiphenomena of (a) functionality or frequency distributions in
language use (Bresnan, Dingare & Manning 2001, Newmeyer 2002, Hawkins 2004,
Haspelmath 2008), or (b) derivable from other grammatical mechanisms such as
feature geometry or/and syntactic movement (Harley & Ritter 2002, Bejar 2003)?
What is the relation between feature hierarchies and the order of
functional projections in syntax (Cinque 1999, Starke 2001)?

(iii) Which role do scales play in the language processing architecture? Should
they be afforded an independent status or can they be viewed as epiphenomena of
other information types (e.g., frequency of occurrence)? Is there evidence for
the interaction of different scales during language processing and, if so, how
does this interaction take place?
