Call for Papers

SIGDIAL 2009 Conference
10th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue
Queen Mary University of London, UK September 11-12, 2009
(right after Interspeech 2009)

Extended Submission Deadline: May 4, 2009

The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting edge
research in discourse and dialogue to both academic and industry researchers.
Due to the success of the nine previous SIGDIAL workshops, SIGDIAL is now a
conference. The conference is sponsored by the SIGDIAL organization, which
serves as the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for both ACL and
ISCA. SIGDIAL 2009 will be co-located with Interspeech 2009 as a satellite event.

In addition to presentations and system demonstrations, the program includes
talks by two invited speakers:
- Professor Janet Bavelas (University of Victoria): "What's unique about dialogue?"
- Professor Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield): "Artificial companions as
dialogue agents".

Topics of Interest
We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementation, experimental, or analytical
work on discourse and dialogue including, but not restricted to, the following
themes:

1. Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems
Discourse semantic and pragmatic issues in NLP applications such as text
summarization, question answering, information retrieval including topics like:
- Discourse structure, temporal structure, information structure;
- Discourse markers, cues and particles and their use;
- (Co-)Reference and anaphora resolution, metonymy and bridging resolution;
- Subjectivity, opinions and semantic orientation.

Spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems including topics such as:
- Dialogue management models;
- Speech and gesture, text and graphics integration;
- Strategies for preventing, detecting or handling miscommunication (repair and
correction types, clarification and under-specificity, grounding and feedback
strategies);
- Utilizing prosodic information for understanding and for disambiguation.

2. Corpora, Tools and Methodology
Corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and spoken, text-based and
multi-modal dialogue including its support, in particular:
- Annotation tools and coding schemes;
- Data resources for discourse and dialogue studies;
- Corpus-based techniques and analysis (including machine learning);
- Evaluation of systems and components, including methodology, metrics and case
studies.

3. Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling
The pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e. beyond a single
sentence) including the following issues:
- The semantics/pragmatics of dialogue acts (including those which are less
studied in the semantics/pragmatics framework);
- Models of discourse/dialogue structure and their relation to referential and
relational structure;
- Prosody in discourse and dialogue;
- Models of presupposition and accommodation; operational models of
conversational implicature.

Submissions
The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers for full plenary
presentation as well as short papers and demonstrations. Short papers and demo
descriptions will be featured in short plenary presentations, followed by
posters and demonstrations.

- Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title, examples,
references, etc. In addition to this, two additional pages are allowed as an
appendix which may include extended example discourses or dialogues, algorithms,
graphical representations, etc.
- Short papers and demo descriptions should be 4 pages or less (including title,
examples, references, etc.).

Please use the official ACL style files: http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications
must provide this information (see submission format). SIGDIAL 2009 cannot
accept for publication or presentation work that will be (or has been) published
elsewhere. Any questions regarding submissions can be sent to the General Co-Chairs.

Authors are encouraged to make illustrative materials available, on the web or
otherwise. Examples might include excerpts of recorded conversations, recordings
of human-computer dialogues, interfaces to working systems, and so on.

Best Paper Awards
In order to recognize significant advancements in dialog and discourse science
and technology, SIGDIAL will (for the first time) recognize a Best Paper Awards
and a Best Student Paper Award. A selection committee consisting of prominent
researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.

Satellite Event
The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems, a SIGDIAL
satellite event, is also to be held at QMUL, on September 13-14
(i.e. immediately following the main conference). This is an annual workshop
designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working in research
related to spoken dialogue systems in both academia and industry.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
