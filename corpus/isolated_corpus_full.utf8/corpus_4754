FORMATS 2009: The 7th International Conference on
Formal Modelling and Analysis of Timed Systems

*** co-located with QEST 2009 ***

Budapest, Hungary, 13-16 September 2009

http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/FORMATS2009/
================================================================
*** CALL FOR PAPERS ***
Abstract submission: Friday 10 April, 2009
Paper submission: Friday 17 April, 2009
================================================================

FORMATS 2009 -- OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

Timing aspects of systems from a variety of computer science domains have been 
treated independently by different communities. Researchers interested in 
semantics, verification and performance analysis study models such as timed 
automata and timed Petri nets, the digital design community focusses on 
propagation and switching delays while designers of embedded controllers have 
to take account of the time taken by controllers to compute their responses 
after sampling the environment.

Timing-related questions in these separate disciplines do have their 
particularities. However, there is a growing awareness that there are basic 
problems that are common to all of them. In particular, all these 
sub-disciplines treat systems whose behaviour depends upon combinations of 
logical and temporal constraints; namely, constraints on the temporal distances 
between occurrences of events.

The aim of FORMATS is to promote the study of fundamental and practical aspects 
of timed systems, and to bring together researchers from different disciplines 
that share interests in modelling and analysis of timed systems. Typical topics 
include (but are not limited to):

*** Foundations and Semantics
Theoretical foundations of timed systems and languages; comparison between 
different models (timed automata, timed Petri nets, hybrid automata, timed 
process algebra, max-plus algebra, probabilistic models).

*** Methods and Tools
Techniques, algorithms, data structures, and software tools for analyzing timed 
systems and resolving temporal constraints (scheduling, worst-case execution 
time analysis, optimisation, model checking, testing, constraint solving, 
etc.).

*** Applications
Adaptation and specialization of timing technology in application domains in 
which timing plays an important role (real-time software, hardware circuits, 
and problems of scheduling in manufacturing and telecommunication).

IMPORTANT DATES:

Abstract submission:  Friday 10 April, 2009

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION:

The proceedings of FORMATS 09 will be published by Springer in the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science series. Papers must contain original contributions, 
be clearly written, and include appropriate references to and comparison with 
related work. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published 
proceedings is not allowed. Submissions should not exceed 15 pages, and should 
be formatted according to Springer LNCS guidelines. If necessary, the 
submission may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be 
reviewed at the discretion of the program committee.
New: A best-paper award will be presented at the conference.
Submissions will be handled by the EasyChair system.
