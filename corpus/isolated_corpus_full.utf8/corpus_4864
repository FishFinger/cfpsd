SIGDIAL 2009 CONFERENCE
10th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group
on Discourse and Dialogue

Queen Mary University of London, UK - September 11-12, 2009
(right after Interspeech 2009)


Submission Deadline: April 24, 2009

CALL FOR PAPERS

The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of
cutting edge research in discourse and dialogue to both academic and
industry researchers. Due to the success of the nine previous SIGDIAL
workshops, SIGDIAL is now a conference. The conference is sponsored by
the SIGDIAL organization, which serves as the Special Interest Group in
discourse and dialogue for both ACL and ISCA. SIGDIAL 2009 will be
co-located with Interspeech 2009 as a satellite event.

In addition to presentations and system demonstrations, the program
includes talks by two invited speakers:

- Professor Janet Bavelas (University of Victoria): "What's unique about
   dialogue?"
- Professor Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield): "Artificial
companions as dialogue agents".


TOPICS OF INTEREST

We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementation, experimental, or
analytical work on discourse and dialogue including, but not restricted
to, the following themes:

1. Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems

Discourse semantic and pragmatic issues in NLP applications such as text
summarization, question answering, information retrieval including
topics like:

- Discourse structure, temporal structure, information structure ;
- Discourse markers, cues and particles and their use;
- (Co-)Reference and anaphora resolution, metonymy and bridging resolution;
- Subjectivity, opinions and semantic orientation;

Spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems including
topics such as:

- Dialogue management models;
- Speech and gesture, text and graphics integration;
- Strategies for preventing, detecting or handling miscommunication
(repair and correction types, clarification and under-specificity,
grounding and feedback strategies);
- Utilizing prosodic information for understanding and for disambiguation;

2. Corpora, Tools and Methodology

Corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and spoken, text-based
and multi-modal dialogue including its support, in particular:

- Annotation tools and coding schemes;
- Data resources for discourse and dialogue studies;
- Corpus-based techniques and analysis (including machine learning);
- Evaluation of systems and components, including methodology, metrics
and case studies;

3. Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling

The pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e. beyond a
single sentence) including the following issues:

- The semantics/pragmatics of dialogue acts (including those which are
less studied in the semantics/pragmatics framework);
- Models of discourse/dialogue structure and their relation to
referential and relational structure;
- Prosody in discourse and dialogue;
- Models of presupposition and accommodation; operational models of
   conversational implicature.


SUBMISSIONS

The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers for full
plenary presentation as well as short papers and demonstrations. Short
papers and demo descriptions will be featured in short plenary
presentations, followed by posters and demonstrations.

- Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title, examples,
references, etc. In addition to this, two additional pages are allowed
as an appendix which may include extended example discourses or
dialogues, algorithms, graphical representations, etc.
- Short papers and demo descriptions should be 4 pages or less
(including title, examples, references, etc.).

Please use the official ACL style files:
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles/

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information (see submission format).
SIGDIAL 2009 cannot accept for publication or presentation work that
will be (or has been) published elsewhere. Any questions regarding
submissions can be sent to the General Co-Chairs.

Authors are encouraged to make illustrative materials available, on the
web or otherwise. Examples might include excerpts of recorded
conversations, recordings of human-computer dialogues, interfaces to
working systems, and so on.


BEST PAPER AWARDS

In order to recognize significant advancements in dialog and discourse
science and technology, SIGDIAL will (for the first time) recognize a
BEST PAPER AWARD and a BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD. A selection committee
consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will
select the recipients of the awards.


SATELLITE EVENT

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems, a SIGDIAL
satellite event, is also to be held at QMUL, on September 13-14
(i.e. immediately following the main conference). This is an annual
workshop designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers
working in research related to spoken dialogue systems in both academia
and industry.
