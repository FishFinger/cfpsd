Call for Papers and Participation
(***Deadline extended until 10th July.***)


Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems 2009

13th-14th September, at Queen Mary University of London



*Overview and goals*

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems (YRRSDS)
is an annual workshop designed for post-graduate students, post-docs
and junior researchers working in research related to spoken dialogue
systems in both academia and industry. The roundtable provides an open
forum where participants can discuss their research interests, current
work and future plans. The workshop has three main goals:
- to offer an interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about
current issues in spoken dialogue systems research
- to provide young researchers with career advice from senior
researchers and professionals from both academic and industrial
backgrounds
- to develop a stronger international network of young researchers
working in the field.

(Important note: There is no age restriction for participating in the
workshop; the word 'young' is meant to indicate that it is targeted
towards researchers who are at a relatively early stage in their
career.)


*Topics and sessions*

Potential roundtable discussion topics include: best practices for
conducting and evaluating user studies of spoken dialogue systems, the
prosody of conversation, methods of analysis for dialogue systems,
conversational agents and virtual characters, cultural adaptation of
dialogue strategies, and user modelling.

Previous workshops were held in Columbus (ACL 2008), Antwerp
(INTERSPEECH 2007), Pittsburgh (INTERSPEECH 2006) and Lisbon
(INTERSPEECH 2005).

YRRSDS=E2=80=9909 will feature:
- a senior researcher panel (both academia and industry)
- a demo and poster session
- a special session on frameworks and grand challenges for dialogue
system evaluation
- a special session on EU projects related to spoken dialogue systems.

Confirmed speakers and panelists:
- Alan Black, Carnegie Mellon University
- Philippe Bretier, Orange Labs
- Maxine Eskenazi, Carnegie Mellon University
- Michael McTear, University of Ulster
- Sebastian M=C3=B6ller, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories
- Tim Paek, Microsoft Research

- Jason Williams, AT&T


*Workshop date*

YRRSDS'09 will take place on September 13th and 14th, 2009
(immediately after Interspeech and SIGDial 2009).


*Workshop location*

The 2009 YRRSDS will be held at Queen Mary University of London, one
of the UK's leading research-focused higher education institutions.
Queen Mary=E2=80=99s Mile End campus began life in 1887 as the People's
Palace, a philanthropic endeavour to provide east Londoners with
education and social activities, and is located in the heart of
London's vibrant East End.


*Grants*

YRRSDS 2009 will be supported this year by ISCA, the International
Speech Communication Association. ISCA will consider applications for
a limited number of travel grants. Applications should be send
directly to grants@isca-speech.org, details of the application process
and forms are available from http://www.isca-speech.org/grants.html.


*Endorsements*

YRR'09 is endorsed by the Special Interest Group on Discourse and
Dialogue (SIGDial) of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(ACL) and of the International Speech Communication Association
(ISCA); by ISCA; and by "Dialogs on Dialogs" students reading group;
and is supported by the IEEE Speech and Language Technical Committee.


*Sponsors*

Orange, Microsoft Research, AT&T


*Submission process*

Participants will be asked to submit a 2-page position paper based on
a template provided by the organising committee. In their papers,
authors will include a short biographical sketch, a brief statement of
research interests, a description of their research work, and a short
discussion of what they believe to be the most significant and
interesting issues in spoken dialogue systems today and in the near
future. Participants will also provide three suggestions for
discussion topics.

Workshop attendance will be limited to 50 participants. Submissions
will be accepted on a first-come-first-served basis. Submissions will
be collated and made available to participants. We also plan to
publish the position papers and presentations from the workshop on the
web, subject to any sponsor or publisher constraints.
