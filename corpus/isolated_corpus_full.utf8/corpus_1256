Meeting Description:

A Workshop on Formal Approaches to the Relation of Tense, Aspect and Modality to
be held in conjunction with the 18th International Congress of Linguists (CIL 18). 

Workshop description:

Tense, aspect and modality have generally been considered to belong to distinct
categories. It is, however, well known that they are not always marked
separately in a language. Modal distinctions such as Realis/Irrealis can be
coded in what can primarily be described as tense forms, aspectual forms or
modals depending on a language. Epistemic modality and evidentiality have also
been observed to be relevant to the semantic characterization of tense and
aspect. Tense and aspect can be, in some cases, not so easily separable in
languages like Korean or Japanese, where aspectual meanings are associated with
tense forms, or vice versa. Tense, aspect and modality are three of the
grammatical categories that have received most detailed linguistic descriptions
but the question of how the three categories interact with one another has only
very recently begun to receive due treatment in formal linguistic theories. This
workshop calls for papers that aim to address tense, aspect and modality of
individual languages or in general linguistic terms from the following
perspectives or approaches:

1) Comparative perspective: they have to address issues in tense, aspect and/or
modality in at least two languages from a comparative perspective.

2) Inter-category interaction: they have to deal with the interrelationship
between tense, aspect and/or modality, e.g. tense and aspect, aspect and
modality, tense and modality.

3) Formal approaches: they have to take formal approaches to the problems.
Papers in formal semantics, syntax, pragmatics, and discourse can be accepted,
if they meet the requirements in (1) and (2).

Submission of Abstracts:

A small number of papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. We
invite submissions for twenty minutes talks (20 minutes for presentation plus 10
minutes for questions). A two-page abstract including everything should be sent
electronically to both cil18@cil18.org and ytakubo@bun,kyoto-u.ac.jp. An MS Word
and/or .pdf file may be accepted.

Important Dates:

- Deadline for Abstract Submission: May 31, 2007
- Notification of Acceptance/Rejection: August 31, 2007
