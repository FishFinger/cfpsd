Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Variation and Change in Argument Realization,' organized by
J=F3hanna Bar=F0dal (University of Bergen) and Michela Cennamo (University =
of
Naples), will take place at the premises of the University of Naples in Cap=
ri
and Naples, 28-30 May 2010.

The workshop aims at exploring the diachronic and/or variational implicatio=
ns of
 modern current frameworks, pertaining to, for instance, their applicabilit=
y on
diachronic changes and variational data, the predictions they make on the
progression and actualization of change, and the generalizations offered fo=
r
patterns of variation and change.=20

Call for Papers

Invited Speakers
- Balthasar Bickel (University of Leipzig)
- Miriam Fried (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague)
- Adam Ledgeway (University of Cambridge)
- Ranko Matasovi? (University of Zagreb)
- Nigel Vincent (University of Manchester)

Research on the nature of argument structure and the factors determining it=
s
encoding and representation has highlighted the complex interplay of semant=
ic,
syntactic and pragmatic factors that determine argument realization within =
and
across languages (cf. Cennamo 2003, Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005, Bentley
2006, Goldberg 2006, Bar=F0dal 2006, 2008, Ramchand 2008, Van Valin 2009, a=
mong
others). The consensus view emerging from a large body of synchronic resear=
ch
acknowledges the key roles played by event-based notions such as aspect (e.=
g.,
telicity, incremental theme) and control, and inherent features of argument
fillers, such as animacy and definiteness, in determining the mapping from =
the
lexical semantic to the morphosyntactic planes. The existence of non-event =
based
aspects in the encoding of arguments has also prompted current investigatio=
n of
the contribution of the idiosyncratic (the root) and structural facets (the
event-structure templates) of the meaning of verbs to argument realization,=
 and
the principles governing their integration (Rappaport Hovav 2008).

This workshop aims at exploring these issues from a diachronic and variatio=
nal
perspective (cf. Bar=F0dal and Chelliah 2009, Cennamo 2009), bringing toget=
her
different strands of research on event/argument structure, as reflected in =
the
choice of key-note speakers, and focusing on:

a) the applicability of current models, whether typological, projectionist,
constructional, neo-constructional, co-compositional, and others, on actual
diachronic changes and variational data from different domains, such as
auxiliary selection, argument marking and linking, ditransitives, the conat=
ive,
locative, (anti)causative alternation, etc.
b) the predictions they make as to the progression and actualization of cha=
nge,
for instance whether syntactic aspects are affected earlier by change than
lexical aspects, the role played by pragmatic notions, frequency, etc.=20
c) the generalizations offered for recurrent patterns of variation and chan=
ge,
and the uniformity encountered

Contributions are invited from scholars of different theoretical persuasion=
s for
discussion on the general and specific implications of different theoretica=
l
models on argument/event structure in a diachronic and/or variational
perspective, including, but not limited to, the following:
- voice
- case-marking and grammatical relations
- (in)transitive alternations
- split intransitivity
- existential/presentative constructions

Please send your abstracts of 500 words or less to the workshop's contact
person: Eystein Dahl (Eystein.Dahl@uib.no). Abstracts should be sent no lat=
er
than 15 December 2009, preferably in pdf- format. A response on abstracts w=
ill
be sent out no later than 20 January 2010.
