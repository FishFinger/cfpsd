Presentation
RECITAL is reserved for PhD students and young doctors who passed their PhD up

RECITAL has a calling to offer to young NLP researchers the opportunity to
present their research works and to compare their approaches. This conference
has its own program committee which is composed of researchers and PhD students. 

Submissions accepted by the committee are published in the same conference book
as TALN papers.

The official conference language is french. English submissions are accepted for
non french-speaking people.

Scientific Directions
Submissions have to be about one of those thematics :
- Information research and NLP, information extraction, automatic summarization,
Q/A systems ;
- Morphologic automatic analysis, syntax, semantics, lexical semantics, speech ;
- Automatic translation and alignement ;
- Human to machine communication in natural language ;
- Automatic generation and text planification ;
- Systems evaluation ;
- Acquiring resources and resources development (lexicon, ontology, grammars ...)

Selection Criterion
Authors must exclusively be PhD students, Master Degree students or young
doctors (who passed their PhD at most one year ago). Submissions which appear to
have been co-written by confirmed researchers will be rejected (this type of
submission has to be submitted to TALN, not to RECITAL).

Authors are encouraged to submit original research works, which have not been
previously published. Submissions will be examined by at least two domain
specialists. Most important aspects to be considered :
- Contribution importance and originality ;
- Scientific and technical contents have to be correct ;
- Results discussion, in particular compared to other domain research works ;
- Presentation organization and clarity ;
- Adequation to the conference thematics.

Selected papers will be published in the conference book. According to the
programm comittee opinion, presentation will be either oral or posters. A prize
for the best paper will be awarded.

Submission Format and Modalities
Articles have to be written in french (or in english for non french-speeking
people), and shall not be over ten pages, references and figures included, in
pdf format. A LaTeX stylesheet and Word/OpenOffice models will be available on
the conference website.

Double submission of the same article to both TALN and RECITAL is forbidden.
