Final Call for Participation
VideoCLEF2009
Video Analysis and Retrieval Benchmark Evaluation
http://www.cdvp.dcu.ie/VideoCLEF =20

VideoCLEF 2009 is a track of the CLEF benchmark campaign dedicated to =
developing and evaluating tasks involving access to video content in a =
multilingual environment. In 2009, we offer four video analysis and =
retrieval tasks, which will be carried out on Dutch television =
documentaries. Participants can approach these tasks using their own =
choice of methods and features. The provided video data will include =
speech recognition transcripts, shot boundaries, shot-level keyframes =
and archival metadata.

1) Subject Classification

The Subject Classification task involves automatic tagging of videos =
with subject labels such as 'Music', 'History', 'Politics', and =
'Museums'. This task is related to video genre classification--the =
subject theme labels the task uses are semantically more fine grained =
than genres, however. The Subject Classification task ran successfully =
during the VideoCLEF pilot in 2008. In 2009, this task will run on the =
TRECVid 2007 and 2008 collections from the Netherlands Institute for =
Sound and Vision. Participants are encouraged to use features derived =
from both the speech and visual channels.

2) Affect and Appeal

The goal of the Affect and Appeal task is to move beyond the thematic =
content of the video and to analyze video with respect to =
characteristics that are important for viewers, but not related to the =
video topic. This task will use content from a collection of short form =
documentaries taken from the "Beeldenstorm" series. These are described =
as having "hilarious" and "moving" moments. This task comprises two =
subtasks, the narrative peak detection subtask, in which participants =
are asked to find the three funniest, most moving moments in each short =
documentary video, and the classification subtask, in which participants =
are asked to classify videos as either =93popular=94 or =
=93not-popular=94.

3) Semantic Keyframe Extraction

Keyframes or keyframe sets allow users to preview video content without =
playing the video. In this task, participants carry out keyframe =
selection using video and speech/audio features. Selected keyframes =
should represent the semantic content of the video, e.g., an episode of =
a documentary. This task will also use the "Beeldenstorm" dataset. This =
task builds upon the 2008 keyframe extraction task.

4) Finding Related Resources Across Languages

Given a short documentary in Dutch, participants are asked to identify =
English-language resources to support viewer comprehension for non-Dutch =
speaking viewers. This task is new in 2009. Participants will be given a =
number of selected time points for each short documentary and asked to =
link each time point to a relevant article from the English language =
Wikipedia. This task will also use the "Beeldenstorm" dataset.

VideoCLEF 2009 takes place on the following schedule:

April 2009 Release of training set
May 2009 Release of test set
June 2009 Submission of runs
July 2009 Evaluation
August 2009 Working notes paper

CLEF Workshop - September 30 - October 2, 2009
VideoCLEF participants are expected to attend the CLEF workshop, planned =
in collocation with ECDL 2009 in Corfu, Greece

Participants in VideoCLEF are required to register with CLEF. Deadline =
for registration for CLEF 2009 is May 1, 2009; full information about =
CLEF can be found at: http://www.clef-campaign.org/.
