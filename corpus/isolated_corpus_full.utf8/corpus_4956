========== ICMI-MLMI 2009 Call for Papers ================
===========  Summisions due May 22nd, 2009 ==================


ICMI-MLMI 2009

Cambridge, MA, USA, 
November 2-6 2009 
sponsored by ACM SIGCHI 

The Eleventh International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces and The
Sixth Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction will
jointly take place in the Boston area from November 2-6, 2009. The
main aim of ICMI-MLMI 2009 is to further scientific research within
the broad field of multimodal interaction, methods and systems. This
joint conference will focus on major trends and challenges in this
area, and work to identify a roadmap for future research and
commercial success. ICMI-MLMI 2009 will feature a single-track main
conference with keynote speakers, panel discussions, technical paper
presentations, poster sessions, and demonstrations of state of the art
multimodal systems and concepts. It will be followed by workshops.

Venue:
The conference will take place at the MIT Media Lab, widely known for
its innovative spirit. Organized in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA,
ICMI-MLMI 2009 provides an excellent setting for brainstorming and
sharing the latest advances in multimodal interaction, systems, and
methods in a city known as one of the top historical, technological,
and scientific centers of the US.

Important dates: 

Paper submission May 22, 2009 
Author notification July 20, 2009 
Camera-ready due August 20, 2009 
Conference Nov 2-4, 2009 
Workshops Nov 5-6, 2009 

Topics of interest:

Multimodal and multimedia processing:

Algorithms for multimodal fusion and multimedia fission
Multimodal output generation and presentation planning
Multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
Generating non-verbal behaviors for embodied conversational agents
Machine learning methods for multimodal processing

Multimodal input and output interfaces:

Gaze and vision-based interfaces
Speech and conversational interfaces
Pen-based interfaces
Haptic interfaces
Interfaces to virtual environments or augmented reality
Biometric interfaces combining multiple modalities
Adaptive multimodal interfaces

Multimodal applications:

Mobile interfaces
Meeting analysis and intelligent meeting spaces
Interfaces to media content and entertainment
Human-robot interfaces and human-robot interaction
Vehicular applications and navigational aids
Computer-mediated human to human communication
Interfaces for intelligent environments and smart living spaces
Universal access and assistive computing
Multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization

Human interaction analysis and modeling:

Modeling and analysis of multimodal human-human communication
Audio-visual perception of human interaction
Analysis and modeling of verbal and non-verbal interaction
Cognitive modeling of users of interactive systems

Multimodal data, evaluation, and standards:

Evaluation techniques and methodologies for multimodal interfaces
Authoring techniques for multimodal interfaces
Annotation and browsing of multimodal data
Architectures and standards for multimodal interfaces


Paper Submission:

There are two different submission categories: regular paper and short
paper.  The page limit is 8 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for
short papers. The presentation style (oral or poster) will be decided
by the committee based on suitability and schedule.

Demo Submission:

Proposals for demonstrations shall be submitted to demo chairs
electronically.  A two page description with photographs of the
demonstration is required.

Doctoral Spotlight:

Funds are expected from NSF to support participation of doctoral
candidates at ICMI-MLMI 2009, and a spotlight session is planned to
showcase ongoing thesis work. Students interested in travel support
can submit a short or long paper as specified above.
