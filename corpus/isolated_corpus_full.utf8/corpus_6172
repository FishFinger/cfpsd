Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-Feb-2010 

Meeting Description:

The 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics will be
held in Uppsala, Sweden, July 11-16, 2010. The conference will be organized by
the Department of Linguistics and Philology at Uppsala University. 

Call for Papers

The 48th Annual Meeting of the ACL (ACL 2010) seeks submission of papers on
original and unpublished research in all areas of computational linguistics,
broadly conceived to include areas such as psycholinguistics, speech,
information retrieval, multimodal language processing, and language issues in
emerging domains such as bioinformatics. In addition, we want to stress that
both theoretical, as well as practical and empirical papers, are sought for the
conference.

ACL 2010 has the goal of a broad technical program. Thus, ACL 2010 invites
papers in the following categories:

Research Papers:
- theoretical computational linguistics
- empirical/data-driven approaches
- paradigms/techniques/strategies
- resources and evaluation
- applications/systems
- negative result (report of a sensible experiment or approach that failed to
achieve the desired results)

Survey papers (new emerging area, field relevant to computational linguistics, etc.)

Position papers (we are particularly soliciting papers co-authored by two
individuals with opposing positions, though single-authored papers are welcome)

Challenge papers (a challenge to the field in terms of setting out a goal for
the next 5/10/20 years).

The above categories include types of papers that have not typically been part
of the ACL conference program. Since the appropriate criteria for evaluating
papers is not identical for the above categories (and subcategories), ACL 2010
will use a different review form for each category of paper, with the review
form tailored to the type of submission. For example, the review criteria for an
applications/ systems research paper will include whether a substantive
evaluation or user experiments are reported and whether a demo will be available
at the conference, whereas the review form for a theoretical computational
linguistics research paper will include a different set of review criteria. The
review forms will be available on the conference web site at least 3 months
prior to the submission deadline. At the time of submission, authors will be
asked to designate the category under which they believe that their paper should
be evaluated. However, the program committee chairs reserve the right to change
the selected category if they feel that the submission falls into a different
category of paper.

If you are unsure about whether your submission is appropriate for ACL 2010,
please email the program chairs at program@acl2010.org.

Long versus Short Papers:
The submission deadlines for long and for short papers are identical. Long
papers are appropriate for:
1. reporting substantial, completed, and previously unpublished research;
2. presenting a survey of a subfield that would be of interest to computational
linguists;
3. a two-author position paper in which the co-authors take opposing positions.

Short papers typically constitute more focused contributions. Thus they are
appropriate for:
1. reporting smaller experiments;
2. describing work-in-progress;
3. single-author position papers;
4. challenge papers;
5. descriptions of new language resources or evaluation methodologies (although
these could be long papers);
6. presenting negative results.

Long papers will be allocated 8 pages of content in the conference proceedings,
and short papers will be allocated 4 pages of content. Both long and short
papers may have any number of pages consisting solely of references. Long papers
will generally be presented as 20-minute talks plus questions (although authors
will be given the option of instead selecting a poster presentation or a
10-minute oral presentation followed by a poster); short papers will be
presented either as a poster or as a 10-minute talk followed by a poster
session. There will be no distinction in the conference proceedings between
papers that are assigned different presentation modes (such as oral versus poster).
