Meeting Description

Since its inception ten years ago, the International Conference on Formal
Ontology in Information Systems has explored the multiple perspectives on the
notion of ontology that have arisen from such diverse research communities as
philosophy, logic, computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, and various
scientific domains.

As ontologies have been applied in new and exciting domains such as the World
Wide Web, bioinformatics, and geographical information systems, it has become
evident that there is a need for ontologies that have been developed with solid
theoretical foundations based on philosophical, linguistic, and logical
analysis. Similarly, there is also a need for theoretical research that is
driven by the issues that have been raised by recent work in the more applied
domains.

FOIS is intended to be a forum in which to explore this interplay between the
theoretical insights of formal ontology and their application to information
systems and emerging semantic technologies.

Topics

We seek high-quality papers on a wide range of topics. While authors may focus
on fairly narrow and specific issues, all papers should emphasize the relevance
of the work described to formal ontology and to information systems. Papers that
completely ignore one or the other of these aspects will be considered as lying
outside the scope of the meeting.
Topic areas of particular interest to the conference are:

Foundational Issues
Kinds of entity: particulars vs. universals, continuants vs. occurrents,
abstracta vs. concreta, dependent vs. independent, natural vs. artificial
Formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence, constitution,
subsumption, instantiation
Vagueness and granularity
Identity and change
Formal comparison among ontologies
Ontology of physical reality (matter, space, time, motion, ...)
Ontology of biological reality (genes, proteins, cells, organisms, ...)
Ontology of mental reality and agency (beliefs, intentions and other mental
attitudes; emotions, ...)
Ontology of social reality (institutions, organizations, norms, social
relationships, artistic expressions, ...)
Ontology of the information society (information, communication, meaning
negotiation, ...)
Ontology and Natural Language Semantics, Ontology and Cognition

Methodologies and Applications
Top-level vs. application ontologies
Ontology integration and alignment; role of reference ontologies
Ontology-driven information systems design
Requirements engineering
Knowledge engineering
Knowledge management and organization
Knowledge representation; Qualitative modeling
Computational lexica; Terminology
Information retrieval; Question-answering
Semantic web; Web services; Grid computing
Domain-specific ontologies, especially for: Biomedical science, eBusiness,
Enterprise integration, Geography, Law, Library science, Linguistics, ...

Meeting Description

Call For Papers for Japanese Society for Language Sciences 10th Annual
International Conference (JSLS2008) 

The Japanese Society for Language Sciences (JSLS) invites proposals for our
Tenth Annual International Conference, JSLS 2008. JSLS2008 will be held at the
University of Shizuoka, in Shizuoka, Japan. We welcome proposals for oral
presentations and poster presentations. Our plenary speaker will be Dr. Bernard
Comrie (Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology).

Submissions

The Japanese Society for Language Sciences aims ''to promote the language
sciences and contribute to a better understanding of the human mind through
theoretical and experimental research on language'' (Article 2, JSLS
Regulations). The scope of this endeavor covers a wide area, including
linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics), first
language acquisition, second language acquisition, psycholinguistics, language
production, mother tongue education, foreign language instruction, natural
language processing,  brain science, bilingualism, sociolinguistics, discourse
research, and linguistic philosophy, among others. This society hopes that
researchers working on these widely diverse topics reach beyond their own areas
of specialization by supporting the active exchange of opinions and ideas
between researchers working in related fields.

Qualifications for Presenters

All presenters should be members of JSLS by June 1st, 2008. (It is not necessary
for co-presenters to be members, but they must be registered for the conference
if they plan to attend.) Please refer to the following website for membership
information:
http://www.cyber.sist.chukyo-u.ac.jp/JSLS/proposal.html
Papers published or presented elsewhere should not be submitted and will not be
accepted. Each author is only allowed to submit one proposal as the first
author. Each paper presentation will be 25 minutes in length (20 minutes for
presentation, followed by a 5-minute question & answer period). The presentation
of posters will be 90 minutes. The language of presentation can be either
Japanese or English. 

Please visit http://aimee.gsid.nagoya-u.ac.jp/jsls2008/wiki.cgi?page=Call+for+Papers
for more information.
