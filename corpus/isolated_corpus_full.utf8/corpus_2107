Meeting Description

It is our pleasure to announce the next International Conference on
Politeness, organised under the aegis of the Linguistics Politeness
Research Group (LPRG), which will be held in Budapest on 2-4 July 2008. The
Conference will be hosted by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences. 

Call for Papers 

4th International Conference on Politeness 
'East meets West' -- Advances in Politeness Research 
02 - 04 July, 2008, Budapest, Hungary 

The title of the conference 'East Meets West' Advances in Politeness
Research reflects the sustained interest in the study of East Asian
politeness but also the need to promote more vigorously cross-cultural and
inter-cultural research in all aspects of politeness and impoliteness. 

As the first event of its kind in Europe organised to bring together
eastern and western scholars, it provides a long-overdue opportunity for
academics engaged in either East Asian (im)polite communication or inter-
and cross-cultural politeness research to exchange views on recent
developments and to forge new collaborations. 

Venue 
The Conference will be hosted by the Research Institute for Linguistics,
Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Benczúr utca 33, Budapest, Hungary, H-1068). 
The Institute is situated in the old town of Pest, near to the famous Hõsök
tere (Heroes' Square), one of the best-known tourist attractions of Hungary. 

Keynote Speakers 
The Organising Committee is pleased to announce the following confirmed
keynote speakers: 

Sara MILLS, University of Sheffield, UK 
Yuling PAN, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. 
Barbara Pizziconi, SOAS, UK 

Organising Committee 
Members of the conference Organising Committee include: 

Francesca Bargiela (Nottingham Trent University) 
Huba Bartos (Research Institute for Linguistics, H.A.S.) 
Dániel Z. Kádár (Research Institute for Linguistics, H.A.S.) 

Abstract Submisssion 
Submissions should reach us by 17th December 2007. Authors will be notified
of acceptance or rejection by 1st February 2008. Abstracts of max. 300
words (excluding references) should be sent to Dániel
Kádár(danielkadar@yahoo.co.uk) and should include author's name,
affiliation, e-mail address, and up to five keywords. 

Presenters who would like to have their paper considered for publication in
the Conference Volume (see below) should submit long (800-word) abstracts
('regular', short abstract submissions will not be considered for the volume). 

The Organising Committee encourages (especially) young scholars to submit
poster presentations. These are considered on par with paper presentations,
and often provide a better opportunity for scholarly exchange than paper
sessions. It should be noted that although posters can be set up from the
beginning of the conference there will be a special slot in the conference
programme when poster presenters will be asked to stand beside their
posters and answer questions. The presenters of the three best posters - as
selected by the keynote speakers - will receive an award (books). Poster
presenters are also entitled to submit the paper format of their
presentation to the Conference Volume (provided the authors send in long
abstracts). 

There will be panel discussions organised within the framework of the
conference (see below) - panel participants are advised to contact the
panel organisers directly regarding the length and content of panel abstracts. 

Abstract Guidelines 
Speakers are asked to adhere to the following guidelines, independently of
the fact as to whether the given abstract is submitted for a paper
presentation in the main programme or a panel presentation: 

Abstracts must be sent as MSWord files. Documents in .pdf or other formats
will be returned to the sender. 

Font Type: Times New Roman (special fonts can be used but authors are
encouraged to con-tact Dániel Kádár in order to avoid technical problems;
e.g. Chinese characters should be written in traditional PMingLiu and
Japanese characters should be written with MS Mincho fonts) 
Margins: 2.5 cm 
Line width: single 

Abstracts should have the following structure: 
Title - Author's Name - Author's Institution - Author's E-Mail Address -
Keywords - Main Text - References 
Title: 12 pt., centred, boldface letters 
Author's Name: 11pt., family name-comma-person name, small capital letters,
centred 
There should be no blank line between titles and authors' names. 
Author's Institution and E-Mail Address: 10 pt., centred 
Keywords: 11pt., left indented; the number of keywords should be between 3
and 5; separate keywords with semi-colons 
Main Text: 11 pt., justified; new paragraphs should not be separated with
blank lines but use 'tab' (1.25 cm) instead to denote new paragraphs 
Bibliography: 10 pt., hanging, according to the following samples: 
Journals: 
Gu, Yueguo (1990). Politeness phenomena in modern Chinese. Journal of
Pragmatics 14(2), 237-257. 
Books: 
Mills, Sara (2003). Gender and Politeness. Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press. 
Book chapters: 
Brown, Penelope and Levinson, Stephen C. (1978). Universals in Language
Usage: Politeness Phenomena. In E. N. Goody (ed.) Questions and Politeness.
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 56-289. 
Footnotes: No footnotes are acceptable in the abstracts 

Conference Volume 
Two members of the Organising Committee (Francesca Bargiela and Dániel
Kádár) will edit a volume, published by a major European academic publisher
and containing a selection of high quality papers. All submissions will be
subject to double blind review. The selection of papers will take place in
two stages. Firstly, authors submitting long abstracts will be notified
about acceptance or rejection by 1st February, together with the
notification of acceptance of their abstracts as conference presentations.
(It should be noted that exclusion from the conference volume does not
necessarily mean rejection of the abstract for the purposes of conference
presentation). Secondly, the authors of accepted abstracts will be asked to
submit full (strictly unpublished!) papers to the editors by 1st October,
2008. The papers will be peer-reviewed and the authors notified about the
acceptance or rejection by 10th January 2009. It is necessary to emphasise
that thematic coherence plays an important role in the selection of papers,
that is, papers on inter-cultural or cross-cultural (European-Asian)
research will be given priority. 

Conference Panels 
In order to encourage research teams and networks of colleagues working on
specific aspects of (im)politeness to share their findings with the
conference delegates, the organisers invite submissions of proposals for
panel discussions. Proposals should reach us no later than 23rd November
2007. We will inform authors about the acceptance of their proposal within
four weeks from the deadline. Once the proposal is accepted, panel
organisers are free to invite abstracts and organise the selection
procedure. The conference organisers encourage panel organisers to
advertise their panel as widely as possible.

Accommodation/Other Costs 
Budapest is well-served by transportation links and both accommodation and
food are relatively cheap compared with many other capitals of the European
Union. Conference participants will be provided with detailed information
about hotels ranging from two to five stars, which are located near to the
conference venue. For example, basic accommodation is avail-able at a hotel
next to the conference site that offers the following special prices for
conference participants: 
Deluxe single (3 stars plus, incl. breakfast): 70 euros/day 
Deluxe double (3 stars plus, incl. breakfast): 80 euros/day 

Standard single (3 stars, incl. breakfast): 60 euros/day

(More details will soon be available on the conference website) 

Conference Tour 
The Organising Committee is delighted to invite participants to a one-day
tour on July 5, the day immediately after the conference. In the course of
this English-language guided bus tour we will visit the most famous spots
of Budapest and, after a lunch in a typical restaurant, we will go on to
the Danube bend (Dunakanyar), one of the most famous scenic spots in
Hungary, with stops at Szentendre, a beautiful small Serbian town, and at
Esztergom, to visit the Cathedral, one of the largest catholic churches in
Europe. 

Book Stalls 
We plan to invite several international publishers to exhibit and sell
their books and journals (at special 'conference' prices) during the
conference. More information about the book stalls will be announced soon
on the website. 

Young Scholar Award
The Organising Committee plans to set up a Young Scholar Award to support
and encourage young postgraduate students in linguistic politeness to take
part in the conference. The candidates will be asked to submit an
unpublished paper on the theme of the conference (for guidelines please
refer to the abstract submission guidelines) and submit it to the
Organising Committee by 10th of March. The papers will be forwarded in
anonymous form to reviewers. The Young Scholar Award will cover travel
expenses and hotel costs for the author to attend the Conference in
Budapest. The paper will be also considered for inclusion in the conference
volume. 

Contact/Detailed Information 
Please send all inquiries to Dániel Kádár (danielkadar@yahoo.co.uk). More
information and news can be found on the conference website
(http://www.nytud.hu/lprg). 

We look forward to welcoming you in Budapest!

Meeting Description

The workshop 'Methods for Modalities' (M4M) aims to bring together researchers
interested in developing algorithms, verification methods and tools based on
modal logics. Here the term 'modal logics' is conceived broadly, including
temporal logic, description logic, guarded fragments, conditional logic,
temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a number of
invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations aimed at
highlighting new developments, and submissions of system demonstrations.

More information about the previous editions and the M4M5 program can be found
on http://m4m.loria.fr/

The workshop will take place in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS de
Cachan). ENS de Cachan is a prestigious public institution of research and
higher education, founded in 1912. It is one of the French 'Grandes Ecoles'
which are considered to be the pinnacle of French higher education.

Access to/from central Paris is easy and takes 30 minutes by RER train (line B).
