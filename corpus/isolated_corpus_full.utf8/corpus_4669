Meeting Description:

The Boston University Conference on Language Development (BUCLD) was started in
1976 by students in the Applied Psycholinguistics Program.  The Conference
involves year-round planning and draws over 500 people from all over the U.S.
and around the world. It includes presentations in such areas as theoretical
approaches to language acquisition, cross-cultural language development, second
language development, language disorders, and literacy development. Each year,
close to 500 abstracts are submitted to the conference, from which about 87
papers and 66 posters are chosen for presentation. Internationally renowned
researchers also give keynote and plenary addresses, as well as a lunch
symposium on a topic of current interest. 

Call for Papers

Submissions which present research on any topic in the fields of first and
second language acquisition from any theoretical perspectives will be fully
considered, including Bilingualism, Cognition & Language, Creoles & Pidgins,
Dialects, Discourse and Narrative, Gesture, Hearing Impairment and Deafness,
Input & Interaction, Language Disorders, Linguistic Theory, Neurolinguistics,
Pragmatics, Pre-linguistic Development,  Reading and Literacy, Signed Languages,
Sociolinguistics, and Speech Perception & Production.
