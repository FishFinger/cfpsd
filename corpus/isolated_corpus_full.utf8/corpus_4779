Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce that the 2009 Chicago Colloquium on Digital
Humanities and Computer Science (DHCS) will be held at the Illinois Institute of
Technology, November 14-16, 2009, cosponsored by IIT, the University of Chicago,
and Northwestern University. 

Call for Papers

The goal of the 2009 DHCS Colloquium, as in previous years, is to bring together
scholars and researchers in both the Humanities and Computer Science to
collaborate on deepening the current state of Digital Humanities as a field of
intellectual inquiry and to identify and explore new directions and perspectives
for future research.

One particular focal area is work using formal, applied, and computational
linguistic approaches to illuminate problems in the humanities, particularly
regarding the interpretation of literary, philosophical, and historical texts.

For more information, please see the colloquium website at: http://dhcs.iit.edu
A full call-for-papers will be published soon.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
