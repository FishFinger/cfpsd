        ITP 2010: Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving
                11-14 July 2010, Edinburgh, Scotland
                   http://www.floc-conference.org/

                               -----

ITP brings together researchers working in all areas of interactive
theorem proving.  It combines the communities of two venerable
meetings: the TPHOLs conference and the ACL2 workshop.  The inaugural
meeting of ITP will be held on 11-14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland,
as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC, 9-21 July 2010),
co-located with the other FLoC conferences (CAV, ICLP, IJCAR, LICS,
RTA, SAT) and workshops.

The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of
interactive theorem proving and its applications.  Examples of typical
topics include formal aspects of hardware or software (specification,
verification, semantics, synthesis, refinement, compilation, etc.);
formalization of significant bodies of mathematics; advances in
theorem prover technology (automation, decision procedures, induction,
combinations of systems and tools, etc.); other topics including those
relating to user interfaces, education, comparisons of systems, and
mechanizable logics; and concise and elegant worked examples ("Proof
Pearls").

Submission details:

All papers must be submitted electronically, via EasyChair:

 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp10

Papers may be no longer than 16 pages and are to be submitted in PDF
using the Springer "llncs" format.  Instructions may be found at
ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/instruct/authors/typeinst.pdf
with Latex source file typeinst.tex in the same directory.
Submissions must describe original unpublished work not submitted for
publication elsewhere, presented in a way that users of other systems
can understand.  The proceedings will be published as a volume in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be available to
participants at the conference.

In addition to regular submissions, described above, there will be a
"rough diamonds" section.  Rough diamond submissions are limited to
four pages and may consist of an extended abstract.  They will be
refereed: they will be expected to present innovative and promising
ideas, possibly in an early form and without supporting evidence.
Accepted diamonds will be published in the main proceedings.  They
will be presented at the conference venue in a poster session.

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the
conference, and will be required to sign copyright release forms. 
All submissions must be written in English.

Important dates (midnight GMT):

 Abstract submission deadline:         15 January 2010
 Paper submission deadline:            22 January 2010
 Notification of paper decisions:        15 March 2010
 Camera-ready papers due from authors:    9 April 2010
 Conference dates:                     11-14 July 2010
