Meeting Description:

This workshop aims to bring together developers of broad-coverage parsers who
are interested in questions of target representations and cross-framework and
cross-domain evaluation and benchmarking. 

Call for Papers

22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics
Workshop on Cross-Framework and Cross-Domain Parser Evaluation
August 23 -- Manchester, UK
        
http://lingo.stanford.edu/events/08/pe/

Background and Motivation:
Broad-coverage parsing has come to a point where distinct approaches can offer
(seemingly) comparable performance: statistical parsers acquired from the PTB;
data-driven dependency parsers; 'deep' parsers trained off enriched treebanks
(in linguistic frameworks like CCG, HPSG, or LFG); and hybrid `deep' parsers,
employing hand-built grammars in, for example, HPSG, LFG, or LTAG. Evaluation
against trees in the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank (PTB) has helped advance
parsing research over the course of the past decade. Despite some scepticism,
the crisp and, over time, stable task of maximizing ParsEval metrics over PTB
trees has served as a dominating benchmark. However, modern treebank parsers
still restrict themselves to only a subset of PTB annotation; there is reason to
worry about the idiosyncrasies of this particular corpus; it remains unknown how
much the ParsEval metric (or any intrinsic evaluation) can inform NLP
application developers; and PTB-style analyses leave a lot to be desired in
terms of linguistic information.

This workshop aims to bring together developers of broad-coverage parsers who
are interested in questions of target representations and cross-framework and
cross-domain evaluation and benchmarking. From informal discussions that the
co-organizers had among themselves and with colleagues, it seems evident that
there is comparatively broad awareness of current issues in parser evaluation,
and a lively interest in detailed exchange of experience (and beliefs).
Specifically, the organizers hope to attract representatives from diverse
parsing approaches and frameworks, ranging from 'traditional' treebank parsing,
over data-driven dependency parsing, to parsing in specific linguistic
frameworks. Quite likely for the first time in the history of these approaches,
there now exist large, broad-coverage, parsing systems representing diverse
traditions that can be applied to running text, often producing comparable
representations. In our view, these recent developments present a new
opportunity for re-energizing parser evaluation research.

The workshop organizers invite papers on all aspects of parser evaluation,
qualitative and quantitative, including but not limited to:
- in-depth or contrastive evaluation of parsing systems;
- methology, test data, and technology for parser evaluation;
- reflections on existing standards and evaluation metrics;
- correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic parser evaluation;
- proposals for new target representations or success measures. 

Seeing the general theme of this workshop, submissions that discuss aspects of
cross-framework, cross-domain, or cross-linguistic parser evaluation are
especially welcome.

One of the workshop goals is to establish an improved shared knowledge
among participants of the strengths and weaknesses of extant annotation
and evaluation schemes.  In order to create a joint focus and in-depth
discussion, there will be a `lightweight' shared task. For a selection of 50
sentences (of which ten are considered obligatory, the rest optional) for which
PTB, GR, and PropBank (and maybe other) annotations are available, we will
invite contributors to scrutinize existing gold-standard representations
contrastively, identify perceived deficiencies, and sketch what can be done to
address these. As an optional component, participants in the shared task are
welcome to include 'native', framework-specific output representations and
actual results for a parsing system of their choice (be it their own or not) in
the contrastive study.  In either case, submissions to the shared task should
aim to reflect on the nature of different representations, highlight which
additional distinctions are made in either scheme, and argue why these are
useful (for some task) or unmotivated (in general).

Please see the workshop web pages for detailed submission information:

Important Dates:
- Initial Call for Papers: March 1
- Shared Task Release: March 22
- Paper Submission Deadline: May 5
- Notification of Acceptance: June 6
- Camera-Ready Papers Deadline: July 1
- One-Day Workshop: August 23

Workshop Organizers and Programme Committee:
The workshop aims to appeal to a wide range of researchers across frameworks,
hence it has a relatively large and diverse group of organizers.  The
co-organizers will jointly make all decisions regarding the workshop form and
programme, and it is expected that most of the co-organizers participate in the
actual workshop.
