Meeting Description:

Conference on the Foot in Phonology
Sponsored by the MA/PhD program in linguistics at the City University of New
York and the CUNY phonology forum

January 15th-17th, 2009 at the CUNY graduate center, 365 Fifth Avenue, New York
City, 10016

Call for Papers

Call for Presentations:
We invite oral and poster presentations from any subdivision of cognitive
science such as formal linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics,
philosophy, psychology, etc. We also encourage diversity in methods, so we
welcome both formal and experimental approaches to the topic of the foot in
phonology. 

By ''foot'' we mean any structural entity that has been proposed to describe or
explain stress, rhythmic and/or prosodic phenomena above the level of the
syllable. The conference organizers especially want to encourage both oral and
poster proposals from a variety of theoretical frameworks.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to open the field of discussion to all matters related
to foot structure in phonology and/or phonetics.

Do feet exist?

Are feet hierarchically superordinate to syllables (or are they on separate planes)?

What is the internal structure of the foot?

What principles determine foot structure?

Are feet hierarchically dominated by other prosodic categories?

Is foot structure lexically distinctive? If so, how is this distinction represented?

How is foot structure derived (if indeed it is)?

What aspects of feet are referred to by morphological and phonological
rules/constraints?

How do phonetic feet relate to phonological feet (and vice versa)?

Invited Speakers:
To Be Announced

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts for oral or poster presentations should consist of a one page
description (12pt font) with a second page for references, data and/or
illustrations. Please specify whether it is a proposal for a poster or an oral
presentation, or potentially either. Although we will make every effort to honor
authors' requests, the criterion for assigning a proposal to either the oral or
the poster format is simply whether the subject matter is better suited for one
or the other mode of presentation. Abstracts should be emailed as an attachment
(PDF format) to foot@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than midnight, November 1,
2008. Authors should include title of the proposal, name of the author(s) and
affiliation in the body of the email.

Important Dates and Information:
November 1, 2008 deadline for abstracts submission
December 1, 2008 notification of acceptance
January 15-17, 2009 Conference on the foot in phonology

Theme session at ICLC11, UC Berkeley, July 28-August 2, 2009

''Metonymy in Gesture and Signed Languages''

Organizers:
Irene Mittelberg, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (i.mittelberg@let.vu.nl)
Alan Cienki, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (a.cienki@let.vu.nl)
Cornelia M端ller, European University Viadrina  (cmueller@euv-frankfurt-o.de)

Metaphor and metonymy have been shown to be cognitive-semiotic processes that
motivate expressions in both verbal and non-verbal modalities. While multimodal
manifestations of conceptual metaphor have received considerable attention from
various perspectives (e.g., Cienki & M端ller 2008, Forceville & Urios-Aparisi
fc.; McNeill 1992; M端ller fc.; Sweetser 1998), the growing body of research on
metonymy within cognitive linguistics has predominantly focused on spoken and
written language. The variety of views on metonymy - and its interaction with
metaphor - attests to its central status within cognitive linguistic approaches,
ranging from conceptual integration, prototype theory and categorization, domain
theory, grammar, language change, and pragmatic inferencing (see, e.g., Panther
& Thornburg 2007).

Exploring the role of conceptual metonymy in gesture and signed languages, this
panel is aimed at identifying ways in which the manual modalities co-speech
gesture and signed languages have the potential to shed light on claims
primarily based on linguistic inquiry. The underlying assumption is that whereas
conceptual metaphor is central to accessing and structuring abstract domains,
metonymy plays an important role not only regarding the formation of gestural
signs (e.g., Bouvet 2001; Cienki & M端ller 2006; Gibbs 1994; M端ller 1998), but
also regarding crossmodal modes of indirect reference and pragmatic inferencing
(e.g., Mittelberg 2005, 2006; Mittelberg & Waugh fc.). In sign language
research, it has even been proposed that metonymy functions as a ''cognitive
key'' to meaning construction (P. Wilcox 2004).

The objective of this theme session is at least two-fold: first, to investigate
various types of manifestations of metonymy in bodily semiotics, thus
identifying the different cognitive and semantic functions metonymy appears to
assume therein. Second, we will discuss the theoretical implications of the
findings and determine what kinds of contributions work on gesture and sign
languages can make to a comprehensive theory of metonymy within cognitive
linguistics.

If you are interested in participating, please email us a preliminary title as
soon as possible. Full abstracts should not exceed 500 words (including
references) and include your name(s), academic affiliation(s), e-mail
address(es), and the title of your talk.

Deadline for submitting full abstracts is September 12, 2008. Notifications of
acceptance will be sent out by September 17. Please be aware that all theme
session paper authors will have to submit their abstracts to the regular
abstract competition by November 1. Both the theme session as a whole and
participation of each contributor will thus depend on approval of acceptance by
the ICLC scientifc committee. For more detailed information, please visit the
ICLC11 website at http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~iclc/index.php/iclc/11
