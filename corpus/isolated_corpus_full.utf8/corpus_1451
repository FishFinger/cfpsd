AIMS AND SCOPE
ICMLA'07 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present
the latest achievements andinnovations in the area of machine learning
(ML). The conference provides a leading international forum for
thedissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications,
novel algorithms, software andsystems. Following the success of previous
ICMLA conferences, it attracts researchers and applicationdevelopers from
a wide range of ML related areas such as statistical, probabilistic, fuzzy,
evolutionary, inductive, and other kinds of learning, data mining, knowledge
discovery, pattern recognition, knowledgeacquisition and retrieval,databases,
data warehousing and visualization, knowledge-based systems and
highperformance computing.

The main goal of the conference is to advance the state-of-the-art in ML
via promotionof high quality and novel research. Scope of the Conference:
         - multistrategy learning
         - statistical learning
         - neural network learning
         - learning through fuzzy logic
         - learning through evolution (evolutionary algorithms)
         - Bayesian network
         - case-based reasoning
         - evolutionary computation
         - reinforcement learning
         - machine learning of natural language

         - knowledge discovery in databases
         - knowledge intensive learning
         - knowledge representation and reasoning
         - information retrieval and learning
         - theories and models for plausible reasoning
         - cooperative learning
         - planning and learning
         - multi-agent learning

         - distributed and parallel learning algorithms and applications
         - inductive learning
         - inductive logic programming
         - feature extraction and classification
         - support vector machines
         - computational learning theory

Contributions describing applications of machine learning techniques to
real-world problems, interdisciplinary research involving machine
learning, experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insights
into the design of ML systems, and papers describing development of new
analytical frameworks that advance practical learning methods are
especially encouraged.

    The ICMLA Conference:                    December 13-15, 2007

All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Detailed
instructions for submitting the papers are provided on the conference home
page at
      http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~icmla/icmla07/  or
      http://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla07/

SUBMISSIONS
High quality papers in all ML areas are solicited. Papers that present new
directions will receive especially careful and supportive reviews. Authors
are expected to ensure that their final manuscripts are original and are
not appearing in the other publications. Paper should be limited
to 4-6 pages and submitted in IEEE format (double column). Papers will be
reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality,
originality, significance, and clarity. All submissions will be handled
electronically. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings, as a hardcopy. A selected number of accepted
papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised
form, in a journal. ICMLA'07 Best Paper Awards will
be conferred at the conference on the authors of the best research paper.
