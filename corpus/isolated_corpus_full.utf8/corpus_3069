Full Title: Diachronic Generative Syntax X 
Short Title: DiGS X 

Date: 07-Aug-2008 - 09-Aug-2008
Location: Ithaca, NY, USA 
Contact Person: John Whitman
Meeting Email: jbw2@cornell.edu
Web Site: http://phonetics.cornell.edu/DiGSX/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Language Family(ies): Indo-European 

Call Deadline: 20-Jun-2008 

Meeting Description:

DiGS X will highlight generative work on early Indo-European. The special focus
of DiGS X will be on fostering interaction between generativists and
Indo-Europeanists, as we feel that both the locale (the U.S. Northeast) and the
times favor heightening such interaction. We emphasize that the focus of this
tenth anniversary DiGS meeting will not be at the expense of papers treating
syntactic change in languages outside early Indo-European. Given current trends
in the field, we expect the opposite. 

Call for Posters

DiGS (Diachronic Generative Syntax) X Conference
Cornell University
August 7-9, 2008

Abstracts are invited for poster presentations at DiGS X, the leading conference
on diachronic syntax from a generative perspective. There will be at least one
poster session, depending on the volume of acceptances. Presentations are
welcome in any area of theoretical diachronic syntax.

Submissions from graduate student presenters are highly encouraged and will be
given special attention. Funding is available to assist with travel and lodging
for graduate student presenters.

Abstracts should be submitted to digsx@cornell.edu as PDF attachments. 
Abstracts should be no longer than one page, with an additional page for data
and references. All abstracts must be anonymous; the PDF should not identify the
authors. Please include ''Abstract'' in the subject of the email. In the body of
the email, please list the author(s), affiliation(s), and presentation title.

Submission deadline: June 20, 2008
Notification of acceptances will be made by July 1, 2008
