Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Meeting Description:

Call for Tutorial Proposals

Proposals are invited for the Tutorial Program of the 12th Conference  of the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational  Linguistics (EACL 2009),
to be held in Athens, Greece, from March 30  to April 3, 2009. The selected
tutorials will be given on the Monday  and Tuesday preceeding the main
conference (March 30 and 31).

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of natural language processing, speech
processing and information retrieval are sought. We particularly welcome (1)
tutorials which cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in
an (E)ACL related tutorial, or (2) tutorials which provide introductions into
related fields which are potentially relevant for the CL community (e.g.
bioinformatics, human language processing, emerging machine learning techniques).

The remuneration for tutorials will be computed as follows:
- 484 for up to 20 people
- plus 23 per person for registrants 21 to 50
- plus 16 per person for registrants greater than 50

The minimum remuneration will be 484 or the cost of one economy airline ticket
to the conference, whichever is higher. As has been ACL policy, the remuneration
is per tutorial, not per presenter; multiple presenters will split the proceeds,
the default assumption being an even split.

These figures are euro conversions to the nearest euro of dollar amounts quoted in:
http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=Tutorial_teacher_payment_policy 

Submission Details

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to
the ACL community (not more than 2 pages).

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial's core
content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including a coffee break). In
exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are available as well.

3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of the
tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their research
interests and areas of expertise.

4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same or a
similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate of the audience
size.

5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g. internet
access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text no later
than November 25th, 2008 to E.J.Krahmer ''at'' uvt.nl

The subject line should be: ''EACL 2009 Tutorial Proposal''.

Please note that only proposals submitted by e-mail will be taken into account.

Tutorial Speaker Responsibilities:
Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by December 3rd, 2008, and must then
provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference
registration material by January 13th, 2009. The description should be in two
formats: an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and
published on the conference web site, and a PDF version for inclusion in the
electronic proceedings (detailed instructions to follow). Tutorial speakers must
provide tutorial materials, at least containing copies of the course slides as
well as a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, by February
2nd, 2009.

Important Dates:
Submission deadline for tutorial proposals: November 25th, 2008
Notification of acceptance: December 3rd, 2008
Tutorial descriptions due: January 13th, 2009
Tutorial course material due: February 2nd, 2009
Tutorial dates: March 30-31, 2009

Tutorial Chairs:
Emiel Krahmer, Tilburg University, NL
David Weir, University of Sussex, UK

Please send inquiries concerning EACL 2009 tutorials to e.j.krahmer ''at''
uvt.nl or d.j.weir ''at'' sussex.ac.uk
