(with apologies for multiple cross-postings)

Submissions are invited to the 2nd Workshop on Personalisation for 
e-Health, to be held in conjunction with UM 2007, Corfu, Greece, 26 June 
2007.

Deadline for submissions: February 7th

Details at http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~floriana/Pers4eHealth/


A non exhaustive list of issues of interest is:

- adaptive  and personalised  e-Health information  systems (including
   adaptive content, search and interface)
- tailored health education and advice (written and online) 
- promoting trust and compliance to health advice
- personalised    assistance,   including    for    special   citizens
   (e.g. disabled, elderly)
- personalisation in chronic care (e.g. asthma or diabetes management)
   as opposed to acute care (e.g. ICU setting)
- privacy issues for health related user models 
- personalisation  based  both on  biometric  or  genomic factors  and
   clinical information
- tailored decision support (for patients and practitioners) 
- supporting  the  implementation   of  guidelines  and  protocols  in
   healthcare  models   of  user  learning,   knowledge,  attitude  and
   behaviour change (including compliance)
- patient/citizen models 
- business models (personalisation to various stakeholders) 
- ontologies for user models for tailored health care delivery
- methods  for  evaluating  user  satisfaction  with  ehealth  systems
   (weblog  analysis,  tracking  users,  quantitative  and  qualitative
   methods)
- reports on evaluation studies of personalised eHealth systems.

The workshop welcomes contributions from diverse perspectives, such as
knowledge   engineering,  multi   agent   systems,  natural   language
processing, cognitive  modelling, human factors,  mobile computing, as
well  as  public health  and  medical  informatics. Contributions  may
describe applications, approaches, and evaluation studies.

Special  attention   will  be  dedicated   to  system  demonstrations:
submissions should be accompanied by short written reports.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------
The workshop encourages submissions in three categories:

- Long papers, describing mature research (up to 6000 words) 
- Short papers, describing work in progress (up to 3000 words) 
- Demonstrations  of  an  implemented  system:  submission  should  be
   accompanied by  written reports (up  to 3000 words).  Authors should
