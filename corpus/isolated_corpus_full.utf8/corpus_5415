Meeting Description:

The teaching of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has been seen as a separate
activity within English language teaching. However, with the advancement of
commerce, science, technology, and various discipline in education, ESP should
be opened to insight drawn from the present needs of the society. With the
implementation of the Indonesian government's education policy to design and
develop Sekolah Berbasis Internasional or Internationally Standardized School -
for some Indonesian schools, the needs for appropriate ESP design and
methodology for Indonesian school is greatly felt by the school management.
Based on the consideration above, the Faculty of Language and Literature in
cooperation with the Language Training Center, Satya Wacana Christian University
will hold the third international seminar on the key issues in ESP within the
context of SBI.

Topic Areas:

-ESP curriculum design
-Content language acquisition
-ESP Needs Analysis
-ESP Materials Development
-Methodology in ESP
-ESP teacher preparation
-Appropriate model of ESP
-Evaluation in ESP 
-Other related subtopics 

Second Call for Papers:

Paper Presentation:

These are formal lecture presentations which last thirty minutes and ten minutes
for questions. 

Workshop:

A workshop lasts two hours in which the speaker does not do much of lecturing.
Instead, the speaker designs activities which can engage the participants
throughout the session. 

Poster/Film Presentation:

Presentations in the form of poster, pictures, photos, or films displayed
throughout the conference. Participants will have opportunities to see the
display and talk to the presenters during snack and lunch times. 

A 250-300 word abstract with a title not exceeding twelve words and a fifty-word
bio-data should be sent no later than August 31, 2009.
