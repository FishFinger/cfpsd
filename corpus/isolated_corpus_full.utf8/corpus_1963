Meeting Description

Workshop: 'Mixing Approaches to Machine Translation'

First Call for Papers

Workshop: ''Mixing Approaches to Machine Translation''
Thursday February 14th 2008, Donostia - San Sebastián. Basque Country
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/matmt-2008

Background

The aim of the workshop ''Mixing Approaches To Machine Translation'' is to
promote practical hybrid approaches to MT, combining resources and
algorithms coming from rule-based, example-based or statistical approaches.

The boundaries between the three principal approaches to MT (rule-based,
example-based, statistical) are becoming narrower:

(i) Phrase based SMT models are incorporating morphology, syntax and
semantics into their systems.
(ii) Rule based systems are using parallel corpora to enrich their lexicons
and grammars, and to create new methods for disambiguation.
(iii) Previous ASR/ALT projects have shown that in a MT system benefits can
be realized by a simple combination of different MT approaches in a Rover
architecture.

Data-driven Machine Translation (example-based or statistical) is nowadays
the most prevalent trend in Machine Translation research.

Translation results obtained with this approach have now reached a high
level of accuracy, especially when the target language is English. But
these Data-driven MT systems base their knowledge on aligned bilingual
corpora, and the accuracy of their output depends heavily on the quality
and the size of these corpora. Large and reliable bilingual corpora are
unavailable for many language pairs.

hybrid MT

About the OpenMT project

The main goal of the OpenMT project is the development of an Open Source
Machine Translation Architecture based on hybrid models and advanced
semantic processors. These architectures will be Open Source systems
combining the three main Machine Translation frameworks - Rule-Based MT,
Statistical MT, and Example-Based MT -- into hybrid systems. Defined
architectures and results of the project will be Open Source, this will
allow a fast development and adaptation of new advanced Machine Translation
systems for other languages. We will test the functionality of this system
with different languages: English, Spanish, Catalan and Basque. Corpora are
easily available for English and Spanish, but not so for the remaining
languages. While the structure of some of those languages is very similar
(Catalan and Spanish), others are very different (English and Basque).
Basque is an agglutinative language with a very rich morphology, unlike
English, Catalan and Spanish.

The highlights of the OpenMT project are:
- The design of hybrid systems combining traditional linguistic rules,
example-based methods and statistical methods.
- That it is an Open Source Initiative
- The use of advanced syntactic and semantic processing

LREC 2008 - 6th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference

Second Call for Papers

Palais des Congrès Mansour Eddahbi, Marrakech - Morocco

Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/  

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)
will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of
international associations and organisations, including AAMT, AMTA, ACL, ALTA,
COCOSDA and Oriental COCOSDA, EACL, EAMT, ELSNET, EURALEX, GWA, IAMT,
KnowledgeWeb, LDC, NEMLAR Network, SIGLEX, TEI, Technolangue French Program,
WRITE and with major national and international organisations including the
European Commission - Information Society and Media, Unit E.2 ''Content and
Knowledge''.

Conference Aims

In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has become the
major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language
Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange
information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and
tools, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements
coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to
technological and organisational ones.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies
from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find
new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support
to investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies and
development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.

Conference Topics

Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): text,
speech, multimodality
 
- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for LRs
- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation
- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge
- Ontologies and knowledge representation
- Terminology
- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web technologies
- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup

Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications

- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, mobile
communication, machine translation, summarisation, web services, semantic
search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.
- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural
language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice activated services, etc.
- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. e-government,
e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile applications, etc.
- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs

Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation

- HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs
- Benchmarking of systems and products
- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and dialogue
systems
- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation

General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation

- National and international activities and projects
- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies
for LRs
- Open architectures
- Organisational, economical and legal issues

Special Highlights

LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken, written, and
other modalities - and of the respective communities. To this end, LREC
encourages submissions covering issues which are common to different types of
LRs and language technologies.
 
LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of applications
and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass all those data that
interact with language resources in an attempt to model more complex human
processes and develop more complex systems, and encourages submissions on topics
such as:

- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces, Human-Human
interactions, and content processing
- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, including emotions
- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for robotic systems

Programme
 
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster
and demo presentations, and panels.
There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only
the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to
the content of the paper will be considered.
