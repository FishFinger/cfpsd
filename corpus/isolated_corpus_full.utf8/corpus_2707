DESCRIPTION

Commercial Web search engines offer fast search on huge amounts of  =

text, combined with increasingly clever ranking and data analysis  =

algorithms, but their content-centric services do not cater to the  =

needs of the computational linguistics and NLP communities.  The  =

leading theme of this workshop, the fourth in a row of highly  =

successful Web as Corpus meetings, is to find out how to combine the  =

power and scalability of modern search engine technology with  =

sophisticated linguistic annotation and query processing.

We invite papers on various topics concerning the use of Web  =

resources for corpus research and NLP applications, including (but  =

not limited to) the following:

    * linguistic Web crawler technology and Web corpus collection  =

projects
    * applications of Web-derived corpora and other kinds of Web data
    * how far does the "easy way" get you? (using search engines, or  =

Google's n-gram lists; we are particularly interested in a critical  =

discussion of the usefulness and limitations of such approaches)
    * methods and tools for "cleaning" Web pages to turn them into a  =

corpus (contributors to this topic will be encouraged to participate  =

in the second CLEANEVAL competition to be held in 2009)
    * automatic linguistic annotation of Web data: tokenisation, POS  =

tagging, lemmatisation, semantic tagging, etc. (established tools  =

often perform very poorly on Web data)
    * search engine architectures for linguists: bringing linguistics  =

to commercial search engines, or high-performance search technology  =

to linguistics?
    * search engine-related topics such as result ranking (e.g. how  =

to identify "typical" uses rather than returning 50 very similar  =

matches on the first page)
    * duplicate detection, interactive query refinement, etc.
    * reviews and clever uses of search engine APIs (Google, Yahoo,  =

Altavista, and in particular Microsoft's current generous LiveSearch  =

API)

This workshop is endorsed by the Special Interest Group on the Web as  =

Corpus (SIGWAC) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished  =

work in the topic area of this workshop.  Submissions should follow  =

the format of LREC proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages,  =

including references.  We strongly recommend the use of LREC LaTeX or  =

Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference.

Submissions are managed via EasyChair.org.  In order to submit a  =

paper, go to:

	http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwac4

and login (or register an account with EasyChair if you don't have  =

one yet). After logging in, click 'New Submission' and fill in the  =

standard fields.
