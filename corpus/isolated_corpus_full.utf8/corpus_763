Contact Person: Naomi Yamaguchi

Web Site: http://www.geocities.com/rjced268 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description:

Ever since its creation, nine years ago, the ED268 Young Researchers'
Meetings, at Sorbonne Nouvelle University, offers young graduates in the
field of linguistics and language teaching a possibility to introduce their
work in a context that favours the exchange of ideas.

The subject for this year is: Norms, variations, identity, otherness. 

Call for papers

These four notions are often encountered by researchers within the realm of
Humanities., and they seem to represent a particular feature within the
domain of linguistics, as they often introduce fundamental questions such as:

- Is it possible to consider a norm -or norms-, within the field of
linguistics?
- What is the scope of these notions in terms of the scientific
methodologies in Humanities?
- What kind of interaction can be considered between norms and their
specific applications?
- Is it possible to consider variation without referring it to a norm? Is
it possible to consider otherness without confronting it with a specific
identity? 

Papers will either explore epistemological perspectives or analyse a corpus
or set of corpora. The meeting aims to confront different theoretical
standpoints, in order to establish a dialogue between the different parts:
discourse analysis, interaction analysis, language teaching, phonetics and
phonology, natural language processing, sociolinguistics, morpho-syntax,
corpus linguistics, descriptive linguistics, semantics, lexicology,
lexicography, and any other domains of research within the realm of
linguistics.
Two formats will be accepted: oral presentations and posters. In either
case, abstracts will be submitted to the scientific committee for examination.
 
Dates:

-Friday, 8th of December 2006: Last date to hand in abstracts of oral
presentations (1000 words) and posters (500 words)
-
Friday, 16th of February 2007: Committee's resolutions after examination of
papers.
-
Saturday, 12th of May 2007: ED 268 Young Researchers' Meeting
- Monday, 11th of June 2007: Articles submitted for publication.
 
Submissions:

Proposals for oral communications will be presented according to the
following format requirements: Times New Roman font, size 12, single
spaced, abstract of 1000 words maximum (references included). Proposals for
posters will be presented according to the following format requirements:
abstract of 500 words maximum (references included). For any articles
containing phonetic transcriptions, please use SILDoulos font, downloadable
at http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=91.
Papers will be submitted by e-mail, in two copies in a .rtf format: the
first copy will be saved as anon_surname-of-the-author_rjc2007.rtf (for
example anon_WRIGHT_rjc2007.rtf ). It will contain:
- The title;
- 5 keywords;
- The domain;
- The abstract.

The second copy will be saved as  surname-of-the-author_rjc2007.rtf  (for
example WRIGHT_rjc2007.rtf ). It will contain the following details:
- Author's contact details (surname(s), first name(s), e-mail address,
postal address);
- The institution to which the author belongs, the level of studies (PhD
students, please specify the year); 
- Thesis supervisor's full name.

Oral presentations and posters can be presented either in English or French.

Remarks:

Presentations can be filmed and/or made available online on demand.
These meetings lead to a double publication: one in paper format, and the
other in digital format - on the YRM (RJC) website.
