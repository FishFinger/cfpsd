Meeting Description

Acquisition of African Languages with a special interest in the national
languages of South Africa. 

We are happy to announce that on 21-22nd January 2008, Stellenbosch University,
Western Cape Province, South Africa will host a special two-day conference on
the Acquisition of African Languages, with a special interest in the national
languages of South Africa.

We expect an audience of linguists, psychologists, speech pathologists and
therapists as well as educators of young children. The first day will consist
primarily of research papers on child language acquisition, and the second day
we would like to encourage submissions of work in more applied settings such as
language assessment, development of norms, therapy, and education. The afternoon
of the second day will be devoted to a roundtable discussion of how to further
support and encourage endeavours that will bring together linguists and applied
practitioners to work on improving assessment, intervention, and education for
children who are native speakers of African languages.

The meeting will immediately follow the 3rd International Symposium on
Intercultural Communication and Pragmatics (14-16 January 2008), and the annual
joint conference of the Linguistics Society of Southern Africa and the Southern
African Applied Linguistics Association (17-19 January 2008). Those groups have
extended their call for papers until July 30th, 2007, so we are hoping that the
coincidence of meetings might encourage people to submit and/or come to both
meetings. Their web site is http://academic.sun.ac.za/iccling/

The submission deadline is July 30th, 2007. To submit, please visit our website
at http://jeanerz.com/AAL2008.

Meeting Description:

'Building Bridges in the City and Beyond: Languages, Communities, and Cultures'
is an interdisciplinary conference hosted by the Language, Literacy, and Culture
Program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The goal of this

residents, city planners, and public officials whose respective work engages
issues of 'the city' or 'city life.' Featured plenary speaker: Dr. Barbara
Johnstone of Carnegie Mellon. 

The conference will have two main thrusts: 1) to foster cross-disciplinary

city and its surroundings; and 2) to promote dialogue about these issues as they
relate specifically to Baltimore City. Interested participants are encouraged to
submit proposals for individual papers, panels, workshops, exhibits, discussion
circles or breakout sessions.

Possible topics include:

Art, Borders, Cities/Counties, Citizenship, Communication, Communities,
Cultures, Ethnography, Filmmaking, Genders, Gentrification, Geographies,
Graffiti, Identities, Immigrants, Intercultural, Languages, Literacy, Mapping,
Murals, Neighborhoods, Outsiders and Outlaws, Places, Planning, Policy,
Political Economy, Pragmatics, Public Discourse, Storytelling, Spaces,
Sexualities, Urban/Suburban, Verbal/Visual
