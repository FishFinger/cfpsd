Second HCSNet Next Generation Search Workshop -- NGS07
Macquarie University
19-20 July 2007

http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/next-gen-search07


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

BACKGROUND

Existing information retrieval systems effectively treat documents as unstructured bags of words. As current Web search engines demonstrate, this approach works surprisingly well. At the same time, it is clear that human processors of information make use of a much deeper understanding of text than these systems exhibit. Humans cannot compete with machines in terms of quantity, but their abilities far exceed those of machines when it comes to quality.

Linguistics treats texts as richly structured objects that obey complex and interacting rules about language use, and natural language processing attempts to implement computational models that embody these ideas: how do we add this sophistication to information retrieval in a way that scales and which delivers better results? Are there insights from the cognitive sciences that can tell us how to build better tools for finding information? How do we extend these technologies when the data we are concerned with includes audio and video as well as text?

The aim of HCSNet's Priority Research Area in Next Generation Search is to bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines to address these questions. At our first workshop in September 2006 at the University of Melbourne, initial groundwork was laid via a collection of short presentations aimed at knowledge sharing across communities; see http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2006/next-gen-search. At this second workshop, our aim is for participants to gain a deeper understanding of each others' work.

AUDIENCE

The goal of the workshop is to gather people from all areas of research, development and industry. We welcome people from academia and industry with interest in any area related to innovative methods for search, including but not limited to the following:

* Cognitive Science 
* Natural language Processing and Language Technology 
* Information Retrieval 
* Human-computer Interaction 
* Data Mining 
* Formal Syntax and Morphology 
* Formal Semantics 
* Conversational and Discourse Analysis 
* Music Information Retrieval 
* Philosophy of Language 

WORKSHOP FORMAT

Our main aim is to further develop grounds for collaboration across the NGS community. Accordingly, the workshop will consist of a number of presentations of different types with this focus in mind:

- 30 minute project presentations which aim to give a detailed 'under-the-covers' understanding of how the technology used in current projects actually works, with the objective of building upon the knowledge sharing achieved at last year's workshop; and

- 10 minute speed presentations that describe a new project or specific idea to be shared with the community, with the aim of encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration; and

- 10 minute student project presentations, with the aim of informing the community of new ideas being developed, and to get feedback from an interdisciplinary audience.

The schedule will include ample time for discussion and networking.

KEYNOTE PRESENTATION

There will be a keynote presentation by Brett Poole, Head of Search of Yahoo!7. Brett began his career with a variety of roles in commercial web development where he was responsible for all facets of production including planning, designing, building and marketing of client websites.

In 2001, Brett was appointed as search product manager at Hitwise. During this time he focused on creating unique search marketing strategies for key clients by integrating website consulting and sponsored search solutions.

From there, Brett joined Yahoo! Australia & NZ in July 2004 as Search Producer, responsible for the technical integrity and local relevance of the Yahoo!'s search offering.

In January 2005, he was appointed to Product Manager of Search under the newly formed Yahoo!7, and in 2006 Brett became the Head of Search. Brett is charged with the ongoing development and direction of Yahoo! search, and his achievements include the successful launch of Yahoo!7 Answers and Video Search in the Australian market.

SUBMISSIONS

We want to involve as many as possible in discussion, so the effort required for attendance is deliberately small.

Those interested in making a project presentation should submit a half-page description of the project to be described.

Those interested in making a speed presentation or student presentation should submit a brief abstract of 100-150 words in length.

In addition, we ask all those interested in attending to submit a 100-150 word statement indicating their research interests pertinent to the workshop theme. These will be made available as part of the workshop materials.

Please visit the workshop website at http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/workshops/next-gen-search07 for a link to an email submission template.

FUNDING

HCSNet will fund travel and accommodation to a maximum of $500 for a number of participants from outside the Sydney area. The provision of a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop theme; also, early career researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in the last fifteen years) will have priority.

In addition, 10 student travel awards to a maximum of $500 per award will be available for postgraduate students outside the Sydney area. To apply for this funding stream, send a short CV in plain text to the email addresses below by the date of submission.

Note that, although attendance at the workshop is free, prior registration will be required.
