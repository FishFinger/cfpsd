Meeting Description:

The Department of Finno-Ugristics of the University of Szeged is pleased to
announce the New trends in Uralistics: typology, syntax, sociolinguistics
conference, to be held from 3 to 5 September, 2009 at the Department of
Finno-Ugristics in Szeged. The objective of the conference is to bring together
linguists who are engaged in research on the typological, syntactic or
sociolinguistic study of the Uralic languages, to exchange ideas across
approaches, theories, methodologies. The conference is intended to bridge the
gap between theoretical, typological, sociolinguistic approaches in general and
Uralic studies, and help to initiate new research projects or collaborations.

We therefore invite papers both on theoretical and on empirical aspects from a
language-specific or cross-linguistic perspective. Contributions are expected to
be based either on new data, or new approaches to analysis. We especially
encourage submissions on minor, less well studied Uralic languages and dialects.

phonological typology
phonological typology and grammar
morphological typology
synthesis and fusion
syntactic typology
typology of parts of speech

bilingualism/multilingualism
language endangerment
linguistic human rights

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
