  First Call for Papers:

in conjunction with:

Final WORKSHOP OF Dialogue Matters: Leverhulme International Network =

Project.

King=92s College London, June 2nd=96 June 4th, 2008


The SEMDIAL series of workshops aim to bring together researchers =

working on the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such as
artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, formal =

semantics/pragmatics, philosophy, psychology, and neural science.
In 2008 we will celebrate eleven years of the SEMDIAL series with the =

LONDIAL workshop, to be organized at King=92s College London in =

conjunction with the Interaction, Media and Communication Centre at =

Queen Mary London. The SemDial workshops are always stimulating and fun, =

and with King=92s being in the heart of London, just across from the South =

Bank Centre, there will be no shortage of evening entertainment.

LONDIAL 2008 will be held in conjunction with the closing workshop of =

the Leverhulme-funded network Dialogue Matters: Foundations for =

Technology Development, initially set up between London (KCL, QMUL), =

Edinburgh/Glasgow, Stanford, Stony Brook, Gothenburg, Essex, with =

additional collaborators now also participating. This one-day workshop =

on 2nd June (and possibly the previous day) will feature invited =

presentations by members of this group and other leaders of the =

computational linguistics and human language technology community.

There is also a planned session on dialogue situated in joint action.

We are still waiting to finalize many details; this preliminary
announcement is intended to let you know of the dates and deadlines.
