Doctoral Consortium at the 8th EUROLAN Summer School
* Last Call for Participation *

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 30 - August 2, 2007, Iasi, Romania

Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 14, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity
for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies)
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their current work and receive constructive
feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general
audience and the invited lecturers at the Summer School.

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4
consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in the second week of the
EUROLAN 2007 Summer School, July 30 - August 2, 2007. The final
version of the accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of
the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium, at the University Al. I. Cuza
Publishing House. During the Summer School the students will present
their work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to current and
future research directions from a panel of established researchers,
and will benefit from the collaborative climate established among all
participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Students
will also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the
Summer School.

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the
Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to
receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, including
but not limited to:

    * phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
    * pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax, and the lexicon;
    * text understanding and generation;
    * computational semantics;
    * ontology enriched NLP applications;
    * multilingual NLP;
    * multilingual question answering;
    * machine translation;
    * corpus-based language processing;
    * electronic dictionaries;
    * written and spoken natural language interfaces;
    * knowledge acquisition;
    * terminology;
    * text summarisation;
    * text classification;
    * computer-aided language learning;
    * human computer interaction;
    * language resources;
    * evaluation, assessment and standards in language engineering;
    * theoretical and application-oriented papers related to NLP of
      every kind.


Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lecturers of
the school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The
submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST
be students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD).

The paper should include:

    * the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;
    * the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field;
    * the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the
      methodology adopted;
    * the future research plan.

3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The only format acceptable is PDF
(.pdf). Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references
and annexes and should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings. The papers will be uploaded on a special page,
http://www.easychair.org/EUROLAN2007DC/ , announced on the web page of
the Doctoral Consortium, where more submission guidelines are
available.

4. Important Dates

    * Paper submissions deadline: May 14, 2007
    * Notification of acceptance: June 4, 2007
    * Camera ready papers due: June 25, 2007
    * Doctoral Consortium: July 30 - August 2, 2007
    * Summer School dates: July 23 - August 3, 2007

5. Registration

Authors of accepted papers must register for the Summer School and
present their work at the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. No
supplementary fee will be required above the EUROLAN fee. The authors
will benefit of early registration fee regardless of the date they
register. Participation in the Doctoral Consortium is open to all
EUROLAN 2007 attendants.

6. Travel Grants

A limited number of registration and accommodation discounts/waivers
will be available. The authors of accepted papers with reduced
possibilities to support their participation to the Doctoral
Consortium and the Summer School will have to send a motivation
letter, a CV and a recommendation letter from their Ph.D./research
advisor to the organizers. More details will be posted at the
appropriate time on the webpage of the event.
