Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

AI 2009, the twenty-second Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
invites graduate students to submit four-page extended abstracts of their thesis
for possible inclusion in the AI 2009 Graduate Student Symposium.  The symposium
will be a one-day pre-conference event, where students of accepted abstracts
will be invited to give a presentation on their thesis work before a group of
peers as well as a small team of expert AI researchers who would offer a
critique of each presentation and provide support, advice, and mentoring. 

Call for Papers

PhD and Master's students are invited to submit original work in all areas of
Artificial Intelligence. It is not expected that submissions will consist of
polished work with complete results; instead, more weight will be placed on the
significance of the work, the proposed ideas or solutions, and the overall
presentation. Submissions should therefore have emphasis on work in progress,
with directions for future research clearly indicated wherever appropriate. 

To apply for the symposium, please email an extended abstract in PDF, Postscript
or MS-Word RTF to Svetlana.Kiritchenko@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca, by January 30th, 2009.
Each abstract has to be accompanied with a cover letter stating your name,
institution, supervisor's name and email address, program start date, expected
graduation date, and 2-5 keywords describing your work. Also include a list of
your refereed and non-refereed publications and presentations at national and
international forums. All submissions must be written in English. Abstracts may
be up to 4 pages in length and must be formatted according to Springer's LNCS
style. Please follow the instructions for authors at Springer's site for
authors. The use of the LaTeX2e style file available at the web site is strongly
encouraged. We anticipate all accepted abstracts to be included in the
proceedings of the Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2009 published
by Springer. 

Each abstract will be reviewed by a mixed team of both students and program
committee members. Presenting students will be selected based on clarity of the
submission, stage of research, and evidence of promise such as published papers
or technical reports. Partial financial assistance for travel and accommodations
may be available to a limited number of students presenting at the Symposium. 

All students are encouraged to attend and participate in the Symposium, whether
or not they apply to present their work. All the selected student presenters are
expected to actively participate in the full Symposium, as we envision
participants gaining as much by interacting with their peers as by having their
presentations critiqued by the faculty panel. In addition, a senior AI
researcher and faculty member will be invited to give a talk on a topic of
interest to graduate students.

Important Dates
Full paper submission due: January 30th, 2009
Notification of acceptance: March 3rd, 2009
Final paper due: March 16th, 2009
Graduate Student Symposium: May 24th, 2009

Co-Chairs

eLexicography in the 21st century: New challenges, new applications

Second Call for Papers

The 12th International Conference on Translation (PPA) is a biennial conference
which was held for the first time held in 1984 through the initiatives of the
Malaysian Translators Association (MTA) and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), with
the awareness that translation is crucial in knowledge transfer. Translation is
a prime knowledge communication medium to develop one's country, particularly in
this borderless world. Therefore this international conference aims to nurture
the exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience, and simultaneously encourage
cooperation between scholars, language experts, translators, writers,
publishers, editors, educators and students internationally. The conference also
aims to explore the latest information, theories and techniques in the field of
translation in order to enhance translation quality as a whole.
