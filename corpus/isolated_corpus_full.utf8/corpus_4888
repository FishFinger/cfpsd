                            Call for Papers

First International Conference on 'Networked Digital Technologies'(NDT 2009)
                Ostrava, Czech Republic, July 28-31, 2009
             The proceedings will be indexed in IEEE Xplore
                  http://arg.vsb.cz/ndt2009/Default.aspx

=3D=3D=3D

The proposed conference on the above theme will be be held at the =20
VSB-Technical University, Ostrava, Czech Republic from July 28 to July =20
31 2009 which aims to enable researchers build connections between =20
different digital applications.

Currently a number of institutions across the countries are working to =20
evolve better models to provide collaborative technology services for =20
scholarship by creating shared cyberspace thro expert collaboration, =20
but this is a challenge for the institutions for a number of reasons. =20
In the last few years, the landscape of digital technology =20
applications projects for the various disciplines in humanities, =20
social sciences, and sciences appears induced by many initiatives. For =20
the creation of research clusters, the research community has =20
thousands of databases, websites, local computing clusters, and =20
web-based tools around individual themes, interests and projects. In =20
most cases, these tools and resources are and were created to meet the =20
specific needs of a particular community. In many cases, the funding =20
and support for these critical initiatives is fragile and temporary, =20
and directed in piecemeal fashion.
There is a need to provide concerted efforts in building federated =20
digital technologies that will enable the formation of network of =20
digital technologies.

Topics include but not limited to:

Information and Data Management
Data and Network mining
Intelligent agent-based systems, cognitive and reactive distributed AI syste=
ms
Internet Modeling
User Interfaces, Visualization and modeling
XML-based languages
Security and Access Control
Trust models for social networks
Information Content Security
Mobile, Ad Hoc and Sensor Network Management
Web Services Architecture, Modeling and Design
New architectures for web-based social networks
Semantic Web, Ontologies (creation , merging, linking and reconciliation)
Web Services Security
Quality of Service, Scalability and Performance
Self-Organizing Networks and Networked Systems
Data management in mobile peer-to-peer networks
Data stream processing in mobile/sensor networks
Indexing and query processing for moving objects
User interfaces and usability issues form mobile applications
Mobile social networks
Peer-to-peer social networks
Sensor networks and social sensing
Social search
Social networking inspired collaborative computing
Information propagation on social networks
Resource and knowledge discovery using social networks
Measurement studies of actual social networks
Simulation models for social networks

LOCATION

NDT 2009 will be organized by VSB-Technical University, Ostrava, Czech =20
Republic, in cooperation with the Digital Information Research =20
Foundation (DIRF) located in India. NDT is technically co-sponsored by =20
the Communications Society of IEEE. All the activities of the =20
conference will take place in Ostrava, Czech Republic.
