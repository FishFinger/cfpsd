               The Second International Conference on
                   Web Reasoning and Rule Systems

                 http://www.rr-conference.org/RR2008

         Karlsruhe, Germany, October 31 - November 2, 2008

                          Call for Papers

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deadlines approaching:
Abstract submission:   June 14, 2008
Paper submission:      June 21, 2008
submission url: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drr2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR)
aims to be the major forum for discussion and dissemination of new
results concerning Web Reasoning and Rule Systems. RR 2008 builds on
the success of The First International Conference on Web Reasoning and
Rule Systems RR 2007, which received enthusiastic support from the Web
Rules community. In 2008, RR will continue the excellence of the new
series and aim to attract the best Web Reasoning and Rules researchers
from all over the world.

The reasoning landscape features theoretical areas such as knowledge
representation (KR) and algorithms; design aspects of rule markup;
design of ontology languages; engineering of engines, translators, and
other tools; efficiency considerations and benchmarking;
standardization efforts, such as the Rules Interchange Format activity
at W3C; and applications. Of particular interest is also the use of
rules to facilitate ontology modeling, and the relationships and
possible interactions between rules and ontology languages like RDF
and OWL, as well as ontology reasoning related to RDF and OWL, or
querying with SPARQL.

Suggested topics include the following, which is not to be considered
as an exhaustive list:

* Acquisition of rules and ontologies by knowledge extraction
* Combining open and closed-world reasoning
* Combining rules and ontologies
* Design and analysis of reasoning languages
* Efficiency and benchmarking
* Implemented tools and systems
* Standardization
* Ontology usability
* Ontology languages and their relationships
* Querying and optimization
* Rules and ontology management
      (such as inconsistency handling and evolution)
* Reasoning with uncertainty and under inconsistency
* Reasoning with constraints
* Rule languages and systems
* Rule interchange formats and Rule markup languages
* Scalability vs. expressivity of reasoning on the web
* Semantic Web Services modeling and applications
* Web and Semantic Web applications

LOCATION:

The conference is co-located with ISWC 2008
(http://iswc2008.semanticweb.org/), the International Semantic Web
Conference.


SUBMISSION DETAILS:

RR 2008 welcomes original research and application papers dealing with
web reasoning and rule systems, with particular attention to the
topics listed above.  Submitted papers are limited in length to
fifteen (15) pages, including title, abstract, and list of references,
and should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style (see
http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html).  Submitted papers
must be in PDF format.  The full paper submission must be preceded by
the submission of an abstract.  Submission is via EasyChair, at

    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drr2008

Papers may be accepted as:
- full papers (15 pages in the proceedings)
- short papers (8 pages in the proceedings)
- posters (2 pages in the proceedings)

Accepted papers will be published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS
series.  The best papers may also be considered for publication in a
prestigious international journal.

Abstract submission deadline:          June 14, 2008
Paper submission deadline:             June 21, 2008
Notification of acceptance decisions:  July 21, 2008
