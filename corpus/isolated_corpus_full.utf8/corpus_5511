AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTA)

3rd and 4th December 2009, Sydney, Australia
http://alta.asn.au/events/alta2009
to be held as part of HCSNet SummerFest
http://hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest09

Submissions deadline: Monday 28th September 2009

Overview

This year, the Australasian Language Technology Workshop (ALTA) will
be held as part of the HCSNet Summerfest at the University of New
South Wales in Sydney on Thursday 3rd and Friday 4th of December 2009.
This event will be the seventh annual installment of the ALTA Workshop
in its most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual
workshop series that has existed under various guises since the early
90s.

The goals of the ALTA workshop are:
 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in
Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community
and with the wider international LT community;
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers,
to encourage dissemination of research results;
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research
and projects;
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally,
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and over=
seas.

Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
 * speech understanding and generation;
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
 * machine translation and translation aids;
 * question answering and information extraction;
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
 * natural language and multimodal systems;
 * message and narrative understanding systems;
 * evaluations of language systems;
 * embodied conversational agents;
 * computational lexicography;
 * summarisation.

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research. We also
specifically encourage submissions from industry.

Submission Format

All submissions should follow the ACL style guidelines and must be in
PDF format.

Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one
extra page for references. Accepted full papers will be presented
orally at the workshop.

Short paper submissions should also follow the two-column format of
ACL proceedings without exceeding four (4) pages of content plus one
extra page for references. Accepted short papers will be presented as
posters at the workshop.

Note that full papers can be accepted as short papers as determined by
the program committee. Full papers will be distinguished from short
papers in the proceedings.

We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft
Word Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files
and example documents are available from the workshop website.We
reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these
styles including font and page size restrictions.

If we cannot print your PDF file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.) Detailed directions for submission will be made
available at the workshop website. Contact the organisers for any
questions regarding this process.

Proceedings

A proceedings containing all papers (full paper and short paper
submissions) will be produced and published by HCSNet in CD-ROM
format. The full proceedings volume will also be published online on
the website of the Australasian Language Technology Association
(ALTA).
