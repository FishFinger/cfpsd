CALL FOR PAPERS

1st International Workshop on Describing Medical Web Resources
http://www.medieq.org/drmed2008/
The workshop is organized as part of the 21st International Congress
of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (MIE-2008),
May 25-28, 2008, Goteborg Sweden

Description and Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The number of health information web resources is increasing day by
day. The content of these resources is very variable and difficult to
assess. Furthermore, the number of people searching for health-related
information is also increasing. The development of tools to support the
process of describing the content of medical web resources with =

meta-data that facilitate their retrieval, and with quality labels by
certified authorities, is crucial for the delivery of content of better
quality to health information consumers.

The DRMed workshop at MIE 2008 aims at providing a focused international
forum for researchers, developers and labeling organizations to present
the scope of the problem, discuss the potential of semantic web
technologies and outline promising future research directions.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:: =


 * Knowledge representation and management technologies (e.g. OWL, RDF,
   Annotation Schemas, etc.) that enable the creation of =

   machine-processable descriptions of medical web resources, either
   by experts of simple users. =


 * Challenges related to content collection and information extraction
   techniques that allow the retrieval of unclassified/unlabeled web
   resources or the continuous monitoring of already classified/labeled
   ones.
 =

 * Applications of Medical Web Content Accreditation, utilizing Semantic
   Web technologies/tools. =
