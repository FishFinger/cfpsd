Meeting Description:

Two day symposium on current trends and developments in Ecolingusitcs with an
eye on future avenues of research. 

Call for Papers

Symposium on Ecolinguistics: The Ecology of Science

Ecolinguistics emerged in the 1990's as a new paradigm of linguistic research
which emphasises the ecological context in which societies are embedded.
Einar Haugen's "The Ecology of Language" and Michael Halliday's 1990 work "New
ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics" are often credited as a
seminal works which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the
ecological context and consequences of language. 

Among other things, the challenge that Haugen, Halliday and others put forward
was to make linguistics relevant to the issues and concerns of the 21st century
such as the the widespread destruction of ecosystems and the loss of languages.
Since Haugen's and Halliday's initial comments, the field of Ecolinguistics has
developed considerably, especially in Europe with a working group "Human Ecology
and Language" and symposia held in Austria and Germany. The discipline of
Ecolinguistics is divided into two main branches: eco-critical discourse
analysis and the ecology of languages. However, Ecolinguistics is still about to
find its own home but it holds an interdisciplinary potential with academic
subjects such as cultural geography, environmental history, eco-feminism,
cultural studies, anthropology, eco-psychology and social ecology.

The aim of the symposium is to trace and merge current and new trends and
developments in Ecolinguistics in order to explore avenues for future research. 

Please submit tiles and an abstract for 20 minutes presentations to Jørgen Bang
(bang@language.sdu.dk)

The symposium is organised by Anna Vibeke Lindø (Odense) and Jørgen Chr. Bang
(Odense) in co-operation with Martin Doering (Hamburg) and Wilhelm Trampe
Osnabrueck).
