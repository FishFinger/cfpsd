Workshop on Partial Parsing 2: Between Chunking and Deep Parsing


**** Extended Deadline: 21 June 2009 ****

Motivation

After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are  =20
happy to announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a =20
standard means of integrating syntactic knowledge into high level =20
applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, or =20
question answering,  for which efficiency and robustness is of =20
importance. In comparison with  chunking and deep parsing, partial =20
parsing consists in finding structure that is  richer than chunks but =20=

less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing =20=

may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple  chunking) =20
without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial  =20
parsing is not a single concept but rather an area ranging from =20
chunking to almost full parsing. This workshop will bring together =20
researcher who work on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Scope

The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not  =20
restricted to):
- Linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications:
syntactic and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical =20
structure, semantic information (anaphora, disambiguation);
- Development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine  =20
learning, hybrid;
- The usability of language resources for the development of partial =20
parsers;
- Multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;
- Experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial =20
parsers for new languages;
- Technical aspects of partial parsers: robustness, scalability; time =20=

and space complexity; expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms =20
(regular vs. context-free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.);
- Applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question =20
answering, machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of =20
lexical  information, etc.;
- Evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,  =20
application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for =20
different partial parsing tasks, etc.;
- Ways of combining multiple partial parsers;
- Comparison (classification) of partial parsers.

Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should  =20=

indicate the state of completion of the reported results. In =20
particular, any  overlap with previously published work should be =20
clearly mentioned.  Submissions will be judged on correctness, =20
novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, and significance/=20=

relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should be no longer than 7 pages typeset in an 10pt font.
Guidelines are available at the RANLP 2009 web page:
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009.

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system, at
https://www.softconf.com/ranlp09/PaPa2009/.

Submission deadline: 21 June 2009
Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2009
