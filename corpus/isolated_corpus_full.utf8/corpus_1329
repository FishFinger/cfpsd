Call Deadline: 15-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

The focus of the conference is on variability in native and non-native
English speech. Suggested topics include native accents of English,
non-native accents of English, native- non-native accent continuum, model
accents for English teaching, accents and Lingua Franca Core, variability
in spoken language, methodology of accent studies, teaching English
pronunciation. The list of topics is by no means exclusive, as we hope to
provoke discussion on a variety of issues related to the application of
accent studies to second and foreign language learning and teaching. 

The conference continues the tradition of annual meetings of teachers and
researchers in the area of phonetics and phonology of English in Poland. In
connection with the main theme of the conference, the major aim is to
stimulate the exchange of ideas between specialists in the field of native
accent variability and non-native speech, including linguistic,
socio-linguistic and pedagogical aspects of accent studies in native and
non-native speakers. We invite papers in the following areas: 
- native accents of English 
- non-native accents of English
- native- non-native accent continuum 
- model accents for English teaching 
- accents and Lingua Franca Core
- variability in spoken language
- methodology of accent studies
- teaching English pronunciation
The list of topics is by no means exclusive, as we hope to provoke
discussion on a variety of issues related to the application of accent
studies to second and foreign language learning and teaching.    

Deadline for abstract submission is June 15, 2007. Please send abstracts of
about 500 words to accents@uni.lodz.pl. An abstract should also include the
name, affiliation of the author, and the intended type of presentation:
paper (20 minutes + 10 minutes for discussion), workshop (45 minutes) or
poster presentation. After the process of peer-revision, e-mail
notifications will be sent out by September 15, 2007

Multi-source Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization

Workshop to be held in conjunction with

26th of September 2007
First Call for Papers

Information extraction (IE) and text summarization (TS) are key technologies
aiming at extracting relevant information from texts and other sources and
presenting the information to the user in condensed forms. Recent years have
witnessed an explosion of information, making IE and TS particularly important
for the information society. These technologies, however, face new challenges
with the adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g. blogs, wikis) because of their
inherent multi-source nature. These technologies have to deal no longer with
isolated texts or single narratives but with  large scale repositories, or
sources -- in one or many languages -- containing a multiplicity of views,
opinions, or commentaries on particular topics, entities or events. There is
thus a need to adapt and/or develop new techniques to
deal with these new phenomena.

Recognising similar information across different sources and/or in different
languages is of paramount importance in this multi-source, multi-lingual
context, in particular the ability to detect paraphrases in texts is relevant
here. In information extraction, merging information from multiple sources can
lead to increased accuracy relative to extraction from single sources. In text
summarization, similar facts found across sources can inform sentence scoring
algorithms. In question answering, the distribution of answers in similar
contexts can inform answer ranking components. In occasions, it is not the
similarity of information that matters, but its complementary nature. In a
multi-lingual context, information extraction and text summarization can provide
solutions for cross-lingual access: key pieces of information can be extracted
from different texts in one or many languages, merged, and then conveyed in many
natural languages in concise forms. It is therefore important that the research
community addresses the following issues:

- What methods are appropriate to detect similar/complementary/contradictory
information? Are hand-crafted rules and knowledge-rich approaches convenient?

- What methods are there to tackle cross-document and cross-lingual entity and
event coreference?

- What machine learning approaches are most appropriate for this task
supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised? What  type of corpora is required for
training and testing?

- What techniques are appropriate to produce condensed synthesis of the
extracted information? What generation techniques are useful here?
What kind of techniques can be used to cross domains and languages?

- What tools are there to support multi-lingual/multi-source access to
information? What solutions are there beyond full document translation to
produce cross-lingual summaries?

The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
in the areas of extraction, summarization, and other information access
technologies to discuss recent approaches to deal with multi-source and
multi-lingual challenges.

We welcome submission concerning the following topics:

- Multi-source information extraction
- Cross-document Cross-lingual coreference
- Opinion mining and synthesis
- Multi-lingual information extraction
- Cross-lingual Summarization
- Tools to support information fusion
- Paraphrase identification and generation
- Adaptable IE-based text generation

Important Dates:

Deadline for submission: June 15, 2007 
Notification of acceptance: July 25, 2007
Camera-ready copy due: August 31, 2007
Workshop: September 26, 2007

Submission guidelines:

Submissions should be A4, two-column format and should not exceed seven pages,
including cover page, figures, tables and references. Times New Roman 12 font is
preferred. The first page should state the title of the paper, the author's

organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.
