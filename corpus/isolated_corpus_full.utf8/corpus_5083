Full Title: Workshop on Formal Approaches to the Phonology-Morphology-Syntax
Interfaces 

Date: 16-Dec-2009 - 16-Dec-2009
Location: Barcelona, Spain 
Contact Person: Clàudia Pons
Meeting Email: console18@uab.cat
Web Site: http://seneca.uab.cat/clt/ConsoleXVIII/workshop.html 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Morphology; Phonology; Syntax 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Investigation of interface phenomena, be it phonology-morphology,
phonology-syntax, or morphology-syntax, has a central position in linguistic
inquiry.  Interface investigations are not only important for discovering the
nature of the interfaces themselves, but also for illuminating properties of the
interfacing domains that might otherwise remain obscure. Moreover, an
integration of the results of studies of distinct interfaces offers the
potential for a higher level understanding of the nature of a linguistic
interface, an abstraction that can very well contribute to a deeper 
understanding of the organization of the faculty of language. 

3rd Call for Papers
On 16 December, 2009, a one-day workshop focusing on the phonology-morphology-
syntax interfaces will be held at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Centre
de Lingüística Teòrica), Spain. We invite papers that offer new insights into
the nature and organization of the faculty of language deriving from
investigations of any of these interfaces. Four abstracts will be selected for
35 minute presentations with 10 minutes for discussion.

NB: Although the workshop immediately precedes ConSOLE XVIII, it is NOT
restricted to students. It is open to anyone who wishes to send an abstract.

Abstracts should not exceed two pages, including data, references, and diagrams.
They should be typed in at least 11-point font. Abstracts must be anonymous and
submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author. To
submit your abstract, please go to http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/console18
and follow the instructions. (Please, include "Workshop Submission" in the title
section.) Only abstracts in .pdf format will be considered. The .pdf file name
should be a shortened version of the abstract title, resembling the full title
as closely as possible.
