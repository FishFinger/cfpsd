Second Call for Papers

Workshop:  Reconstructing Alignment Systems
14-15 May, 2009
University of Bergen, Norway

Invited Speakers:
Alice Harris (Stony Brook University)
Geoffrey Haig (University of Kiel)

Abstract Submission Deadline: 15 December, 2008
Workshop URL: http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP/Workshop3.htm
Address Abstract to: Thomas.Smitherman@uib.no

The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers working on alignment systems
in an historical perspective, in order to brainstorm on how alignment systems
can be reconstructed for earlier stages of a language or a language family. We
welcome abstracts on well-studied language families like Indo-European,
abstracts on oral languages without a recorded history, and everything in
between, aiming to highlight different kinds of reconstruction problems. We also
welcome papers on changes in alignment systems, papers addressing the issue of
how different theoretical frameworks can contribute to reconstruction, as well
as papers concerned with the more general implications of alignment changes for
diachronic typology.

The workshop is hosted by the University of Bergen and the research team of the
project, Indo-European Case and Argument Structure from a Typological
Perspective (IECASTP): http://ling.uib.no/IECASTP/index.htm

Location:
University of Bergen
Vilvite Bergen Vitensenter AS (Auditorium)
Thorm√∏hlengate 51
