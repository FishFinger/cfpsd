Call for Papers

ASYRAS (Association of Young Researchers on Anglophone Studies), together with
the English Department of the University of Salamanca, is pleased to announce
the 1st Conference of Young Researchers on Anglophone Studies that will be held
in Salamanca next October. This association was founded by a group of eight
graduate students who saw the need to create new platforms of dissemination and
sharing of current research trends and results. This conference is one of the
varied events organised by ASYRAS with the aim to promote, give diffusion and
favour the exchange of research done by young scholars on the different fields
of Anglophone Studies (literature, culture, linguistics, translation studies, etc).

The conference will welcome contributions (whether papers or round tables) on
any field related to English, American and Postcolonial Studies, including
literary, cultural and linguistic approaches. These contributions should offer
innovative and thoughtful perspectives on the topics to be discussed.

The attendance of reputed and well-known scholars as plenary speakers has
already been confirmed:
- Prof. Dr. María Socorro Suárez Lafuente (University of Oviedo)
- Prof. Dr. Francisco Collado Rodríguez (University of Zaragoza)
- Prof. Dr. Francisco José Ruiz de Mendoza Ibáñez (University of La Rioja)
- Prof. Dr. Ana Isabel Moreno Fernández (CSIC)
Registration form and conference information available at www.usal.es/asyras

Paper presentations, in English, will be 20-min. long plus a 10-min. discussion.
Authors are invited to submit 300-word abstracts (including a list of keywords).
Round tables should include three or four brief presentations (approx. 10 min.
each) followed by an open discussion (approx. 20-30 min.). Proposals must
include titles of papers, name, e-mail address and an institutional affiliation.
They should be submitted in Word format.
