Full Title: Transmission and Diffusion 

Date: 17-Jan-2008 - 19-Jan-2008
Location: Nijmegen, Netherlands 
Contact Person: Ans van Kemenade
Meeting Email: tranmission.diffusion@let.ru.nl

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

The title 'Transmission and Diffusion' is inspired by Labov's recent paper in which he attempts to fit together the family tree model of language change with the wave model into a general framework based on changes in language learning ability across the lifespan. The general argument is that the divergence of branches of family tree is based on the stable transmission of language structure from adults to children, and the incrementation of change in progress by children. The diffusion of language contact across branches of the tree is primarily the work of adults who do not preserve structural conditions with the same fidelity (as adult second language learning is to varying degrees imperfect), which accounts for the limitations on borrowing of structure. 
The theme of the conference can be approached on various levels of scale.

- the macro-level of (sub-)continental transmission and diffusion patterns, as in historical-comparative work on larger language families such as Amerind, Austronesian and Trans-New Guinea Phylum, or Semitic within Afro-Asiatic

- the meso-level of language contact, acquisition, and pidgin and creole studies

- the micro-level of more fine-grained (historical) dialectological research, e.g. within the Germanic language area
