1st CALL FOR ABSTRACTS :

Prosody of Expressivity in Speech and Music

Third EMUS Conference - Expressivity in MUsic and Speech
http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/EMUS

Paris, France, June 17th-18th, 2008, during AGORA music festival
[Abstract submission deadline: February 29th, 2008]
Keywords: emotion, expressivity, prosody, music, acquisition, 
perception, production, interpretation, performance, cognitive
sciences, neurosciences, acoustic analysis, linguistics, phonetics.


DESCRIPTION:
The analysis of expressivity in speech and musical performance are two
emerging and pluri-disciplinary areas of scientific research. The
recent parallelism in this research of the role played by prosody
(verbal and/or instrumental) in expressivity raises new questions at
the boundary of these two areas. These questions are constantly raised
in a more or less direct manner by an artistic community that has
"handled" for a long time now the expressive gesture. In order
to bring together the many participants in the artistic and scientific
domains, this colloquium focuses on two questions : How can one define
the expressivities common to both speech and music (what are the
semantic and categorical fields) ? What are the acoustical elements
common to both music and speech that make possible the description of
these expressivities ? These questions will be dealt with from the
point of view of the composer, the scientific researcher, the
performer and the musicologist.

FRAMEWORK:
This workshop will be the third event of a string dedicated to the
relations between language and music:
May 5th: Prosody and Expressivity in Speech and Music (Speech Prosody
2008, Campinas, Brazil)
May 16th: Prosody, Babbling and Music (Ecole Normale Supérieure
Lettres et Sciences Humaines, Lyon)
June 17-18th: Prosody of Expressivity in Music and Speech (IRCAM,
Paris) September 25th and 26th: Semiotics and microgenesis of verbal
and musical forms (RISC, Paris).
Our aim is to make links between several fields of research and create
a community interested in the relations between music and
language. The project will be materialized in a final publication of
the keynote papers of those four events.
This colloquium takes place during the June 2008 Agora Festival. As a
counterpoint to this scientific colloquium, IRCAM is organizing - in
collaboration with the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers (CNAM) - an
evening event aimed towards a wider public. This event's goal is to
give an accessible overview of current musical and scientific research
in the area of expressivity.

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:
The workshop will host about ten posters.
Authors should submit an extended abstract to: beller@ircam.fr in pdf
format by February 29, 2008.
We will send an email confirming the reception of the submission. The
suggested abstract length is maximum 1 page, formatted in standard
style. The authors of the accepted abstracts will be allocated as
poster highlights. Time will be allocated in the programme for poster
presentations and discussions. Before the workshop, the extended
abstracts (maximum 4 pages) will be made available to a broader
audience on the workshop web site. We also plan to maintain the web
page after the workshop and encourage the authors to submit slides and
posters with relevant links to their personal web pages.
