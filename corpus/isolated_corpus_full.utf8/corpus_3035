EACL 2009 CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS

Proposals are invited for the Tutorial Program of the 12th Conference  =20=

of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational  =20
Linguistics (EACL 2009), to be held in Athens, Greece, from March 30  =20=

to April 3, 2009. The selected tutorials will be given on the Monday  =20=

and Tuesday preceeding the main conference (March 30 and 31).

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of natural language processing, =20=

speech processing and information retrieval are sought. We =20
particularly welcome (1) tutorials which cover advances in newly =20
emerging areas not previously covered in an (E)ACL related tutorial,  =20=

or (2) tutorials which provide introductions into related fields =20
which  are potentially relevant for the CL community (e.g. =20
bioinformatics,  human language processing, emerging machine learning =20=

techniques).

The remuneration for tutorials will be computed as follows:
=95 =80484 for up to 20 people
=95 plus =8023 per person for registrants 21 to 50
=95 plus =8016 per person for registrants greater than 50

The minimum remuneration will be =80484 or the cost of one economy =20
airline ticket to the conference, whichever is higher. As has been ACL =20=

policy, the remuneration is per tutorial, not per presenter; multiple =20=

presenters will split the proceeds, the default assumption being an =20
even split.

These figures are euro conversions to the nearest euro of dollar =20
amounts quoted in
=

y


SUBMISSION DETAIL

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its =20
relevance to the ACL community (not more than 2 pages).

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the =20
tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including =20=

a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are =20
available as well.

3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of =20=

the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their =20=

research interests and areas of expertise.

4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the =20
same or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an =20
estimate of the audience size.

5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g. =20=

internet access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text =20=

no later than November 25th, 2008 to E.J.Krahmer "at" uvt.nl

The subject line should be: "EACL 2009 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

Please note that only proposals submitted by e-mail will be taken into =20=

account.
