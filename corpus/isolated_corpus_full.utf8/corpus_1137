Call Deadline: 07-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description
The goals of ICPhS are to present reports of recent research in as many areas of
the Phonetic Sciences as possible and to provide a forum for the discussion of
topics that are of current interest in an atmosphere that is conducive to a
positive and constructive exchange of views.

The main focus of the conference will be on the section papers and the poster
sessions. There will, however, also be a number of symposia. 

Last Call for Papers
The phoneticians of Germany are proud to be able to invite you to participate in
ICPhS 2007 Germany. 
The 16th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences will take place on the
campus of the Saarland University, Saarbrücken, from the afternoon of Sunday 5th
August (registration and informal reception) till the evening of Friday 10th
August, 2007 (final ceremony and conference barbecue). 

The congress is under the patronage of the Minister for Education and Research
of the Federal Republic of Germany, Frau Annette Schavan. ICPhS 2007 Germany is
supported by the two international organisations for phoneticians, the
International Phonetic Association (IPA) and the International Society of
Phonetic Sciences (ISPhS).

We would like to encourage submission of papers on topics within the following
areas
- Speech Production 
- Speech Perception and Auditory Mechanisms
- Speech Acoustics
- Speech Prosody
- Phonetics of Conversation
- Dysfluent Speech
- Tone Languages
- Phonology
- Universals and Typology
- Dialectology
- Sociophonetics
- Diachronic Phonetics and Phonology
- First Language Acquisition 
- Foreign Language Acquisition and Phonetics Pedagogy 
- Contrastive Phonetics and Phonology 
- Forensic Phonetics 
- Speaker Characteristics 
- Phonetic Neurolinguistics
- Phonetic Psycholinguistics
- Clinical Phonetics and Pathophonetics

Paper Submission
The (extended) deadline for 4-page full paper submission is 7 March 2007. Papers
will be submitted exclusively through the conference website. Submitted papers
will be anonymous to the reviewers. Previously published papers should not be
submitted. The author will be notified by e-mail of the paper status by 19 May
2007. For each paper at least one author must be registered for the conference.

Special Sessions
In addition to the regular sessions, a series of Special Sessions has been
planned for the meeting. Like the regular sessions, these will feature
contributions within a selected thematic area, but with a different mode of
presentation. In Special Sessions, either an overview is given or the speakers
are invited to contribute because they are known to represent different points
of view. Thus the character of the Special Sessions is intended to be one of
lively debate and more extended theoretical discussion of areas which support
disparate perspectives. 

Special Sessions will be organised on the following topics:
- Between Meaning and Speech: On the Role of Communicative Functions,
Representations and Articulations
- Second Language Acquisition and Exemplar Theory 
- Natural Phonology: Universal Principles for the Study of Language (Insiders
meet Outsiders)
- Do Phonological Features have any Reality for the Brain?
- Arabic Phonetics at the Beginning of the 2nd Millennium
- Speech Timing: Approaches to Speech Rhythm
- Sound to Sense:  Modelling Fine Phonetic Detail
- Is there a Biological Grounding of Phonology?
- Nasalization Processes at the Interface between Phonetics and Phonology
- Audiovisual Speech Analysis
- Intonational Development from Babbling to the Two-word Stage
- Of Mouths, Ears and Eyes - The Sensory Motor Foundations of Spoken Language

Papers for Special Sessions will be submitted to the Session organizer(s), not
to the central conference organization.

Satellite Events
Satellite Workshops will be held on the following topics:
- Disfluency in Spontaneous Speech - DiSS 07 (August 2-4, 2007 in Edinburgh) 
- Phonetics and Phonology in Third Language Acquisition (August 3-4, 2007, in
