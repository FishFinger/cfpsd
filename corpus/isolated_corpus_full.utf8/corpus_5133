Full Title: FrameNet Masterclass and Workshop 

Date: 03-Dec-2009 - 03-Dec-2009
Location: Milan, Italy 
Contact Person: Marco Passarotti
Meeting Email: marco.passarotti@unicatt.it
Web Site: http://tlt8.unicatt.it/framenet.htm 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Lexicography 

Call Deadline: 11-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

FrameNet Masterclass and Workshop will be held on 3 December 2009 in Milan, at
the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart
(http://tlt8.unicatt.it/framenet.htm) and will be co-located with the TLT8
workshop (http://tlt8.unicatt.it/).

FrameNet is a project directed by Charles J. Fillmore and hosted at the
International Computer Science Institute of the University of California,
Berkeley. It is an on-line lexical resource based on frame semantics and
supported by corpus evidence. FrameNet is mainly a lexical database, containing
approximately 10,000 lexical units, 825 semantic frames and over 135,000 example
sentences. It is developed based on English, but also on a number of other
languages, such as Japanese, German and Spanish. The aim of the project is to
document the range of semantic and syntactic combinatorial possibilities -
valences - of each word in each of its senses. Similar projects are ongoing
today, including PropBank, NomBank, VerbNet, and Prague Tectogrammatics
(PDT-Vallex).

Despite the fact that FrameNet has begun to annotate some continuous texts, as a
demonstration of how frame semantics can contribute to text understanding, no
FrameNet annotated corpus is currently available and FrameNet data are
systematically biased by the criteria for the selection of the examples adopted
to describe the frame semantics of target words. 

Therefore, a more strict collaboration between FrameNet and annotated corpora
(especially, treebanks) is now required for at least two reasons: (a) during the
procedure of syntactic annotation, FrameNet data can help with consistency and
supply motives in support of annotation choices; (b) annotated corpora provide
further evidence to FrameNet data, allowing lexicographers to ground their
decisions on a wider variety of examples.

In order to connect people involved in treebank development, management and
exploitation with the FrameNet project, TLT8 will be co-located with an event
conceived as a Masterclass by Charles J. Fillmore (morning, Dec. 3rd), followed
in the afternoon by a workshop with oral presentations (peer-reviewed) on
research concerning FrameNet and related linguistic and corpus topics. 

Call for Papers

A Masterclass given by Charles Fillmore will cover the entire morning session.
For the afternoon session, we invite the submission of abstracts (up to 2,000
words) for oral presentations on research concerning FrameNet and related
topics, such as the following:
- applications of FrameNet in NLP
- collaboration between FrameNet and annotated corpora
- the role of linguistic theories in FrameNet
- FrameNet as a basis for linguistic research
- combination and comparison between FrameNet and other lexical resources
- parallel and multilingual FrameNets
- development of new FrameNets

Abstracts should be submitted by e-mail to workshop.tlt8@unicatt.it before 11
September 2009, clearly indicating in the subject line 'FrameNet submission'. In
the accompanying message, please include:
- the title of the talk
- the names of all the authors
- the contact author name
- contact information (e-mail is sufficient)

Notifications of acceptance will be sent before 9 October 2009. No publication
of the papers of the talks is foreseen.

The presentations at this event will be as long as the presentations at the TLT8
workshop (i.e. 30 minutes: 25 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for
questions and discussion).

Please forward this call to colleagues of yours who may be interested.
