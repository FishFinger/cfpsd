Call for Papers

The conference welcomes substantive contributions relating to the evolution of
human language from any relevant discipline, including Anthropology, Genetics,
Population Biology, Linguistics, Psychology, Primatology, Ethology,
Paleontology, Archeology, Artificial Life and Mathematical Modelling. Normal
standards of academic quality apply. Thus, submitted papers should aim to make
clear their own substantive claim, relating this to relevant scientific
literature, and briefly setting out the method by which the claim is
substantiated, the nature of the relevant data, and/or the core of the
theoretical argument concerned.

Types of Submission:

There are two possible types of submission: 
- Full Papers, which can have a length of between 6 and 8 pages. 
- Abstracts, which can be at most 2 pages long. 

All accepted submissions will be published in the proceedings of the conference.
All papers or abstracts accepted will be allotted the same presentation length
(probably 25 minutes plus 10 minutes discussion). Proceedings will be published
by World Scientific. Formatting instructions (MS Word, Latex) are available
through the website: http://evolang2010.nl

Important Dates:

- Submissions due: 2 October 2009
- Acceptance Notifications: 13 November 2009 
- Final versions due (provisional): 11 December 2009. 

All submissions are handled by our electronic submission system accessible
through http://evolang2010.nl

Workshops:

Prior to the main conference, three full-day workshops are planned on Wednesday
April 14th. Separate calls for papers for these workshops will be sent out in
due time on the evolang mailing list -- sign up for the mailing list on our
website. The themes for these workshops are:
- Human language & bird song

- Computational modelling of language evolution

Local Organizers

The conference is hosted by the Utrecht Institute of Linguistics OTS (UiL OTS)
of Utrecht University, the Netherlands. The Local Organizing Committee are
taking various steps to ensure that Evolang 2010 will be a significant event
from a scientific perspective. These include inviting, in addition to plenary
speakers, a number of other leading scientists to present papers at the
conference, extending the range of pertinent perspectives on language evolution
to be included in the programme, revising the review procedure for submitted
papers, and exploring the
possibility of publishing, in addition to the proceedings, a selection of
reworked/expanded papers with an publisher of high repute. All details are at
http://evolang2010.nl.
