NLDB 2009

14th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to =

Information Systems

June 23-26, 2009

Saarland University, Saarbr=FCcken, Germany

http://www.nldb.org

Call for Papers =96 Doctoral Symposium

Schedule:


April 14, 2009 Doctoral symposium submission deadline (extended!)

May 18, 2009 Notification of acceptance/rejection

June 2, 2009 Camera-ready papers due

June 23, 2009 Doctoral Symposium

June 24-26, 2009 Main conference

Aims and Scope

Since 1995, the NLDB conference, with high impact factor, has aimed at =

bringing

together researchers, industrials and potential users interested in =

various applications

of Natural Language in the Web and database driven information systems =

area. It has

contributed to many areas such as: improving the development process =

from the

viewpoints of the developers (e.g., the process of requirements =

engineering, conceptual

modeling, validation, etc.) the usability of applications (e.g., natural =

language query

interfaces, retrieval, semantic web, etc.) knowledge extraction and =

dissemination (e.g.,

text mining, knowledge discovery, etc.). To underline these inspiring =

connections,

NLDB 2009 will take place from June 23 to June 26 in Saarbr=FCcken, Germany.

Doctoral Symposium

Following the two most recent NLDB conferences, the 14th International =

Conference

on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB 2009) is

organizing a Doctoral Symposium. This is intended to encourage Ph.D. =

students,

who are studying aspects of Natural Language Processing and Management =

related

to Information Systems, to share and discuss their research proposals =

and direction

under the guidance of a panel of leading academics in Computer Science and

Information Systems, and to network with other doctoral students and =

researchers.

Contributions are welcome in all topics covered by NLDB 2009.

In order to present at the symposium, Ph.D. students should submit a =

paper describing

their research proposal and direction of their work. The paper should =

not exceed

4 pages in PDF or Postscript format. We intend to include accepted =

papers in the

proceedings. In contrast to regular conference papers, submissions to =

this Doctoral

Symposium should clearly address:

=95 The motivation behind the proposed research

=95 A clear formulation of the research problem to be solved

=95 An outline of the current knowledge of the problem domain, by briefly =

citing

and describing any existing solutions

=95 A proposed methodology and any preliminary ideas and results achieved =

so far

=95 The contributions of the current proposal

Similar to a Ph.D. thesis, only a single author is allowed per =

submission to the

symposium. The Ph.D. advisor is not stated as co-author but should be =

separately

mentioned as a footnote in the first page of the paper attached on the =

title of the paper.

Submitted papers will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program =

Committee

and will be evaluated on originality, overall quality of presentation, =

soundness and

technical correctness of the proposed method. The Doctoral Symposium =

Panel will

carry out the best research proposal award. The NLDB 2009 conference will

reimburse financially part of the participation costs for the recipient =

of the Award.

Submission Guidelines:

Authors should submit manuscripts in either PostScript or Portable Document

Format (PDF). Papers should not exceed 4 pages. Please also note: The

Doctoral Symposium Panel will carry out the best research proposal award
