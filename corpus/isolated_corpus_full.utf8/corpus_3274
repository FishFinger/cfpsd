CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on

<<  Corpus, Colligation, Register Variation  >>

31. Annual Meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f=FCr Sprachwissenschaft =

(DGfS)
Topic: Form and Function
Date: 4 =96 6 March 2009   ||   Venue: Universit=E4t Osnabr=FCck, Germany

Register variation, i.e. functional linguistic variation according to =

situational context, has been the subject of numerous studies addressing =

a wide spectrum of features deemed to be characteristic of specific =

registers. Many register studies focus on single or relative small sets =

of texts instead of being based on studies of larger corpora. This =

limits the possibilities of systematically evaluating register features =

in larger and more diverse sets of registers and, thus, the wider =

applicability of the results. Furthermore, most registers are not =

reliably characterized by features that are exclusively found in a =

single register, but rather by sets of lexical and grammatical features =

that are principally found in any text, albeit to varying extent. It has =

been shown that methodologies based on qualitative as well as =

quantitative corpus studies are well suited to the study of registers =

from different perspectives (e.g. synchronic, diachronic, comparative, =

cross-linguistic etc.). Advances in corpus-based methodology in =

combination with the increasing availability of corpora and tools for =

their annotation and analysis at different levels of linguistic =

organization make more extensive and systematic register studies =

feasible. In particular, they enable the investigation of a more diverse =

set of types and combinations of register features that require =

qualitative and quantitative corpus analyses.

The main interest of this workshop is the exploration of the =

methodological possibilities and limitations of present-day corpus-based =

register studies with a focus on lexico-grammatical and grammatical =

register features. Central issues are lexical co-occurrence patterns =

such as collocations and other types of multi-word expressions and =

lexico-grammatical patterns such as colligations which are postulated to =

characteristically co-occur in individual registers.

For this workshop, we invite papers on synchronic and diachronic =

register studies with a focus on the following topic areas:
   - lexical, grammatical and semantic analyses of colligation and =

collocation,
   - methods in exploring register features,
   - corpus compilation and annotation for register studies.
The focus of this workshop is going to be on methodology in corpus-based =

register studies, yet contributions on theoretical issues are also welcome.
