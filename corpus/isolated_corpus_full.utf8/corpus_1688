The newly created 

Master programme MA multi-LEARN - Learning & Development in Multilingual
and Multicultural Contexts 
(University of Luxembourg, starting September 2007) 

calls for the submission of expressions of interest in the field innovative
learning and teaching experiences. Please find below details on Call for
expression of interest in teaching within the MA multi-LEARN - Learning &
Development in Multilingual and Multicultural Contexts (University of
Luxembourg, starting September 2007)

CALL FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST

The MA multi-LEARN programme applies a dynamic vision of learning and
teaching; also, the programme aims at integrating recent developments and
findings from ongoing research projects in the relevant domain. Therefore
invited or collaboratively organized courses, seminars and workshops are
frequently set up and welcome. The MA multi-LEARN encourages the submission
of suggestions for teaching units and applied teaching-for-learning
research projects to be implemented on a one-semester (or longer / shorter)
basis. Proposals should be addressed to the scientific coordinators of the
relevant domain by
* stating the importance of the proposal as well as its thematic and/or
methodological connection to the domain;
* the main focus and methodological orientation of the seminar as well as
the added value of the proposed seminar or course;
* the data, items or fields of application to be used / analyzed;
* the organizational structure of the seminar (e.g., number of
participants, hours of contact studies, closed/open character of the
seminar, blocks, practical phases, guest lectures, learning e-platforms
used etc.)
* the language(s) to be used in teaching;
* nature of project or experience of the proposer-s with regard to the
proposal submitted (e.g., CV or relevant courses taught, institution)
* if applicable, information on potential / mandatory cooperation partners
in teaching and technical requirements as well as costs other than the
teaching staff involved.

The MA multi-LEARN programme explicitly invites young researchers (end of
doctoral phase, post-doc period and beyond) as well as innovative or
creative study projects and teaching experiences from all suitable (that
is, trans disciplinary perspectives) and international contexts (European &
non-European) to make use of this offer to send in proposals for seminars,
courses and applied research experiences. Remuneration is highly
competitive. The MA multi-LEARN provides excellent ground for yielding new
results in research and research methodology on learning, teaching and
development on the one hand and to challenge concepts of learning
environments and their development on the other hand.
