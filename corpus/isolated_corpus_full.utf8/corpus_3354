Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

The international conference, which is kindly sponsored by Fonds National de la
Recherche Luxembourg (FNR), takes place at the University of Luxembourg, campus
Walferdange December 10th -12th 2008. 

Call for Papers

DICA-lab within the Unit for Socio-Cultural Research on Learning and
Development, University of Luxembourg invites researchers and practitioners, who
focus on learning and development from social and activity-driven perspectives,
to submit abstracts to the international conference

''Methodologies and Practices for Approaching Learning as a Social Phenomenon
Inside and Outside of School''.
 
Since the 1990s, a growing amount of research has adopted socio-cultural and/or
interactional approaches to describe and analyze learning and development. These
approaches contrast previous research, which has been primarily (i) conducted
from a psychological/psycholinguistic approach, and (ii) focused on learning and
development as exclusively a matter for the individual('s mind). As opposed to
this view, more socially based studies argue that learning is intrinsically (i)
social in nature, (ii) situated in a particular local context, and (iii) does
not only occur in formal settings.

The conference focuses on formal as well as informal learning. Of particular
relevance is the inclusion of visual, or ''multimodal'', aspects of language,
and as such the conference will discuss benefits and challenges of including
multimodal and activity-bound aspects for the analysis of learning and development.
 
The following scholars will present keynote lectures:
- Gabriele Pallotti, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia
- Donald Carroll, Shikoku Gakuin University
- Pilar Lacasa, University of Alcal√°
- Catherine E. Brouwer, University of Southern Denmark

Thematically, papers and presentations should address one or more of the
following domains:
- Plurilingual learning in and through interaction
- Multimodal interaction as analytic tool for learning or multimodal learning?
- Education in plurilingual societies - social perspectives of development
- Classroom interaction - social interaction and multimodality
 
Theoretically and methodologically, the conference invites researchers from a
broader range of fields to participate. These are sociocultural research,
activity theory and an array of interactional approaches.
 
Two presentation/submission formats have been designed for allowing exchanges
and the discussion across frameworks: Paper sessions and round poster sessions,
bringing together genuine work from both theoretical and applied research
perspectives.
 
Abstracts for presentations (in English) will undergo a blind double peer-review
and should be sent to learning08@multi-learn.org by October 1st. Pre-submission,
consisting of name, affiliation and title of paper proposal, should be sent by
September 15th. Notification of accepted abstracts will be sent out shortly
after the submission deadline. Bilingual (including English as one
presentational mode) presentations are encouraged.
 
Scientific Committee:
- Charles Max, University of Luxembourg

The development of information network systems enables us to communicate 
with people in remote places ''anytime and anywhere'', enriching human
knowledge, affection and sensibility. However, there are various barriers which
stand in our way to using these systems freely and flexibly. In order to
discuss how to overcome these barriers and create a more human-centered 
communication environment, in 2007 the first International Symposium on
Universal Communication was held in Kyoto, Japan featuring discussions with
well-known researchers from around the world. 

Following its success, the second International Symposium on Universal
Communication will be held in Osaka, Japan.

Topics of interest are as follows, but not limited to:
- Information retrieval and information analysis
- Information credibility
- Knowledge processing
- Language resources
- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Machine translation and speech translation
- Natural language processing
- Spoken language processing
- Multilingual information processing
- Super high-resolution image technology
- 3D visualization, imaging and display technologies
- 3D sound processing
- Virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality
- Multisensory (visual, acoustic, haptic, olfactory, etc) interaction
- Human factors
- Human interface and interaction technologies
- Real-world sensing technologies
