September 22(Monday) - 24(Wednesday), 2008


#SCOPE#

ICGI-2008 is the ninth in a series of successful biennial international
conferences in the area of grammatical inference.

Grammatical inference has been extensively addressed by researchers in
information theory, automata theory, language acquisition, computational =

linguistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational learning =

theory and neural networks.

The conference will take place in the city of St Malo, a beautiful walled =

port =

city, on the Brittany coast of France, near Le Mont St Michel, with easy =

TGV access.

#AREAS OF INTEREST#

The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of =

original research papers on all aspects of grammatical inference =

including,
but not limited to:

   *  Different models of grammar induction: e.g., learning from examples,
learning using examples and queries, incremental versus non-incremental
learning, distribution-free models of learning, learning under various
distributional assumptions, learnability results, complexity results,
characterizations of representational and search biases of grammar
induction algorithms.

   *  Algorithms for induction of different classes of languages and
automata: e.g., regular, context-free, and context-sensitive languages,
interesting subclasses of the above under additional syntactic =

constraints,
tree and graph grammars, picture grammars, multidimensional grammars,
attributed grammars, parameterized models, etc.

   *  Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to
grammar induction including artificial neural networks, statistical
methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches, minimum
description length, complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic methods, =

etc.

   *  Broader perspectives on grammar induction, e.g. acquisition of
grammar in conjunction with language semantics, semantic constraints on
grammars, language acquisition by situated agents and robots, acquisition
of language constructs that describe objects and events in space and time,
developmental and evolutionary constraints on language acquisition,
statistical modelling of natural language, etc.


Historically the roots of grammatical inference have been in the modelling =

of =

first language acquisition by human infants: we especially invite =

submissions that address this theme, directly or indirectly. =



# LOCATION #
ICGI-2008 will be held in St Malo, France. =

The conference will take place in the Palais du Grand Large,
ideally located in front of the sea and near the old town.

# CONFERENCE FORMAT #
The conference will include plenary and invited talks, software
demonstrations and possibly poster presentations of accepted papers and
tutorials. All plenary and invited papers will appear in the conference
proceedings. =


The proceedings of ICGI-2008 will be published by
Springer-Verlag as a volume in their Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence, a subseries of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

# SUBMISSION OF PAPERS #
Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper which represents
original and previously unpublished work. Simultaneous submission to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. The paper should be
written in English with the following format.

 The cover page should
specify: submission to ICGI-2008, title, authors and affiliation, mailing
address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the contact author, a brief
abstract describing the work, at least three keywords which can specify
typically the contents of the work. Postscript versions of the papers
should not exceed 12 single spaced pages (excluding the cover page) on A4
or letter-size paper, and should be in single-column format using at least
1 inch margins and at least 11-point font. Submissions deviating
significantly from these guidelines will be rejected without review.
The technical exposition should be directed to a specialist and should
include an introduction understandable to a non specialist that describes
the problem studied and the results achieved, focusing on the important
ideas and their significance.

All paper submissions, review and notification of acceptance will be done
electronically through the conference's WWW pages =

(http://icgi08.irisa.fr).

# DEADLINES #
Submission of manuscripts: May 20, 2008
Notification of acceptance: June 20, 2008
Final version of manuscript: July 14, 2008
