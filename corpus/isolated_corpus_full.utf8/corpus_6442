Abstracts: 15 January 2010; Full papers: 15 April 2010


After the experience of organizing the 1st International Workshop on
Social Media, we've been organizing a special issue of the IJEC
(International Journal of Electronic Commerce) on Mining Social Media.
Now we release the CFP hoping to receive high quality papers on Mining
Social Media.


OVERVIEW
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Recently, Forrester published a report, =93The Future of the Social Web=94=

where they sketched a timeline of the development of the Social Web,
dividing its evolution in 5 eras. According to that report, the first
era of the development of the Social Web started to explode the social
relationships among users. Then, in the social functionality era,
these social relationships resulted in the social functionality era
where several websites started to add social functionalities in order
to help users to interact with their peers. We are now in the era of
Social Colonization, where technologies like Facebook Connect or
Google Friend Connect have standardized social functionalities among
websites and a vast majority of websites now include several social
functionalities. Soon these federated identities will empower people
to enter the era of social context with personalized and social
content, and the development of tools for personalize social content
will aim the development of the era of social commerce.

The primary goal of the proposed special issue of International
Journal of Electronic Commerce is to foster research in the interplay
between Social Media, Data Mining and Electronic Commerce, trying to
reflect the actual developments on technologies that fit on the Social
Context era.


SCOPE
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The International Journal of Electronic Commerce is the #1-ranked
journal on Electronic Commerce globally. This Special Issue will
provide a significant opportunity for authors to publish important
novel and original contributions in the area of Data Mining applied to
Social Media. The guest editors seek papers and proposals that address
various aspects of Mining Social Media, including recommender systems
for social media, data mining algorithms designed to explode Social
Networks, information management for Social Networks, etc.


RESEARCH QUESTIONS

to submit to this Special Issue. Papers may encompass any or all of
the following: foundational theoretical analyses, modelling,

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Manuscripts submitted to the special issue should contain original
material not published in nor submitted to other journals. Each
manuscript has to have a cover page with the author information and
another page with title and abstract but the author information
omitted. The review process is double-blind and papers which do not
meet publication quality standards will be rejected before the review
process.

Interested authors are required to submit extended abstracts of no
more than two pages for their planned submissions. This will give the
editorial team an opportunity to determine if a given submission is
appropriate for expedited handling and review.

Full papers should be sent via e-mail to Jose Carlos Cortizo
<josecarlos.cortizo@wipley.com> in anonymized PDF Format, not including
any author names or affiliations, and should not exceed 40 pages.
