Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; General Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

Second Language Research Forum (SLRF)
'Diverse contributions to SLA: Integrating the parts of a greater whole'.
October 29 - November 1, 2009

SLRF 2009 will be hosted by Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing, MI. 

Call for Papers

This annual conference aims to create a forum for the presentation and
discussion of research in second language acquisition from a variety of
subfields including, but not limited to: theoretical linguistics,
sociolinguistics, anthropology, cognitive science, psychology, and educational
science. 

SLRF 2009 asks how these varied methodologies and approaches compose a single
'field of SLA'. 

We solicit papers, posters, and colloquia that address this question and that
add to our understanding of SLA.

Plenary Speakers:
Dr. Robert DeKeyser, University of Maryland
Dr. Susan Gass, Michigan State University
Dr. Jim Lantolf, Penn State University
Dr. Bonnie Schwartz, University of Hawaii

SLRF 2009 offers two workshops and three colloquia (one invited and two
refereed). The invited colloquium will be organized by Dr. Shawn Loewen, MSU. We
invite submissions for the other two colloquia.

Invited Colloquium: Current Issues in Focus on Form
Although considerable research has been conducted on focus on form (FonF), there
still remain numerous unanswered questions. This colloquium will consider FonF
from the perspectives of current SLA theory, research methodology and pedagogy.
Areas to be addressed include the role of social context, the measurement of
constructs (e.g. noticing), the intensity and frequency of focus, and the target
of focus, inter alia. The goal of the colloquium will be to advance the research
agenda for FonF.

Conference Workshops:
'Conducting Research with Learner Corpora' with Dr. Thomas Cobb, 
University of Quebec at Montreal.

'Grant Acquisition Workshop' with Linda White, In-House Grant Writer for the MSU
Second Language Studies Program and Center for Language Education and Research
(CLEAR).

Submission Deadline: May 1, 2009  
Notification of Acceptance: July 1, 2009

Submission Guidelines:  
Proposals for papers, posters, and colloquia are welcome on all areas that
contribute to second language research, including:
- Formal approaches to SLA
- Socio-cultural approaches / CA / pragmatics
- CALL / CMC
- L2 psycholinguistics
- Classroom research and pedagogy
- L2 assessment and research methodology
- L2 phonetics and phonology

A first for SLRF, comprehensive syntheses, preferably in the form of
meta-analysis, are also invited in these areas.

Paper Presentations:  
Paper presentations will be 20 minutes long, followed by 10 minutes 
for discussion.

Poster Presentations:  
Posters will be on display each day between 9:15am - 4:30pm. Poster presenters
