Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

Human communication has always been a focus not only of linguistics, but also
experimental psychology. While traditional linguistic research based on
speakers' judgments will always be the fastest and most reliable way to develop
a general theory of the adult speaker, formal experimental research makes two
important contributions to linguistic theory: (i) populations other than
competent adults can be investigated and (ii) differentiated measurements can be
taken of competent adults and others. Therefore, linguistic and formal
experimental research are not separable, also in the area of semantics and
pragmatics. But only in recent years, a critical mass of researchers with deep
theoretical knowledge and access to experimental methods has emerged such that
one can speak of a field of Experimental Pragmatics. The field has grown and
will continue to grow because of the development and refinement of experimental
methods and new techniques based on technological advances. This conference
serves to keep researchers in the field abreast of current research and to
provide an overview of the field to linguists and psychologists not actively
involved yet. 

Experimental Pragmatics 2007 is a sequel to three very successful, independently
organized meetings in 2001 in Lyon, 2003 in Milan, and 2005 in Cambridge (UK).
However, it differs from these meetings by addressing more topics and connecting
also to results in semantics. The earlier successful meetings focused mostly on
implicatures in acquisition and polarity. The planned topics at this meeting
are: types, negation, implicatures and the semantics-pragmatics boundary. The
conference is planned around four three-hour sessions for each of the four
topics just mentioned. Each session will consist of two invited one-hour
lectures and a subsequent one-hour discussion on the topic. The discussion will
be introduced by an invited commentary of between 20 and 30 minute length and
then the discussion will be open to all participants. In addition to the four
thematic sessions, the conference will feature eight submitted presentations
each 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion, and a large number of poster
presentations. The submitted talks and poster presentations are selected on the
basis of a double-blind abstract evaluation process involving the invited
speakers. The reviewers take into account scientific quality of the abstract
(primary) and special interest for the four themes of the conference (secondary).

Invited speakers by thematic session: 

Evening lecture on language and cognition: Ted Gibson (MIT) 
Types: Martin Hackl (Pomona), Liina Pylkkänen (NYU), comments: Bart Geurts

Location: Marrakech, Morocco 
Contact Person: Helene Mazo

Meeting Description:

LREC 2008 - 6th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference

Main Conference: 28-29-30 May 2008
Workshops and Tutorials: 26-27 May and 31 May - 1 June 2008

The sixth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)
will be organised in 2008 by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of
international associations and organisations.

Palais des Congrès Mansour Eddahbi, Marrakech - Morocco

Conference web site: http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2008/ 

Conference Aims

In 10 years - the first LREC was held in Granada in 1998 - LREC has become the
major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human Language
Technologies (HLT). The aim of LREC is to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art, explore new R&D directions and emerging trends, exchange
information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies and
tools, ongoing and planned activities, industrial uses and needs, requirements
coming from the e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to
technological and organisational ones. 

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding agencies
from across a wide spectrum of areas to discuss problems and opportunities, find
new synergies and promote initiatives for international cooperation, in support
to investigations in language sciences, progress in language technologies and
development of corresponding products, services and applications, and standards.
 
Conference Topics

Issues in the design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs): text,
speech, multimodality
- Guidelines, standards, specifications, models and best practices for LRs
- Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation
- Methodologies and tools for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge
- Ontologies and knowledge representation
- Terminology 
- Integration between (multilingual) LRs, ontologies and Semantic Web technologies
- Metadata descriptions of LRs and metadata for semantic/content markup
Exploitation of LRs in different types of systems and applications 
- For: information extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, mobile
communication, machine translation, summarisation, web services, semantic
search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, etc.
- In different types of interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural
language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, voice activated services, etc.
- Communication with neighbouring fields of applications, e.g. e-government,
e-culture, e-health, e-participation, mobile applications, etc. 
- Industrial LRs requirements, user needs
Issues in Human Language Technologies evaluation
- HLT Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
- Validation, quality assurance, evaluation of LRs
- Benchmarking of systems and products
- Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces, interactions and dialog systems
- Usability and user satisfaction evaluation
General issues regarding LRs & Evaluation
- National and international activities and projects
- Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies
for LRs
- Open architectures 
- Organisational, economical and legal issues 

Special Highlights

LREC targets the integration of different types of LRs - spoken, written, and
other modalities - and of the respective communities. To this end, LREC
encourages submissions covering issues which are common to different types of
LRs and language technologies.

LRs are currently developed and deployed in a much wider range of applications
and domains. LREC 2008 recognises the need to encompass all those data that
interact with language resources in an attempt to model more complex human
processes and develop more complex systems, and encourages submissions on topics
such as:
- Multimodal and multimedia systems, for Human-Machine interfaces, Human-Human
interactions, and content processing
- Resources for modelling language-related cognitive processes, including emotions
- Interaction/Association of language and perception data, also for robotic systems

Programme

The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations, poster
and demo presentations, and panels. 
There is no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations. Only
the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less interactive) to
the content of the paper will be considered.

Submissions and Dates

Submitted abstracts of papers for oral and poster or demo presentations should
consist of about 1500-2000 words.
Submission of proposals for oral and poster/demo papers: 31 October 2007 

Proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials will be reviewed by the Programme
Committee.
- Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: 31 October 2007

Proceedings

The Proceedings on CD will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format.
In addition a Book of Abstracts will be printed.
