Full Title: Lingvisticae Investigationes 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 18-Jan-2008 

Call for papers.
Contributions are invited for a special issue on coordination to be
published under the title:
Semantic aspects of coordination


After several years when works on coordination were rather few and far
between, there has been renewed interest in this topic over the past few
years, more specifically in France (Haspelmath 2004, Godard/Abeillé 2005,
Carston/Blakemore Lingua 2005, Bril/Rebuschi 2006, Rousseau et al. 2007).
While in the works of the majority of our predecessors issues related to
the syntactic and typological aspects of coordination were primarily
addressed, in the present project the aim is to concentrate on and explore
the semantic aspects of coordination. A major characteristic of
coordination is the wide variety of elements that may be conjoined. It must
be underlined that except in the special issue of Lingua, in which the
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects of coordination are addressed,
most other papers are more or less limited to syntactic and typological
issues. Consequently it seems relevant now to try and provide an
explanatory account for the contrast between the combinatorial
potentialities of coordination and its semantic constraints. This is the
aim of our project, and we plan to submit 10 papers on this topic to the
journal Linguisticae Investigationes. Each paper will eventually be 15-20
pages long, in English or in French .
The important dates are: 
18th January 2008 : deadline for abstract submission (2 pages maximum).
15th February 2008 :notification of acceptance by the the project
coordinators .
13th June 2008: deadline for final submission of papers.
