Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organising Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY     
University of Technology, Mauritius     
5-7 January 2009      
http://www.SustainabilityConference.com/     

This Conference aims to develop a holistic view of sustainability, in which environmental, cultural and economic issues are inseparably interlinked. It will work in a multidisciplinary way, across diverse fields and taking varied perspectives in order to address the fundamentals of sustainability.

Plenary speakers include:     
* Tom Baum, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK     
* Davina Boyd, Murdoch University, Perth, Australia (2008 winner of the International Award for Excellence in the International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability)     
* Amareswar Galla, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia       
* Souad Halila, University of Tunis and Sousse, Tunisia     
* Charlie Hargroves and Cheryl Desha, The Natural Edge Project, Nathan, Australia

In addition, the Conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by practitioners, teachers and researchers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the Conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability. If you are unable to attend the Conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication, as well as access to the Journal.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is 13 November 2008. Future deadlines will be announced on the Conference website after this date. Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the Conference, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the Conference website - http://www.SustainabilityConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Mauritius in January 2009.

Yours Sincerely,

Gowtam Chintaram, Research Scholar     
Ramesh Durbarry, Associate Professor
