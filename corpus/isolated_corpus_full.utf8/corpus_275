10th INTERNATIONAL PRAGMATICS CONFERENCE
July 9-14, 2007
Göteborg, Sweden

Special theme: Language data, corpora, and computational pragmatics
[as always the conferences are open to all other relevant themes in pragmatics]

chaired by:  Karin AIJMER & Jens ALLWOOD (Göteborg)

other members of the local site committee:
- ELISABETH AHLSÉN (Göteborg)

Dear Colleagues,

We are proposing a panel on the theme of  ''Lexical Contrast in Discourse'' for the International Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg, Sweden in July 2007, and are thus interested in hearing from other people working on related topics who might be interested in presenting at this panel. The organisers of the panel have recently been researching the use of antonyms in discourse (in English and Swedish), but we define 'lexical contrast' broadly and would be interested in hearing about research related to:

        - functions of antonyms/lexical opposition in discourse
        - the contexts/constructions  that coerce opposite readings in word
        pairs(e.g. synonyms, hyponyms, incompatibles)
        - discourse properties of using morphological antonyms vs. lexical
        antonyms vs. syntactic negation
        - cross-linguistic/cross-cultural studies
        - methodological/technological innovations in studying contrast in
        discourse

If interested, please send a brief summary of the work you would want to present in such a panel tolynnem@sussex.ac.uk by the end of June 2006.

Best wishes,
Lynne Murphy, Carita Paradis, Steve Jones and Caroline Willners

Meeting Description:

A theme session at DGKL-06 (Meeting of the German Cognitive Linguistics
Association), Munich, Germany, 5-7 October 2006 

!!! NEW DEADLINE for abstracts submission: 31st May 2006 !!!

Work with empirical data is important, if not essential, to cognitive linguistics. Electronic corpora of written texts or transcriptions of speech are increasingly used and sometimes purposefully collected by linguists in their investigations of phenomena such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms, and frames. During their work, some linguists also compile - more or less private - electronic archives of phenomena studied in cognitive linguistics: searchable lists, classifications, databases. Moreover, they have to deal with these phenomena - usually in cooperation with computational linguists and computer scientists - when building general lexicon resources for the automatic treatment of language.

Problems that arise when working with corpora are connected to the way they are prepared for and processed by the corpus tools (concordancers, corpus managers). For example, in spite of some attempts in computational linguistics to detect metaphors in running texts, no corpus manager disposes of a ''Show all metaphors'' function. Rather, in order to search a corpus for metaphors, linguists will devise their own methods, be they theory-based or data-driven.

Other problems arise when creating project-specific as well as more general archives of language usage examples classified by cognitive linguistic criteria. Here, linguists decide which criteria they use in their classifications and which features of the archived data they annotate. These decisions are often made at a project-specific basis and therefore different classifications might be difficult to compare.

At a larger scale, this also applies to general linguistic resources developed for Human Language Technology applications. The decisions taken during linguistic resource-building may then be evaluated - by the resource developers or others -, based on large quantities of data encoded in the resources themselves. Evaluations of this kind are at the same time test-beds for theories put forth in cognitive linguistics, and their results provide valuable feedback for theory development.

In this theme session, we would like to discuss methods of exploiting electronic corpora for any cognitive linguistic research, not restricted to the phenomena mentioned above, as well as practical experiences with resource building in cognitive linguistics. We also invite contributions that evaluate the implications of data encoded in computational resources, from the viewpoint of cognitive linguistic theory.

Please send only detailed abstracts (2 pages), in which you make clear how your study is related to the topics indicated.

The deadline for abstract submission is 31st May 2006. Participants will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by 15th July 2006.

Please send your abstracts exclusively as email attachments (pdf- or rtf-files) to:
