Meeting Description:

Workshop 'Mood and Modality in Romance' within the scope of the 30th Deutscher
Romanistentag (Biannual Meeting of the German Society for Romance Studies),
University of Vienna, 23 Sep 2007 - 27 Sep 2007 

The concept of modality, originating from philosophy of language (cf. Wright
1951), has not only been very productive in the description of modal verbs and
particles in the Germanic languages (cf. Kratzer 1991, Fabricius-Hansen 2002),
but, as recent studies show, also in the analytic approach to the category of
'mood' (cf. Giorgi & Pianesi 1997, Quer 1998) and the 'modal use' of temporal
categories (cf. the contributions in Birkelund 2003) in Romance. 
In this research area, one can observe a tendency towards model formation (e.g.
Quer 1998, Giannakidou 1998) in the framework of formal modal semantics (cf.
Chierchia & McConnel-Ginnet 22000, Lohnstein 2000) as well as the endeavour to
establish a coherent formal language which looks promising for a homogeneous
description of linguistic (not only verbal) categories in general. However,
there is a great variety of theoretical and methodical approaches in a research
field where semantics, (morpho-) syntax and pragmatics overlap. It is,
therefore, an attractive issue to explore this field in search of an adequate
methodology which allows for the analysis of specific manifestations of mood and
modality. 
Our session intends to discuss syncronic and diacronic phenomena in the Romance
languages which are related to 'mood and modality'. Especially, the plurality of
approaches in the description and analysis of these issues will be taken into
account. Contributions to the following aspects/problems are planned:

- How do the modal systems of single Romance languages look like synchronically?
- On which diacronic background are these systems based? What are the convergent
and what the divergent patterns in the development of the categories mood and
modality from Latin to Romance?
- Which morphological peculiarities do the Romance languages have with respect
to mood and modality? Which explanatory approaches or theoretical models are
relevant here?
- How do the basic modalities, necessity and possibility, manifest themselves,
and about the derived ones (e.g. epistemic, volitional etc. modality)?
- How do mood and modality interact with the categories aspect and tense?
- Which role do mood (cf. also the so called 'sentence mood') and modality play
in the discussion referring to the interfaces between morphosyntax, semantics
and pragmatics?
- How do generative approaches treat mood and modality, cf. especially the
discussion on the left periphery and the split-CP-approach of Rizzi (1997),
which was mainly entertained on the basis of Romance data?
- What is the contribution of the Romance languages to the formal model of modal
semantics?

Bringing together different theoretical approaches and applying them to the
manifold variety of Romance data shall give us instructive results for research
in the field of mood and modality. Talks can be delivered in any Romance
language as well as in German or English. We plan to publish the conference
proceedings. Abstracts should include title of contribution, name(s),
affiliation(s) and e-mail address(es) of author(s) and must not exceed one page,
including references. Please submit your abstract as an e-mail attachment (both
word and pdf files) to the following two addresses: 
eva.remberger@uni-konstanz.de 
martin.becker@ling.uni-stuttgart.de

Deadline for abstract submission: 28 February 2007 

The workshop forms part of the XXX. Deutscher Romanistentag. All participants
are requested to register for the conference (online registration is possible
through the conference website http://www.romanistentag.de/040_anmeldung.htm).
Please note that in accordance with the DRV guidelines no speaker is allowed to
give a talk in more than one workshop during the conference.
