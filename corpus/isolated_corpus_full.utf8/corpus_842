			   NODALIDA 2007

	The 16th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics

                      SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

The Program Committee of the 16th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics 
(NODALIDA 2007), to be held in Tartu, Estonia, May 25-26, 2007. invites papers 
on substantial, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of language 
technology, including, but not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology, and morphology;
- speech recognition and speech synthesis;
- word segmentation, tagging, and chunking;
- syntax, semantics, and grammars;
- pragmatics, discourse, and dialogue;
- the lexicon and ontologies;
- parsing and grammatical formalisms;
- generation, text planning, and summarization;
- language modeling, spoken language recognition, and understanding;
- linguistic, psychological, and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, text categorization, question answering, and information 
  extraction;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- machine learning for natural language;
- multilingual processing, machine translation, and translation aids;
- multimodal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- language-oriented applications, tools, and resources;
- evaluation methodology.

REQUIREMENTS

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work 
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion 
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results 
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, 
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest 
to the attendees. Submissions presented at NODALIDA should mostly contain new 
material that has not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available 
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or 
workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain 
significant overlap with previously published work.

REVIEWING

Reviewing will be managed by the Program Committee and associated reviewers. The 
reviewing process will be double-blind and each submission will receive three 
independent reviews.

CATEGORIES OF PAPERS

Papers can be submitted to one of three categories: REGULAR PAPER, STUDENT PAPER 
and POSTER. Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time. 
The three categories have different requirements on authors, submission format 
and publication format:

REGULAR PAPERS are submitted as full papers (max 8 pages). If accepted, a 
regular paper is presented a single time during one of the parallel paper 
sessions at the conference and is published as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the 
conference proceedings.

STUDENT PAPERS are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). All authors of 
a student paper must be students (undergraduate or graduate). If accepted, a 
student paper is presented a single time during one of the parallel student paper 
sessions at the conference and is published either as an extended abstract (max 4 
pages) or as a full paper (max 8 pages) in the conference proceedings according 
to the authors' own choice.

POSTERS are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). If accepted, a poster 
is presented repeatedly to small groups of people at one of the conference poster 
sessions and is published either as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) or as a 
full paper (max 8 pages) in the conference proceedings according to the authors' 
own choice.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and must use 
either the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template that will be 
made available on the conference web site, courtesy of the Association for 
Computational Linguistics. Regular paper submissions should not exceed eight (8) 
pages, including references; student paper and poster submissions should not 
exceed four (4) pages. We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not 
conform to these styles, including font size restrictions. As reviewing will be 
blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and affiliations. 
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We 
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations 
such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to 
these requirements will be rejected without review. Submission will be 
electronic. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Regular 
papers must be submitted no later than January 19, 2007; student papers and 
posters must be submitted no later than February 9, 2007. Papers submitted 
after the deadlines will not be reviewed. Questions regarding the submission 
procedure should be directed to the Program Chair (nivre@msi.vxu.se).
