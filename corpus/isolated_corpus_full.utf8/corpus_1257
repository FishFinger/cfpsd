7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA'07)
   Plus GALA - Gathering of Life-like Agents
           17th - 19th September 2007
               Paris, France
           http://iva07.ntua.gr

           1st Call for Papers
*******************************************************************

SCOPE

Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are autonomous, graphically embodied 
agents in an interactive, 2D or 3D virtual environment. They are able to 
interact intelligently with the environment, other IVAs, and especially 
with human users.

The conference is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and 
practitioners in computer graphics, animation, computer games, virtual 
environments, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
cognitive modeling, human-computer interaction and artificial life. 
Since the first IVA back in 1999 firm lines of research have been 
established and there is much that the graphics and AI communities can 
learn from each other.

The domain of Intelligent Virtual Agents has become much more diverse 
and now encompasses a wide range of disciplines; cognitive and social 
psychology, communication models (conversational skills, interaction 
loops, conversational analysis), non-verbal communication, sociology 
(modeling human / IVA societies), HCI (intelligent user interfaces, 
gesture/body tracking interfaces), design and arts (e.g., interactive 
installations with IVAs), and numerous application domains.

While initial research often focused on the use of IVAs in virtual 
environments, they are now increasingly used in web-based interfaces, 
personal computing devices and interactive television. The rapid 
advances in the field have enabled it to be applied in both in research 
and industrial contexts. IVAs can provide appealing characters for games 
and entertainment. They can also be used in novel user interfaces or 
even as tools of psychological research.

IVA'07 will be a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and 
practitioners from academia and industry with an interest in the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of IVAs and IVA applications. We aim for 
a lively program of timely, high-quality presentations and 
demonstrations to discuss the state of the art and future of Intelligent 
Virtual Agents. Papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag LNAI 
(Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series.

This year, IVA'07 and ACII'07 (http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/acii2007/) are 
happening close to each other. While we do encourage submitting to both 
conferences we do highlight there are differences in topics of interest 
in each conference. We highly advise authors to read them carefully. 
Papers submitted to both conferences should be clearly different in 
their scope and topic.

IVA'07 will also host GALA - The Gathering of Life-like Agents - see
