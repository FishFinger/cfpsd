THE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES

January 23-24, 2009
Groningen, The Netherlands
http://www.let.rug.nl/tlt


FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS (EXTENDED DEADLINE)

The Seventh International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic
Theories will be held on January 23 to 24, 2009 in Groningen, the
Netherlands. Submissions are invited for papers, posters and
demonstrations presenting high quality, previously unpublished
research in the topics described below. Contributions should focus on
results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis
on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether
descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Papers and poster
abstracts will be published in paper as well as online proceedings.

WORKSHOP MOTIVATION AND AIMS

Treebanks are language resources that include annotations at levels of
linguistic structure beyond the word level. They typically provide
syntactic constituent or dependency structures for sentences and
sometimes functional and predicate-argument structures. Treebanks have
become crucially important for the development of data-driven
approaches to natural language processing, human language
technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in
general. There are a number of ongoing projects aiming at compiling
representative treebanks for specific languages. In addition, there
are projects that develop tools or explore annotation beyond syntactic
structure and beyond a single language.

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown
that there is a relation between formal linguistic theory and the
practice of syntactic annotation. Therefore the connection between
treebank development and linguistic theories and paradigms merits
attention.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. We encourage interested
potential participants to read the proceedings of the previous
workshops (see the web page for links).

WORKSHOP TOPICS

The workshop invites submissions that discuss relevant innovative work
in treebanking, including the relations and links between, and
possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic annotation; furthermore, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation
schemes, on the relation between linguistic theory and the practice of
annotation, and on applications of information in treebanks are
encouraged as well.
