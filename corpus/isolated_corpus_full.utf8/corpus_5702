Meeting Description:

The second bi-annual CASPSLP conference (the first was held in Minnesota in
2008) showcases approaches to and findings from the study of second language
phonology. The presentations will include a wide range of contexts, from
acquisition of Spanish phonology by English speakers to the acquisition of
Portuguese phonology by Spanish speakers; from classroom-based learning to full
immersion in the culture of the second language; and all other related topics.
By focusing on the breadth of approaches that scholars are taking to the study
of second language phonological acquisition in Spanish and Portuguese, this
conference aims to represent the state of-the-art in second language
phonological acquisition. 

Call for Papers:

Abstracts are invited for presentations on any topic related to the second
language acquisition of the Spanish and Portuguese sound systems, and the theme
is intended to be construed as broadly as possible. The aim is to include in the
conference a wide range of approaches to the study of second language phonology,
as well as a wide range of contexts, from acquisition of Spanish phonology by
English speakers to the acquisition of Portuguese phonology by Spanish speakers,
from classroom-based learning to full immersion in the culture of the second
language, to name just a few of the possibilities. 

Anonymous one-page abstracts (with a second page allowed for references and/or
examples) should be submitted to the website indicated below. Abstracts may be
submitted as Word or PDF documents. Please embed any special fonts. Each author
may submit at most one abstract as sole author and one jointly authored abstract.  

Submit abstracts to: http://linguistlist.org/confcustom/caspslp2010 

Abstract deadline: August 31, 2009
