Meeting Description

First Announcement 

The local organising committee is pleased to announce the Seventh International
Conference on Researching and Applying Metaphor (RaAM 7), to be held at the
University of Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain, from 29th to 31st May 2008. 
The biennial RaAM conferences aim to gather researchers interested in metaphor
and other figurative phenomena, such as metonymy, hyperbole or irony, as they
relate to 'real world' issues. Further aims are to encourage the development of
rigorous research methods in the study of metaphor in real-world contexts and to
foster interdisciplinary collaboration in this field of study. (For more
information about RaAM, its aims and previous events, visit the organisation's
website at http://raam.org.uk)

The theme of the Seventh International Conference on Researching and Applying
Metaphor is 'Metaphor in Cross-Cultural Communication'. A great deal of
attention has been paid to identifying and describing the metaphors used by
different social groups, in everyday and specific discourse contexts, and their
realisation in language or other modes. These descriptions show that although
certain metaphoric themes or 'conceptual' metaphors appear to be shared by
people from different parts of the world, linguistic metaphors may differ
greatly across languages. Furthermore, people of different cultural backgrounds
also vary considerably in the way they 'see' and express one thing in terms of
another, and the value they assign to such figurative reasoning or
understanding. RaAM 7 will focus on the effect such variation may have on
cross-cultural communication and intercultural dialogue.

Final Call for Papers

The seventh international conference on Researching and Applying Metaphor (RaAM
7) will be held at the University of Extremadura, Cáceres, Spain, from 29th to
31st May 2008. 
The biennial RaAM conferences aim to gather researchers interested in metaphor
and other figurative phenomena, such as metonymy, hyperbole or irony, as they
relate to 'real world' issues. Further aims are to encourage the development of
rigorous research methods in the study of metaphor in real-world contexts and to
foster interdisciplinary collaboration in this field of study. (For more
information about RaAM, its aims and previous events, visit the association's
website at http://raam.org.uk).

Submissions

The local organising committee invites submissions for 30-minute papers,
90-minute workshops and posters from researchers whose work contributes to our
understanding of the roles of metaphor in cross-cultural communication and how
this may be investigated. Proposals on other topics related to metaphor and
'real world' issues will also be welcome.
We also invite applications from PhD candidates whose on-going research is of
interest to the RaAM organisation to participate in the PhD workshop A special
feature of RaAM 7 is a PhD forum, and this workshop aims to serve as a platform
for on-going research and an opportunity for researchers new to the field to
receive feedback from experienced metaphor researchers.
