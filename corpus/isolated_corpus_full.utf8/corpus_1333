Multi-source Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization
      (http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/mmies.html)

                Workshop to be held in conjunction with


                          *** RANLP 2007 ***

                          Borovets - Bulgaria

                   http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2007/

                     *** 26th of September 2007 ***

                         First Call for Papers

Information extraction (IE) and text summarization (TS) are key
technologies aiming at extracting relevant information from texts and
other sources and presenting the information to the user in condensed
forms. Recent years have witnessed an explosion of information, making
IE and TS particularly important for the information society. These
technologies, however, face new challenges with the adoption of the
Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g. blogs, wikis) because of their inherent
multi-source nature. These technologies have to deal no longer with
isolated texts or single narratives but with large scale repositories,
or sources -- in one or many languages -- containing a multiplicity of
views, opinions, or commentaries on particular topics, entities or
events.  There is thus a need to adapt and/or develop new techniques
to deal with these new phenomena.

Recognising similar information across different sources and/or in
different languages is of paramount importance in this multi-source,
multi-lingual context, in particular the ability to detect paraphrases
in texts is relevant here.  In information extraction, merging
information from multiple sources can lead to increased accuracy
relative to extraction from single sources. In text summarization,
similar facts found across sources can inform sentence scoring
algorithms.  In question answering, the distribution of answers in
similar contexts can inform answer ranking components.  In occasions,
it is not the similarity of information that matters, but its
complementary nature.  In a multi-lingual context, information
extraction and text summarization can provide solutions for
cross-lingual access: key pieces of information can be extracted from
different texts in one or many languages, merged, and then conveyed in
many natural languages in concise forms.  It is therefore important
that the research community addresses the following issues:

** What       methods       are       appropriate      to       detect
similar/complementary/contradictory   information?   Are  hand-crafted
rules and knowledge-rich approaches convenient?

** What methods  are there to tackle  cross-document and cross-lingual
entity and event coreference?

** What machine learning approaches are most appropriate for this task
supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised?   What  type  of  corpora  is
required for training and testing?

** What techniques  are appropriate to produce  condensed synthesis of
the extracted information? What generation techniques are useful here?
What kind of techniques can be used to cross domains and languages?

** What tools  are there to  support multi-lingual/multi-source access
to  information?  What  solutions   are  there  beyond  full  document
translation to produce cross-lingual summaries?


The objective  of the  workshop is to  bring together  researchers and
practitioners  in the  areas of  extraction, summarization,  and other
information access  technologies to discuss recent  approaches to deal
with multi-source and multi-lingual challenges.

We welcome submission concerning  the following topics:

* Multi-source information extraction
* Cross-document Cross-lingual coreference
* Opinion mining and synthesis
* Multi-lingual  information extraction
* Cross-lingual Summarization
* Tools to support information fusion
* Paraphrase identification and generation
* Adaptable IE-based text generation


Important Dates:

Deadline for submission: *** June 15, 2007 ***
Notification of acceptance:  July 25, 2007
Camera-ready copy due:  August 31, 2007
Workshop: September 26,  2007


Submission guidelines:

Submissions  should be  A4, two-column  format and  should  not exceed
seven  pages, including  cover page,  figures, tables  and references.
Times New Roman 12 font is  preferred. The first page should state the
title  of the paper,  the author's  name(s), affiliation,  surface and
email address(es),  followed by keywords and an  abstract and continue
with  the first  section of  your  paper.  Guidelines   for   producing
camera-ready  versions will be available at the  conference  web  site.


Each paper  will be  reviewed by  up to three  members of  the program
committee.  Authors   of  accepted  papers   will  receive  guidelines
regarding  how to produce  camera-ready versions  of their  papers for
inclusion in the proceedings.
