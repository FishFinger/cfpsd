Meeting Description:

ABC, the Association for Business Communication, is an international
organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication
scholarship, research, education, and practice. ABC Europe was established in
November 1996 and has been organizing conventions on a regular basis. The 10th
edition is organized by Lessius University College.

GABC is a Tricontinental Rotating Conference series focusing on Global Advances
in Business Communication and Practices. GABC is affiliated with ABC and is
co-organized by the University of Antwerp, Eastern Michigan University and Macau
University of Science and Technology

Conference theme: Researching business communication - perspectives from
scholarship, education and practice 

Call for Papers

In recent years business communication has come of age as a field of scientific
inquiry in its own right. Written, oral and on-line interaction within and among
profit as well as non-profit organizations is now being studied from a wide
range of perspectives and using a great many different methods.

This convention is aimed at presenting a state-of-the-art survey of what the
field has accomplished so far and where it is heading. In particular, papers,
posters and panels are welcomed that present new research on business
communication or that address the question of how such scholarship is relevant
to education and practice, i.e. how business communication teachers and
professionals draw on research findings in going about their daily activities in
the field.

Contributions are welcomed on a wide spectrum of business settings, including
leadership and management situations, on gatekeeping encounters in a variety of
institutions and organizations and through a range of media and cultures, on
oral interaction in the workplace, on marketing and PR discourse, on on-line
communication, on management, organizational and corporate communication, on
global aspects of integrated marketing communications, etc.

Methodologically, the convention is open to wide-ranging efforts, including work
in discourse analysis and ethnomethodology, rhetoric and document design,
intercultural pragmatics and writing studies, genre analysis, e-semantics and
sociolinguistics. Studies from the perspective of marketing or management
research are also welcomed.

Papers
Submissions are invited for 30-minute slots (including 10 minutes of discussion
and question time). Please submit an abstract of 300 words. Add up to 5 keywords
and indicate whether the proposal should be included in the research, teaching
or practice sections of the convention. In case of a research paper, detail
research question, method, data and conclusions.
Deadline: 1 December 2009. Contributors will be informed of the decision by 15
January 2010.

Posters
Please submit an abstract of 300 words. Deadline: 1 December 2009. Contributors
will be informed of the decision by 15 January 2010.

Panels
Submissions are invited for thematic panels spanning one or more 90-minute
slots. Please submit an outline of 500 words. Indicate whether the proposal
should be included in the research, teaching or practice sections of the
convention. List any contributors that are anticipated to be involved in the
panel. Deadline: 15 October 2009. Panel convenors will be informed of the
decision by 1 November.

Please note that not all panels need to take the same form: some may emphasize
discussion while others may want to fit in more oral presentations. Panels
should include a min. of 4 contributions per 90-minute slot. Please note that,
after a panel has been accepted, all abstracts for panel contributions are to be
submitted before the 1 December deadline through the ABC-website (online
abstract submission will be available from June 2009 onwards - look at our
website for more details: http://www.lessius.eu/tt/nieuws/abc_callforpapers.aspx).

The convention language is English, but abstracts in other languages (such as
French, German or Spanish) will be considered as well.
