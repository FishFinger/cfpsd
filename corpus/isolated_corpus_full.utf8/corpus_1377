     FINAL  CALL   FOR   PAPERS   (Deadline Extension)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BSNLP 2007: Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing 2007
with Special Theme: Information Extraction and Enabling Technologies
ACL 2007  Workshop
Prague, Czech Republic, June 29 2007
http://langtech.jrc.it/bsnlp2007


SUMMARY:

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: extented to April 9
Notification of Acceptance: April 30
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.


TOPIC AND MOTIVATION:

The recent political and economic changes in Central and
Eastern Europe and the related on-going enlargement of the
European Union brings into focus new cultures and languages.
Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic group have
an outstanding role because of their rich cultural heritage
and the widespread use - over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavonic languages, with the
focus on Information Extraction (IE) and enabling technologies
for this language family. The task of IE is to identify a
predefined set of concepts from natural language text. The
spectrum of IE tasks ranges from named-entity recognition,
through relation extraction and co-reference resolution to the
identification of complex events and cross-document entity
profile extraction. Although a considerable amount of
IE-related work exists, most of the studies are concentrated
on a few major languages. Research on this topic, as well as
on general-purpose NLP tools in the context of Balto-Slavonic
languages, is still in its early stage and is progressing
relatively slowly. Due to some specific  phenomena like the
highly inflectional character and relatively free word order,
a construction of IE systems and other language processing
tools (question-answering, text summarization, machine
translation) for these languages is an intriguing and
challenging task.

This workshop can be seen as the follow-up to the successful
workshop on Information Extraction for Slavonic and Other
Central and Eastern European Languages
(http://lml.bas.bg/IESL2003) held in conjunction with the
RANLP 2003 conference. It is also related to the EACL 2003
workshop on Morphological Processing of Slavic Languages
(http://nl.ijs.si/mpsl03). In particular, we would strongly
encourage submissions describing systems, resources or
solutions that are made available to the wider public, as
these would help to promote computational linguistics
applications for these languages.

AREAS OF INTEREST include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP, in particular
in the context of IE and enabling technologies

- text segmentation
- morphological analysis
- morphology models
- morpho-syntactic disambiguation
- named-entity recognition
- named-entity disambiguation (e.g., geo-referencing)
- named-entity lemmatisation
- term and keyword extraction
- name variant recognition and merging
- syntactic parsing and chunking
- co-reference resolution
- word sense disambiguation
- corpus-based knowledge acquisition

B. Multilingual IE frameworks and techniques applied to these languages

- tools and resources (freely available for research purposes will be preferred)
- experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and processing resources
- comparative evaluation between languages

C. IE solutions for these languages:

- scenario template filling / event extraction
- relation extraction
- automatic pattern learning
- corpus studies and statistical techniques for IE
- IE from Web sources
- IE-based ontology population
- IE evaluation
- IE techniques for Question/Answering and Answer Extraction
- Utilisation of IE-based techniques in other NLP applications

INTENDED AUDIENCE

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages, in
particular on IE and core technologies supporting IE for these
languages. The workshop will give an opportunity to exchange
ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle problems in
this field of research, and to make available resources more
widely known.

SUBMISSION

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the
state of completion of the reported results. In particular, an
overlap with previously published work should be clearly
mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty,
technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL
2007 main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight
(8) pages, including references. We recommend to use either
the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word style file, which
can be found at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-citations and other references that could reveal the
author's identity should be avoided.

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no
later than April 9, 2006 using the submission webpage
http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007/submission
(or http://www.softconf.com/acl07/ACL07-WS12/submit.html).

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines
regarding how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers
for inclusion in the ACL workshop proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: extented to April 9
Notification of Acceptance: April 30
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.

LOCATION

Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is located in the
centre of Europe. It is one of the most valuable historical
city reserves in Europe. The historical core of the city is
listed in the UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage
Register. The workshop itself will take place in the TOP HOTEL
Praha, located in the quiet neighbourhood of the Prague 4
district, only 15-20 minutes from the historic centre of Prague.

Prague is easily reachable by car, bus or train from central
Europe (only 3-hour drive from Vienna or Budapest or 4 hours
from Berlin or Munich), by cheap flights from the rest of
Europe, and by several direct flights from overseas.
