CALL FOR PAPERS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
4th IEEE International Workshop on Engineering Semantic Agent Systems
(ESAS 2009), 20 July 2009 to 24 July 2009 Seattle, WA, USA.

Main theme of the workshop is Applying Semantic Technologies in
Research and Development of Ontology-Enabled Multi-Agent Systems.
Semantic Web technology topics are welcome.
Researchers and practitioners=A0 working on the following are especially
encouraged to submit papers: realization of multi-agent systems
through semantic web technology, ontology-based agent applications,
distributed control and processing applications, security & trust,
interoperability, service levels and quality issues in such systems.
Enterprises and research centers developing ontologies, languages,
integrated development environments, tools, and middleware. Other
relevant topics in semantic Web and multi-agent systems are welcome.
This one-day workshop will take place IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPSAC
2009.

The deadline has been extended to 31st March 2009 (final).

Original research papers will be considered. All submitted papers will
be reviewed by the large international program committee considering
originality, significance, correctness, presentation, and relevance.
We also encourage authors to present position papers on practical
studies and experiments, critiques of existing work, emerging issues,
and novel ideas under development.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the ESAS2009 Submission
Page (URL: http://rs.cs.iastate.edu/COMPSAC2009Workshops/ESAS2009/).
Manuscripts will be limited to six pages for regular/invited paper,
four pages for short paper, two pages for fast abstract and position
statement including all figures, tables, and references. Extra page
charges apply. The format of submitted papers must follow the IEEE
conference proceedings guidelines (i.e., 8.5" x 11", Two-Column Format
(PDF: instruct.pdf; DOC: instruct.doc); Layout Guide (PDF: format.pdf;
DOC: format.doc; all under
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/).

All accepted papers will be published in the electronic conference
proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society, indexed through INSPEC and
EI Index (Elsevier's Engineering Information Index), and automatically
included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. At least one of the
authors of each accepted paper must register as a full participant of
COMPSAC for the paper to be included in the proceedings. Each accepted
paper must be presented in person.

ESAS 2009 authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their
papers for publication in a special issue in an academic journal
(TBD). After the conference book project is being finalized with a
major scientific publisher.

The authors of ESAS 2008 and 2007 were invited to submit extended
versions of their papers for publication in the Special Issue on
Engineering Semantic Agent Systems of the Expert Systems: The Journal
of Knowledge Engineering by Blackwell Publishing
(http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=3D0266-4720). Paper selection
is being finalized for late 2009 publication. A special issue of the
best papers of ESAS 2006 has been published with the Multiagent and
Grid Systems - An International Journal, IOS Press, ISSN 1574-1702;
Volume 4, Number 3, 2008, pp: 293-346.
