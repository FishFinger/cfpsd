Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: 5 June 2009 

Motivation 
After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are happy to 
announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a standard means of 
integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as 
information retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which 
efficiency and robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and 
deep parsing, partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer than 
chunks but less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial 
parsing may involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking) 
without creating the full parse of a sentence. However, partial parsing is not 
a single concept but rather an area ranging from chunking to almost full 
parsing. This workshop will bring together researcher who work on partial 
parsing in its different interpretations. 

Scope 
The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted to): 
- Linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: syntactic 
and semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical structure, semantic 
information (anaphora, disambiguation); 
- Development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine learning, 
hybrid; 
- The usability of language resources for the development of partial parsers; 
- Multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.; 
- Experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers for 
new languages; 
- Technical aspects of partial parsers: robustness, scalability; time and space
 complexity; expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. context-
 free rules; unification; type hierarchies; etc.); 
- Applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question answering, 
machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical information, etc.; 
- Evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards, application-
specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different partial parsing 
tasks, etc.; 
- Ways of combining multiple partial parsers; 
- Comparison (classification) of partial parsers. 

Submissions 
Authors are invited to submit original research papers. Papers should indicate 
the state of completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap 
with previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be 
judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, 
and significance/relevance to the workshop. 

Submissions should be no longer than 7 pages typeset in an 10pt font. 
Guidelines are available at the RANLP 2009 web page: 
http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009. 

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system, at 
https://www.softconf.com/ranlp09/PaPa2009/.

Important Dates 
Submission deadline: 5 June 2009 
Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2009 
Camera-ready version due: 24 August 2009 
Workshop: 17 September 2009
