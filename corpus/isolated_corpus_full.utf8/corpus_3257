Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Psycholinguistics; Semantics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2008 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is part of the 31. annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS). We would like to address the question of what
strategies there are in natural languages to express comparison, how theses
strategies can be modeled, and how these strategies relate to the findings from
Cognitive Psychology. We are interested in semantic/pragmatic approaches as well
as contrastive/typological studies and, in particular, contributions from
Cognitive Psychology. 

Second Call for Papers

''Comparison constructions and similarity-based classification''

Workshop at the 31. annual meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS), 4- 6 March, 2009, Osnabrück

Classification of objects and situations can be expressed linguistically in two
basic ways, either by ascribing a (nominal or verbal etc.) predicate to the
object/ situation, or by comparing the object/ situation to some entity known to
the addressee. When ascribing a predicate classification is performed according
to the meaning of the predicate. In (1a), for example, we are told that Anna's
height is 1,80m. But when using a comparison construction the classifying
property has to be inferred from a similarity relation between the compared
entities and the relevant respect of similarity. Thus, in (1b) we only learn
that Anna and Marie are similar with respect to height and we have to infer
Anna's height from what we know about Marie. Likewise, in (2a) the property of
the student in question is explicitly mentioned while (2b) it has to be inferred
from what we know about Marie. 

(1) a. Anna ist 1,80m groß. 		  'Anna is 1,80 tall'
      b. Anna ist so groß wie Marie. 	'Anna is as tall as Marie'
(2) a. Uns fehlt eine kluge Mathestudentin im Seminar. 
         'We need a clever Math student in the seminar.'
      b. Uns fehlt eine Studentin wie Marie im Seminar. 
         'We need a student like Marie in the seminar.'

While the meaning of comparison constructions based on gradable adjectives has
been discussed in detail (e.g., Bierwisch 1986, Kennedy 1999), there are few
approaches addressing comparison constructions beyond the adjectival domain and
there is no general account of how similarity is exploited in natural language.
On the other hand, in Cognitive Psychology similarity-based classification is
regarded as a basic cognitive ability of human agents and has been studied at
length (cf. Hahn & Chater 1998). 

In the workshop, we would like to address the question of 
- what strategies there are in natural languages to express comparison, 
- how theses strategies can be modeled, and 
- how these strategies relate to the findings from Cognitive Psychology. 
We are interested in semantic/pragmatic approaches as well as
contrastive/typological studies and, in particular, contributions from Cognitive
Psychology.

Invited speakers:
Louise McNally (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona)
Ulrike Hahn (School of Psycholgy, Cardiff University)

addition to the invited talks. Abstracts should be anonymous and at most 2 pages
in length. Please send your abstracts electronically (pdf, ps, rtf) to
comparison 'at' cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de, and include your name, affiliation and
the title of the abstract in the body of the e-mail.

Deadline for abstract submission: July 31, 2008
Notification of acceptance: September 15, 2008
