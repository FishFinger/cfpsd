Full Title: International Journal of Translation 


Linguistic Field(s): Translation 

Call Deadline: 01-Apr-2007 

International Journal of Translation (IJT), published by Bahri Publications
since 1989, solicits papers on topics related to translation, including
manual, computer-aided, and automatic translation.

Topics

We plan to publish special issues of this journal on various relevant
topics. The nearest special issue is on multilingual lexical resources
(mainly oriented on automatic text processing and translation). Suggestions
for other topics are welcome for future issues.

Page Limit

Papers of any (reasonable) length are welcome, given that the quality
justifies the length.

Deadline

We plan to close the submissions for the nearest issue on April 1 at the
latest. However, we may close the issue as soon as we have enough good
papers. We strongly encourage expressing of interest if you do not yet have
your submission ready, for us to plan the nearest issue. The papers
received after the issue is closed may be scheduled for the next volumes to
be published later on this year.

Response Time

We aim at very short review and response time, within few weeks or faster.
We start reviewing each paper as soon as we receive it, and notify
acceptance as soon as we have the response from the reviewers -- i.e.,
without waiting for other papers.

Contact and Details

For contact information and details, see http://www.Gelbukh.com/IJT. Please
indicate 'International Journal of Translation (IJT)' in any email
communication.
