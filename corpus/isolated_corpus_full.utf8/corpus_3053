CONFERENCE THEMES
Since 1992, the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM) has successfully brought together leading researchers and
developers from the database, information retrieval, and knowledge
management communities. The purpose of the conference is to identify
challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and
information systems, and to shape future research directions through the
publication of high quality, applied and theoretical research findings.
In CIKM 2008, we will continue the tradition of promoting collaboration
among multiple areas. We encourage submissions of high quality papers on
all topics in the general areas of databases, information retrieval, and
knowledge management. Papers that bridge across these areas are of
special interest and will be considered for a "Best Interdisciplinary
Paper" award.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
CIKM 2008 topics are in the broad areas of Databases, Information
Retrieval, and Knowledge Management. CIKM 2008 also includes an Industry
track. Each area is organized into tracks:

Databases:
    * Access methods and indexing
    * Authorization, data privacy and security
    * Concurrency control and recovery
    * Data adaptability, reusability and quality
    * Database languages and models
    * Information integration, data provenance, probabilistic databases
    * Mobile databases and distributed data management
    * Peer-to-peer, parallel and distributed databases
    * Query processing, optimization and performance
    * Real-time and active databases
    * Scientific and biological databases
    * Semantic Web
    * Semi-structured data processing, XML filtering and routing
    * Stream-based processing and network databases
    * String Databases, Blogs and Social Search

    * Temporal, spatial and multimedia databases
    * User experience (Languages, Models, Interfaces)

Information Retrieval:
    * Citation Analysis, Social Networks for IR
    * Domain-specific IR (e.g., Legal IR, Genome, Mobile IR, IR for
      chemical structures)
    * Filtering (e.g., Routing, Collaborative filtering, Topic tracking,
      Recommender systems)
    * Foundation of Information Retrieval (e.g., Theory, Ranking)
    * IR Architectures, Scalability and Efficiency
    * IR Evaluation
    * Language Specific IR (Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual, NLP)

INDUSTRY DAY
As CIKM 2008 will be held in Napa Valley, just one hour to the north of
San Francisco, one of the goals of the conference is to embrace the
innovative spirit of the Bay Area/Silicon Valley in bridging further the
academic-commercial gap in the database, information retrieval, and
knowledge management communities. To help achieve this goal, we will
having an industry day (separate from the industry research track) where
luminaries, primarily from industry and from the VC (Venture Capital)
community, will provide insights on how DB/IR/KM technologies are/can be
leveraged to make a billion-dollar success. Confirmed speakers and
panelists include:
    * Andrei Z. Broder (Yahoo! Research, USA)
    * Steven Gary Blank (Stanford University, USA)
    * Christopher J. C. Burges (Microsoft Research, USA)
    * Doug Cutting (Yahoo!, USA)
    * Omar Hamoui (AdMob, USA)
    * Ronny Kohavi (Microsoft, USA)
    * Peter Norvig (Google, USA)
    * Peter Rip (Crosslink Capital, USA)
