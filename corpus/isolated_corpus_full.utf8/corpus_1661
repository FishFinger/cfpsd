Meeting Description

This conference focuses on the wide-ranging application of discourse analysis as
a methodology in a variety of disciplines, and on addressing issues of theory
raised by the practice of discourse analysis. The conference will include
workshop sessions focusing on different approaches to conducting discourse
analysis and the challenges that these raise. Is there a common core to all
discourse analysis? Where do approaches diverge or even become incompatible? By
bringing together the threads that are labelled discourse analysis we hope to
shed light on different research and theoretical aims and approaches. 

Call for Papers

The organisers invite submissions of abstracts for presentations at The New
Zealand Discourse Conference: the Challenge of Discourse Analysis, to be held
6th - 8th December, 2007 at the AUT University, Auckland, New Zealand, Institute
of Culture, Discourse & Communication.

Meeting Description:

Information extraction (IE) and text summarization (TS) are key technologies
aiming at extracting relevant information from texts and other sources and
presenting the information to the user in condensed forms. Recent years have
witnessed an explosion of information, making IE and TS particularly important
for the information society. These technologies, however, face new challenges
with the adoption of the Web 2.0 paradigm (e.g. blogs, wikis) because of their
inherent multi-source nature. These technologies have to deal no longer with
isolated texts or single narratives but with large scale repositories, or
sources -- in one or many languages -- containing a multiplicity of views,
opinions, or commentaries on particular topics, entities or events. There is
thus a need to adapt and/or develop new techniques to deal with these new phenomena.

Recognising similar information across different sources and/or in different
languages is of paramount importance in this multi-source, multi-lingual
context, in particular the ability to detect paraphrases in texts is relevant 
here. In information extraction, merging information from multiple sources can
lead to increased accuracy relative to extraction from single sources. In text
summarization, similar facts found across sources can inform sentence scoring
algorithms. In question answering, the distribution of answers in similar
contexts can inform answer ranking components. In occasions, it is not the
similarity of information that matters, but its complementary nature. In a
multi-lingual context, information extraction and text summarization can provide
solutions for cross-lingual access: key pieces of information can be extracted
from different texts in one or many languages, merged, and then conveyed in many
natural languages in concise forms. It is therefore important
that the research community addresses the following issues:

- What  methods are appropriate to detect similar/complementary/contradictory
information? Are hand-crafted rules and knowledge-rich approaches convenient?

- What methods are there to tackle cross-document and cross-lingual
entity and event coreference?

-What machine learning approaches are most appropriate for this task
supervised/unsupervised/semi-supervised? What type of corpora is required for
training and testing?

-What techniques are appropriate to produce condensed synthesis of the extracted
information? What generation techniques are useful here? What kind of techniques
can be used to cross domains and languages?

-What tools are there to support multi-lingual/multi-source access to
information?  What solutions are there beyond full document translation to
produce cross-lingual summaries?

The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
in the areas of extraction, summarization, and other information access
technologies to discuss recent approaches to deal with multi-source and
multi-lingual challenges.
