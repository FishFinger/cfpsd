	***** 2ND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION *****

EACL 2009 Workshop
GEMS : GEometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics

March 31, 2009

Athens, Greece
Megaron Athens International Conference Center Room MC.3

URL : http://art.uniroma2.it/gems/


*****
Distributional models and semantic spaces represent a core topic in
contemporary computational linguistics for their impact on advanced tasks a=
nd
on other knowledge fields (such as social science and the humanities).

The goal of the GEMS workshop is to further stimulate research on semantic
spaces  and distributional methods for NLP, by adopting an interdisciplinary
approach to allow a proper exchange of ideas, results and resources among
often independent  communities. In particular, the workshop will provide a
common ground for a fruitful discussion among experts of distributional
approaches, collocational corpus analysis and machine learning; researchers
interested in the use of statistical models in NLP applications (e.g. quest=
ion
answering, summarization and textual entailment) and in other fields of
science; and experts in formal computational semantics.

The workshop aims at gathering contemporary contributions to large scale
problems in meaning representation, acquisition and use, based on
distributional and vector space models. The workshop aims also to shed new
light on the use of such  techniques  on complex linguistic tasks, such as
linguistic knowledge acquisition, semantic role labeling, textual entailment
recognition, question answering, document understanding/summarization and
ontology learning.
