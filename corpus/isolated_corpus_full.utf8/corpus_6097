Call Deadline: 01-Dec-2009 

The Reading Matrix: 
An International Online Journal

Invites Proposals for a Special Issue:

Voices From the Margins: 
Second Language Acquisition Research in Periphery Communities

Guest edited by Adrian Wurr & Suresh Canagarajah

The Reading Matrix: An International Online Journal invites submissions of
previously unpublished manuscripts on any topic related to Second Language
Acquisition Research and Teaching from under-represented regions. Possible
topics may include, but are not limited to:

- Case Studies of SLA Scholarship in Periphery Communities
- Access & Equity in SLA Scholarship
- The Promise and Perils of Crossing The Digital Divide
- Monolingual Scholarship in a Multilingual World
- Peripheral Discourses - Linguistic Resources and Resistance
- Language Revitalization Efforts in First People Nations
- Language Acquisition in the Contact Zones
- Strategies of Multilingual Acquisition
- Beyond the Body and the Mind, Society and Cognition, in SLA

We welcome both practical and research focused articles (including action
research). Articles should have a clear focus and be written so that they
are accessible to a broad audience of reading and language educators,
including those individuals who may not be familiar with the particular
subject matter addressed in the article. Articles should report on original
research or present an original framework that links previous research,
educational theory, and teaching practices. 

The Reading Matrix: An International Online Journal encourages submissions
that take advantage of the hypertext and multimedia possibilities afforded
by our World Wide Web publication format. To this end, we gladly accept
articles with graphics, sound, and hyperlinks submitted as HTML documents.
More detailed submission guidelines are available online at:
http://www.readingmatrix.com/submission.html. 

Queries and a one-page abstract from prospective authors should be sent to
Adrian Wurr (ajwurr@uidaho.edu) by December 1, 2009. Complete manuscripts
(7500 words in length in APA format) of accepted proposals will be due
March 15, 2010.

Send all submissions electronically to: ajwurr@uidaho.edu
