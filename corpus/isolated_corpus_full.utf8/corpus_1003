 Inaugural Workshop on Computational Japanese Studies: Call for Presentations

			      March 15-16, 2007

				 Kanto, Japan

	      http://www.ish.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/coJaS/index.html



		*** Submission deadline: FEBRUARY 15, 2007 ***




INTRODUCTION

The Inaugural Workshop on Computational Japanese Studies is a broad gathering
of researchers with interests in the applications of computer technology to
Japanese Studies, i.e. the Japanese language, culture, history and/or
literature. Presentations are sought in a wide variety of related areas,
including:

 * Human computer interfaces
 * Computer-assisted language learning
 * Computer-assisted applied and theoretical linguistics
 * Lexicography and dictionary interfaces
 * Computers and translation



CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

Outline:

There are many researchers interested in the applications of computer
technology to Japanese studies throughout the world, but there is no common
forum for these researchers to come together. As a result, there is a lack of
research dialogue between sites, and only small numbers of papers are
published on the topic, in diverse forums. In order to promote further
collaboration and the exchange of ideas, we invite interested participants to
present their research to an open audience of like-minded colleagues, in a
small scale, informal workshop specifically focusing on this area.

We also welcome participants who aren't directly involved with computational
Japanese studies, but whose interests overlap with those of the workshop,
e.g. computational Chinese or Korean studies.

The workshop will consist of a series of general presentations on recent
research in the broad area of Japanese studies and technology.  


Venue:

The workshop will be held in the Kanto (greater Tokyo) area of Japan. The
final location of the workshop will be announced closer to the date of the
workshop.


Submission Details:

Interested participants should e-mail a 2-page PDF abstract of their proposed
presentation to Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii (kumiko@i.u-tokyo.ac.jp) by February 15,
2007.


Important Dates:

Deadline for abstract submissions:           February 15, 2007
Workshop on Computational Japanese Studies:  March 15-16, 2007
