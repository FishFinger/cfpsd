Workshop Description

Human judgements play a key role in the development and the assessment
of linguistic resources and methods in Computational Linguistics. They
are commonly used in the creation of lexical resources and corpus
annotation, and also in the evaluation of automatic approaches to
linguistic tasks. Furthermore, systematically collected human
judgements provide clues for research on linguistic issues that
underlie the judgement task, providing insights complementary to
introspective analysis or evidence gathered from corpora.

We invite papers about experiments that collect human judgements for
Computational Linguistic purposes, with a particular focus on
linguistic tasks that are controversial from a theoretical point of
view (e.g., some coding tasks having to do with semantics or
pragmatics). Such experimental tasks are usually difficult to design
and interpret, and they typically result in mediocre inter-rater
reliability. We seek both broad methodological papers discussing these
issues, and specific case studies.

Topic of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Experimental design:
  - Which types of experiments support the collection of human
    judgements? Can any general guidelines be defined? Is there a
    preference between lab-based experiments and web-based
    experiments?
  - Which experimental methodologies support controversial tasks? For
    instance, does underspecification help? What is the role of
    ambiguity and polysemy in these tasks?
  - What is the appropriate level of granularity for the category
    labels?
  - What kind of participants should be used (e.g., expert
    vs. non-expert), how is it affected by the type of experiment, and
    how should the experiment design be varied according to this
    issue?
  - How much and which kind of information (examples, context, etc.)
    should be provided to the experiment participants? When does
    information turn into a bias?
  - Is it possible to design experiments that are useful for both
    computational linguistics and psycholinguistics? What do the two
    research areas have in common? What are the differences?

* Analysis and interpretation of experimental data:
  - How important is inter-annotator agreement in human judgement
    collection experiments? How is it best measured for complex tasks?
  - What other quantitative tools are useful for analysing human
    judgement collection experiments?
  - What qualitative methods are useful for analysing human judgement
    collection experiments? Which questions should be asked? Is it
    possible to formulate general guidelines?
  - How is the analysis similar to psycholinguistic analysis? How is
    it different?
  - How do results from all of the methods above affect the
    development of annotation instructions and procedures?

* Application of experiment insights:
  - How do the experimental data fit into the general
    resource-creating process?
  - How to modify the set of labels and the criteria or guidelines for
    the annotation task according to the experimental results? How to
    avoid circularity in this process?
  - How can the data be used to refine or modify existing theoretical
    proposals?
  - More generally, under what conditions can the obtained judgements
    be applied to research questions?
