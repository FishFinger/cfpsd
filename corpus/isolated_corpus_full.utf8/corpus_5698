INTRODUCTION
Daniel Schreier's book attempts to describe the genesis of the variety of
English spoken on the tiny South Atlantic island of St Helena (StHE). The v=
olume
is, one needs to stress from the outset, the first monograph on this
lesser-studied variety of English and is breaking new ground. Together with=
 the
author's 2003 volume on Tristan da Cunha English, it is the second in-depth
description of a South Atlantic insular variety of English. The principal g=
oals
are to ''go beyond a simple and straightforward description of a hitherto
neglected post-colonial variety of English'' and to ''provide a detailed an=
alysis
of the historical development and the phonological and the morphosyntactic
features of StHE'' (8). As such, the work is a sociohistorical analysis of =
StHE,
which uses the present to explain the past by applying a well-tested method=
ology
- with some new facets - to the variety.

SUMMARY
The study is comprised principally of three distinct parts, the first part
focusing on basic concepts of language contact and contact linguistics (cha=
pter
2, chapter 1 being a short introduction), the second part being an external
language history of the island (chapter 3), while the final part presents t=
he
linguistic evidence, which is split in a historical (chapter 4) and a synch=
ronic
section (chapters 5 and 6). The strands are woven together in a conclusion
(chapter 7), which is complemented by appendices, passenger lists, facsimil=
e
document excerpts, and - most importantly - feature lists of StHE and how t=
hey
relate in frequency, roughly, to other varieties. Kortmann, Schneider et al=
.
(2004) serve as the benchmark for these comparisons.

One of the most important questions is the dating of StHE: when did its
formation begin? While St Helena was first discovered in 1502 by the Portug=
uese,
it was permanently settled only in the late 1650s by the English East India
Company (EIC), which had to find a port of call for their vessels in the ar=
ea.
Schreier takes great care in assembling historical materials, most of them =
from
the island's Jamestown Castle Archives, and in interpreting the settlement
history of the island. He is able to show that in the latter half of the 17=
th
century extreme in- and out-migration contact processes to take shape and s=
hows,
convincingly, that StHE should be dated back to the early 18th century, whe=
n the
population was steady to a minimal, yet to a sufficient degree that it prov=
ided
some continuity from one year to the other and from one generation to the n=
ext.
This start date is in line with some phonological innovations from the earl=
y
18th century and there ''is little doubt that, sociolinguistically speaking=
, StHE
is younger than it appears'' (p. 225).=20

Schreier takes great pains at disentangling the various input languages and
dialects on StHE that formed the feature pool. The slaves on the island wer=
e an
important group, coming from a ''dozen different locations , including west=
ern
India, disparate places in West Africa and, most importantly, in Schreier's
assessment, Madagascar (p. 97). While evidence is scarce, the earliest slav=
es
most likely spoke a Portuguese-based pidgin or creole. One of the most
enlightening language-external points is the disentangling of white and bla=
ck
settler groups in the population increases from the 1660s to the 1820s,
culminating in a numerical assessment in figure 3.1, showing that from the =
1720s
onwards, and thus from the start of the formation of the variety proper, th=
e
black population, mostly consisting of slaves (and very few free blacks),
outnumbered the white populace.

The sociodemographic situation on St Helena, however, was drastically diffe=
rent
from that on large-scale multilingual plantation scenarios, such as in the
American South. Great effort is made to show that the slaves were owned by =
a
handful of slave owners and that most owners did not arrange for separate
housing of their slaves so that ''[w]hites and blacks must have lived under=
 the
same roof and maybe even took their meals at the same table'' (p. 112), whi=
ch
suggests relatively close ties between the two ethnic groups. The situation=
 on
the island seems to have given rise to a less cruel scenario for the slaves=
 than
elsewhere, as some slave children were given education and that mixed
relationships, between whites and blacks, began as early as the 1730s, lead=
ing
to ethnic mixing on St Helena that ''would have favoured sociolinguistic mi=
xing
also'' (p. 116). This, in turn, made English a lingua franca not just betwe=
en
whites and blacks, but also ''among the slaves themselves'', which does not
preclude prior pidginization when around 1720 ''shiploads of slaves arrived=
 from
Madagascar'' to make possible big development projects on the island (p. 15=
1-2).
For the white settlers, a family name-based approach for the identification=
 of
their origins is used in a systematic manner and assesses the situation,
suggesting that the core of the British founders ''most likely originated a=
nd
hailed from the South of England'', the evidence for their working-class or=
igins
is more indirect, yet still considered ''strong'' (p. 97).=20

In the assessment and evaluation of early records of StHE, Schreier takes a
qualitative approach. Drawing from various sources, most importantly extrac=
ts of
the St Helena Records, which includes verbatim speech reports, court cases =
and
testimonies and is complemented by newspapers and early short stories, Schr=
eier
presents exemplarily features that may provide evidence for the vernacular.=
 A
useful summary is provided in table format for phonological features (table
4.1), with the earliest features dating from the mid-19th century and for
morphosyntactic features (table 4.2), going back to 1679.

The sociolinguistic, synchronic part of the study draws from 33 recorded
speakers, 20 of whom served as the sub-sample for the analysis. The informa=
nts,
all of whom were born on the island between 1911 and 1940, were raised ther=
e and
never left for long stretches of time, were selected by gender and their pl=
ace
of residence on the island. The latter is part of an attempt to describe
regional variation on the island, which, due to distinct topographical feat=
ures,
seems plausible. The regional analysis, is, perhaps, somewhat beyond the
immediate scope of the study, and does therefore not show significant
differences between regions, while an urban (Jamestown) - rural split is
detected (p. 221).

In the phonological analysis, using Wells' (1982) lexical sets for vowels,
Schreier attempts to qualitatively characterize StHE by using not one, but =
four
speakers, listing IPA symbols in narrow transcription for their vowel
phonologies (DRESS, KIT, GOOSE etc.) as benchmarks ''to facilitate
cross-comparison of varieties'' (p. 159) that are compatible with Schneider=
,
Kortmann et al. (2004).=20

Two phenomena, one phonological, the other syntactic, are studied in a stri=
ctly
quantitative variationist paradigm with data from 14 StHE speakers: these a=
re
Consonant Cluster Reduction (CCR) and copula absence (CA), which are both
classic variables in the concert of World Englishes, African American Verna=
cular
English, and Pidgin and Creole studies, and are an especially apt choice. C=
CR,
for which there is evidence that it is not transmitted via contact between
systems, is extremely frequent in StHE (almost 87%) and is more common in t=
he
outlying areas than in the urban centre Jamestown. It is claimed to be an
''extremely diagnostic'' (p. 212) feature for the typological status of StH=
E.
Likewise, CA is a prominent feature at a ratio of 3:1 for absence:presence =
of
the copula, and shows ''resemblances with varieties shaped in conditions of
extensive language contact: [African American English]'' (p. 220).
Distributionally, _am_ copulas occur less often than _are_ and _is_, which
suggests a typological classification of StHE in line with English-based Cr=
eoles
of the Caribbean (p. 220).

The conclusion section of the volume pursues two more focused linguistic go=
als,
which are to summarize the formation of StHE and provide answers to the
typological status of the variety, somewhere between the poles of Inner Cir=
cle
Englishes and Creoles. The bulk of the monograph is clearly geared towards
answering the former question, and Schreier's conclusion posits three phase=
s of
formation as a result (p. 231-2): 1) a founding phase (from 1658-1720s),
characterized by extreme social fluctuation and mixing; 2) a consolidation =
phase
(1720s to 1770s), with population stability and beginning sociolinguistic n=
orm
development; and 3) a focusing phase (1770s-c1850), with the completion of
language shift and the start of an endonormative StHE. It is important to p=
oint
out in this context that these three stages are exclusively derived from th=
e
language external history and that no linguistic claims are made on the bas=
is of
this trichotomy.=20

In contrast, the claims that are based on the present-day sociolinguistic d=
ata
are made not so much on the formation of the variety, but on the typologica=
l
status of the variety. Extremely high frequencies CCR in a very unusual
distribution (shared only with Jamaican Creole English) - together with the
pervasive nature of CA - are taken as strong indicators that StHE is a creo=
le,
leading to the book's strongest claim: ''it is not exaggerated to say that =
StHE
is an English-based Creole after all'' (p. 246). The assessment is founded =
on CCR
for the most part, proffered by zero copula occurrence and an interesting
comparison of creole features adapted from Baker and Huber (2001), which
supports this interpretation.=20

EVALUATION
It needs to be pointed out that about half of the 84 creole features attest=
ed in
StHE come from judgments from a local writer, Basil George (p. 238-40), and=
 were
not found in the data as such. Taking out George's information would
considerably change the ranking of StHE in the list of creoles (Table 7.4) =
and
weaken the argument. In this light the volume is somewhat skewed, as the mo=
st
interesting, quantitative aspect of the status of StHE was given perhaps le=
ss
space in the overall picture than it deserves.=20

On the other hand, as a trail-blazing publication on StHE, the monograph
contains a wealth of information on the language external history and offer=
s
many a springboard towards further study. Be it the identification of
phonological/phonetic areas, such as a quite unique overlap of the START an=
d
CLOTH vowels on the one hand and the merger of the THOUGHT, FORE, NORTH and=
 POOR
vowels on the other hand (p. 245), or simply the list of features provided:=
 the
author's familiarity with features of World Englishes and his in-depth
familiarity with the literature on contact linguistics and related areas sh=
ine
through on every page and make for many insightful moments.

The analytical choice of presenting data from four speakers in the phonolog=
y
section appears logical, given time and space constraints, and provides som=
e
idea of variation in the pre-WWII generation that the synchronic chapters f=
ocus
on. The author, rightly, acknowledges the ''risk of over-generalization'' (=
p.
166), as the four speakers were selected for no objective reasons, and only
further study will be able to reveal any bias in the sample. Perhaps the mo=
st
general goal of the volume was too ambitious, aiming ''to combine general a=
nd
variationist viewpoints into a coherent analysis'' and ''[i]deally [...] pr=
ovide
both an accurate descriptive profile of the variety and at the same time
investigate variation within individuals and across speaker groups'' (p. 16=
0).
Schreier succeeds admirably in many areas, but it seems impossible to do fu=
ll
justice to these overarching sociohistorical themes and connections between
language external history and linguistic data, for which it is notoriously
difficult to establish causal links for, or links at all.=20

The discussion on the principles of contact linguistics in chapter 2, expan=
ded
from Schreier (2003), is highly informative and insightful. This chapter ca=
n be
used as an introductory text in advanced classes for its discussion of the
differences between koineization, new-dialect formation and creolization. I=
n
line with a hotly debated issue, the theoretically most contested aspect is
Schreier's apparent scepticism towards partially automatic, predictable out=
comes
in new-dialect formation, which reflects a recent discussion in the field
(Trudgill 2008). The author states clearly his point of view that ''the sel=
ection
and evolution of structural properties [in contact varieties] reflects not =
only
the properties and proportions of the input varieties (though they are cert=
ainly
essential) but also the social characteristics of the community'', which, i=
n its
generality, is uncontroversial (p. 54)''. While Schreier considers Schneide=
r
(2007) as ''almost an antithesis to Trudgill's (2004) model of new-dialect
formation'' (p. 65), a view I do not agree with, there remains a lot of roo=
m for
integrating these two approaches - the former as a very general model, the
latter as a very focused, temporally limited process in certain settings. T=
his
synthesis was not the focus of the book. It is important to add, however, t=
hat
the volume does not produce data that would contradict theories that operat=
e
without notions of identity and prestige for part of the new-dialect format=
ion
process (Trudgill 2004).

As for Schreier's phonological analysis, it is an honorable goal that
demonstrates the adoption of qualitative methods in the author's research f=
ocus
and a methodological enrichment of the strict quantitative approach taken i=
n
Schreier (2003). Some could argue, however, that it provides a departure fr=
om a
time-tested quantitative paradigm, especially since the quantitative part
comprises less than 20 of the 250 text pages. The phonological overview wil=
l,
doubtless, prove beneficial in the bigger picture, but in the present volum=
e the
reader will find little on the interpretation of a given feature, turning s=
ome
sections into a reference guide on the variety in this respect.=20

This qualitative approach, however, allows the general characterization of
features, which can be illustrated for morphosyntax; for instance, some fea=
tures
of StHE pronoun use or the ''unusual adverbial mussy'' (probably a reductio=
n of
'must be', as in example (97) on p. 186, ''Rock Rose - mussy the only build=
ing
there now'') are certainly of interest for comparisons with other varieties=
. In
the former case just enough context is provided to offer a baseline for
comparison, which, however, the four examples of mussy, an interesting vari=
ant
in itself, do not allow. It is hoped that the author will find ways to shar=
e the
materials, of which too much for analysis was found (p. 164), perhaps as
advocated in Kretzschmar et al. (2006).


All in all, Schreier's book is both an inspiring sociolinguistic history an=
d an
effective case study that stimulates reflection on sociohistorical
methodologies. It is inspiring in the sense that Schreier, just as was the =
case
with his previous case study on Tristan da Cunha, ''was not familiar with [=
the
island] and its inhabitants prior to my fieldwork'' (2003: 73), offers the =
most
comprehensive account of this under-studied variety of English as the resul=
ts of
nine weeks of fieldwork (p. 161). Implicitly, the volume provokes reflectio=
ns on
the role of the fieldworker: does the fieldworker really need to be intimat=
ely
familiar with the community, or preferably even a local, for this line of w=
ork?
(Feagin 2002, Chambers 2009: 43). Schreier takes an approach not unlike an
anthropological linguist, by going into the field and taking in as much as
possible in a limited time frame. Until we have studies carried out by a St
Helenian local we will not know the extent of the outsider's effect on the =
data,
if there is any at all. For now, we have pioneering study, bursting with de=
tails
and informative insights, which makes a substantial addition to the field o=
f
contact linguistics, variationist linguistics and sociohistorical linguisti=
cs in
general, and the study of World Englishes, Late Modern Englishes, and
Postcolonial Englishes in particular. It seems to be clear that Schreier is
poised to become the expert on small insular varieties of English. To which
little island will his next project take him?
