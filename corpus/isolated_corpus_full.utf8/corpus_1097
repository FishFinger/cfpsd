Journal of Applied Ontology: An Interdisciplinary Journal of
Ontological Analysis and Conceptual Modeling

http://www.applied-ontology.org/
IOS Press (Editors-in-Chief: Nicola Guarino and Mark A. Musen)

Special Issue on

**** ONTOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR CONCEPTUAL MODELING ****

Expected publication: Winter 2007
Submission Deadline: March 1st, 2007

GUEST EDITORS OF SPECIAL ISSUE
===========================================

- Giancarlo Guizzardi, Computer Science Department, UFES, Brazil &
  Laboratory for Applied Ontology (ISTC-CNR), Trento, Italy

- Terry Halpin, Neumont University, South Jordan, Utah, USA

OBJECTIVES OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE
===========================================

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role played
by formal ontology, and more generally, by areas such as philosophy,
logics, cognitive sciences and linguistics in the development of
theoretical foundations for conceptual modeling in computer
science. As it has been shown in a large number of recent
publications, so-called foundational ontologies such as BWW, GFO,
DOLCE, UFO, BFO, and Chisholm's have been successfully applied to the
evaluation of conceptual modeling languages and frameworks (e.g., UML,
ORM, ER) and to the development of engineering tools (e.g.,
methodological guidelines, modeling profiles, design patterns) that
contribute to the theory and practice of conceptual modelling.

The purpose of this special issue is to collect innovative and
high-quality research contributions regarding the role played by the
aforementioned areas to the theoretical foundations of conceptual
modeling.

This issue should be of interest of several academic communities,
including those working on database design, requirements engineering,
knowledge engineering, enterprise modeling, agent and object
orientation, information systems, software engineering (in particular
domain engineering), natural-language processing, business rules and
model-driven architectures.

We thus solicit contributions in several areas related to Ontological
Foundations for Conceptual Modeling. Topics of interest include:

- Philosophical and Cognitive Foundations for Conceptual Modeling

- Ontology-Based Conceptual Modeling: Methodologies, Tools, and Case
Studies

- Psychological Experiments Evaluating the Cognitive Adequacy of
Conceptual Modeling Primitives

- Ontological Analysis of Existing Conceptual Models (including
Reference Models)

- Role of Ontology-driven Conceptual Modelling for Semantic
Interoperability

- Ontological Design Patterns

- Linguistic theories and Natural-Language Semantics in Conceptual
Modeling

- Formal Semantics of Conceptual Modeling Languages

- Comparison between existing Foundational Ontologies for the purpose
of Conceptual Modeling

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
===========================================

Submissions, that will undergo a peer-reviewing process, must be sent
electronically through the journal's website
(http://www.applied-ontology.org/) by the deadline listed
below. Detailed instructions for authors are available from the same
website.

ABOUT THE JOURNAL
===========================================

Although a formal contribution is not an absolute requirement for
contributing to Applied Ontology, the contributors should keep in mind
the aim and scope of Applied Ontology, an interdisciplinary journal of
Ontological Analysis and Conceptual Modeling.

Applied Ontology is a new journal whose focus is on information
content in its broadest sense. As the subtitle makes clear, two broad
kinds of content-based research activities are envisioned: ontological
analysis and conceptual modeling. The former includes any attempt to
investigate the nature and structure of a domain of interest using
rigorous philosophical or logical tools; the latter concerns the
cognitive and linguistic structures we use to model the world, as well
as the various analysis tools and methodologies we adopt for producing
useful computational models, such as information systems schemes or
knowledge structures.

Applied Ontology is the first journal with explicit and exclusive
focus on ontological analysis and conceptual modeling under an
interdisciplinary view. It aims to establish a unique niche in the
realm of scientific journals by carefully avoiding unnecessary
duplication with discipline-oriented journals. For this reason,
authors will be encouraged to use language that will be intelligible
also to those outside their specific sector of expertise, and the
review process will be tailored to this end.

For example, authors of theoretical contributions will be encouraged
to show the relevance of their theory for applications, while authors
of more technological papers will be encouraged to show the relevance
of a well-founded theoretical perspective. Moreover, the journal will
publish papers focusing on representation languages or algorithms only
where these address relevant content issues, whether at the level of
practical application or of theoretical understanding. Similarly, it
will publish descriptions of tools or implemented systems only where a
contribution to the practice of ontological analysis and conceptual
modeling is clearly established.
