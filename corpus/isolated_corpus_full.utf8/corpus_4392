Third International Workshop on Cross Lingual Information Access: Addressin=
g the Information Need of=A0
Multilingual Societies (CLIAWS3)

Boulder, Colorado; June 04,2009=A0

http://search.iiit.ac.in/CLIA2009/

Submission Deadline: March 06, 2009=A0




WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION=A0

Cross-Language Information Access is concerned with any/all technologies th=
at let users express their query in=A0
their native language, and irrespective of the language in which the inform=
ation is available, present the=A0
information in the user-preferred language or set of languages, in a manner=
 that satisfies the user's information=A0
needs. The additional processing may take the form of machine translation o=
f snippets, summarization and=A0
subsequent translation of summaries and/or information extraction.

This workshop aims to bring together various trends in multi-source, cross =
and multilingual information retrieval=A0
and access, and provide a venue for researchers and practitioners from acad=
emia, government, and industry to=A0
interact and share a broad spectrum of ideas, views and applications. The w=
orkshop will consist of a set of=A0
invited talks and presentations of technical papers that will be selected a=
fter peer review from the submissions=A0
received.

We solicit submissions describing research on all aspects of "Cross Lingual=
 Information Access and Retrieval".=A0
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Semantic approaches to cross lingual information access
* Cross-language cross media search (speech, video, audio)
* Uses of (statistical) Machine Translation and Transliteration in multilin=
gual information access
* Search based on language independent forms
* Cross-language text categorization
* Multilingual / Cross-lingual named entity recognition
* Cross-document and crosslingual entity and event coreference
* Multilingual digital libraries
* Scalability issues in multilingual information access/ system evaluation
* Cross Lingual/ Multilingual question answering
* Appropriate methods to detect similar/complementary/contradictory informa=
tion across multiple languages
* Multilingual Summarization
* Multilingual Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
* Multilingual Information Extraction
* Practical systems on various domains
* Acquisition of parallel and comparable corpora in multiple languages
* Morphology and Shallow Parsing for CLIR
* Query Translation, Query Expansion, Multiword handling and Lightweight WS=
D for CLIR
* Other CLIR research issues, user studies / interactive CLIA=A0


SUBMISSION INFORMATION=A0

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, =
PDF format (with up to 1 additional=A0
page for references). Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The s=
ubmissions will be reviewed by the=A0
program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers ar=
e anonymous. Self-references that=A0
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...=
", should be avoided. Instead, use=A0
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Papers will be accepted on or before 6 March 2009 in PDF format via the STA=
RT system at https://www.softconf.com/=A0
naacl-hlt09/CLIAWS2009/. Submissions should follow the NAACL HLT 2009 lengt=
