Meeting Description

Day seminar on encounter charms / Begegnungssegen 

Call for Papers

One-day seminar on Encounter charms / Begegnungssegen

May 9th 2008, Tartu, Estonia

Organised by the Committee on Charms, Charmers and Charming of the International
Society for Folk Narrative Research

Hosted by the Department of Estonian and Comparative Folklore, University of Tartu,
Estonia

Many narrative charms feature an encounter between the chief protagonist of the
historiola and another key figure. These may be encounters with a supernatural
helper or encounters with an evil power. The great charms scholar Ferdinand Ohrt
termed such charms 'Begegnungssegen' in a series of influential articles and in
his entry on 'Segen' in the Handwörterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens. But
little concentrated work has been done on encounter charms since then - a
situation this seminar intends to remedy.


This seminar will be dedicated to addressing encounter charms across
cultures and over time, and papers are requested dealing with topics such as: 

history of particular types of encounter charms, 

the genre characteristics of historiolas,

the role of protagonists, antagonists and helpers in historiolas

the nature of encounters and dialogues in charms,

the links (or lack of links) between the historiola and the remainder of the charm,

the connections of encounter charms with other charm types,

the relationship between encounter charms and other genres,

and other related themes.
