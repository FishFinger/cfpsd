***************************************************************************************

New technologies of the self, mobilities and (co-)construction of identity 

Edited by:
Fred Dervin, Senior Lecturer, 
Department of French Studies, University of Turku, Finland
(e-mail: freder@utu.fi)
&
Yasmine Abbas, 
Doctor of Design, Harvard, USA
Independent scholar
(e-mail: abbas.yasmine@gmail.com) 


Overall objectives of the book

The new interpersonal spaces created by web 2.0 and 3.0 technologies seem
to correspond to the technologies of the self that Michel Foucault (1988)
has addressed in his lectures at the Collège de France at the beginning of
the 1980s. These new technologies enable the individual's self to emerge
publicly and to be worked upon with its ''disciples'': be they companions
in Second Life, readers (for example on a blog) or listeners (Podcasts).
With high speed Internet access and increasingly generous capacities of
storage (mp3, USB keys, iPhone, portable computers...), the opportunities
for staging the self have become unlimited. 
 
The authors will explore aspects of the contributions of these new
technologies to the expression and (co-)construction of identitie(s) of
mobile individuals (physical and/or digital; short-term (expatriates,
businessmen, trainees, exchange students?) and long-term (migrants,
refugees, exiles?); inter-/intra- and/or transnational mobilities). Any of
the following issues can be addressed:

- The specificities of (co-)constructions of the self through new
technologies. How do they contribute to presenting the self?
- The potential differences between these technologies of the self and more
« traditional » ones.
- What is said about the self? How? How is it constructed or staged? With
whom? For whom? And why? 
- Are there signs of manipulation of the self and identity collages? 
- What myths related to identity seem to emerge? 
- The position of the (real/fictive) interlocutor(s) and groups (cf.
peg-communities, Z. Bauman) in these constructions.
- How is the other constructed?
- What do visitors, readers, spectators or listeners seem to gain in terms
of reflections on their own identities? 
- Problems in using but also researching the new technologies of the self
(ethics, psychological effects, in terms of relationships, interculturality?).

Submission procedure
Researchers and practitioners (from linguistics, sociology, anthropology,
psychology, education, IT?) are invited to submit a proposal (350 words)
clearly explaining the mission, concerns of their proposed chapter as well
as a short description of the corpus (if they plan on using one), the
method of analysis and a basic bibliography by March 1, 2008  to
freder@utu.fi & abbas.yasmine@gmail.com. The proposal can be in English or
French.
The followings will also be provided with the proposal: Name(s),
affiliation, a few lines about the author(s), and a list of major
publications. 
Authors of accepted proposals will be notified by March 15, 2007.  
Full chapters will be expected to be submitted by September 1st, 2008.
