Full Title: Subordination from Diachronic and Dialectal Perspective=20

Date: 23-Feb-2010 - 26-Feb-2010
Location: Berlin, Germany=20
Contact Person: Katrin Axel
Meeting Email: katrin.axel@mx.uni-saarland.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Historical Linguistics; Syntax=20

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Syntactic dependency between clauses can be marked by a variety of linguist=
ic means, e.g. by word order, connectives, verbal mood, =B1finiteness (Cris=
tofaro 2003). Interestingly, syntactic dependency does not always correspon=
d with semantic, phonological and/or pragmatic dependency or vice versa. No=
tably in German there exist many constructions in which the canonical corre=
spondences do not hold. Consider, for example, so called continuative subor=
dinate clauses (weiterf=FChrende Nebens=E4tze), subordinate clauses with ma=
in-clause properties, implicative constructions with 'und/and' (Reis 1997).=
=20

In the previous literature not much attention has been paid to the situatio=
n in older language changes and in the dialects: Which linguistic means are=
 used to encode syntactic dependency? What is the diagnostic value of the d=
ifferent kinds of subordination markers? What is the relationship between s=
yntactic dependency on the one hand and prosodic, semantic or pragmatic dep=
endency on the other? Is there a connection between diachronic and syntacti=
c variation in individual languages?      =20

The workshop offers the opportunity to expand the scope beyond the predomin=
ant focus on standard languages and synchrony. We welcome theoretically-ori=
ented contributions from a variety of frameworks.

The workshop 'Subordination from a Diachronic and Dialectal Perspective' is=
 part of the Conference of the German Society for Linguistics (DGfS).

The DGfS 2010 Conference will be held at the Humboldt University, Berlin, f=
rom 23-26 February, 2010. The DGfS 2010 home page (in German) can be found =
at http://www2.hu-berlin.de/dgfs/.=20

1st.

gust 2009 to katrin.axel@mx.uni-saarland.de
