Full Title: 21st Modern Greek Studies Association Symposium 
Short Title: MGSA 2009 

Date: 15-Oct-2009 - 17-Oct-2009
Location: Vancouver, Canada 
Contact Person: Victor Papacosma
Meeting Email: mgsa@kent.edu
Web Site: http://www.mgsa.org 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Subject Language(s): Greek (ell)

Call Deadline: 15-Jan-2009 

Meeting Description:

MGSA 2009, the twenty-first biennial international symposium of the 
Modern Greek Studies Association, will take place October 15-17, 2009 in 
Vancouver, Canada, and will be coordinated by the Hellenic Studies 
Program at Simon Fraser University (www.sfu.ca/hellenic-studies/). 

Call for Papers

Abstracts for individual papers and proposals for entire panels are invited 
on any aspect of contemporary Greek culture, literature, language, history, 
society, politics, economics, and the arts. Comparative and interdisciplinary 
approaches to the study of Greece and research on transnational Greek 
worlds are especially encouraged.

Possible Topics for MGSA 2009 include:
Interdisciplinary approaches to environmental issues; popular culture and 
media; cultural change; spaces of cross-cultural and intellectual fertilization 
between the Hellenic world and the rest of the world; the emergence of 
new urban and suburban environments; Greek literature in national and 
post-national contexts; new economies of labor; poverty, economic 
marginalization, and class relations; Greece and geopolitics in the wider 
region; Cyprus and interregional relationships; diaspora and transnational 
Greek worlds; and Modern Greek Studies as a field.

General Guidelines for Submission: 
All submissions will be judged by blind review on the basis of their 
individual merit, even when part of a submitted panel. Abstracts of 300-400 
words should be submitted electronically to the MGSA Executive Director. 

Abstracts will be evaluated 1) in relation to the innovativeness of the 
approaches they employ, 2) in terms of their active engagement with the 
existing literature, and 3) in terms of the narrative coherence of their aims 
and objectives.

Abstracts should reflect original work that has not been previously 
presented or announced in other venues. Previously presented or 
announced work compromises the blind review process and risks rejection 
for procedural reasons. 

Each abstract should explain briefly the scope and focus of the proposed 
topic, its broader significance for its discipline and the field of Modern 
Greek Studies, and the methodology employed. Although the decisions of 
the committee are final, short commentaries on the rationale for rejected 
abstracts can be provided upon request. 

Jointly authored abstracts and papers are welcome.

Each abstract should be accompanied by a separate page that contains 
the name(s) of the author(s), affiliation(s), postal and email addresses, and 
telephone numbers. All papers will have a 20-minute time limit, which will 
be strictly enforced. Papers of absent authors will not be read at the 
Symposium under any circumstances. The Program Committee will assign 
Chairs to all panels. No one may present more than one paper, or act as 
presenter and commentator on the same panel. Audio-visual requirements 
should be indicated at the time of submission.

Proposals for entire panels of no more than 4 participants may be 
submitted by the panel organizer in the same manner as individual 
abstracts and should include a) abstracts and contact information for each 
of the presenters and b) a panel abstract of 300-400 words by the panel's 
organizer providing an abstract describing the panel and explaining the 
connections among the individual papers.
 
In cases where a panel is rejected but an individual paper merits inclusion, 
this paper will be accepted as an individual entry to the Symposium. 

Symposium participants are expected to cover their own expenses. There 
is a small fund available to defray accommodation costs only (not travel) for 
participating graduate students. 

Abstracts or inquiries may be submitted via email to Prof. Victor 
Papacosma, MGSA Executive Director: mgsa@kent.edu

Deadlines
The deadline for submissions of abstracts for individual papers is 
15 January 2009. Deadline for abstracts of organized panels is 
25 January 2009. There will be no extensions of the deadlines. Final 
decisions will be announced by early March 2009.
