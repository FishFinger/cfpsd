********************************************************************
* 2nd Asian Semantic Web School (ASWS2008)                         *
* Jointly located with ASWC2008                                    *
* Bangkok, Thailand, Dec 1-6, 2008 (http://www.asws2008.org/)      *
********************************************************************

The 2nd Asian Semantic Web School aims to teach its
attendees how to apply semantic technologies in their own projects
and environments. The school is targeted at young researchers and
other interested parties affiliated to academia or industry. It is
particularly our goal to bring together international experts in the
field and to invite the leading research groups in Korea to be part
of the program.

Course Topics
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Presentations by international experts in the field will
introduce the core technologies of semantic computing:

- Standard knowledge representation languages such as Resource
Description Framework (RDF) or Web Ontology Language (OWL), including
tools for exploiting their reasoning capabilities.
- Methodologies, methods and tools to build and manage ontologies.
- The current directions in Semantic Web Services, in particular the
Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) and the related Web Service
Modeling Language (WSML) and Web Service Execution Environment (WSMX).

Tutorials, hands-on sessions and exercices
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorials, hands-on sessions and exercises will provide additional
insights into the aforementioned topics and guide the students in
applying the  technologies in specific situations. These learning
modules will be complemented by invited talks which report on the
deployment of semantic technologies in real-world business scenarios,
handed over by representatives of well-known international companies.
The participants will be involved in projects, in which they will
develop prototypical Semantic Web applications in small teams on the
basis of a pre-defined scenario specification.

Co-located events
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The school will be co-located with
the Asian Semantic Web Conference (ASWC2008) in Bangkok, Thailand.
It will take place one week prior to the main conference.
