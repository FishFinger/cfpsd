The International Journal of Bilingualism
Special Issue

Dynamics of First Language Attrition across the Lifespan

Studies into the language of bilinguals have traditionally interpreted
non-linear, or even erratic, developments to be 'noise' in the system
(Herdina & Jessner, 2002, p. 78). However, in an attempt to acknowledge
such 'noise', an approach consistent with dynamic systems theory proposes
that the presence of one or more language systems influences the
development of not only the L2, 'but also the development of the overall
multilingual system' (Herdina & Jessner, 2002, p. 28).

In response to the recent proposal that dynamic systems theory is a
candidate for an overall theory of language development (de Bot, Lowie &
Verspoor, 2007; Herdina & Jessner, 2002), as well as an increase in
research activity in the area of first language attrition (see for example
Schmid, 2009; K=F6pke, 2007), we seek high quality abstracts contributing
theoretical and/or empirical perspectives to a special issue of the
International Journal of Bilingualism entitled 'Dynamics of First Language
Attrition across the Lifespan'. Contributions encompassing longitudinal
findings and those which not only document but explain (ir-) regularities
(Ellis, 2007, p. 23) on the basis of dynamic systems theory are
particularly welcome.

Authors are invited to submit abstracts of unpublished, original work of
approximately 800 words. Abstracts should be submitted electronically to
the e-mail address below by 22 December 2009. Authors of selected abstracts
will be invited to submit complete manuscripts subject to peer review.

Important dates:
- 22 December 2009 - Deadline for abstract submission
- 31 March 2010 - Notification to authors
- December 2010 - Submission of manuscript
- August 2011 - Notification of outcome of peer review to authors
- May 2012 - Targeted publication date

Please send your abstract and any enquiries to:
dynamics.of.L1attrition@gmail.com
