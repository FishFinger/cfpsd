         to be held in Udine (Italy) at the occasion of ICLP'08


                             December, 2008



Important dates and other relevant information
----------------------------------------------

   * Abstract submission: September 1
   * Paper submission: September 8
   * Notification of acceptance: October 1
   * Final version due: October 17
   * Workshop dates: TBD

Submission will be done through EasyChair using the URL

Topics of interest
------------------

This  workshop aims  at discussing  and exchanging  experience  on the
design, implementation, and  optimization of logic, constraint (logic)
programming  systems, and  systems intimately  related to  logic  as a
means  to   express  computations.   Experience  backed  up   by  real
implementations and their evaluation will be given preference, as well
as descriptions of work in progress in that direction.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

   * Standard and alternative sequential implementation schemes (e.g.,
     generalization / modification of the WAM, translation to
     lower-level and/or general-purpose languages, etc.)

   * Implementation of parallel and concurrent logic and constraint
     programming systems.

   * Compile-time analysis and its application to code generation.

   * Interaction between high-level optimizations / transformations /
     specialization and low-level issues.

   * Memory management, indexing, and garbage collection issues.

   * Balance between compile-time effort and run-time machinery.

   * Implementation techniques for declarative programming paradigms
     with basis on, or extending, logic and constraint programming,
     such as non-monotonic reasoning, inductive logic programming,
     co-inductive logic programming, contextual logic programming, etc.


   * Implementation of systems closely related to, or based on, logic,
     such as theorem provers and natural language processing systems.

   * Automatic performance evaluation of logic and constraint
     programming systems.

   * User-oriented tools for performance evaluation and enhancement.

   * Software design with / for LP/CP systems: components, code
     patterns and rules, etc.

   * Design and implementation of programming environments.

   * Experiences from using systems in real-life applications.


Workshop Goals
--------------

Our  intent is  to  bring  together, in  an  informal setting,  people
involved  in  research   on  sequential  and  parallel  implementation
technologies  for  logic  and  constraint  programming  languages  and
systems, in  order to  promote the exchange  of ideas and  feedback on
recent developments. We hope that  the workshop will provide a meeting
point for  people working  on implementation technology  for different
aspects of logic and constraint-based languages and systems.


Rationale and History
---------------------

Progress in computing technology,  including the now readily available
multicore processors, increased  memory capacity and bandwidth, faster
networking  technology,  and   O.S.  support  for  cluster  computing,
combined  with recent  advances  in compilation  technologies and  the
wider  adoption   of  alternative  constraint/logic-based  programming
languages,  are making  high-level languages  to be  regarded  as good
candidates for programming  complex, demanding applications. A witness
of this  very interesting  trend is the  interest of Intel  with their
sponsorship  of the DAMP  series of  workshops. Logic  Programming and
Constraint  Programming,   in  particular,  offer  one   of  the  best
alternatives, as  they couple a very  high level of  abstraction and a
declarative nature with flexibility  its execution model, which can be
adapted to different scenarios.

An orthogonal but synergistic  issue in the pursue of high-performance
and  high-level  languages   comes  from  advances  in  implementation
techniques for logic and constraint languages. These techniques aim at
achieving  both design flexibility  and good  performance in  terms of
speed and memory consumption,  thus making those languages and systems
more  amenable  than ever  for  real  world applications.  Maintaining
flexibility without  unnecessarily sacrificing performance,  and while
retaining a  high level which  relieves the programmer  from burdening
tasks,  requires   sophisticated  technology  whose   exploration  and
development is one the aims of this workshop.

This  workshop  continues  a  tradition  of  successful  workshops  on
Implementations of Logic Programming  Systems, previously held with in
Budapest  (1993) and  Ithaca  (1994), the  Compulog  Net workshops  on
Parallelism and  Implementation Technologies held in  Madrid (1993 and
1994), Utrecht (1995) and Bonn (1996), the Workshop on Parallelism and
Implementation Technology for (Constraint) Logic Programming Languages
held in  Port Jefferson (1997), Manchester (1998),  Las Cruces (1999),
and London (2000), and  more recently the Colloquium on Implementation
of Constraint and LOgic  Programming Systems in Paphos (Cyprus, 2001),
Copenhagen (2002),  Mumbai (2003),  Saint Malo (France,  2004), Sitges
(Spain, 2005), Seattle (U.S.A., 2006) and Porto (Portugal, 2007).
