Title: Linguistic Interfaces in Child Language Acquisition

Guest editors: Pedro Guijarro-Fuentes (Plymouth University) 
                        Jason Rothman (University of Iowa)


Theoretical linguistic approaches to language cognition make strong
theoretical predictions for close connections between language
acquisition/learning and the emergence of complex properties that
characterize and distinguish human languages across space and time.
Studying of sub-parts of grammatical systems in isolation (e.g., phonology,
syntax, semantics, morphology and pragmatics) cannot provide us with
adequate explanation of how acquisition is possible. Sub-modules of
linguistic systems, by definition, are not independent of each other but
necessarily work in tandem to make the interaction between sound, structure
and meaning possible. Only an incorporated approach involving the study of
the interaction between different levels of linguistic knowledge - known as
interfaces - has the promise of shedding light on fundamental questions.
The study of linguistic interfaces has the potential to make a crucial
contribution towards a tenable, integrated model of the acquisition,
constitution and organization of human mental linguistic systems. 

  	Mainly, but not exclusively, contemporary generative acquisition theory
and empirical research are motivated by the hypothesis that acquisition
delays in children (as well as L1 attrition and variability in adult L2
acquisition) are often related to the inherent complexity of acquiring
interface-conditioned properties. This special issue aims to bring together
cutting edge research from all relevant paradigms addressing interface
issues in first language acquisition (defined broadly as language(s)
learned in childhood).

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

-	Developmental interfaces among morphology, syntax, semantics, 
        phonology and discourse/pragmatics in first language acquisition
-	Cross-linguistic interfaces in simultaneous bilingual acquisition 
-	Interface vulnerability/ attrition
-	Interfaces and input 
-	Interfaces and developmental delays
