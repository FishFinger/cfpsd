Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2007 

Meeting Description:
IAWE is an international scholarly association which aims to establish links
among those who are involved with any aspect of World Englishes in research
and/or teaching. The association focuses on global issues relating to three
major aspects of World Englishes, language, literature, and pedagogy. IAWE is
committed to the study of the forms and functions of varieties of Englishes in
diverse cultural and sociolinguistic contexts. (See www.iaweworks.org/). IAWE
has held annual conferences in North America, Asia, and Africa; in 2007 the
organization will meet for the first time in Europe.

The conference theme is 'World Englishes: Problems - Properties - Prospects'. It
reflects the wide range of interests and concerns of the society and the topics
which will be discussed, including: 
-	political, pedagogical, anthropological and cultural issues raised by the
global spread and the increasing indigenization of English in many countries
around the globe; 
-	structural features and conditions of use of these newly-emerging varieties,
and general linguistic questions raised by these processes of contact and change; 
-	social repercussions and sociolinguistic consequences which will result from
the 'glocalization' of the English language. 

2nd Call for Papers
The 13th Annual Conference of the International Association of World Englishes
(IAWE) will be held at the University of Regensburg, Germany, from Oct. 4 to
Oct. 6, 2007. Members of the association, scholars actively involved in research
on World Englishes, and others interested in the subject are invited to attend
the conference and to submit abstracts for conference presentations.
