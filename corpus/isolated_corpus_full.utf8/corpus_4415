Meeting Description:

ISLOJ provides the opportunity for scholars working on various linguistic
aspects of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak to gather and
share their research. 

Final Call for Papers

ISLOJ 2
The Second International Symposium on the Languages of Java
4-5 June 2009 
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, Senggigi, Lombok, Indonesia

Keynote Speakers: 
Dr. Thomas Hunter: The interaction of irrealis with the symmetrical voice system
of Old Javanese. 
Dr. Husni Muadz, Universitas Negri Mataram: A topic on Sasak TBA 

The island of Java is home to several major languages. Javanese-- spoken mainly
in Central and East Java-- is the world's 10th or 11th largest language in
number of native speakers. It has one of the oldest and fullest recorded
histories of any Austronesian language. It also has been of considerable
interest to scholars because of the system of speech levels or speech styles
found in a number of varieties of Javanese. Sundanese--spoken in West Java-- has
over 27 million speakers, and Madurese--spoken on the neighboring island of
Madura and throughout parts of East Java--has over 13 million speakers.
Varieties of both of these languages have speech level systems and such systems
can also be found in the geographically, historically, and linguistically
related languages on the neighboring islands of Bali and Lombok. Each of these
languages displays a range of dialects, isolects, continua, and contact
varieties and yet they have received relatively little attention from linguists.
With this symposium, we offer an opportunity for scholars working on any aspect
of Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese and Sasak to come together and share
their findings. We aim to encourage and promote continued research on these
important and unique languages.

Abstracts are invited for papers to be presented on any linguistic topics
dealing with the languages of Java and its environs- Javanese, Sundanese,
Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak. Given the location of the conference, papers on
Sasak are especially encouraged. Papers on other languages will be judged
according to their relevance to the symposium topic. Papers are welcome from any
subfield of linguistics and using any approach or theoretical background.
Studies of non-standard(ized) versions, dialects, and isolects, including
contact varieties, are particularly welcome.  All papers are to be presented in
English.

Persons wishing to present papers at the symposium are invited to submit a
one-page [data and references may be on a second page] abstract in electronic
form (PDF AND MSWord) to Thomas Conners at the following address:
oranghutan@cbn.net.id

Deadline for submission of abstracts: March 1, 2009

Please note that the 13th International Symposium on Malay-Indonesian
Linguistics (ISMIL 13) will be held immediately following ISLOJ, also at the
Sheraton Senggigi Beach Resort, on 6-7 June, 2009.  For more information see:

Meeting Description:

The 11th Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar (SICOGG 11)
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul
Aug 11(Tue) - 14(Fri), 2009 

Call for Papers

Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Hankuk University of
Foreign Studies, Seoul

Invited Speaker: 
Norbert Hornstein (University of Maryland at College Park)
 
General Session on Visions of the Minimalist Program

The Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies
are pleased to announce that 2009 Seoul International Conference on Generative
Grammar will be held at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, Korea, on
Aug 11- 14.

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the general
session specified above, equal consideration will be given to papers from all
areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the
general session, two additional workshops, and a series of lectures from the
invited speaker. The themes of the additional workshops are as follows:

Workshop on Control and Binding

This workshop solicits the abstracts on control and binding. Since the earliest
framework of the generative grammar, control and binding have been the richest
sources of linguistic investigation on the nature of thematic relations. With
the advent of the minimalist program, earlier approaches to these two phenomena
may well be reinterpreted in the minimalist setting. Regarding control, one most
remarkable shift of focus would be the view taken by Hornstein (1999) and his
subsequent works that obligatory control is actually movement. This claim
invoked various controversies over PRO including Landau's (2001) Agree-based
analysis of control. Whichever approaches one might take, an adequate theory of
control must explain the distribution and interpretation of PRO. Inseparably
related to control, binding also must be reinterpreted in the minimalist
program. The topics of research include the questions like whether binding is
movement or construal, or if both are operative, which one comes prior over the
other. All in all, it would be a major contribution to the Strong Minimalist
Thesis if the theories of control and binding can be deduced from more minimal
operations, whether they would be movement, agreement, or something else.

Workshop on Islands
Since the inception of the Minimalist Program, much of the earlier machinery
deriving island effects has been reformulated in terms of various equivalents
from minimalist considerations: Shortest Move (Chomsky 1994), the Minimal Link
Condition (Chomsky 1995), Multiple Spell-Out (Uriagereka 1999) and Phase Theory
(Chomsky 2000, 2001). Despite the emergence of such principled notions, however,
there is no general consensus on the treatment of islands in the current
minimalist theory, and this is partly because islands show non-trivial
differences of deviance in extraction caused by the nature of different types of
islands: weak islands vs. strong islands. This workshop aims to discuss the
issues related to how the distinct characteristics of the extraction from weak
islands and strong islands, either as a unified or dissociated class, can be
accommodated in less redundant, more clarifying fashions in the current
minimalist program; but we also hope to extend the range of possible topics to
the impact of islands on other domains of inquiry such as language acquisition,
language processing, and functional approaches.

Abstracts should be anonymous and may not exceed 2 pages (A4), including
examples and references, with 2.54 cm (1 inch) margin on all four sides and
should employ the font Times New Roman 12 pt. Submissions are limited to a
maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author. Please send a
separate file containing the following information: (i) the title of the paper,
(ii) the author's name, (iii) affiliation, (iv) e-mail address, (v) telephone
number, and (vi) the preferred session (general, workshop on control and
binding, or workshop on islands). Abstracts should be sent ELECTRONICALLY as
Word or PDF attachments to kwangsup@hufs.ac.kr, swkim@kw.ac.kr, and
kggc2009@gmail.com no later than April 8, 2009. 

Abstracts will be reviewed by readers, and authors will be notified by May 15,
2009. Each speaker of the general and the workshop sessions will be allotted 20
minutes followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Accepted papers will be published
in the Proceedings of 2009 Seoul International conference on Generative Grammar,
which will be distributed to the conference participants. All presenters will be
asked to provide camera-ready copies of their papers in publishable form by July
20, 2009. The text should be single-spaced and the general page limit is 20
pages including appendices and references.  

All the information about the conference is available on our website
http://www.kggc.org. Participants are asked to check this web page to keep up to
date regarding possible alterations and changes. Additional questions concerning
the conference can be answered by sending a question to Chang Yong Sim at
kggc2009@gmail.com.
