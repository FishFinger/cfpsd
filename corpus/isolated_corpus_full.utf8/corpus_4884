Call for papers
RANLP-2009 Workshop on Natural Language Processing methods and corpora 
in translation, lexicography, and language learning

We are pleased to announce the workshop on Natural Language Processing 
methods and corpora in translation studies, lexicography, and language 
learning, to be held in conjunction with the main RANLP-09 conference in 
Borovets, Bulgaria, on 17-18 September 2009.


Motivation

Corpora are now indispensable tools in research and everyday practice 
for translators, lexicographers, second language learners. Specialists 
in these areas share a general goal in using corpora in their work: 
corpora provide the possibility to find and analyse linguistic patterns 
characteristic of various kinds of language users, monitor language 
change, and reveal important similarities and divergences across 
different languages. For professional translators corpora present an 
invaluable linguistic and cultural awareness tools. For language 
learners, they serve as a means to gain insights into specifics of 
competent language use as well as to analyse typical errors of fellow 
learners. For lexicographers, corpora are key for monitoring the 
development of the vocabularies of languages, making informed decisions 
as to lexicographic relevance of the lexical material, and for general 
verification of all varieties of lexicographic data.

While simple corpus analysis tools such as concordancers have been long 
in use in these specialist areas, in the past decade there have been 
important developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
technologies: it has become much easier to construct corpora and 
powerful NLP methods have become available that can be used to analyse 
corpora not only on the surface level, but also on the syntactic, and 
even semantic, pragmatic, and stylistic levels.

This workshop aims to bring together the developers and the users of NLP 
technologies for the purposes of translation, translation studies, 
lexicography, terminology, and language learning in order to present 
their research and discuss new possibilities and challenges in these 
fields.


Topics

Submissions are invited for the following topics of interest to the 
workshop:

- NLP methodologies for processing parallel and comparable corpora
- Context-sensitive dictionary look-up
- Corpus-based study and identification of cognates and false friends
- Compilation and use of corpora in translation studies
- Corpus-based study of properties of translated text: translation 
universals, phraseology, lexical and grammatical patterns
- Corpora in translator training
- Translation of terms and collocations using corpora
- Bilingual concordancing in translation applications
- NLP methods for Computer-Aided Translation
- Compilation of specialised terminologies
- Compilation of corpora for bilingual lexicography
- Detection of gaps in bilingual dictionaries
- Corpus-based estimation of lexicographic relevance
- Term and collocation extraction
- Discovery of illustrative examples and definitions of words and word 
senses in corpora
- Reading and writing aid applications for language learners
- Automated text glossing in Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL)
- Corpus-based design of assessment materials in CALL
- Error detection and error analysis in CALL
- Detection of first-language interference in learner corpora

Important dates

Submission deadline: 10 June 2009
Acceptance notification: 20 July 2009
Final copies due: 24 August 2009

Submission instructions

Papers must be submitted in PDF format as e-mail attachments to Iustina 
Ilisei at _iustina.ilisei@gmail.com <mailto:iustina.ilisei@gmail.com>_. 
The e-mail should use the subject header: RANLP-2009 workshop.

Format
Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work 
in the topic area of this workshop. Papers (in PDF format conforming to 
the RANLP 2009 stylefiles) should not exceed 8 pages. The RANLP 2009 
stylefiles are available at:

_http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/submissions.htm_

As reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the authors' 
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the 
authors' identities should be avoided. Papers that do not conform to 
these requirements will be rejected without review.

Reviewing
Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program 
Committee. Reviewers will be asked to provide detailed comments, and to 
score submitted papers on the following factors:
- Relevance to the workshop
- Significance and originality
- Technical/methodological accuracy
- References to related work
- Presentation (clarity, organisation, English)

Accepted papers policy
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. By 
submitting a paper at the workshop the authors agree that, in case the 
paper is accepted for publication, at least one of the authors will 
attend the workshop; all workshop participants are expected to pay the 
RANLP-2009 workshop registration fee.
