Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their full paper (about 5
   to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to H. R. Arabnia
   by Feb. 20, 2007 (hra@cs.uga.edu). E-mail submissions in MS Doc or
   PDF formats are preferable (postal mail submissions are also fine.)
   All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the
   authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular
   typesetting format to prepare their papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited
   to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously
   published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The
   first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,
   name, affiliation, postal address, email address, and telephone
   number for each author.  The first page should also identify the
   name of the author who will be presenting the paper (if accepted)
   and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the
   content of the paper.  Finally, the name of the conference/track
   that the paper is being submitted to must be stated on the first
   page.

   Each paper will be refereed by two experts in the field who are
   independent of the conference program committee.  The referees'
   evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of the program
   committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of the track
   that the paper has been submitted to.  The track chair will make
   the final decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be
   reviewed by one member of the program committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy
   of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing;
   artificial intelligence; imaging science; databases; simulation;
   software engineering; embedded systems; internet and web
   technologies; communications; computer security; and
   bioinformatics.) Many members of the program committee for
   individual conferences include renowned leaders, scholars,
   researchers, scientists and practitioners of the highest ranks;
   many are directors of large research laboratories, IEEE Fellows,
   heads/chairs of departments, deans and provosts.  Each committee
   also includes two Student Members (in their final stages of their
   PhD programs) who are identified as such.  Refer to the conference
   web sites for the list of members of program committee.

Co-Sponsors (a partial list):

   Academic Co-Sponsors of WORLDCOMP'07 include:

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the 25 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their
   respective fields.  We anticipate to have 2000 or more attendees
   from over 75 countries participating in the 2007 event.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates
   communication among researchers from all over the world in
   different fields of computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing.  Both inward research (core areas of computer
   science and engineering) and outward research (multi-disciplinary,
   inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered during the
   conferences.

Important Dates:

   Feb.  20, 2007:    Submission of full papers (about 5 to 8 pages)
   March 20, 2007:    Notification of acceptance
   April 20, 2007:    Camera-Ready papers and Registration due
   June 25-28, 2007:  The 2007 World Congress in Computer Science,
                      Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing
                      (WORLDCOMP'07)
