  - Implementation of higher order logics and lambda-calculus
  - Implementation of new and unusual calculi
  - Integration of systems based on different logics
  - Transformations between different logics (e.g., abstractions)
  - Issues of reliability, witness generation, and witness verification
  - Evaluation and benchmarking of logic-based systems
  - Reasoning for ontologies
  - Ontology modularity, module extraction
* Contributions that help the community to understand how to build useful
  and powerful reasoning systems in practice are of particular interest.
* Important dates:
  - Submission of abstracts: October 18th
  - Notification: October 27th

21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AIDED VERIFICATION (CAV 2009)
  Call for Papers
  June 26 - July 2, 2009
  Grenoble
  http://www-cav2009.imag.fr
* Aims and Scope
  CAV 2009 is the 21st in a series dedicated to the advancement of the
  theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for
  hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum
  from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis
  on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques
  that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings of the
  conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in
  Computer Science series. Topics of interest include:
  - Modeling and specification formalisms
  - Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations
  - Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for verification
  - Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology
  - Hardware verification techniques
  - Program analysis and software verification
  - Analysis of embedded and hybrid systems
  - Verification techniques for security
  - Applications and case studies
  - Verification in industrial practice
* Paper Submission
  There are two categories of submissions:
  - A. Regular Papers:* Submissions, not exceeding fourteen (14) pages
  using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research, and
  sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the
  contribution. For papers reporting experimental results, authors are
  strongly encouraged to make their data available with their
  submission. Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial
  context are strongly invited, and should describe details,
  weaknesses and strength in sufficient depth. Simultaneous submission
  to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that
  has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.
  - B. Tool Presentations:* Submissions, not exceeding five (6) pages
  using Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented tool
  and its novel features. A demonstration is expected to accompany a
  tool presentation. Papers describing tools that have already been
  presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant
  and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.
  Submission is done with EasyChair. Informations about the submission
  procedure will be available at:

  conferences have been accompanied by successful workshops on a
  variety of topics, like formal and foundational methods, models of
  systems (biological, timed), security issues, semantical issues, and

  interactive atmosphere for presenting novel ideas and discussing their
  application.
* Proposals should include:
  - The name and the preferred date of the proposed workshop.
  - A very brief cv of the chairperson(s) or a link to some web page
  including such information.
  - A short scientific summary of the topic, its scope and significance
   (and possibly a description of past versions of the workshop, including,
    e.g., dates, organizers, submission and acceptance counts, and
    attendance).
  - Procedures for selecting papers, plans for dissemination (for example,
    proceedings and special issues of journals), and the expected number of
    participants.
* Important Dates:
  Workshop proposals due November 15th, 2008.
  Notification of acceptance: December 1st, 2008.
  Submissions to: concur09@cs.unibo.it
* The CONCUR organization offers:

  workshop chairperson(s), including:
* Workshop publicity (possibly including call for papers,
  submission and review process).
* Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the CONCUR
  local organizers.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AIDED VERIFICATION (CAV)
   2008 CAV Award Announcement
* The 2008 CAV (Computer Aided Verification) award is given to Rajeev
  Alur from the University of Pennsylvania and David L. Dill from
  Stanford University for fundamental contributions to the theory of
  real-time systems verification.
* The CAV award is an annual award given for a specific fundamental
  contribution or a series of outstanding contributions to the field
  of Computer Aided Verification.  
* The CAV award carries a $10,000 prize and was presented at this
  year's CAV conference on July 10, 2008, in Princeton, New Jersey.
  This is the first year that the CAV award is given.
* The 2008 CAV award is given for the seminal 1990 article on
  "Automata for modeling real-time systems" by Alur and Dill.  This
  article laid the theoretical foundation for the computer aided
  verification of real-time systems, which are computer systems that
  are expected to finish their computations by specific
  deadlines. With the increasing ubiquity of embedded computers, which
  control everything from aircraft to medical devices, there is an
  urgent need for a rigorous methodology that can ensure that such
  systems operate without failures.
*  During the late 1980's there were several attempts to extend the
  theory of computer aided verification to real-time systems.  Alur
  and Dill's work put this research direction on a firm foundational
  footing.  In particular, the formalism of Timed Automata introduced
  by Alur and Dill in their 1990 paper has become the standard model
  for the verification of real-time systems.  The 1990 paper of Alur
  and Dill is among the most cited papers in Computer Aided
  Verification.
* Detailed announcement can be found on the CAV 08 website 
  (www.princeton.edu/cav2008).
