Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 08-Mar-2008 


Meeting Description

The CSLP 2008 Workshop addresses the question of constraints and language
processing from an interdisciplinary perspective. Constraints are widely used in
linguistics, computer science, and psychology. How they are used, however,
varies widely according to the research domain: natural language processing,
knowledge representation, cognitive modelling, problem solving mechanisms, etc.
The purpose is to pursue a paradigm, unifying the different approaches into a
common framework capable of explaining how constraints play a role in
representing, processing and acquiring linguistic information, and this from a
formal, technical, and cognitive perspective. 


Call for Papers

The topics include, but are not limited to, constraint-based linguistic
theories, constraints in human language comprehension and production, context
modelling and discourse interpretation, acquisition of constraints,
probabilistic constraint-based reasoning, constraint satisfaction technologies
and constraint logic programming.


Submission

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 12 pages in PDF format. The
font size must be at least 10 pt when printed on A4 paper. It is recommended
that the LaTeX ''article'' style is used. Previously published papers cannot be
accepted. The submissions will be reviewed by the program committee.

The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI.
One author for each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present
the paper.

Proceedings are printed as a technical report (with ISSN no.) and made available
online. Selected and extended papers will be included in a volume of Studies in
Computational Intelligence published by Springer.

Please use the CSLP 2008 submission page handled by the EasyChair conference
system.

Linguistic Field(s): Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 25-Jan-2008 


Meeting Description

Formal Semantics in Moscow is an annual workshop devoted to the formal semantics
and pragmatics of natural language. 


Call for Papers

The 4th Formal Semantics in Moscow workshop (FSIM 4) will be held in Moscow on
April 5-6, at ABBYY Production. 
The extended deadline for submission is January 25. 


The Invited Speakers are: 

Carmen Dobrovie-Sorin (CNRS, Universite Paris 7)
Manfred Krifka (ZAS, Humboldt University)

We invite submissions of abstracts for 30-minute presentations followed by
10-minute discussion on any topic pertaining to formal semantics and formal
pragmatics of natural language. 
Each author may be involved in at most two submissions and may be the sole
author of at most one submission. Abstracts should be anonymous and should not
exceed 2 pages. To submit an abstract, please send an e-mail to
fsim4.submissions@gmail.com with your abstract attached as a .pdf (preferably)
or Microsoft Word file. If you use Word, please save your file in the .rtf
format. In the body of the message please specify your name, affiliation, and
the title of the paper. Notifications of acceptance will be sent by late February.

The annual FSiM workshop was originally started as a place for young researchers
from the field of formal semantics and pragmatics to present their work in a
lively and friendly setting. So while the workshop today is not restricted to
only young and/or student researchers, papers by young researchers are
especially welcome. 
There is no registration fee for the workshop. Crash space will be available
upon request.

There are two satellite workshops in Moscow this April: FSIM 4 (April 5-6) and
Syntactic Structures 2, to be held on April 3-4, a conference devoted to syntax
of natural language, but not limited to a single paradigm, allowing to meet both
people studying syntax from a more theoretical perspective and those taking a
more typology-based and hands-on-data direction. One may find more information
on Syntactic Structures 2 at http://syntactic-structures.ru


FSIM 4 Organizing Committee:

Igor Yanovich (Moscow State University, ABBYY Production)
Anna Pazelskaya (ABBYY Production)
Peter Arkadyev (Institute of Slavic Studies of Russian Academy of Sciences)

Barbara H. Partee (UMass Amherst) - Honorary Mentor of the Organizing Committee.
