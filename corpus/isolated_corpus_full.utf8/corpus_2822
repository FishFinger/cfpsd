MLMI 2008 second call for papers (apologies for multiple postings):



                5th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI 2008)

                         8-10 September 2008
                       Utrecht, The Netherlands
                                   
                        http://www.mlmi.info
                                   

The fifth MLMI workshop will be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands,
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005),
Washington (2006) and Brno (2007).  The MLMI joint multi-disciplinary
workshops bring together researchers from the different communities
working on the common theme of advanced machine learning algorithms
applied to multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction.

MLMI 2008 will also feature a special session on user requirements and
evaluation of meeting browsers, and the AMI Career Day.


*Important dates*

Submission of papers/posters: Monday, 31 March 2008
Acceptance notifications: Monday, 12 May 2008
Camera-ready versions of papers: Monday, 16 June 2008
Workshop: 8-10 September 2008


*Workshop topics*

MLMI 2008 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers),
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine
learning and multimodal interaction:

  - human-human communication modeling
  - audio-visual perception of humans
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above

The special session on user requirements and evaluation of meeting
assistants/browsers has a separate call for papers with additional
topics and a later deadline (check
http://www.mlmi.info/index.php?id=special_session).


*Satellite events*

MLMI 2008 will feature the AMI Career Day
(http://www.mlmi.info/index.php?id=ami_career_day).  To propose other
special sessions or satellite events, please contact the special
session chair.

MLMI 2008 is broadly collocated with a number of events in related
domains: Mobile HCI 2008, 2-5 September, in Amsterdam; FG 2008, 17-19
September, in Amsterdam; ECML 2008, 15-19 September, in Antwerp; and
Measuring Behavior 2008, 26-29 August, in Maastricht.


*Guidelines for submission*

The workshop proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series.  The first four editions of MLMI were
published as LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299, and 4892.  However, unlike
previous MLMIs, the proceedings of MLMI 2008 will be printed before
the workshop and will be already available onsite to MLMI 2008
participants.

Submissions are invited either as long papers (12 pages) or as short
papers (6 pages), and may include a demonstration proposal.  Upon
acceptance of a paper, the Program Committee will also assign to it a
presentation format, oral or poster, taking into account: (a) the most
suitable format given the content of the paper; (b) the length of the
paper (long papers are more likely to be presented orally); (c) the
preferences expressed by the authors.

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi08/, following the Springer LNCS format
for proceedings and other multi-author volumes
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=5-164-7-72376-0)..
Please indicate in the comments for the PC if a demo is intended, and
if the paper is a special session submission.  Camera-ready versions
of accepted papers, both long and short, are required to follow the
LNCS guidelines and to take into account the reviewers' comments.
Authors of accepted short papers are encouraged to turn them into long
papers for the proceedings.


*Venue*

Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands, with historic
roots back to the Roman Empire.  Utrecht hosts one of the bigger
universities in the country, and with its historic centre and the many
students it provides an excellent atmosphere for social activities in-
or outside the workshop community.  Utrecht is centrally located in
the Netherlands, and has direct train connections to the major cities
and Schiphol International Airport.

TNO, organizer of MLMI 2008, is a not-for-profit research organization.
  TNO speech technological research is carried out in Soesterberg, at
TNO Human Factors, and has research areas in ASR, speaker and language
recognition, and word and event spotting.

The workshop will be held in "Ottone", a beautiful old building near
the "Singel", the canal which encircles the city center.  The
conference hall combines a spacious setting with a warm and friendly
ambiance.
