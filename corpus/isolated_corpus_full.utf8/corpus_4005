CALL FOR PAPERS <br><br>
Papers and workshops are invited on all topics belonging to the field of
linguistics. Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes question
time. <br><br>
We particularly welcome proposals for workshops, which should contain (i)
an outline of the theme and (ii) a provisional list of workshop
participants and their topics (see also below). We encourage workshop
convenors to distribute an open call for papers on the LinguistList and
other fora. For workshop submissions or questions, use
<a href=3D"mailto:sle@arts.kuleuven.be">sle@arts.kuleuven.be</a> . <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Paper abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and
should state research questions, approach, method, data and (expected)
results. Abstracts will be reviewed anonymously. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The <b>deadline</b> for the submission of workshop proposals is <b>15
December 2008</b>. Notification of acceptance will follow within the
week. The deadline for all abstracts (both for the general session and
workshops) is <b>31 January 2009</b>. Notification of acceptance will be
given by <b>31 March 2009</b>. <br><br>
Submit your title through the
<a href=3D"http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/conference/admin/SubmitAbstractSL=
E">
Submit Abstract</a> form and email your abstract as an attachment to
<a href=3D"mailto:sle@arts.kuleuven.be">sle@arts.kuleuven.be</a>. The
abstract should not mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or
addresses. Abstracts are preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your
abstract contains special symbols, please include a pdf version as well.
<br><br>
WORKSHOPS<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Since we would like all conference participants to be able to attend
individual workshop presentations, SLE workshops have to be compatible
with the main conference programme. This means that the format of the
workshops must be organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10
min. discussion). Each workshop should comprise: <br>
&nbsp;=20
<ol>
<li>An introductory paper by the convenor(s) or by a key-note speaker. It
should summarize previous research, specify the approaches to be found in
the workshop and explain the scope of the papers to be given.=20
<li>At least 6 papers (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). The preference is
for one-day workshops, but two-day workshops may also be considered.=20
<li>A slot for final discussion on topics covered by the papers,
methodological issues and questions for future research.=20
</ol>&nbsp;<br>

excursion to Sintra and Cascais. Further information will be given in the
second circular. <br><br>
TRANSPORT<br><br>
The Lisbon airport (Aeroporto da Portela) is located on the outskirts of
the city, so that it is a short distance to the Cidade Universit=E1ria
(where most Faculties are, including the Faculdade de Letras): ca 5 to 10
min. by taxi. The city centre itself is just ca 30 min. by Aerobus or 20
min. by taxi.<br><br>
There is a direct link by Aerobus from the airport to the city centre
(from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., every 20 min; ticket: 3 Euros). The first two
stops (Entre Campos and Campo Pequeno) serve most of the hotels that are
close to the University; the trip to these stops takes ca. 10 min.
Alternatively, you can take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (from 6
to 12 Euros for most hotels, depending on the distance; for hotels near
Entre Campos or Campo Pequeno, about 6 to 9 Euros.).<br><br>
