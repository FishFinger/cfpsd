Meeting Description:

Research in Sign Linguistics in the past several decades has enabled us to 
begin to unravel the properties of sign languages as natural languages, with 
all the complexity and expressive powers found in spoken languages. 

The 'Conference on Sign Linguistics, Deaf Education and Deaf Culture in Asia', 
held in the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2001 marked the beginning of an 
era of sign language research in Asia. Now, a decade later, it is time to take
stock of the progress and the development of this field. Towards this end, the
Conference on Sign Linguistics and Deaf Education in Asia aims at providing a
forum for sign language researchers who work on Asian sign languages to share
their research and to exchange information about the situation for sign
linguistics and sign language research in their respective countries and
regions. In addition, this conference aims at examining the development of
models of deaf education in Asia that include sign language.

the Asian context are welcome:
