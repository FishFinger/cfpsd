CALL FOR CHAPTERS

Handbook of Research on Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments:
Trends and Perspectives

A book edited by:
Dr. Fulvio Mastrogiovanni, University of Genova, Italy
Prof. Nak-Young Chong, JAIST, Japan

Introduction

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a multidisciplinary approach aimed at enriching
physical environments with a network of distributed devices, such as sensors,
actuators, and computational resources, in order to support humans in achieving
their everyday activities. These can range from helping busy businessmen in
increasing their productivity to supporting activities of daily living for
elderly and people with special needs, such as people suffering from cognitive
impairments or physical injuries. AmI represents the convergence of recent
achievements in communications technologies (e.g., sensor networks and
distributed computing), industrial electronics (e.g., the miniaturization
process affecting computational devices, such as wearable sensors), pervasive
computing, intelligent user interfaces (e.g., alternative communication media
such as eyesÂ’ gaze and speech) and artificial intelligence (e.g., knowledge
representation and context or situation awareness), to name a few. AmI is not
only the superimposition of these disciplines, but it is a major effort to
integrate and make them really useful for everyday human life.

Objective of the Book

The handbook is aimed at covering cutting-edge aspects involved in the effective
design, realization and implementation of a comprehensive AmI application. In
particular, it can be considered a conceptual path originating from the
consideration of human aspects that are involved in the design of an AmI system
through the effective reasoning and acting capabilities that AmI systems must
have to operate in the real-world to support humans.

Target Audience

The handbook will be targeted at researchers and practitioners in Ambient
Intelligence. However, since AmI per se originates from the conjunction of many
research and technological fields the handbook will also be useful for
researchers and practitioners in ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial
intelligence, sensor networks and related technologies, knowledge
representation, automated reasoning and learning, system and software
engineering, and man-machine interfaces. Furthermore, for its practical
implications interested readers should also be acquainted with issues related
to eldercare, tele-medicine, gerontechnology and assisted living technologies
for people with disabilities.

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

Human aspects.
Sensing.
Activity recognition.
Knowledge representation.
Context awareness.
Reasoning.
Sensible interaction.
Architectural aspects and infrastructure.

Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before April 5, 2009,
a 2-3 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the mission and concerns of his
or her proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals will be notified by
April 30, 2009 about the status of their proposals and sent chapter guidelines.
Full chapters are expected to be submitted by June 30, 2009. All submitted
chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis. This book is
scheduled to be published by IGI Global (formerly Idea Group Inc.), publisher
of the "Information Science Reference" (formerly Idea Group Reference and
"Medical Information Science Reference" imprints. For additional information
regarding the publisher, please visit www.igi-global.com.

Important Dates:

April 5, 2009: Proposal Submission Deadline
April 30, 2009: Notification of Acceptance
June 30, 2009: Full Chapter Submission
August 15, 2009: Review Result Returned
