Meeting Description:

The Role of Phonology in Reading Acquisition
Workshop at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f端r
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS)

A highly controversial issue in reading research is the role of phonology in
visual word identification. Whereas some researchers argue that the decoding of
written words by means of grapheme-phoneme-correspondences is an essential
requirement for access to the mental lexicon, other researchers posit that words
which are familiar, i.e. that have been decoded before, can be associated with
their meaning directly on the basis of their stored orthographic form.
Although this controversy is important for the issue how reading is taught in
primary schools it still remains unsettled. Thus whereas the whole-word approach
in reading acquisition is based on the assumption that phonology does not play a
crucial role in reading, the now popular phonics approach relies on the teaching
of phoneme-grapheme-correspondences.
A solution of this underlying controversy is crucial for evaluating and
improving the methods applied in reading acquisition. The goal of this workshop
is to contribute to this controversy and discuss the issue which rule phonology
plays in reading acquisition. 
We will therefore discuss for example

- how reading acquisition proceeds in different languages,
- which conclusions with respect to the above mentioned controversy can be drawn
from reading acquisition data,
- how and to what extent children learning to read in different orthographies
differ with respect to reading acquisition, 
- how experimental findings may help improving the teaching of reading in schools. 

The role of phonology in reading acquisition.
Workshop at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f端r
Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS)

Location: Bamberg, Germany
Start Date: February 28, 2008 - End Date: February 29, 2008

This workshop is intended for researchers working in the areas of visual word
recognition and reading acquisition either from an experimental, theoretical or
applied perspective. Note, however, that all talks should address the importance
of their findings for reading acquisition.

Presentations will be 20 or 40 minutes plus 10 respectively 15 minutes for
discussion depending on the number of abstracts accepted.
