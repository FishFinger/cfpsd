  CALL FOR EVALUATION RESOURCES



 LREC2008 - Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions (MWE =20
2008)=20

  endorsed by the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)


Date: Sunday, 1 June 2008
Location: Marrakech, Morocco

Workshop web page: http://multiword.sf.net/mwe2008/

########################################################

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our =20
understanding of
multiword expressions (MWE), the development of algorithms for their =20
automatic
extraction from corpora, and the automatic identification of additional
properties such as morphosyntactic preferences or the interpretation of
semi-compositional expressions.

It is difficult to compare results of the many published studies on =20
MWEs and
obtain a broader perspective, though, because algorithms and implemented
systems have been evaluated on vastly different gold standards and =20
corpora, in
different languages, for different subtypes of MWEs, etc. In order to =20
make the
next big step forward, the field of MWE research needs a shared task =20
in which
different approaches are applied to the same data sets, allowing =20
completely
new insights to be gained. Since there is as yet not a clear and =20
universally
accepted definition of multiword expressions, the first instalment of =20
this
shared task will be of a more exploratory nature than the competitions =20
that
have been carried out in other areas of computational linguistics.

The MWE 2008 workshop is primarily intended as a forum for collecting, =20
sharing
and exploiting MWE evaluation resources.  We solicit contributions of =20
such
resources from the MWE community, in particular:

  (1) manually annotated data sets (MWE candidates marked as true and =20
false
      positives, or as different subtypes of MWEs);

  (2) data sets of MWEs annotated with additional properties; and

  (3) lists of known MWEs, e.g. from machine-readable dictionaries.

In addition, candidate data obtained from corpora with sophisticated
proprietary NLP tools may be of interest, helping researchers to apply =20
their
statistical MWE identification techniques to a broad range of languages.

The contributed resources will be made available freely for research =20
purposes
on multiword.sf.net, and should be accompanied by documentation (e.g.
annotation guidelines) on the SourceForge project wiki. Contributors =20
will be
invited to submit a short paper (4 pages) describing their resource and
summarising previous research carried out on these data.

After collection of the resources, teams participating in the shared =20
task can
evaluate their MWE extraction algorithms on multiple data sets and =20
discuss
implications for their generalisability and further development. At the
workshop, the evaluation results of the different teams will be =20
summarised and
compared. A call for papers and participation in the shared task is =20
being
distributed separately.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

If you are interested in contributing a MWE evaluation resource to our
initiative, please contact us by e-mail to make further arrangements.

If you have a SourceForge account, you will be able to upload the =20
resource yourself
and document it on the project wiki.

Resource submission deadline: February 1, 2008
Paper submission deadline: February 29, 2008
Notification of acceptance: March 28, 2008
Camera-ready papers due: April 4, 2008
Workshop date: June 1, 2008
