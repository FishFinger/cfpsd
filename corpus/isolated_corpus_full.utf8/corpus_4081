The First International ICST Conference on Security and Privacy in Mobile Information and Communication Systems (MobiSec 2009) June 3-5, 2009,Turin, Italy http://www.mobisec.org

Sponsored by ICST
Technically Co-sponsored by Create-NET

**** Submission Deadline -- February 2, 2009 ****
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE

The convergence of information and communication technology is most palpable in the form of intelligent mobile devices, accompanied by the advent of converged, and next-generation, communication networks. As mobile communication and information processing becomes a commodity, economy and society require protection of this precious resource.
MobiSec brings together leading-edge researchers from academia and industry in the field of mobile systems security and privacy, as well as practitioners, standards developers and policymakers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

PAPERS

Technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not currently under review by another conference or journal, are solicited. MobiSec solicits original, high-quality research contributions in the form of full papers. The focus is on the security of information and communication systems including mobile networks, devices and applications. Papers from other areas, e.g., formal methods, cryptography, database security, operating system security, will be considered if a clear connection to one of the topics below is demonstrated.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following focus areas, as applied to mobile ICT:
* Security architectures for next-generation, new-generation, and converged communication networks
* Trusted mobile devices, hardware security
* Network resilience
* Threat analyses for mobile systems
* Multi-hop authentication and trust
* Non-repudiation of communication
* Context-aware and data-centric security
* Protection and safety of distributed mobile data
* Mobile application security
* Security for voice and multimedia communication
* Machine-to-machine communication security
* Trust in autonomic and opportunistic communication
* Location based applications security and privacy
* Security for the networked home environment
* Security and privacy for mobile communities
* Mobile emergency communication, public safety
* Lawful interception and mandatory data retention
* Security of mobile agents and code
* Idenity management
* Embedded security
----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFERENCE VENUE

Star Hotels Majestic Turin

The hotel is located in downtown Turin, just a short distance from the historical center of town, from the famous shopping streets and opposite the Railway Station of Porta Nuova. Turin was built in a baroque, Liberty and quite seducive style, perfectly interpreted by the elegant 4 stars hotel, which was just recently renovated. Ideal for meetings and events, it offers 10 rooms with a maximum capacity of 484 delegates.
