Full Title: Romanitas, Romance Languages and Literatures 


Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics;Language Documentation;Ling & Literature 

Call Deadline: 30-Nov-2009 

Call for Papers for Romanitas April 2010 issue
Topic: Language preservation, rescue, and revival


Today many languages are in danger of disappearing from the face of the
earth (Nettle, 2000). Due to the increasing power of a small number of 
languages spoken by large groups with social prestige or control of
economic resources, 'smaller' languages are vanishing at a rapid rate.
Crystal (2000) estimates that only 600 of the 6,000+ languages in the world
will survive the threat of extinction.  Language death detaches people from
their cultural heritage and leads to loss of community identity. The
dominant culture is also deprived of the diversity that is the foundation
of human cultural creativity, knowledge, and change (Dalby, 2003; Harrison,
2007).

Fortunately, linguists, anthropologists, sociologists, folklorists,
indigenous leaders, and others are rising to the challenge and fomenting
projects to reverse language decline (Hinton & Hale, 2001). There are
projects all around the world dedicated to raising language awareness in
endangered speech communities, documenting languages that are on the verge
of disappearing, facilitating language reacquisition and revival, and
supporting local efforts to establish bilingual programs, literacy
programs, and other forms of language rescue.

Romanitas is a  multilingual, peer-reviewed, online academic journal based
at the University of Puerto Rico. It is dedicated to the study of Romance
languages, literatures, and cultures. Its April 2010 special issue (which
will also be published in traditional printed format) seeks to collect
articles reporting on language preservation and revival projects in speech
communities where a Romance language is a factor (e.g., South America,
Central America, North America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Philippines,
North Africa,  etc.). The language that is being rescued may be a Romance
variety or an indigenous language that is threatened by a hegemonic Romance
language. 

Articles should be written in Spanish, French, Portuguese or English.
Please send contributions (no more than 30 pages including bibliography and
appendices) in electronic form to Dr. Alicia Pousada (English Department,
UPR, RÃ­o Piedras) at: pousada.a@gmail.com. Manuscripts should include an
abstract in the language of the article plus another in one of the other
languages of publication. Authors should follow the Romanitas style
protocol which can be found at:
http://humanidades.uprrp.edu/romanitas/english/style.html . 

The deadline for submission is: November 30, 2009.
