Meeting Description:

Linguistic & Psycholinguistic Approaches to Text Structuring
(LPTS 2009)

Ecole Normale Supérieure, 45 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris, France
September 21-23 2009

The aim of the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary forum to present
and discuss recent work on markers of discourse structure: adverbials,
connectives, discourse particles, etc. How can we categorize these markers? What
kind of relations do they express? Can they combine several functions at the
sentence level and/ or at the discourse level and, if so, which ones? What
impact do discourse structure markers have on comprehension? When and how are
they acquired? From what age are children able to master their use in oral and
written discourse?

The goal of the conference is more specifically to advance research into the
relationship between the position of the markers concerned and their ability to
play a role in discourse organization. Do these markers have a privileged
position? We know that sentence initial position is a strategic position in
terms of information structuring/packaging and memory. But can these factors
override the word order constraints of each language? Are there also observable
variations between discourse genres and between written and oral modes? 

Invited Speakers:
Peter Crompton (American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates)
Tuomas Huumo (University of Turku, Finland)
Tuija Virtanen (Åbo Akademi University Department Of English, Finland)
Isabelle Tapiéro (University of Lyon 2 - EMC, France)
Yves Bestgen (FNRS - UCL, Belgium - representing the psycholinguistic group of
the Spatial Framing Adverbials project) 

Last Call for Papers

We invite papers using cognitive and functional approaches, based on corpora in
different languages at different stages of their evolution, as well as papers
that report on psycholinguistic approaches based on behavioural data.

Topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Segmentation and linearization
- Initial positioning
- Saliency and Information Structure
- Grammaticalization and evolution of structure markers 
- Typological approach to structure markers 
- Spatial and temporal discourse structure
- Effects of discourse organization markers on comprehension
- Acquisition and mastery of their use in discourse production 
- Role of text structuring devices in acquiring knowledge
