Dear Colleague
you are invited to submit a paper at the Workshop on:

*Intelligent Analysis and Processing of Web News Content
http://patterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/News-Content-Workshop
*

*September 15, 2009*

at the Conferences

Web Intelligence (WI'09)<http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/WI09/WIhome.htm>
Intelligent Agent Technology
(IAT'09)<http://www.wi-iat09.disco.unimib.it/IAT09/IAThome.htm>


The content of news outlets - increasingly available freely online -
contains

information of immense scientific and commercial potential, as well as
belonging
to a very specific genre of textual data.

The content of news outlets is both a relatively focused domain, largely
looking at the same set of events, and at the same time unstructured and
open
ended. The understanding and analysis of news content - be it text or
speech,
mono or multi lingual, etc - is a challenging and promising line of
research, with
its own specific features and character.

Various projects exist in this direction, aimed either at simple
aggregation,
or at translation, or summarisation, or content analysis of news. We will
gather
the scientific and technical community working on these applications to
discuss
scientific and technological aspects, lessons learnt, and open problems in
this
growing field, at the intersection of information extraction, machine
learning,
machine translation, pattern discovery, etc.

Technologies in this area span the entire domain of Pattern Analysis: from
indexing to information extraction, from speech recognition to machine
transla-
tion, from pattern discovery to text generation and summarisation, to
network
patterns analysis. Besides connecting to user modelling and personalisation,
the method also is a form of open source intelligence - see the applications
to
epidemic detection for example. The key goal of the meeting is the sharing
of
experiences, and the comparison of results solutions, and long term goals.
