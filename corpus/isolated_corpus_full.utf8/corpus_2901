Full Title: Diversity in Language Corpora 

Date: 22-Apr-2009 - 24-Apr-2009
Location: Basel, Switzerland 
Contact Person: Christoph Schoen
Meeting Email: christoph.schoen@unibas.ch
Web Site: http://www.schweizer-textkorpus.ch/

Language Family(ies): Germanic 

Call Deadline: 31-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

In October 2008 the SWISS TEXT CORPUS project will be completed and be made available online (www.schweizer-textkorpus.ch) as part of a corpus of the German language. It contains German texts from a wide range of different text types of 20th century Switzerland. The German seminar of the University of Basel takes stock at the end of this project and is pleased to announce a conference with the title Diversity in language corpora. The aim of the conference is to investigate the different dynamic fields of work that deal with language corpora.

The word 'diversity' in the title of the conference refers not only to the diversity of the corpus from a historical or contextual point of view or the diversity of the various kinds of texts and the conditions of their production and reception, but it also refers to the theoretical, technical and practical insights which were gained in the course of the project. 'Diversity' also adresses the various academic disciplines with which the language corpus came into contact as well as the various possibilities of use that the corpus offers.

On the one hand, the conference aims to present to the public the SWISS TEXT CORPUS and its partner projects in Germany (Berlin), Austria (Vienna) and Italy (Bolzano). On the other hand it aims to locate the completed corpus within a bigger framework and wants to provide a forum for a dialogue with current debates in related disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, lexicography, digitization and computer science.

The conference will be held at the 'Bildungszentrum der mission21' (Missionsstrasse 21, CH-4055 Basel), from 22 to 24 April.
More information can be found on the following website: www.schweizer-textkorpus.ch 

Call for Papers
