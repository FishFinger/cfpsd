"The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current
one, in which information is given
well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in
cooperation.
Berners-Lee et al., The Semantic Web, Scientific American, 2001.


Soon a decade will have passed since the publication of this article,
but the original vision of the Semantic Web still
remains to a large extent unrealised. Web-scale automated computer
interaction and intelligent information processing
technology producing added value for humans still have to become
reality. Nevertheless, the Semantic Web community,
academia as well as industry, were very active during the past decade
and their efforts resulted in a wide range of
maturing methodologies, methods, and tools for creating, processing,
managing and using semantic content, be that
ontologies or RDF data. A critical mass of useful semantic content is,
however, missing; one can only find very few,
well-maintained and up-to-date domain ontologies on the Web and even
though recently growing, the amount of RDF data
publicly available is limited compared to the size of the traditional Web.

One reason for this state of affairs is the lack of user involvement in
semantic content creation tasks.
Only a small number of Web users, typically members of the Semantic Web
community, annotate their Web resources
semantically or build and publish ontologies. This is a sharp contrast
to several Web 2.0 applications, such as Wikipedia,
Del.icio.us, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook or LinkedIn, which exhibit great
popularity and user involvement and
generate huge amounts of data at comparatively low costs and
impressively high quality. To encourage large-scale
user participation, the Semantic Web community has to look into
incentive structures and means to motivate humans to
become part of the Semantic Web movement and to contribute their
knowledge and time to create useful ontologies and
to use these in annotating documents, images, videos or even Web services.

In this special issue, we aim to present approaches that tackle the
incentive bottleneck in semantic content creation.
In particular we are looking for high quality research papers describing
the way humans can be effectively involved
in the development of useful ontologies, and the generation of massive
amounts of RDF annotations of resources.


================
Subject Coverage
================

Topics of interest for the prospective special issue include, but are
not limited to:

     * Motivations and incentives of several Web 2.0 applications and
their application and applicability to
       the Semantic Web and semantic applications.
     * Incentive structures both within enterprise intranets and the
open Web and their semantic extensions.
     * Games with a purpose for the creation of semantic content,
ontologies as well as RDF data.
     * Tools and applications exploiting collective intelligence and the
"Wisdom of Crowds" in the context of semantic
       technologies, and their respective incentive structures.
     * Community-driven semantic applications.
     * Empirical studies on the usage of Web 2.0 principles to encourage
large-scale user participation in Semantic
       Web-related tasks.
     * Instruments to derive and estimate the value of semantic
technologies from quantitative and qualitative criteria.
     * Experience reports and models of the benefits of semantic
technologies.
