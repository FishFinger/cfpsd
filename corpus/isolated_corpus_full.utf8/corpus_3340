Call Deadline: 15-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

Expanding Literacy Studies is an International, Interdisciplinary Conference for
Graduate Students to be held April 3-5, 2009, at The Ohio State University.
Addressing the need for an expanded conversation about literacy that exceeds
disciplinary boundaries, this conference is a space for graduate and
professional students from all fields to ask questions, consider directions,
examine representations, make connections, and share investigations of literacy,
broadly defined. 

Call for Proposals
 
Expanding Literacy Studies is an International, Interdisciplinary Conference for
Graduate Students to be held April 3-5, 2009, at The Ohio State University.
 
Literacy Studies is a recent construct. At the same time, it addresses
long-standing questions and concerns within and across disciplines. But what is
literacy? Who is studying it? And how is it being studied?
 
Literacy is traditionally defined as reading and writing. Contemporary
constructs, however, include everything from cyber and health literacy to
mathematical and visual literacy. The potential advance this broadened view
might represent is complicated by historical myths about literacy, persistent
fears about declines in literacy, and failure to connect literacy research
across disciplines.
 
Addressing the need for an expanded conversation about literacy that exceeds
disciplinary boundaries, this conference is a space for graduate and
professional students from all fields to ask questions, consider directions,
examine representations, make connections, and share investigations of literacy,
broadly defined. This conference aims to expand the dialogue and explore the
landscape and intersections of literacy studies as a framework of critical
investigation. This approach is meant to do the double work of expanding the
field while critiquing the expansion. To that end, we invite proposals from
graduate and professional students in all fields.

- health literacy

Ways to Collaborate:

website immediately. Visit the site to connect with people who have submitted
requests and/or submit your own request for collaborators. Please include a

Conference Special Features:
Keynote Panel with Harvey J. Graff: ''Responses to The Literacy Myth: 30 Years
Later''
In honor of the 30th Anniversary of the publication of The Literacy Myth:
Literacy and Social Structure in the Nineteenth Century, author Harvey J. Graff
will respond to a panel of graduate students from various disciplines speaking
about ''the literacy myth''. Harvey J. Graff is currently Ohio Eminent Scholar
in Literacy Studies and Professor of English and History at The Ohio State
University.
 
Interactive Workshop by Participatory Design pioneer Liz Sanders
Senior Lecturer in the Department of Design at Ohio State and President of
MakeTools (a design research firm), Liz Sanders is a pioneer in the use of
participatory research methods for the design of products, systems, services,
and spaces. Sanders speaks about and teaches human-centered design to students,
clients, and colleagues around the world. She will lead conference participants
in an interactive workshop about the future of literacy, as a reflection of and
closure for the conference.
 
Plenary Presentation by Shirley Brice Heath, author of Ways with Words Heath is
a sociolinguist and anthropologist whose primary interests are oral and written
language, youth development, racial relations, organizational learning, and the
relationships among aesthetics, cognition, and human development. At the heart
of Heath's research are the organizational structures and cultural values and
behaviors that surround the learning and use of language. She is the author of
the prize-winning book Ways with Words: Language, Life, and Work in Communities
and Classrooms (1983) and co-editor of Identity and Inner-city Youth: Beyond
Ethnicity and Gender (1993), as well as several other books and over 100
articles and book chapters. Heath is Professor at Large for the Watson Institute
for International Studies at Brown University and Margery Bailey Professor
Emerita at Stanford University.
