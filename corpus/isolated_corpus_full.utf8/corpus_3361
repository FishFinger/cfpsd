Meeting Description:

The department of Linguistics and English Language at the University of
Edinburgh is proud to announce that the sixth Old World Conference in Phonology
(OCP6) will take place in Edinburgh from 22nd to 24th January 2009. OCP6 is
organised by a group of phonologists at Edinburgh, and it follows in the line of
previous OCP conferences, which have been held in Leiden, Troms√∏, Budapest,
Rhodes and Toulouse. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts for consideration for presentation as either talks or poster papers at
the conference are now invited. 

Invited speakers:
B. Elan Dresher (University of Toronto)
Jennifer Hay (University of Canterbury)
Marc van Oostendorp (Meertens Instituut & Leiden University)

The conference will be preceded by a semi-separate workshop entitled ''the
Privative Project: is it still worth pursuing?'' This workshop is organised by
Bert Botma (Leiden) and Patrick Honeybone (Edinburgh) and further details will
be available soon. Those attending the conference will be very welcome to attend
the workshop, too. Abstracts addressing issues related to the workshop theme
will be welcome at the main conference, but there is no conference theme for
OCP6 at all, and abstracts on any phonological issue (theoretical or empirical)
in any language(s) and in any phonological framework are invited, as are
abstracts which deal with connections between phonology and psycholinguistics or
sociolinguistics.

Abstract Submission:

This is a summary - please consult the website for full details
www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ocp6

There is no obligatory conference theme - abstracts can be submitted on
anything. Abstracts should be sent to Patrick Honeybone as attachments to an
email (patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk) by 15th September 2008.

Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm or one inch
margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal
character spacing.

Please send two copies of your abstract - one of these should be anonymous and
one should include your name, affiliation and email address at the top of the
page, directly below the title. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by
members of the organising committee.

Please use one of these formats for your abstract: pdf, Word, or plain text. If
you need to use a phonetic font in your abstract, either embed it in a pdf file,
or use the Doulos SIL font.

Full papers will last around 25 minutes with around 5 minutes for questions, and
we also have plans for a high-profile poster session. Please indicate whether
you would prefer to present your work only as an oral paper or a poster, or
whether you would be prepared to present it in either form.

If you need technical equipment for your talk, please say so in the message
accompanying your abstract and we will do our best to provide it, although this
cannot be guaranteed.

We aim to finalise the programme, and to contact abstract-senders by around the
end of September

Further important details concerning abstract submission are available on the
conference website - please make sure that you consult these before submitting
an abstract: www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ocp6

Contact Details:
The main organiser for OCP6 is Patrick Honeybone. If you would like to attend or
if you have any queries about the conference, please feel free to get in touch
(patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk).
