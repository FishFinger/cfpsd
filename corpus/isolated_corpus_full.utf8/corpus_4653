Meeting Description:

We are pleased to announce the First Vigo-Newcastle-Santiago-Leuven
International Workshop on  'The Structure of the Noun Phrase in English':
Synchronic and Diachronic Explorations' (NP1), to be held at the University of
Vigo (Spain) on 2-3 October 2009. 

Call for Papers

Although there exists an enormous literature on many aspects of nouns and noun
phrases (NPs) in English, there are still fundamental issues in their structure
and distribution that remain unsolved. These involve matters like the structural
relations between different types of NP elements, the relation between internal
and external properties of NPs, the parallels (or lack thereof) between verbal
and nominal constituents, the factors responsible for the textual frequencies of
various NP-related phenomena, and the contribution of different types of NPs to
the information structure of texts. This workshop aims at bringing together
researchers who are currently looking at the English NP from different points of
view (theoretical, structural, functional, textual and descriptive).

We would therefore like to invite presentations concerned with any topic
involving NPs, including the following:
- NP complexity: the relationship between grammatical function and NP complexity
- NP types, including binominal phrases, discontinuous NPs and possessive
constructions
- the structural representation of NPs and their constituents 
- strategies of premodification, postmodification and complementation in the NP
- apposition in the NP
- headedness and NPs
- the exploration of the implications of particular theoretical frameworks for
NP structure: diachronic, syntactic, construction-based, cognitive perspectives
on all of the above
 
Invited Speakers:
- Douglas Biber (Northern Arizona University)
- William Croft (University of New Mexico)
- Evelien Keizer (Universiteit van Amsterdam)
- John Payne (The University of Manchester)

Abstracts must be submitted in MS Word or RTF format as an e-mail attachment to
np1@uvigo.es by 30 March 2009. The e-mail should use the subject header "NP1
abstract". Abstracts should be one page in length (single-spaced), excluding
references, and be written in standard 12-point font. The page should be headed
only by the title of the paper and not mention the presenter(s) nor their
affiliations or addresses. The accompanying e-mail should include:
(a) Title of the paper
(b) Name(s) of the author(s)
(c) Institutional affiliation(s)
(d) E-mail address(es)
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 30 April 2009.

Publication:
Authors of papers accepted for presentation will be invited to submit their
papers for publication in a special journal issue or volume with an
international publisher. Papers will be subjected to refereeing.

Important dates:
30 March 2009: Deadline for abstract submission
30 April 2009: Notification of acceptance or rejection
1 September: (Re-)Submission of 1-page abstract for conference booklet
2-3 October: Workshop at Vigo, Spain

Workshop organisation: NP1 is organised by the Language Variation and Textual
Categorisation (LVTC) research group at the University of Vigo
(http://lvtcuvigo.blogspot.com), in cooperation with:
- the School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics at the University
of Newcastle
- the VLCG Research Group at the University of Santiago de Compostela
- the Functional Linguistics Leuven (FLL) Research group at the University of
Leuven.

Providing there is sufficient interest, we anticipate having follow-up workshops
in later years.

Contact person: Javier Perez-Guerra (jperez@uvigo.es)

Workshop webpage: http://webs.uvigo.es/np1

This workshop is sponsored by the English Linguistics Circle (ELC), a network
coordinated by Professor Teresa Fanego involving four research groups based at
the Universities of Santiago de Compostela and Vigo (http://elc.org.es).

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.
