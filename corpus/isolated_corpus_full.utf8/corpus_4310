Reminder: Deadline for SIGIR Workshop Proposals

***SIGIR Workshop Proposals are due EARLIER this year than in the  
past! Please pay attention to the submission deadline: February 02,  
2009 and notification date: March 09, 2009.***

Proposals are solicited for one-day workshops to be held as part of  
the SIGIR Conference on July 23, 2009 (http://www.sigir2009.org/).  
Topics should match those identified in the SIGIR general call for  
participation (http://sigir2009.org/Calls).

SIGIR workshops provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a  
less formal and possibly more focused way than the conference itself.  
The format of each workshop is to be determined by the organizers, but  
it is expected that workshops will contain ample time for general  
discussion and engagement by all participants - not just those  
presenting papers. Workshops that foster collaboration, discussion,  
and group problem-solving are encouraged. Workshops that only involve  
the presentation of papers are discouraged.

Researchers and practitioners from all segments of the information  
retrieval community are invited to submit proposals for review. The  
organizers of approved workshops are expected to define the workshop's  
focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon final program  
content. Organizers (including co-organizers) are expected to attend  
their entire workshop and to provide an article for the SIGIR Forum  
summarizing the event.

Submission Guidelines

Submissions describing proposed workshops should include (1) the theme  
and purpose of the workshop; (2) motivation for the workshop and  
appropriateness to SIGIR; (3) planned activities and a tentative  
schedule of events; (4) selection process for participants and/or  
presenters and maximum number of participants (if limited); and (5)  
names of potential program committee members (if a program committee  
will be formed).

If the workshop has been held previously at SIGIR or another  
conference, then the organizers should indicate this and describe  
briefly past attendance and outcomes, and why another workshop is  
needed.

The submission should also include a short biographical sketch for  
each organizer, describing relevant qualifications and experience.

Proposals should be in pdf format and not exceed 1000 words. Proposals  
should be emailed to the 2009 SIGIR Workshop Chair, Diane Kelly  
(dianek [at] email.unc.edu).
