Meeting Description: 

XII SILEL- Simpósio Nacional de Letras e Lingüística
The 12th National Symposium on Language Studies and Linguistics

II  Simpósio Internacional de Letras e Lingüística
The 2nd International Symposium on Language Studies and Linguistics

The Institute of Letras and Linguistics of the Federal University of 
Uberlândia invites you to the 12th National Symposium on Language 
Studies and Linguistics and the 2nd International Symposium of Language 
Studies and Linguistics to be held from November 17th, 2009 to November 
19th, 2009 in the Santa Mônica Campus in the city of Uberlândia, MG, 
Brazil.  

SILEL is a biannual event that aims to provide a common interdisciplinary 
forum for researchers and scholars to debate and reflect on studies in the 
areas of Linguistics and Literary Studies. It is a unique opportunity to 
explore, share, and disseminate the ideas and works that help sustain and 
characterize the main research lines of these areas.

Its previous edition counted with 2639 participants from 26 Brazilian States 
and from 10 different countries. This variety of people and the vast scope of 
themes and discussions that resulted from it have added to the excellence 
of the event and strengthened the quality of the texts that have been 
published in the two volumes. We hope to repeat it in 2009. 

The Symposia will host conferences and round-tables with acknowledged 
researches from Brazil and other countries, oral communications from 
professors and graduate students, and panels from graduate and 
undergraduate students. Communications will be hosted within Thematic 
Groups (GTs) under the coordination of professors at institutions of higher 
education. Organization into Thematic Groups will provide a more 
productive environment for the discussions.

Official languages: Portuguese, English, French, Spanish

Key Dates:

Call for submissions - Thematic Sessions: March 02nd, 2009 - March 16th, 
2009. 
Call for oral communications in Thematic Sessions: March 31st, 2009 - May 
18th, 2009 
Call for Panel proposals: April 30th, 2009 - May 30th, 2009
