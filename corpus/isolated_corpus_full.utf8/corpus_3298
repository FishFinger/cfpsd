Call for Papers: Rice Working Papers in Linguistics

The Rice Linguistics Society (RLS) solicits submissions from all subfields
of theoretical linguistics for publication in the Rice Working Papers in
Linguistics. We especially welcome submissions in line with our
department's focus on functional, usage-based approaches to language study.
Graduate students and postdocs are strongly encouraged to submit. **The
deadline for submissions is September 1, 2008.**

Papers submitted to RLS's Working Papers must be previously unpublished
works. Copyright remains with the author(s) of the individual papers,
however, and publication in the Working Papers does not prevent publication
elsewhere at a later date.

RLS accepts only electronic submissions, which must be sent to
rls@rice.edu. The body of the e-mail should include:

-title of paper
-name(s) of author(s)
-affiliation
-address
-phone number
-contact e-mail address

Papers submitted must meet the following minimum style requirements:

-15-25 single-spaced pages (normally 5000-8000 words) with 1" margins (size
8.5 x 11'' paper)
   -additional pages may be used for references, tables, and figures
-size 12 font, Times New Roman or Doulos SIL
   -if another font is necessary for linguistic symbols, please contact the
editors prior to submitting your paper
-title should appear at the top of the first page, but in order to maintain
anonymity in the review process, the author's name must not appear anywhere
in the document. Please include this information in the body of the email. 
-use footnotes, not endnotes
-use section headings
-examples must be numbered, and if data from a language other than English
are presented, it should be accompanied by interlinearized glosses and a
free translation.
-include abstract (maximum 150 words)
-submit two copies:
   -one copy in Word or LaTeX
      -if you use Word, please send only .doc files, not .docx files
      -if you use LaTeX, please contact rls@rice.edu before submitting your
paper
   -in addtion to the Word or LaTeX submission, you must send a PDF version
so we can preview formatting and fonts. 

Questions regarding the submissions process or style requirements may be
addressed to the editorial board at rls@rice.edu.
