Dear Jean-Philippe Prost:

We would like to invite you to submit a paper/abstract and/or an invited =
session to

A. The 2nd International Symposium on Engineering Education and =
Educational Technologies: EEET 2010 =
(http://www.2010iiisconferences.org/EEET); and/or to

B. The 3rd International Multi-Conference on Engineering and =
Technological Innovation: IMETI 2010 =
(http://www.2010iiisconferences.org/IMETI)

Both conferences will jointly be held on June 29th - July 2nd, 2010 - =
Orlando, Florida, USA.

The deadlines for both conferences are the following:

Papers/Abstracts Submissions and Invited Sessions Proposals: November =
4th, 2009
Authors Notifications: December 14th, 2009
Camera-ready, full papers: February 24th, 2010

Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both =
accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing =
processes and the accepted papers will be included in the same printed =
and electronic proceedings.

Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic =
forums) will be held for each session included in the conference =
program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and =
authors presenting at the same session can interact during one week =
before and after the conference. Authors can also participate in =
peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions.

All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing =
processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, =
and (3) participative peer reviews. These three kinds of review will =
support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be =
accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to =
be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have =
access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the =
reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so =
they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. =
Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their =
respective submissions.

Sessions' best paper will be awarded and the author who presented the =
paper will receive an award certificate at the award ceremony which will =
be held as the last event of the conference.

Authors of the best 10%-20% of the papers presented at the conference =
(included those virtually presented) will be invited to adapt their =
papers for their publication in the Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics =
and Informatics.

Registration fees of an effective invited session organizer will be =
waived according to the policy described in the web page  (click on =
'Invited Session', then on 'Benefits for the Organizers of Invited =
Sessions'), where you can get information about the ten benefits for an =
invited session organizer. For Invited Sessions Proposals, please visit =
the conference web site, or directly to =
http://www.2010iiisconferences.org/eeet/organizer.asp

Best regards,

EEET 2010 and IMETI 2010 Organizing Committees
