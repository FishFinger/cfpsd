Call Deadline: 08-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

The 36th annual meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society will take place at the University of California, Berkeley on February 6-7, 2010. The meeting will consist of a General Session, a Parasession, and a Special Session. Invited speakers will be announced as they accept.

General Session:

The General Session will cover all areas of linguistic interest. We encourage proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks and also welcome papers on language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology, cognitive science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology.

Parasession: Writing Systems and Orthography

The Parasession invites papers on all aspects of writing systems and orthography. We welcome submissions from diverse theoretical perspectives in any linguistic subfield (phonology, syntax, morphology, semantics, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics, etc.). Areas of discussion might include: the interaction between written and spoken (or signed) language, the development of orthographies, and the relationship between cognition and writing.

Invited Speakers:

Richard Sproat, Oregon Health and Science University & University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Special Session: Language Isolates and Orphans

As the last remaining members of their families, language isolates and orphans provide data relevant to both linguistic theory and typology. We invite papers on any aspect of these languages in the hope of encouraging research on their diverse and often unique properties. We also welcome submissions on near-isolates and languages whose genetic affiliation is uncertain.

Invited Speakers:

Lyle Campbell, University of Utah
Jean-Marie Hombert, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) 

Call for Papers:

Presentation and Publication:

Presentations are allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. Presented papers are published in the BLS Proceedings. Authors agree to provide camera-ready copy (up to 12 pages) by 15 May 2010. In order to expedite publication of papers, BLS will begin publishing digitally with the proceedings from this 36th Annual Meeting.

Abstract Submission:

Abstracts must be received electronically at bls_submissions@berkeley.edu by

11:59 PM, Pacific Standard Time (PST) Sunday, 8 November 2009

No late submissions can be accepted. Authors will be notified of decisions regarding abstracts by mid-December.

Submission Guidelines:

An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. In the case of joint authorship, one address should be designated for official communication with BLS.

Abstracts must clearly present a specific thesis statement and include a description of topic, approach, and conclusions.

Abstracts must fit on one page in 12-point font with 1'' margins. Data and examples must be given within the body of the text, but references may be included on a separate page if necessary. To preserve anonymity during the review process, authors should not include their names or otherwise reveal their identity anywhere in the abstract.

Abstracts that do not fit these specifications will not be considered.

All abstracts must be submitted electronically, formatted as Adobe Acrobat PDF files with the author's name as the filename. The body of the e-mail message must contain the following information:

1. Paper title
2. Session (General Session, Parasession, or Special Session) *
3. Name(s) of author(s)
4. Affiliation(s) of author(s)
5. E-mail address for each author
