The Workshop on the Minority languages in the Malay/Indonesian speaking world invites papers concerned with minority languages that are spoken in Malay/Indonesian speaking countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, southern Thailand). These languages may be Austronesian, belong to a Papuan family, or be Austroasiatic. Submissions relating to the minority languages of East Timor are also invited because of their geographical location. Papers may be in any of the subfields of linguistics. 

First Call for Abstracts

International Workshop on 
Minority Languages in the Malay/Indonesian Speaking World 

28 June 2008
Leiden, The Netherlands
URL http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gil/minlang

Many speakers of Malay or Indonesian are bilinguals who are also fluent in a regional or local language. These languages may be considered 'minority' languages in the sense that they are not spoken nationwide. Many of these languages are endangered. 

The Workshop on the Minority languages in the Malay/Indonesian speaking world invites papers concerned with minority languages that are spoken in Malay/Indonesian speaking countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, southern Thailand). These languages may be Austronesian, belong to a Papuan family, or be Austroasiatic. Submissions relating to the minority languages of East Timor are also invited because of their geographical location.

Papers may be in any of the subfields of linguistics, and may represent variegated approaches and diverse theoretical persuasions. Presentations at the Workshop on the Minority languages are to be delivered in English. 
Persons wishing to present a paper at the workshop are invited to submit a one-page abstract in electronic form (preferably pdf, but MsWord is also acceptable) to Marian Klamer at the following address: 

Marian.Klamer@let.leidenuniv.nl

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 15 March 2008. 
Notification of acceptance: April 1, 2008.

This workshop immediately follows the 12th International Symposium on Malay/Indonesian Linguistics (ISMIL12), 26-27 June 2008, Leiden, The Netherlands. 
Papers presented at ISMIL are concerned with the Malay/Indonesian language in any of its varieties. In addition to the standardized versions of Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia, papers are particularly welcome dealing with non-canonical isolects such as regional dialects of Malay and Indonesian, contact varieties, and other closely related Malayic languages.

Conference on Semantics and Modelisation
