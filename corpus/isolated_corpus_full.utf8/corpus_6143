Call for Papers

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 31 January 2010
Notification of acceptance: 28 February 2010

Contrastive word-formation pertains to three main linguistic fields: morpho=
logy,
lexicology and contrastive linguistics. It is, however, the parent pauvre o=
f
each of these disciplines. We should therefore like to invite contributions
contrasting English with other languages of Europe, with an emphasis on
extragrammatical morphology, which has been especially neglected. Research
should be empirically-based (experimental data, dictionaries, corpora, web =
as
corpus). It may also be interesting to focus on methodological issues (How =
does
one set about comparing word-formation processes across languages? What kin=
d of
tertium comparationis should be adopted?) and on practical applications of
contrastive word-formation (lexicography, L2 learning, NLP).

Abstracts should be no longer than 200 words (excluding references). Please
submit your file to the three convenors in .doc format by 31 January 2010.

Each oral presentation will be allotted 15 minutes, plus 10 minutes for
questions and discussion. Reduced versions of the papers will be circulated
among all presenters in advance of the seminar.
