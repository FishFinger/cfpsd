Meeting Description:

The Ultrafest meetings bring together researchers from around the world working
on the use of ultrasound imaging to understand the complexity of tongue motion
in speech production. Building on the success of the previous 4 meetings, this
conference, at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, will address several themes:

1. Results on linguistic patterning of tongue motion
2. Methods of quantification of tongue shape and motion
3. Comparison of tongue images from ultrasound and MRI
4. Computational physical models of tongue motion
5. Tongue motion developments through the life span and in various dysfluencies

Two days will be devoted to presentations. A half-day session (19 March 2010)
prior to the main meeting will be a hands-on introduction to several systems for
ultrasound imaging of the tongue, allowing a direct comparison for those
considering a new system or for those interested in evaluating their current
system. 

Call for Papers

Proposals are invited for papers (40 minutes) and brief presentations followed
by a led discussion (40 mins).  The conference will also include themed forums
led by a moderator.  Proposals should be submitted on the proposal form
(available from the email address below) by  Monday, 30 November, 2009.
