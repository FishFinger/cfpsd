Doctoral Consortium at the 8th EUROLAN Summer School - Semantics, Opinion and Sentiment in Text

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 23 - August 3, 2007, Iasi, Romania
               
Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 7, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies) investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing to present their current work and receive constructive feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general audience and the invited lecturers at the Summer School. 

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4 consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in one of the two weeks of the EUROLAN 2007 Summer School. The final version of the accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. During the Summer School the students will present their work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to current and future research directions from a panel of established researchers, and will benefit from the collaborative climate established among all participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Students will also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the Summer School. 

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, however students working in the areas related with the theme of this year's Summer School like:
- computational semantics, 
- ontology enriched NLP applications
- opinion and sentiment analysis, 
- role of  sentiment analysis in multimodal human computer interaction 
are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lectures of the school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST be students. 
The paper should include: 
- the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;
- the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field; 
- the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the methodology adopted;
- the future research plan. 


3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The following formats are acceptable: PDF (.pdf), PostScript (.ps), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Microsoft Word (.doc). Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references and annexes and should follow the Springer format, soon available as a .dot template on the web page of the event. The papers will be uploaded on a special page, to be announced on the web page of the Doctoral Consortium.

4. Important Dates

Paper submissions deadline: *May 7, 2007*
Notification of acceptance: May 28, 2007
Camera ready papers due: June 18, 2007
Summer School dates: July 23  August 3, 2007

5. Registration

Authors of accepted papers must register for the Summer School and present their work at the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. No supplementary fee will be required above the EUROLAN fee. The authors will benefit of early registration fee regardless of the date they register. Participation in the Doctoral Consortium is open to all EUROLAN 2007 attendants.
 
6. Travel Grants

A limited number of registration and accommodation discounts/waivers will be available. The authors of accepted papers with reduced possibilities to support their participation to the Doctoral Consortium and the Summer School will have to send a motivation letter, a CV and a recommendation letter from their Ph.D./research advisor to the organizers. More details will be posted at the appropriate time on the webpage of the event.
