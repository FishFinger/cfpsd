*THEME OF THE WORKSHOP*



As software increases in size and becomes more complex and costly, the
need for techniques to ease software development is likewise
increasing. Over the last decade, pattern community has evolved and
received more interest in both academia and industry. Developing
software using patterns holds the promise to reduce the cost and
condensing the time of developing software systems, while
simultaneously maintaining the quality of these systems.



However, the potential of using patterns in developing systems is not
fully realized and we need to address many challenges. For example,
developing pattern repositories and catalogs, from which patterns can
be retrieved and reused, still forms a challenge to software
engineering, knowledge engineering and information systems
communities. In addition, the need for (semi-) automated approaches
for patterns mining and integration poses several open research
questions to the software engineering community.  Many think these
challenges and others preclude the realization of the benefit of
patterns as a reuse approach.  This workshop aims at bringing together
researchers and practitioners who are interested in resolving research
challenges or who have practical experience with the different issues
of patterns reuse and integration to discuss and advance the
state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in patterns reuse.

Patterns have emerged as a promising reuse technique for both
improving the quality and reducing the cost and time of software
development. However, there is an immense belief that patterns have
not fulfilled the expectations software developers
wanted. Nevertheless, this belief does not rebuff the fact that
patterns, as a concept, have the potential to play a key role in
developing systems in the near future.  This near future will never
come unless there are serious attempts from both developers and
researchers to investigate and provide creative solutions to current
challenges that hinder utilizing patterns in practice. Among these
challenges, this workshop focuses on investigating how to develop
systems using patterns. We are sure that this topic will attract many
developers and researchers in the field to participate in this
workshop.



*WORKSHOP CHALLENGES*







The workshop will address software patterns challenges and debate
several issues related to the following questions.  We want
researchers, framework developers, and application developers to
discuss and debate the following questions related to:

*I.                    **Pattern Creation and Development*

a.  Leaving experience claim on the side, can you show how to create
and develop patterns?

b.  What are the bases of creating patterns?

c.  Are there guidelines, methodologies, and/or processes for pattern
creations and developments?

d.  Would you show an example or two?



*II.                 **Patterns Selection Process: *

a.  How does one select analysis and design patterns to build any
system?

b.  What is the basis for selecting these patterns?

c.  If someone would like to build a system from patterns, how does
she select patterns?

d.  What kind of patterns should one select to build a system from
patterns?

e.  Is there a guideline for the selection process?



*III.              **Patterns Composition*

a.  How does one integrate the selected patterns to build any system?
or How does one compose any system from patterns?

b.  What are the various claims related to patterns composition? Are
they true?

c.  Are there guidelines or techniques for patterns composition? Would
you illustrate how to use them?



*IV.               **System of Patterns and General Reuse*

a.  What do we mean when we say "systems of patterns"?

b.  Are the various claims related to building any system from
patterns reasonable?

c.  How to develop pattern repositories and catalogs, from which
patterns can be retrieved and reused?

d.  Are there automated approaches for patterns mining and
integration?

e.  What other concepts will help build any system from patterns?

.

*V.                  **Impacts*

a.  What is the impact of software stability on the above issues?

*PAPER FORMAT AND SUBMISSIONS*







Detailed instructions for electronic paper submission and review
process can be found at http://www.compsac.org/. People interested in
participating in the workshop are requested to submit a short position
paper (*3-5 pages*) or regular workshop paper (limited to *6 pages*,
double spaced, including figures) representing views and experiences
relevant to the discussion topic. The title page should include a
maximum 150-word abstract, five keywords, full mailing address, e-mail
address, phone number, fax number, and a designated contact
author. Papers will be selected depending on the originality, quality
and relevance to the workshop.  All submitted papers will be evaluated
according to its originality, significance, correctness, presentation
and relevance. Papers should be submitted electronically at:

 http://compsac.cs.iastate.edu/2007/SPAC/
http://compsac.cs.iastate.edu/2007/EMOBS/index.php?authorsInstructions=1
.  Please follow the instructions given by the web page. Camera Ready
manuscripts must be submitted following IEEE conference proceedings
style and guidelines. We encourage authors to present novel ideas,
critique of existing work, and practical studies.



 Each accepted paper must be presented in person by the author or one
 of the authors.  To foster lively discussions, each author is
 encouraged to present open questions and one or two main statements
 that will be discussed at the workshop.  Submissions must be either
 MS-Word or RTF formats (please, DO NOT compress files).



 Depending on the number and spread of contributions, the scope may be
 narrowed to ensure effective communication and information
 sharing. Accepted position papers will be distributed to the
 participants before the workshop and made generally available through
 the WWW and FTP.  Accepted papers will be published in the Workshop
 Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Computer Software and Applications
 Conference (COMPSAC
 2007<http://conferences.computer.org/compsac/2007/>).  At least one
 of the authors of each accepted paper must register as a full
 participant in the workshop to have the paper published in the
 COMPSAC 2007 Proceedings. The workshop selected best papers will be
 published in online Journal of International Journal Of Patterns
 (IJOP) - *www.ijop.org*

 *PROPOSED AGENDA*





 1. Welcome and introduction of participants. The organizers will
 first give a short overview of any open issues and of the main
 arguments arising out of the position papers. (Estimated time: 20-30
 minutes)



 2. Selected authors (representing the main trends) will be given 20
 minutes to explain how their position relates to other positions and
 what each sees as the three major issues. We expect about 5-10
 position papers.  (Estimated time: 120-130 minutes)



 3. The organizers will propose an identification of the major issues,
 and the participants will then discuss and select what they think are
 the hottest issues to be examined. (Estimated time: 10-15 minutes)



 4. The participants will work for 70-95 minutes in small groups, with
 a designated moderator in each group. The groups will each deal with
 two different hot issues identified and will produce a summary in the
 form of points and counterpoints, showing either how several views
 are irreducibly opposed or how they are complementary.

 The number of groups will depend on the number of participants and
 number of issues selected; ideally there should be 3-5 p people in
 each group.  (Estimated time: 60-70 minutes)



 5. Each group will be given 10-15 minutes to present its findings to
 the workshop.  A closing discussion will follow. The workshop report
 will be written on the basis of these findings and will include an
 agenda for future exploration and cooperation; it will be made
 available through the WWW and FTP. (Estimated time: 50-60 minutes for
 five teams)



 (Total estimated time: 285-315 minutes, i.e. about five hours +/- 15
 minutes; lunch and breaks are not included.)
