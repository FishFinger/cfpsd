http://www.lagb.org.uk/circulars/2007_1kclcirc.pdf

More information available at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lagb - currently under
construction.

Abstracts are welcome from both members and non-members.

Special Events:

1. The Henry Sweet Lecture 2007 will be delivered by Professor Hans Kamp
(University of Stuttgart) on the evening of 29th August (title to be confirmed).

2. The Linguistics Association Lecture 2007 will be delivered by Professor B.
Elan Dresher (University of Toronto) on 1st September, with the title 'The
contrastive hierarchy in phonology'.

3. There will also be a Workshop on Discourse Representation Theory, related to
the Henry Sweet lecture, on the afternoon of 31st August.

4. There will also be a special themed session on 1st September, related to the
Linguistics Association Lecture, with the title 'Contrast in Phonology', for
which abstracts are now invited. These should be submitted in the same way as
abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked that they are
intended for the special session. For further details, see the call for papers
for this session on the page 5 of the full circular, and included at the end of
this message.

5. There will be a Language Tutorial on Slavey, given by Professor Keren Rice
(University of Toronto).

6. There will be a session organised by the LAGB's Education Committee which
will feature a discussion of how linguists in Higher Education communicate with
teachers and pupils in schools. Details will be announced in the second circular
and posted on www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/dick/ec/ecsessions.htm.

7. There will be a workshop on 'Syntactic Microvariation in Dialects of
English', for which abstracts are now invited. These should be submitted in the
same way as abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked
that they are intended for the workshop. For further details, see the call for
papers for this session on page 5 of the full circular, and included at the end
of this message.

The meeting will be directly followed by an independently organised Workshop on
Features. For further details, see the call for papers for this session on page
6 of the full circular, and included at the end of this message.

Deadline for abstracts: 9th April. For details of abstract submission, see the
full first circular - abstracts may be submitted either electronically or in
hard copy; sets of abstracts may be submitted together for a themed session of
your choice. Electronic submission of abstracts is preferred.

Call for papers for the themed session at the 2007 LAGB meeting, related to the
Linguistics Association Lecture by B. Elan Dresher on 'Contrast in Phonology'.

It is a phonological commonplace that contrast is fundamental to phonology, but
quite how this should be implemented in phonological theory remains contentious.
Abstracts would be welcome which connect in any way with the issues that arise
from a consideration of the role of contrast (and of contrasts of different
types) in phonology.

Some relevant questions are (in part adapted from the material written by 
B. Elan Dresher and Keren Rice, and available here:
www.chass.utoronto.ca/~contrast/).
- How should the role of contrast be conceived in phonology? How should it be
represented?
- Is there a relation between the amount of segmental complexity a system allows
and the number and nature of contrasts it has?
- Which features and contrasts are marked and which are unmarked, and what
diagnostics should we use to decide this question?
- Do noncontrastive features play any role in the phonology of a language?

Abstracts are now invited for this session. They should be submitted in the same
way as abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked that
they are intended for this special themed session.

Call for papers for the workshop at the 2007 LAGB meeting on 'Syntactic
Microvariation in Dialects of English', organised by Marika Lekakou and Karen
Corrigan.

In the recent past the study of dialect syntax has received renewed interest
from different perspectives (sociolinguistics, theoretical linguistics, language
typology, traditional dialectology, historical linguistics). Particularly
exciting is the recent development of extended co-operation among scholars
within these fields, which has led to a more interdisciplinary approach to the
study of the syntactic properties of dialects. This new development is reflected
in, among other things, the contributions in Cornips and Corrigan (eds), Syntax
and Variation: Reconciling the Biological and the Social. Amsterdam: John
Benjamins, 2005. 

Concomitantly, a number of dialect syntax projects have already been launched or
even completed across Europe, which have the property of combining different
theoretical backgrounds (for example, theoretical linguistics employing
sociolinguistically informed methodology of data collection). Examples of this
European tendency can be found in for instance Italy (ASIS,
http://asis-cnr.unipd.it/index.en.html), Portugal (CORDIAL-SIN,
http://www.clul.ul.pt/english/sectores/cordialsin/projecto_cordialsin.html),
Scandinavia (ScanDiaSyn, http://uit.no/scandiasyn/?Language=en), and the
Netherlands and Belgium (SAND, www.meertens.nl/sand). The Netherlands is also
the home of the currently running ESF-funded Edisyn project
(www.meertens.nl/projecten/edisyn). The Edisyn aspires to set up, extend and
develop cooperation among dialect syntax projects in Europe, thus yielding a
European network of dialect syntacticians that use similar standards with
respect to methodology of data collection, data storage and annotation, data
retrieval and cartography.

Currently, existing dialectal variation in varieties of English has not been
explored in a systematic way, in the sense that a large-scale dialect syntax
project has not yet been undertaken (the FRED project
(http://www.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/institut/lskortmann/) which ran at the
University of Freiburg has resulted in a corpus of dialect data from previous
generations). We aim to host a workshop with the aim of bringing together
scholars who are interested in collaboration that will ultimately lead to the
launch of a UK and Ireland branch of the Edisyn project. We therefore invite
contributions on any aspect of the syntax of English dialects. 

Abstracts are now invited for this session. They should be submitted in the same
way as abstracts for the general sessions, but should be clearly marked that
they are intended for this workshop.

This year's LAGB meeting overlaps with the second conference of the UK Cognitive
Linguistics Association. If members would like to attend both, the committee
will be sure to take this into account, if necessary, when scheduling talks. If
this is likely to affect you, please indicate this in the message accompanying
your abstract.

Workshop on Features, 1-2 September 2007
King's College London
in association with the 2007 LAGB meeting

Linguistic fields: General Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Language
Description, Linguistic Theories, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Typology

Meeting Summary:

The Workshop on Features (1-2 September 2007) will be associated with and will
directly follow the LAGB 2007 conference at King's College London. Abstracts
should be submitted, and will be considered separately to those intended for the
LAGB meeting. The Workshop will bring together linguists who have grappled with
features as a component of theoretical models together with others who have
considered their range and variability in the world's languages.

Details:

In attempting to understand language, a central notion is features. Examples are
person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, plural, dual...) tense (present,
past...), and inflectional class (I, II, III, IV...). Features have proven
invaluable for analysis and description, and have a major role in contemporary
linguistics, right across the range of the discipline. Yet little is firmly
established about features: we have no readily available inventory of which
features are found in the world's languages, no generally agreed account of how
they operate across different components of language and no certainty on how
they interact. Features are widely used, but are little discussed. The workshop
will therefore bring together linguists who have grappled with features as a
component of theoretical models together with others who have considered their
range and variability in the world's languages.

There will be six guest speakers who have agreed to talk on the following topics:
- David Adger 'Features and functional categories'
- Peter Austin 'Features and clause linkage'
- Ann Copestake 'Features and computational semantics'
- Ron Kaplan 'Formal aspects of underspecified features'
- Maria Polinsky 'Featural asymmetries in long-distance agreement: why gender is
different from person'
- Ivan Sag 'Feature geometry and predictions of locality'

The programme organisers of the Workshop are Greville Corbett and Anna Kibort,
Surrey Morphology Group (www.surrey.ac.uk/LIS/SMG/). The Workshop is supported
by the ESRC, within a project on Grammatical Features (grant number
RES-051-27-0122). The local organisers of the LAGB meeting at King's College
London, Devyani Sharma and Eleni Gregoromichelaki, have kindly agreed to take on
the local arrangements.

Abstracts should be submitted in the same format as that described for abstracts
which are to be submitted for the LAGB meeting on page 2 of the LAGB circular.
They should not be sent to the same address as abstracts meant for the LAGB
meeting, but should be emailed to Anna Kibort (a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk), by or on
9th April 2007

Linguistic Field(s): Phonology 

Call Deadline: 07-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:
Since the advent of Optimality Theory (OT) advocating the replacement of rules
by violable constraints, this model faces a number of challenges that appear to
be related to its initial commitment to evaluating a set of surface
'candidates'. One problem is that we have no satisfactory criterion as to which
and how many candidates should be evaluated for a given input. As is shown by
Steriade's (2001) work on the typology of repairs for the constraint against
voiced stops, the only repair attested for violations of such a constraint is
final devoicing. Other potential strategies, such as nasalization, syncope,
metathesis and epenthesis, are not attested. While syncope and epenthesis are
frequent processes among languages, they are never chosen as repair strategies
for final obstruent voicing. However, standard OT has no way to rule out these
possibilities elegantly, and this is far from being the only problem for the
theory. In order to account for problematic opacity facts, several attempts have
been proposed. Thus, Calabrese (2005) proposes to re-establish serialism, the
principle at the heart of classical generative phonology. On the contrary,
Carvalho & Klein (2006) suggest developing a theory of the input, arguing that
phonological representations should explain the reasons of the variable
behaviour of speakers vis-à-vis opacity.
We organize a two-day workshop, addressing any topic related with the above
issues, couched in any theoretical framework. The empirical domains can include
loanwords, word games, sociolinguistic variation, etc.
Speakers will have the opportunity to present a 20-minute talk, followed by 10
minutes of discussion.

Depuis l'avènement de la théorie de l'optimalité (OT) qui prône le remplacement
des règles par des contraintes violables, la phonologie se trouve face à des
défis qui résultent de son engagement initial, fondé sur l'évaluation d'un
ensemble de 'candidats' de surface. Comme le démontre le travail de Steriade
(2001) portant sur la typologie des stratégies de réparation de la contrainte
interdisant les codas voisées, la seule réparation attestée est le dévoisement
final. D'autres stratégies potentielles, telles la nasalisation, la syncope, la
métathèse ou l'épenthèse, ne sont pas attestées. Alors que l'épenthèse et la
syncope sont des processus fréquents dans les langues, ils ne sont jamais
choisis comme stratégie de réparation pour éviter une coda voisée. Or OT
standard est incapable d'exclure ces possibilités d'une façon élégante. Et ceci
est loin d'être la seule difficulté rencontrée par la théorie. Plusieurs
tentatives ont eu lieu qui essaient d'apporter une solution au problème posé à
OT par l'opacité. Ainsi Calabrese (2005) propose de rétablir le sérialisme, le
principe central de la phonologie générative classique. De leur côté, Carvalho &
Klein (2006) suggèrent de développer une théorie de l'input, seul à même
d'expliquer les raisons du comportement variable des locuteurs.
Nous organisons un colloque de deux jours, portant essentiellement, mais non
obligatoirement, sur des sujets en rapport avec les problématiques ci-dessus, et
sans exclusive de cadre théorique. Les domaines empiriques possibles iraient
jusqu'à inclure les jeux de mots, les emprunts, la variation socio-linguistique,
etc.
Nous sollicitons la soumission de résumés pour une présentation de 20 minutes,
suivie de 10 minutes de discussion.
