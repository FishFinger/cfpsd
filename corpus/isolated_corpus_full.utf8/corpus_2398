Meeting Description

Coling 2008 will be held in Manchester, England, 18th-22nd August. 

COLING 2008 Second Call for Workshop Proposals
22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics
18th-22nd August 2008
Manchester, UK
http://www.coling2008.org.uk/

Submission deadline: 3rd February 2008

The Programme Committee for the 22nd International Conference on Computational
Linguistics invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with
COLING 2008 in Manchester, United Kingdom. Workshops provide the opportunity for
in-depth discussion on a focused area of research. We solicit proposals on any
topic of interest to the Coling community, including those which explore
emerging research and/or inter-disciplinary issues.

Workshops will be held close to the location of the main conference during the
weekends preceding and following the main conference (16-17 and 23-24 August).

The START system will be available to assist workshop organisers with the
reviewing process.


Submission Details

Proposals for workshops should contain: 

1. Title and short description (up to 500 words) of the workshop topic and
motivation.

2. A description of target audience and expected number of participants. (If the
workshop is part of a series, also provide details of number of submissions,
acceptances and registered participants for previous events.)

3. The intended length and format of the workshop. (It is expected that the
majority of workshops will last for one day although half-day and two-day
workshops can also be accommodated.)

4. Whether you have any preference for the workshop to be held before or after
the main conference. (Pre-conference workshops will be held on the 16th and 17th
of August, post-conference workshops on the 23rd and 24th.)

5. Proposed timetable for workshop submissions and reviewing process, including
dates for submission deadline, notification of acceptance and submission of
camera-ready versions. (Please ensure these are consistent with the important
dates listed below.)

6. Budget proposal. Coling will provide the workshop with a meeting room
(including projection facilities), electronic proceedings and coffee break
refreshments. Please indicate whether you have any requirements for exceptional
items and how you would expect to meet these costs.

7. Special requirements (e.g. computer infrastructure or shared task).

8. List of workshop organisers and, for each organiser, a brief paragraph
describing their relevant experience.

9. List of individuals who have agreed to be part of the workshop programme
committee if the proposal is accepted.

10. Full contact details (postal address, phone number, e-mail address and fax)
of the main contact person.

Please submit workshop proposals by electronic mail on or before 3rd February
2008 to: Mark Stevenson (m.stevenson@dcs.shef.ac.uk)

Location: Leipzig, Germany 
Contact Person: Martin Haspelmath

Linguistic Field(s): Typology

Language Family(ies): Afroasiatic 

Call Deadline: 31-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description

This conference, held at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
and the University of Leipzig, will bring together typologists and specialists
of the Egyptian-Coptic language to discuss issues of Egyptian-Coptic linguistics
from the perspective of typology and general linguistics. 

The Egyptian-Coptic language, attested for more than 4000 years from the early
development of the hieroglyphic writing system before 3000 BCE up to its
obsolescence and extinction as a spoken language around 1300 CE, is not only one
of the earliest attested human languages, it may justly be called the most
long-lived language that is available for study by linguists.

Its uniqueness in terms of age and longevity and the evidence for long-lasting
processes of language change it provides, including a change in typologically
basic traits, such as word order correlation, make the Egyptian-Coptic language
a most worthwhile object for general linguistics, regardless of philological and
methodological obstacles usually connected to the study of dead corpus languages.

The aim of our conference is to stimulate, or re-intensify, mutual perception of
Egyptologists and general linguists. We hope to approach this by addressing an
issue of obvious significance and considerable breadth - the behaviour of the
Egyptian-Coptic language in its different phases in terms of language typology.

Invited Speakers

Bernard Comrie (Leipzig)  	 
Orin Gensler (Addis Abeba) 	
Eitan Grossman (Jerusalem) 	
Tom Güldemann (Zurich) 	
Dmitry Idiatov (Antwerpen) 	
Frank Kammerzell (Berlin) 	 
Antonio Loprieno (Basel) 	 
Elsa Oréal (Paris) 	 
Carsten Peust (Konstanz) 	 
Ariel Shisha-Halevy (Jerusalem) 	 
Andréas Stauder (Basel)

We request papers within this general perspective, dealing with data from any
period, branch and part of the Egyptian-Coptic language, including fields and
issues such as areal linguistics, phonology, word formation, morphology, syntax,
language change and language contact typology. Papers are welcome both by
Egypologists that are interested in a more general typological perspective, and
by typologists that have been intrigued by data from Egyptian-Coptic and would
like to discuss their broader significance.

Please submit your proposal containing a provisional title of your talk and a
500 words abstract (abstracts in languages other than English are also welcome),
by 31 March 2008 to:
 	  	 
typology.of.egyptian@rz.uni-leipzig.de
	   
Notification of acceptance is by 15 April 2008.
