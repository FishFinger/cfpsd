International Conference on 'Language, Culture and Ideology in the History of 
Anglo-Italian Relations'
 
The Department of Language Studies and Compared Literature of the University of 
Milan announces the international conference 'Language, Culture and Ideology in
the History of Anglo-Italian Relations', to be held in Gargnano del Garda (BS),
Italy, on September 28-30.

The aim of the conference -- which is being organized in cooperation with 
colleagues from the Universities of Padova, Pisa, Leicester and Malta -- is to 
gather together academics from as diverse backgrounds as possible (English 
linguistics, English literature, British cultural studies, history, geography, 
history of art, film studies, etc.) in order to study how ideological and
cultural differences shaped and shape the relations between Italy and the
Anglo-American world.
If you are interested in receiving more information on the conference and the 
call for papers, send an email to Professor Giovanni Iamartino at 
giovanni.iamartino@unimi.it.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
