Call for Papers


The Challenge of Arabic for NLP/MT


The Machine Translation SIG of the British Computer Society requests
papers
for presentation at a one day Conference in London, UK, on Monday 23
October
2006 on the subject of the challenge of the Arabic language for
Natural
Language Processing and Machine Translation in particular. This
includes a
wide range of possible topics such as electronic dictionaries and
corpus
linguistics.

The Conference will be held in the excellent meeting facilities of the
British Computer Society in central London.

If you would like to present a paper please could you submit a 200-400
word
abstract of your proposed paper by 15 July. Please send them to me,
wiggjd@bcs.org.uk, with copies to r.mitkov@wlv.ac.uk and
d.r.lewis@exeter.ac.uk. The Conference language will be English.

We will accept or reject the abstract by the 15 August. After
acceptance we
would require your paper to be supplied in hardcopy and electronic
form (MS
Word only with Arabic capability) by 15 September for inclusion in the
Proceedings which will be published under the auspices of the British
Computer Society.

We are looking for papers to be delivered in 30 to 40 minutes with
each
being followed immediately by 5 to 10 minutes of question and answer
time.

Facilities are available for the display of computer information for
illustration purposes during the presentation.

We will also be able to provide separate facilities for the
demonstration of
software without the presentation of a paper.

We have tentatively divided up the day under the following headings,
but
this is flexible,

Morning

(i)  Introduction: talks on the Arabic language
(ii) The challenges of Arabic for language processing

Afternoon

(iii) Concrete applications I: NLP tasks and applications for Arabic
(iv) Concrete applications II: MT between English and Arabic in focus

With reference to expenses for attending and presenting your paper at
the
Conference I regret we are not in a position to pay for any expenses
outside
this country. Within the UK we may be able to pay some expenses on an
individual basis. As soon as you like, please let me know what you
need, if
anything. We may be able to arrange reasonably priced (for London)
hotel
accommodation for you if you need it. Please let me know by 15 July as
well.

Please see our website at http://www.bcs-mt.org.uk for the latest
information about the Conference.

Finally, I would be grateful if you could let me know as soon as
possible of
any e-mail lists which you think we should address in order to
advertise
this Conference more widely.

Thank you for your interest in our Conference.

Yours sincerely,

David Wigg
Chairman
Natural Language Translation Specialist Group
The British Computer Society
