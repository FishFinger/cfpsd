=========== CALL FOR PAPERS ============

AAAI 2008 WORKSHOP ON ENHANCED MESSAGING

Submissions due: April 7, 2008
WWW: http://enhancedmessagingworkshop.googlepages.com/
email: enhancedmessagingworkshop@gmail.com

=========== CALL FOR PAPERS ============

Abstract:
With the rise of the digital workplace, email has become a ubiquitous
tool in the office and a primary means of communication. Email's growth
has created new opportunities and challenges for a large variety of
artificial intelligence research, focusing an increasing amount of
academic and industrial research on email issues. Research seeks to
enhance the email user experience by addressing email overload or to
learn from email social patterns. Recent papers have dealt with email
triage, activity management, email prioritization, summarization, topic
tracking, sorting, leak detection, social network analysis, and enhanced
intelligent interfaces. The Workshop on Enhanced Messaging at AAAI 2008
brings together researchers working on solutions for email and other
forms of web messaging from many subfields of AI as well as soliciting
participation from the broader community.

Workshop Goals:
    * Bring together a wide spectrum of researchers working on email and
other messaging technologies.
    * Present new and novel areas of research on important problems in
the field.
    * Encourage research that brings together multi-disciplinary
techniques.
    * Facilitate discussion between participants on significant
challenges in messaging research.
    * Highlight new research and production messaging systems that
employ novel research technologies.
    * Set a multi-year agenda of important research goals for the field.

Topics of Interest:
    * User Studies: email in the workplace, usage patterns, behaviors,
email triage, overload
    * User Interfaces: visualizations, messaging in support of user
activities, mashups, personal 
      information management (PIM)
    * Information Retrieval: message and thread summarization, search,
expert finding
    * Machine Learning and Data Mining: applications of ML/DM to email,
including information extraction,
      clustering, entity disambiguation, feature selection and
dimensionality reduction for message 
      classification
    * Message Organization: automatic foldering, categorization,
advanced calendaring and scheduling, 
	activity management and discovery
    * Social Networks: relationship modeling, network analysis, group
and role discovery, online 
      communities, people tagging
    * Natural Language Processing: applications of NLP technologies to
email, message understanding, topic
      detection and tracking, sentiment/discourse/opinion analysis,
dialog analysis, topic modeling
    * Messaging Interactions on the Web: instant messaging (SMS), RSS
feeds, blogging, tagging 

Authors are invited to submit papers on these topics and we especially
encourage cross-disciplinary work. We welcome three different submission
types.

Full Papers (6 pages) - A full paper describes mature work, which may
already have been published in previous conferences. A selected number
of these papers will be selected for oral presentation during the main
workshop session. All accepted papers will be included in the workshop
poster session.

Extended Abstracts (2 pages) - These papers describe new and preliminary
work. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop poster session.

Demonstration Papers (2 pages) - Since the goal of this research is to
develop novel and interesting applications, we encourage submissions
describing demonstration systems. Authors of accepted demonstration
papers should expect to demonstrate their system during the workshop
poster session.

All questions regarding the workshop should be directed to
enhancedmessagingworkshop@gmail.com.

Important Dates:
    * Submissions Due: April 7, 2008
    * Notifications: April 21, 2008
    * Final Papers Due: May 5, 2008
    * Workshop: July 13 or 14, 2008 (TBA) in Chicago at AAAI 2008
