Meeting Description:

Workshop 'Baltic Languages in Areal-Typological Perspective'
at the 43rd annual Meeting of Societas Linguistica Europaea
Vilnius, 2-5 September 2010 

Call for Papers

Organizers: 
Peter Arkadiev (Institute of Slavic Studies, Moscow)
Jurgis Pakerys (University of Vilnius)
Contact emails: baltistica.inslav@gmail.com, Jurgis.Pakerys@flf.vu.lt 

Confirmed keynote speaker: Nicole Nau (University of Pozna?)

The languages of the Baltic area have been subject to areal-typological research 
for quite a long time, especially during the last several decades. The current
workshop aims at focusing specifically on the Baltic language group (Lithuanian, 
Latvian, Latgalian and their dialects), which has been up to now
underrepresented in the general linguistic and typological discourse. The topics
which we hope the workshop will cover include, but are not limited to, the
following:
- contact-induced phenomena at different levels of language structure
(phonology, morphosyntax, grammatical categories, semantics, and lexicon);
- the interplay between inherited and contact-induced features in the structure 
of Baltic languages;
- typological divergencies between different Baltic varieties due to areal
influences of other languages (Slavic, Germanic, Finnic);
- the role of the Baltic data for the more general issues of areal linguistics,
language typology, and linguistic theory.

The workshop proposal (including the preliminary list of participants and the
topics of their presentations) must be submitted to the SLE organizers no later
than November 15, 2009, so we ask the future participants to send us the
provisional titles of their presentations with a brief description by November
7. The abstracts should be submitted by the end of December. Please, send your
proposals to both addresses indicated above.
