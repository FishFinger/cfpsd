'Postcolonial studies in Romance languages'


During the last few decades postcolonial thought has developed new
perspectives within and on Romance studies, thereby expanding the scope of
the field both geographically and thematically.

Arena Romanistica wishes to focus on the potential and challenges this
expansion poses for Romance studies in general. We thus welcome
contributions from any perspective and on any aspect of postcolonial
studies in Romance languages. This includes papers in which a postcolonial
perspective serves as an interpretative foundation or starting point, as
well as papers which more concretely address a postcolonial phenomenon or
issue, be it literary, linguistic or other. Contributions which discuss or
challenge the postcolonial paradigm from a meta-perspective or seek to
develop new directions within the field are also most welcome. 

We thus encourage theoretical as well as empirical contributions from the
fields of linguistics, cultural and literary studies, in all Romance
languages. Contributions in English will also be considered.

Articles will be accepted until June 9th.
