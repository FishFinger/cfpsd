The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation 
(PACLIC 23)

3-5 December 2009
City University of Hong Kong
http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk

Second Call for Papers


************************************************************
Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit revised manuscripts to
a Special Issue of Language Resources and Evaluation, an SCI-indexed
international journal.
************************************************************


The 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation
(PACLIC 23) will be held in the City University of Hong Kong on 3-5 December
2009.  The PACLIC series of conferences emphasizes the synergy of
theoretical analysis and processing of language, and provides a forum for
researchers in different fields of language study in the Pacific-Asia region 
to
meet, to inspire and to be inspired.  According to the Computer Science
Conference Ranking Website, as in Feb 2009, PACLIC is ranked 50th out of
701 conferences in topic area II (AI and Machine Learning), roughly at top
7%. (http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/topicsii.html)

Paper submissions are invited on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of both theoretical and computational linguistics.  Topics include 
but
are not limited to: morphology, phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
discourse analysis, typology, corpus linguistics, formal grammar theory,
natural language processing, natural language systems and related computer
applications.  Papers which showcase the synergistic effects offered by
multi-disciplinary approaches on the construction of language resources and
development of language processing applications are particularly encouraged.
Different research topics could address the following issues in one way or
another, to feature the mutual advancement among language, information
and computation:

* How has formal linguistic analysis informed language technology and how
is it deployed in advancing the development of language processing
applications?
* What light has theoretical linguistics shed on the information demand of
natural language processing, and how has it led to large-scale
machine-usable language resources?
* How have linguistically-informed language resources improved the
performance of language processing applications?
* What does the advancement in language technology have to offer
theoretical linguists with respect to research methodology and analysis
framework?
* What is the limit of pure computational methods like machine learning in
language processing?  What roles do related disciplines such as cognitive
science and psycholinguistics have to play in bridging the gap between human
and computer language processing?


Important Dates:

   9 Aug 2009      Paper submission deadline
   21 Sep 2009    Acceptance notification
   19 Oct 2009     Camera-ready paper due
   3-5 Dec 2009   PACLIC 23 conference


Paper Submission:

Submissions should describe substantial, original, and unpublished work.
Papers should be written in English and may not exceed ten (10) pages,
including references.  Please follow the formatting instructions and use the
style files provided on the conference website 
(http://paclic23.ctl.cityu.edu.hk).
Accepted papers will be presented in one of the regular sessions or poster
sessions as determined by the program committee.  Such decisions will be
based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work.

The deadline for paper submissions is 11:59PM Aug 9, 2009 Hong Kong
time (GMT+8).  Submissions should be made via the submission software at:

   https://www.softconf.com/a/PACLIC23/

Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength,
significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. 
Each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.
As the reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the authors'
names and affiliations.  Authors should ensure that their identities are not
revealed in any way in the paper.  Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which will
subsequently be digitally archived and sent to ISI for indexing.  PACLIC
conference proceedings are indexed in the ISI Web of Science since 2002
and authors are encouraged to cite previous PACLIC papers in their work.


For enquiries on paper submission, please contact the program committee
chair at paclic23@cityu.edu.hk.
