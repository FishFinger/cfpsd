Meeting Description:

European Association for Lexicography Congress

The EURALEX Congresses bring together professional lexicographers, publishers,
researchers, software developers, and others interested in dictionaries of all
types. The next Euralex Congress will be held in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands
from 6 - 10 July 2010. 

Call for Papers

The programme will include plenary lectures, parallel sessions on the topics
listed below, software demonstrations, pre-congress tutorials and specialized
workshops, a special session for students and work-in-progress, a book and
software exhibition, and social events for participants and their guests. 

The 2010 conference will be hosted by the Fryske Akademy (Frisian Academy) in
Leeuwarden <http://www.fryske-akademy.nl>, the capital of the Dutch bilingual
Province of Friesland. The Fryske Akademy does research on Frisian and
Friesland. Over the years the Fryske Akademy has published a wide range of
Frisian dictionaries. The Mercator Research Centre at the Fryske Akademy studies
the position of lesser-used languages in education, gives information on
national and regional education systems and provides the latest statistics
regarding lesser-used languages in education in the European Union. Frisian
being a small non-state language, the organising committee especially welcomes
papers on any aspect of the lexicography of non-state and lesser used languages.

Papers, posters and software demonstrations are invited on all topics of
lexicography, including, but not limited to, the following fields, which are the
main focus of the congress:

Computational Lexicography and Lexicology 
The Dictionary-Making Process 
Reports on Lexicographical and Lexicological Projects 
Bilingual Lexicography 
Lexicography for Specialised Languages - Terminology and Terminography 
Historical and Scholarly Lexicography and Etymology 
Dictionary Use 
Phraseology and Collocation 
Lexicological Issues of Lexicographical Relevance 
Lexicography of non-state and lesser used languages 

The main topics are not meant to exclude any lexicographic topic. Papers,
posters and demonstrations that are relevant to the congress, but which do not
fit into any of the categories above, will be reviewed nonetheless and
considered for presentation.

Submissions 
Submissions may be one of the following types: Contributed full papers,
Contributed short papers & project notes, Software demonstrations, Posters,
Student papers.

All submissions will be evaluated anonymously by at least two reviewers. The
Scientific Committee will be aided in this task by a panel of external referees.
The programme will be selected by the programme committee.

Contributed Papers 
There are two types of contributed papers.
Full papers should be timed for 30 minutes 
Short papers and project notes will be allowed 20 minutes 

All contributed papers will be followed by a 10-minute discussion period.

Software Demonstrations 
We are particularly interested in well-prepared software demonstrations,
presentations of electronic dictionaries, corpora, tools, etc. These
demonstrations will be allowed a 30-minute time slot at the congress (they may
be presented more than once).

Submissions proposing software demonstrations should include a description of
the functions, underlying approach implementation of the software, possibly an
indication of a URL, and hardware/software requirements. Technical facilities
will be available, however, we would ask everyone submitting proposals to
indicate well in advance exactly what technical facilities they need.

Posters 
A poster session is planned. Appropriate facilities will be provided on the
Congress site.

Student Papers 
A special session for short presentations by students (15-minute slots) is planned.

Submission
E-mail submission is required. The submission process has two parts.

1. Submission registration 
First, authors are asked to fill out a submission registration form
<http://euralex2010.eu/en/submission.php>, which provides the congress
organisers with important administrative information. Submission registration
forms can be obtained by sending an e-mail to the address info@euralex2010.nl.

2. Submission 
Once the registration process is successfully completed, authors are asked to
send by e-mail to the address info@euralex2010.nl an MS-Word or RTF attachment
with the title of their contribution and the submission, preferably in English.
Authors are asked to refrain from including their names in the attachment, but
please ensure that the title of the submission is the same as the one
registered. Submissions should reach the programme committee before 1 October 2009.

Format guidelines for submissions:
Font: Times New Roman, 12pt 
Spacing: double-spaced 
Number of pages: 
Contributed Papers: 6-8 pages 
Student Papers: 4 pages 
Software Demonstrations: 4 pages 
Posters: 1-2 pages 

Once we have received the file and have checked to see that everything is in
order, you will receive a message confirming that your submission will be
reviewed for presentation at Euralex 2010.

Authors whose submissions are accepted will receive a style guide for the
preparation of the final version of the paper to be published in the Proceedings
immediately before the congress.
