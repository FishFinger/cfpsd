Full Title: Towards a Transliteration Standard of Arabic: Challenge 

Date: 15-Dec-2009 - 16-Dec-2009
Location: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates 
Contact Person: Dr. Sattar Izwaini
Meeting Email: sizwaini@aus.edu

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Writing Systems 

Subject Language(s): Arabic, Standard (arb)

Call Deadline: 01-Jul-2009 

Meeting Description:

Arabic proper names of individuals, locations, cities, as well as titles of
books, or any quotation from Arabic texts are transliterated in Latin
script in different ways. Presentation of Arabic letters is realized in
different forms that usually lead to confusion and multiplicity of versions
and even failing to identify identity. For example,  ????is written inter
alia as Muhammad, Muhamed, Mohamed, and Mohammed. How can we differentiate
between ???? and ????, or ???? and ???? when they are transliterated? They
can be written in very similar, if not identical, forms. There is a need to
improve the quality of our communication; effective and efficient
communication is one of the prerequisites for excellence. Moreover,
individuals may face unnecessary inconveniences, at certain points, simply
because their names are transliterated/pronounced in different ways, e.g.,
when cashing a check, who is ?Alaa Amir? Is it ???? ????, ???? ????, ????
????, or ???? ?????

There are some transliteration systems that are used around the world to
write Arabic proper nouns and words in Latin letters using different
representations, but there is no one unified standard used to transliterate
Arabic names. A standard based on straightforward rules with clear
representation is now needed more than ever. 

Call for Papers:

You are invited to submit papers that investigate the different aspects of
this issue and propose solutions. Papers on transliteration software and
demos are also welcome. Please submit an abstract (200-300 words) outlining
the main points that will be dealt with in your paper. Papers should
address the following areas: 

-Historical developments and transliteration systems. 
-Problems and challenges that transliteration of Arabic names face.
-Solutions viable for those problems and challenges.
-Laws and governmental guidelines and rules regarding transliteration.
-Transliteration criteria. Is there a standard or standards? What are the
essential characteristics of the transliteration standard?
-How Arabic language academies have dealt with transliteration.
-The experiences of other languages in transliteration.
-Software that carry out transliteration automatically, the standard they
adopt, and the rules used in those software.

Deadlines:

1 July 2009: submission of abstracts or expression of intention to attend
1 ?August 2009: notification of acceptance and providing feedback
1 October 2009: submitting papers
15 November 2009: providing feedback
1 December 2009: submitting the final version of papers
15-16 December 2009: Symposium
