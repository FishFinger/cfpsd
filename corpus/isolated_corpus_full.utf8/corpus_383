concerned with the Malay/Indonesian language in any of its varieties. In addition to the 
standardized versions of Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia, papers are particularly 
welcome dealing with non-canonical isolects such as regional dialects of Malay and 
Indonesian, contact varieties, and other closely related Malayic languages. Papers may be in
