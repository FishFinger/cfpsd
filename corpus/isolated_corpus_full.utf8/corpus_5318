Meeting Description:

Workshop on Scalar Structure and Event Structure
(hosted by the Chronos 9 colloquium)

University Paris-Diderot/Paris 7, September 2-4, 2009
Deadline : 31. May 2009

Although it still constitutes a relatively new empirical field, the study of the
relationship between scalar structure and event structure has proved very
fruitful over the past few years, by nourishing a wealth of new formal and
theoretical approaches to aspectual meaning. The notion of scales/scalar
structures/degree scales has been playing a prominent role in the aspectual
literature since the 1990's, following seminal work by e.g. Ch. Kennedy, L.
McNally, J. Hay & B. Levin; and a large number of recent contribution to the
domain of aspect/Aktionsart have focused on this very issue (cf. Rothstein 2004,
Filip & Rothstein 2005, Filip 2007, Winter 2006, Caudal & Nicolas 2005, Gawron
2006, Piñón 2008, Kennedy & Levin 2008, Beavers 2008, among others).
The present workshop (co-organized by U. Paris 7 and U. Chicago, and hosted by
the Chronos 9 Colloquium) will constitute a unique opportunity of bringing
together and confronting different recent approaches to the connection between
aspect and scalarity, and of assessing their predictive power by applying them
to original data (cf. e.g. Thomas 2007).
