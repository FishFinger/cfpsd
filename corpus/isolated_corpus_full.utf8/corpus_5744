Third International Contest on

Semantic Service Selection (S3)

October 25, 2009

@ 3rd International Workshop SMR2 of the
8th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC)
Washington D.C., USA

Contest website:
http://www.dfki.de/~klusch/s3/html/2009
=========================================

The international S3 contest on semantic service selection
provides means and forum for the joint and comparative evaluation
of the retrieval performance (recall/precision, F1, AQRT, etc)
of publicly available Semantic Web service matchmakers over
given public test collections.

This year, the S3 Contest features three tracks:

Track 1: OWL-S matchmaker evaluation

Track 2: SAWSDL matchmaker evaluation

Track 3: Service selection cross-evaluation

Preliminary Program
*******************
http://www-ags.dfki.uni-sb.de/~klusch/s3/html/program1.html

How to Participate in the S3 Contest?
*************************************

The first two tracks of the contest are based on readily available
semantic service retrieval test collections OWLS-TC3 and SAWSDL-TC2
for OWL-S, respectively, SAWSDL service selection approaches (matchmakers).
Participation requires you only to make your individual service matchmaker
available for its evaluation by the semantic service retrieval evaluation
environment SME2.

OWLS-TC3: http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/owls-tc/
SAWSDL-TC2: http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/sawsdl-tc/
SME2: http://projects.semwebcentral.org/projects/sme2/

The third track is open for any service matchmaker: To participate in
this special track on service selection cross-evaluation, you need to
provide your own semantic annotations of services in the given special
collection JGD (Jena Geographical Dataset) of geographical services
in the formalism of your choice (OWL-S, SAWSDL, WSML, Text/Tagging, etc),
and possibly your special matchmaker for this format.
The special JGD collection will be included in the test collections
OWLS-TC3 and SAWSDL-TC2.

Results of all three tracks will be presented and discussed at the SMR2
Workshop at ISWC 2009.

For detailed information on how to participate with your matchmaker, pls 
visit
http://www.dfki.de/~klusch/s3/html/participation2.html

Please let us know whether you are planning to participate in the S3
Contest, especially what track, and if so when we may expect your entry.
Please do not hesitate to contact us in case you encounter any problems
with using the SME2 for your matchmaker which we could help you to 
easily solve.
Thanks!

Deadline for Submissions of Entries
***********************************

Deadline for submissions to the S3 Contest in 2009:

October 6, 2009

If your entry could be ready before this deadline
PLEASE do not hesitate to do and submit it to us as soon as possible
for testing it, thus making sure everything runs smoothly in the final
presentation round!

PLEASE NOTE: Submissions of entries to the S3 contest that reach us
after this year's deadline will be automatically taken for the 2010
edition of the S3 contest - unless you tell us differently.

In addition, you may also consider submitting a paper that describes
your semantic service matchmaking approach to the SMR2 workshop
which is hosting the S3 contest this year:
http://www.dfki.de/~klusch/smr2-09/html/submission.html
The submission deadline for this workshop is Ausgust 11, 2009.
Submission of a paper to SMR2 is NOT a requirement for participating
in the S3 contest though.
Thanks a lot for your efforts and support of this contest in advance!!

Registration
************

Participation in the S3 contest is entirely free of charge. However,
we strongly encourage you to also attend the final presentation of the
results of the S3 contest 2009 at the hosting workshop SMR2
(http://www.dfki.de/~klusch/smr2-09/) which, in this case, requires
your registration to both the ISWC 2009 conference
(http://iswc2009.semanticweb.org/) and the SMR2 workshop.
