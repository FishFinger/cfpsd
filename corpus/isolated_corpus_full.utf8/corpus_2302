                       CALL FOR PAPERS

                    LREC 2008 Workshop on

       Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data
                         (LaTeCH 2008)

                         Special Theme:
          "Resources and Tools for Studying Language
                     Variety and Change"

               1 June, 2008, Marrakech, Morocco

                 http://ilk.uvt.nl/latech08/

              Submission deadline: 20 February 2008

*********************************************************

The Second Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data
(LaTeCH 2008) will be held in conjunction with LREC 2008, and will
take place on June 1 in Marrakech, Morocco.

* SCOPE AND TOPICS

Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large
collections of cultural and scientific heritage objects, such as
archaeological artefacts, audio and video recordings, manuscripts,
archival documents and other written sources. Such collections are a
potentially very valuable resource for specialists and laypersons
alike, provided they can be easily accessed and automatically
processed. Furthermore, textual cultural heritage resources, such as
old manuscripts and early printed books, are not only interesting for
their information content, but are also an invaluable source for
linguistic research on diachronic and synchronic language variety and
change. While several large scale digitisation projects are currently
underway to make cultural heritage resources more accessible, it is
equally important to develop powerful tools to search, link, enrich,
and mine the digitised data. Language technology has a crucial role to
play in this, even for collections which are primarily non-textual,
since text is the pervasive medium used for meta-data. At the same
time, the cultural heritage domain poses special challenges for the
NLP community, including the use of historic or non-standard language,
the presence of OCR or transcription errors in the data, and the
necessity to deal with data from various media.

For LaTeCH 2008, we invite papers on language technology for cultural
heritage data in general and on the special theme of "Studying
Language Variety and Change". Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to, the following:

    - enriching cultural heritage data by inducing meta-data
    - dealing with linguistic variation and non-standard or
      non-contemporary use of language
    - automatic error detection and cleaning
    - adapting existing NLP tools for the cultural heritage domain
    - linking and retrieving information from different sources, media,
      and languages
    - representing cultural heritage data to different audiences
      (personalisation, text simplification, text summarisation, text
      generation from databases, hypertext generation)
    - knowledge discovery in cultural heritage data
    - complex annotation tools
    - determination of word and sentence boundaries within manuscripts
    - resources for and treatment of dialects (general solutions)
    - annotations of language variety on the orthographic, morphological,
      and syntactic level
    - global language resource management systems
    - repositories of cultural and scientific heritage data


* SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished
work in the topic area of this workshop. Submissions should should not
exceed 8 pages and should be typeset using a font size of 11
points. (Style files will be made available by LREC for the
camera-ready versions of accepted papers.)

The reviewing of the papers will be blind and the papers should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be
reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Accepted
papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

Papers should be submitted electronically, no later than February 20,
2008. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe
PDF. Details about the submission procedure will be published on the
workshop webpage (http://ilk.uvt.nl/latech08/) closer to the time.
