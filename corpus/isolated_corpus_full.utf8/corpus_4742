Meeting Description:

The Grammar of Reiteration in Creole and Other Natural Languages

This one-day workshop is organised in relation to the Van Gogh Project 30-670
'Topic, focus and reduplication: a cross-linguistic approach', jointly directed
by the University of Amsterdam and the Groupe de Recherche sur les Grammaires
Creoles (Research Project on Creole Grammars), UMR SFL/University of Paris-8/CNRS. 

Call for Papers  

The theme of the workshop is the grammar of reiteration Ñ a nontechnical term 
chosen to encompass any linguistic form involving two or several occurrences 
of the same expression within the bounds of a certain domain, regardless of
linear adjacency between the reiterated strings. 

Reiteration phenomena are clearly heterogeneous in nature and call for diverse
analyses bringing out (morpho)phonological, (morpho)syntactic, semantic and/or 
pragmatic constraints and generalisations. The research groups organising the
workshop have a special interest in Creole languages Ñ which justifies their
being overtly distinguished in the proposed title. However, since Creole
grammars activate exactly the same types of grammatical mechanisms as other
natural languages, projects based on non-Creole languages may also crucially
contribute to our global understanding of reiteration. 

The study of reiteration raises a number of descriptive and theoretical issues
which include the following: 
- What types of (phonological, morphological, syntactic) structures may underlie
reiteration phenomena? 
- When reiteration involves two adjacent meaningful expressions, are they merged
in syntax or in morphology? 
- Can we correlate types of reiteration and types of semantic effects? 
- Is a copy mechanism at work in the derivation of some reiteration data? If so,
what type of copy mechanism? 
- Are some types of reiteration dependent on specific (phonological,
morphological, syntactic) properties, and if so, which ones? 

Eight 35-minute talks (+ 10' for discussion) will be selected for the workshop.
Abstract selection will favour projects based on the in-depth study of one (or
two) specific languages. 

One-page (single-spaced) abstracts should be sent to : < taalwetenschap-
fgw@uva.nl>. Please send 2 copies: one anonymous, one with author's
identification, and type 'Abstracts Paris' in the 'object' slot of your email.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
