CALL FOR PAPERS

Articles and contributions are invited from scholars and experts for a book
project titled Current perspectives in Syntax and Dialectology.

The book will be a resource book on diverse aspects of Dialect Syntax in
Nigerian Languages. It will also be an outlet for researchers in the field
of micro-comparative syntax. The goal is to stimulate cooperation in the
study of dialect syntax which is a rapidly growing field. The study of
linguistic diversity is one of the keys to understanding the human
linguistic capacity and the limits within which human language systems may
vary. Such studies may be approached in various ways: empirical viewpoints,
micro- and macro comparative studies, etc. The book on dialect syntax will
highlight the relations between dialects and linguistic theory and,
dialects and linguistic change, among others.

Papers dealing with any language or language area are welcome, and we
particularly encourage studies related to the Nigerian Languages.

Please send contributions to either of the two editors. We are constrained
to receive papers sent by email attachment in editable formats such as MS
Word and others. The deadline for submission is 31st March 2008. Authors
will be contacted before May 31st 2008, after their papers would have gone
through blind review/assessment by our reviewers.

This book is scheduled for publication in the third quarter of 2008.
Thank you.

'Setting Language Research to Music' is a Newcastle University project whose aim
is to compose orchestra and choral music to demonstrate infant perception and
production.  The first piece of music to emerge from the project, 'Swing Cycle',
mimics babies' experience of discovering word boundaries, taking work by Peter
Jusczyk and  colleagues as a starting point.

The 'Swing Cycle' can be listened to by visiting:
