Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

IC3K 2009 - International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management - has currently an open call for papers. We hope to count with your participation in this conference by submitting a paper reflecting your research.
IC3K 2009 will be held in Funchal, Madeira (a Portuguese sub-tropical island in the Atlantic), next October 6-8, and it aims at becoming a top reference for researchers and practitioners in its area. If we live in the knowledge society and most enterprise activity is knowledge work, it is more important than ever to discover, understand and optimize our knowledge resources. 

The technical program will include a number of Keynote Lectures to be delivered by distinguished world-class researchers, including:
- Andreas Dengel, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH), Germany
- David Jensen, University of Massachusetts Amherst, U.S.A.
- Dan Kirsch, Knowledge Management Professional Society (KMPro), U.S.A.
- Steffen Staab, University of Koblenz, Germany
- Justin Zhan, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.

This meeting will take place yearly, bringing together top researchers and practitioners in knowledge technologies, especially those related to Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management.
The three main topic areas have been defined as concurrent and co-located sub-conferences of IC3K, namely:
- Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval (http://www.kdir.ic3k.org/)
- Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development (http://www.keod.ic3k.org/)
- Knowledge Management and Information Sharing (http://www.kmis.ic3k.org/)

Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, in paper and in CD-ROM support. Additionally, a selection of the best papers of the conference will be published in a book, by Springer. Best paper awards will also be distributed during the conference.
The conference proceedings will be indexed in the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography.

Further details can be found at the conference web site (http://www.ic3k.org).

Special sessions are also invited. If you'd like to take the opportunity to gather your R&D project group or hold a meeting within the scope of IC3K at the conference venue, please contact the secretariat. Special session papers will be included in the conference proceedings.

Kind regards,
Vera Coelho
