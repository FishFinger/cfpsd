Date: 12-Mar-2009 - 13-Mar-2009

Contact Person: William McGregor
Meeting Email: linwmg@hum.au.dk

Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics; Morphology; Semantics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2008 

Meeting Description:

The focus of this conference is on the diachrony of classification systems,
including not just linguistic classification systems such as noun classes and
classifiers, but also script classifiers, ontologies, and ethnobotanical
classification systems. Papers will address questions as to how classification
systems arise, how they change, and how they disappear. 

Call for Papers

Recent years have seen much work directed at the study of classifiers in
languages (Aikhenvald 2000, Senft 2000, Grinevald and Seifart 2004, Seifart and
Payne 2007). Most of this work, however, has focused on typological and
synchronic aspects of classifier systems. In this conference we would like to
bring together scholars who are interested in looking at the ways in which
linguistic classifications arise, change, or disappear again. What is the role
of diffusion in such processes? What can be diffused - for instance, is it
possible for the idea of classifier systems to be diffused, or must forms also
be diffused? Are there generalizations to be made about the sorts of semantic
distinctions expected to be found in more vs. less grammaticalised systems of
classification? How does a system of classification treat 'intrusive' items from
a different cultural group, or new items from within? How stable are systems of
classification over time, including in extraordinary circumstances such as
language attrition?

We are not only interested in linguistic classification systems such as numeral
classifiers, noun classes, and verbal classifiers but also more broadly in
classification systems overall, i.e. including script classifiers (e.g.,
Egyptian, Chinese or Maya writing), ontologies, ethnobotanical classification
system, etc.
