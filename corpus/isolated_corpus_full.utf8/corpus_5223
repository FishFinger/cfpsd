Meeting Description:

Terminologie et Intelligence Artificielle (TIA - 2009)
8th Terminology and Artificial Intelligence Conference
Toulouse (IRIT) , France
18-20 November 2009

In all specialized fields, knowledge is stored and disseminated in the form of documents. In some cases, document management (ranking according to relevance to a query, for instance) and acquisition and extraction of knowledge for indexing, modeling and conceptualization rely on terminological and linguistic studies. Hence, terminology and linguistics supply key concepts to other disciplines such as natural language processing, information science and knowledge engineering. Conversely, these disciplines bring to light new problems and issues and present new challenges and perspectives for terminology and linguistics. For nearly 15 years, TIA conferences have provided a forum for researchers working in these various fields to come together.

The 2009 TIA Conference will focus mainly - although not exclusively - on terms and terminological systems. Terms are used as focal points for knowledge structuring in many applications, including ontologies, thesauri, and other conventional terminological resources such as specialized dictionaries and terminological databases. A number of semantic relations between terms may be identified (and may vary depending on the application). However, although the aim of all of these applications is a certain degree of stability, the linguistic nature of terms and of the relations they share raises many questions. Which relations should be represented in specific applications? How should terms and the relations between them be represented? How can the relations in terminological resources and their linguistic representation in texts be linked? 

Call for Papers
Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2009

Submitted papers may address theoretical or methodological issues.Interdisciplinary work that focuses on collaboration between disciplines when dealing with terminological issues is strongly encouraged.

Topics

Proposals addressing the theme 'Terms and terminological systems' are strongly encouraged. However, other proposals dealing with innovative theoretical, methodological, or practical questions are also welcome. Possible topics include:
- Semantic theories and terminology in relation to text linguistics and
ontologies (especially theoretical linguistic approaches to describing terms and terminological structures)
- Representation of terms and semantic or conceptual relations in specific types of data structures (ontologies, thesauri, etc.)
- Representation of terms and semantic or conceptual relations in multilingual applications
-Ontological resources from different languages, communities or time frames
- Theoretical and technical problems in automated or manual compilation of terminologies using mono- or multi-lingual corpora
- Methods for automatic terminology structuring (identification of relations between terms, linking of terms to specific fields of knowledge)
- Studies on the relationships between ontologies and terminologies and/or thesauri:
-Use of terminologies to compile and structure ontologies
-Use of ontological modeling for a better understanding of the semantics of thesauri and terminologies
- Evaluation methods and criteria, and validation of terminologies
- Problems in compiling multilingual terminologies
- Reuse, standardization, comparison and merging of terminological or ontological resources
- Applications of terminological resources (the Semantic Web, information retrieval, technology watch, question answering, document management, ranking and/or classification, etc.)
