Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

We would like to draw your attention to the 5th International Conference on Software and Data Technologies (ICSOFT 2010), which has currently an open call for papers.
ICSOFT 2010 will be held in Athens, Greece next July 22-24 and will be organized by INSTICC (Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication) in cooperation with IICREST (Interdisciplinary Institute for Collaboration and Research on Enterprise Systems and Technology) and WfMC (Workflow Management Coalition) and hosted by the University of Piraeus.

The yearly meeting place of top researchers and practitioners in Enterprise Software Technology, Software Engineering, Data Management, and applications related to Information Technologies, ICSOFT is now one of the largest conferences in the world in its area; organized in an yearly basis, ICSOFT provides a forum for top researchers to regularly present their work.

The conference proceedings will be indexed by major international indexers namely, Thomson Reuters - Conference Proceedings Citation Index, INSPEC, DBLP and EI (Awaiting confirmation of indexation). 

The conference has a double-blind review process and after a strict selection procedure all accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support. Every year, extended versions of the best conference papers are published in a book, by Springer-Verlag.

All published papers will be also available at the INSTICC's Digital Library, which will be made available shortly.

Two prestigious awards (the "Best Paper Award" and the "Best Student Paper Award") will be announced during the conference. These awards, signs of excellence for their recipients, are selected from the set of outstanding full papers presented at the conference, based on the best combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation produced by the reviewers.

We would also ike to draw your attention to the following specialized satellite workshop:
- Int'l Workshop on Recent Trends in Software Engineering for Context-Aware Applications (RTSE4CAA 2010) 		
(see details below)

You may obtain further information at the conference web site (http://www.icsoft.org). 
Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.
