                   SECOND AND FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
                 Submission Deadline 15th January 2007

        Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative Evaluation in
                     Natural Language Generation

                          Arlington, VA USA
                          April 20-21, 2007
          http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/

OBJECTIVES

The aim of this workshop is to bring together leading international
researchers in the field of natural language generation (NLG), with the
aim of establishing a clear, community-wide, position on the role of
shared tasks and comparative evaluation in NLG research. There are many
views held in the NLG community as to the proper role of evaluation, but
so far there has been little scope to hammer out these positions in a
forum that provides the time and involvement required to subject the
different views to rigorous debate. (See the web site for further
background.) Our aim is for this workshop to provide that forum. We =
expect
the workshop to result in the working out of a number of clearly argued
positions on the issue that will serve as a base resource for the field
moving forward.

POSITION STATEMENTS

To spark discussion at the workshop, we invite the submission of short
position statements that make explicit arguments for or against the
adoption of shared evaluation campaigns in NLG; and/or argue for =
specific
approaches to comparative evaluation in NLG. Position statements will be
reviewed by the committee listed below. Authors of accepted statements
will be invited to attend the workshop.

REVIEW COMMITTEE

Dr Anja Belz            University of Brighton, UK
Prof Robert Dale        Macquarie University, Australia
Dr Helmut Horacek       University of Saarbr=FCcken, Germany
Prof Donia Scott        The Open University, UK
Dr Michael White        The Ohio State University, USA

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Position statements should follow the two-column format of ACL =
proceedings
(http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/styles/), should be in
PDF format, and should not exceed two (2) pages, including references.
These statements should be accompanied by a short (half page) =
biographical
sketch, also in PDF, highlighting previous work in NLG. Reviewing will =
not
be blind. Please send your position statement and biographical sketch to
Michael White (mwhite at ling.ohio-state.edu) and Robert Dale (rdale at
ics.mq.edu.au) by no later than Monday January 15, 2007.

WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION

Our intention is to hold the workshop at the Hilton Arlington adjacent =
to
the NSF's offices in Washington, DC. The workshop is planned for April
20-21, 2007, immediately prior to the HLT-NAACL conference in Rochester,
NY, to maximize opportunities for attendance by overseas participants =
who
are already coming to that event. The workshop program will contain =
ample
time for intense and focused discussion, and will include breakout
sessions where groups of 4-5 attendees will each elaborate on a specific
proposal for how to address the evaluation question in NLG. The outcomes
of the workshop will be documented in a report, brought together by the
organizers, summarizing the workshop discussions and including the
participants' contributions. These proceedings will be made publicly
available on the workshop website.

TIMETABLE

January 15, 2007        Deadline for submitting position statements
February 15, 2007       Acceptance decisions returned
April 20-21, 2007       Workshop in Arlington, VA

TRAVEL SUPPORT

We are currently looking into ways to provide travel support to attend
this meeting. If you do not have access to appropriate funds, please let
us know so we can gauge the level of need. Note, however, that
international participants will be encouraged to seek travel funds from
their respective countries.

QUESTIONS

Questions regarding the workshop, its topics and submission procedure
should be directed to the organizers, Michael White (mwhite at
ling.ohio-state.edu) and Robert Dale (rdale at ics.mq.edu.au).
