        ACL-07 Call for Tutorial Proposals

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for
the Tutorial Program for the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association
for Computational Linguistics (ACL-07), to be held in Prague, Czech
Republic, from June 24 to June 29, 2007. The tutorials will be held
on June 24, 2007.

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of computational linguistics
and its applications are sought. Especially encouraged are
cross-disciplinary tutorials that educate the community about recent
technical advancements in neighboring disciplines that are of
interest to computational linguistics, or introduce relevant
algorithms and theory that may be "old hat" to specialists in these
areas but are still unfamiliar to part of the natural language
processing community.

The ACL has a set of policies on tutorials. You can find general
information on policies regarding financial support of ACL tutorials,
at the following URL:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/tutorial-payment-policy.html.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its
    relevance to the ACL community (not more than 2 pages).

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
    tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot =20
(including
    a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are
    available as well.

3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
    the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of =20
their
    research interests and areas of expertise.

4. A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same
    or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an =20
estimate
    of the audience size.

5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g.,
    internet access).

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text
no later than December 15, 2006 to

        tutorials@acl2007.org

The subject line should be: "ACL-07 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

PLEASE NOTE: PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY REGULAR MAIL OR FAX.


TUTORIAL SPEAKER RESPONSIBILITIES

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by January 15, 2007, and
must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the
conference registration material by February 16, 2007. The description
should be in two formats: an ASCII version that can be included in
email announcements and published on the conference web site, and a PDF
version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed =20
instructions
to follow). Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials, at least
containing copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the
material covered in the tutorial, by May 14, 2007.

Notification of acceptance: January 15, 2007
Tutorial descriptions due: February 16, 2007
