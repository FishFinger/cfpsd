FMCAD 2009 
First Call for Papers
International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design

University of Texas at Austin, Texas, USA
November 15 - 18, 2009

http://fmv.jku.at/fmcad09

Important Dates

  Abstract Submission: May 15

  Paper Submission: May 22

  Author Notification: July 31

  Final Version: August 21

  Conference: November 15-18

Conference Scope

  FMCAD 2009 is the ninth in a series of conferences on the theory
  and application of formal methods in hardware and system design and
  verification.  In 2005, the bi-annual FMCAD and its sister conference
  CHARME decided to merge to form an annual conference with a unified
  community. The resulting unified FMCAD provides a leading international
  forum to researchers and practitioners in academia and industry
  for presenting and discussing novel methods, technologies,
  theoretical results, and tools for formally reasoning about 
  computing systems, as well as open challenges therein.

Topics of Interest

  Foundations

    Advancing Industrial-Strength Technologies in Model Checking, 
    Theorem Proving, Equivalence Checking, Abstraction and Refinement 
    Techniques, Property-Preserving Reduction Techniques,
    Compositional Methods, Decision Procedures, SMT Solvers,
    Bit-Precise Reasoning, Word-Level Techniques,
    SAT- and BDD-Based Methods, Probabilistic Methods,
    Combining Deductive Methods with Decision Procedures.

  Verification Applications

    Tools, Industrial Experience Reports, Case Studies.
    
    We encourage the submission of materials relating to novel and
    challenging industrial-scale applications of formal methods, including
    problem domains where formal methods worked well or even fell short. We
    also encourage submissions relating to the development and execution of
    methodologies for formal and informal verification strategies.

  Applications of Formal Methods in Design

    Topics relating to the application and applicability of

    Assertion-Based Verification, Equivalence Checking,
    Transaction-Level Verification, Semi-Formal Verification,
    Runtime Verification, Simulation and Testcase Generation, 
    Coverage Analysis, Microcode Verification, Embedded Systems,
    Software Verification, Concurrent Systems, Timing Verification,
    Formal Approaches to Performance and Power.

  Model-Based Approaches

    Modeling and Specification Languages, 
    System-Level Design and Verification, 
    Design Derivation and Transformation,
    Correct-by-Construction Methods.

  Novel Technologies

    Formal methods for the design and verification of emerging and novel
    technologies, such as 
    
    Nano, Quantum, Biological, Video Gaming, and Multimedia Applications.

Paper Submissions

  Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format
  via EasyChair.  More details will be provided at
  http://fmv.jku.at/fmcad09/submissions.html.

  The proceedings are planned to be published by IEEE and ACM and will
  then be available online in the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE
  Xplore Digital Library. Two categories of papers can be submitted:
  regular papers (8 pages), containing original research that has not
  been previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication;
  and short papers (4 pages), describing applications, case studies,
  industrial experience reports, emerging results, or implemented tools
  with novel features.

  Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions
  format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size (see
  http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html). We
  recommend that self-citations be written in the third person,
  though authors will be required to identify themselves on their
  submissions. Submissions must contain original research that
  has not been previously published, nor concurrently submitted for
  publication. Any partial overlap with any published or concurrently
  submitted paper must be clearly indicated.

  If experimental results are reported, authors are strongly encouraged
  to provide adequate access to their data so that results can be
  independently verified.

  A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a distinguished
  paper award.
