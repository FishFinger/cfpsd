                            Call for Paper
       The 3rd International Workshop on Paraphrasing (IWP2005)

                 http://nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp/IWP2005/

                          IJCNLP-05 Workshop
                           October 14, 2005
                       Jeju Island, South Korea
======================================================================

Paper Submission Deadline: ** now June 6, noon (Japanese time) **

[Background and Goals]

    Paraphrases are alternative ways to convey the same information. As
    has been claimed by an increasing number of researchers,
    technology for generating and recognizing paraphrases can
    potentially benefit a broad range of NLP tasks including machine
    translation, reading assistance, multi-document summarization,
    information retrieval, and question answering.

    Motivated by this background, we organized international workshops
    on automatic paraphrasing in 2001 and 2003 (IWP2003), which
    successfully drew the growing interest of NLP researchers. As both
    workshops attracted attention and successfully finished, we will
    hold the third workshop in conjunction with IJCNLP-05, in order to
    collect existing and emerging research topics on automatic
    paraphrasing during the recent two years.

    The proposed workshop is intended to be the successor to these
    previous workshops. The goals of the workshop are to connect with a
    broader range of research activities related to automatic
    paraphrasing, and to place the workshops in a series with the aim of
    establishing a new research field.


[General Topics]

    The workshop will be open to any research topic related to
    paraphrasing of any language. More specifically, topics of interest
    include, but are not limited to:

        * typology of paraphrases
        * representation of paraphrases
        * automatic acquisition of paraphrases
        * algorithms for recognizing and generating paraphrases
        * existing and potential applications of automatic paraphrasing
        * computational modeling of linguistic theories on paraphrases
        * open resources for paraphrasing technology
        * methods for evaluating paraphrasing technology

    Given the location of the workshop, papers focusing on paraphrasing
    within the languages of the Asia-Pacific region are particularly
    encouraged.


[Special Topic: constructing paraphrase-related resources]

    The theme of the previous workshop in the series was the automated
    acquisition of paraphrase. A particular topic of interest for this
    workshop, then, is the issue of constructing paraphrase-related
    resources that would follow from this automated acquisition: What
    should these look like? How would dictionaries and corpora of
    automatically acquired paraphrases be defined?


[Submission Information]

    Paper submissions must be anonymous and are limited to at most 8
    pages including references, figures etc. Authors are required to
    follow the guidelines of IJCNLP-05 workshop style, by hopefully
    using either the LaTeX style file or the MS Word document template
    shown in the IJCNLP-05 style file page
    (http://www.afnlp.org/IJCNLP05/archives4.html). Only electronic
    submissions will be accepted. Please email your submission in PDF
    (preferred), PostScript, or MS Word to the following address:

                iwp2005-submission@nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp

    Each submission should also specify the author's name, affiliation,
    postal address, email address and title in the body of the email
    message. For more information, please make contact with the workshop
    co-chairs by using the same e-mail address above.
