International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information
Technology (IMCSIT 2009)=20

12-14 October 2009, Mragowo, Poland


The CLA Workshop is located within the framework of the IMCSIT
conference to create a dialog between researchers and practitioners
involved in Computational Linguistics and related areas of Information
Technology.

IMSCIT is a multi-disciplinary conference gathering scientists form
the different fields of IT & Computer Science together with
representatives of industry and end-users.
IMSCIT with its motto: "new ideas are born not inside peoples' heads
but in the space between them", quickly became a unique place to share
thoughts and ideas. This year's gathering is held in October 2009 in a
beautiful town of Mragowo in the midst of Mazury Lake Country.


Workshop Goals
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Computational Linguistics - Applications Workshop was created in
2008 in response to the fast-paced progress in the area.

Traditionally, computational linguistics was limited to the scientists
specialized in the processing of a natural language by computers.
Scientific approaches and practical techniques come from linguistics,
computer science, psychology, and mathematics. Nowadays, there is a
number of practical applications available. These applications are
sometimes developed by smart yet NLP-untrained developers who solve
the problems using sophisticated heuristics.

Computational Linguistics needs to be applied to make the full use of
the Internet. There is a definite need for software that can handle
unstructured text to allow search for information on the
web. According to the European Commission, Human Language Technologies
are one of the key research areas for the upcoming years. The priority
aim of the research in this area is to enable users to communicate
with the computer in their native language.

CLA'09 Workshop is a place where the parties meet to exchange views
and ideas with a benefit to all involved. The Workshop will focus on
practical outcome of modeling human language use and the applications
needed to improve human-machine interaction.


Paper Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This call is for papers that present research and developments on all
aspects of Natural Language Processing used in real-life applications,
such as (this list is not exhaustive):

 * information retrieval
 * extraction of linguistic knowledge from text corpora
 * semantic ontologies in computer linguistics
 * lexical resources
 * machine translation and translation aids
 * ambiguity resolution
 * text classification
 * corpus-based language modeling
 * POS-tagging
 * parsing issues
 * proofing tools
 * dialogue systems
 * machine learning methods applied to language processing
 * ontology and taxonomy evaluation
 * opinion mining
 * question answering
 * sentiment analysis
 * speech and audio processing
 * text summarization
 * use of NLP techniques in practical applications



Paper Presentation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The presentation of the paper has to include a demonstration of
an existing tool. The papers should include a section describing the tool
(or a prototype), which demonstrates the theory discussed in the paper.

The presentation is divided into two parts. First, the author(s) shortly
demonstrate their tools to the audience. In the second part, the authors
discuss their work with other participants and let the audience test their
software.

Papers will be evaluated and accepted on the basis of their technical
merit, usefulness of the real life application and relevance to the
workshop scope by the CLA'09 Program Committee
(http://www.imcsit.org/md/cmt/=E2=8A=82=3D219&pars=3D2). The paper will be =
assessed
by academics as well as industry representatives in order to assure fair
and balanced assessment.

All accepted and presented papers will be published in the Conference
Proceedings and included in the IEEE Xplore(R) database. The best
demonstrations will be selected to be shown to the general audience
of the conference at a plenary session.



Papers Submission Requirements
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

 * Authors should submit full papers (as Postscript, PDF of MSWord file).
 * The submissions are accepted via conference submission system
(http://www.papers.imcsit.org/) until May, 10, 2009.
 * The total length of a paper should not exceed 8 pages (IEEE style).

IEEE style templates are available at: http://submit.imcsit.org.
