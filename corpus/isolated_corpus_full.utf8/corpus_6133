Call for Papers for the Journal Topics in Cognitive Science (topiCS)

Production of Referring Expressions:  Bridging the gap between
computational and empirical approaches to reference.

Deadline for intention to submit:  1 February 2010
Deadline for submission of full papers:  1 March 2010

We invite substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics
related to the production of referring expressions. Contributions may focus
on computational, experimental, or theoretical approaches to reference.
Papers bridging two or more of these fields are especially encouraged.
Papers should not normally exceed 8,000 words, though this limit may be
extended in exceptional cases.

Editors for this topic are Kees van Deemter (University of Aberdeen, UK),
Albert Gatt (University of Malta, Malta), Roger van Gompel (University of
Dundee, UK) and Emiel Krahmer (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). If
prospective authors have any questions, they should contact the topiCS
editors at pre.topics@googlemail.com:
*********
Introduction to the topic:  Following on from a highly successful CogSci
workshop on the same theme (the PRE-CogSci 2009 workshop,
http://pre2009.uvt.nl/), we are pleased to launch this open Call for Papers
for the new journal Topics in Cognitive Sciences (topiCS). Participants in
the PRE workshop are invited to submit, but this Call is in no way
restricted to them. Submission procedures are specified below.

About the journal:  Topics in Cognitive Sciences is one of the two official
journals of the Cognitive Science Society, and is published by Wiley
International. This innovative publication continues in the tradition of
the Cognitive Science journal by being characterized by rigorous reviewing
and high-quality papers. As the name suggests, topiCS features multiple
scholarly papers dedicated to a single topic. Some of these topics will
appear together in one issue, but other topics may appear across several
issues. For more information on the journal and on preparing and submitting
a manuscript to topiCS, see http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/topiCS/index.html.

Background about the topic:  The production of referring expressions has
been studied from many perspectives including cognitive science,
psycholinguistics and computational linguistics, yet several open questions
remain about how human speakers refer to entities. A referring expression
is typically defined as one which is produced in order to identify an
object or set of objects for a listener or reader, in a relevant domain of
discourse. Research has zoomed in on definite descriptions, deictic
expressions, anaphors, and many other areas. In spite of several decades of
research on the topic, our understanding of it is still incomplete, in part
due to a lack of communication between the various disciplines, a
remarkable state of affairs given the substantial overlap in the topics
that these practitioners have investigated. We believe that the time is
ripe to bridge the gap between these disciplines. Psycholinguistics offers
important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying the production
of referring expressions, through carefully controlled experiments.
Computational linguistics has a well-established approach involving corpus
analysis and computational modeling. The goal of this topic is to foster
greater understanding and collaboration between psycholinguists,
computational linguists, and researchers in related fields (e.g.,
theoretical linguists interested in models of human language that are
grounded in cognitive principles), by making research results available and
accessible to both. For further information on the academic background to
these issues, see the PRE-CogSci Workshop website (http://pre2009.uvt.nl).

Specific topics of interest include computational and/or experimental
approaches to:

- different kinds of referring expressions; when are which types of
reference (pronouns, descriptions, etc.) most appropriate?
- plural and quantified references.
- vagueness:  the use of vague (e.g. gradable) predicates in referring
expressions.
- referential overspecification:  why and how do speakers overspecify?
- referential underspecification:  production of descriptions which do not
uniquely identify a referent.
- referring expressions in interactive settings; audience design,
adaptation and alignment.
- ambiguity avoidance in references.
- common ground, cooperativeness and shared/private information in reference.
- realization of referring expressions (including speech and gesture).
- visual scene perception and its influence on the production of referring
expressions.
- social and contextual factors in reference.
- data-collection and experimental evaluation methods.

Paper submission:  Manuscripts should follow the APA guidelines. Each
submission will be sent for review to three reviewers, including at least
one psycholinguist and one computational linguist. The only accepted format
for submitted abstracts is Adobe PDF. Submission is a two-stage process,
whereby authors first send an *intention to submit* by 1 February 2010
followed by the *actual submission* of papers (using TopiCS's submission
system) by 1 March 2010.
