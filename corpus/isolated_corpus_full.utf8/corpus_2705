Meeting Description:

Workshop on Integrating Embodied Conversational Agents with Speech
and Advanced Dialogue Modeling

Combining ECAs, Affective Speech Interfaces, and Dialogue Modeling to
improve language-based computer interaction. 

First Call for Papers for

Integrating Embodied Conversational Agents with Speech
and Advanced Dialogue Modeling

A Workshop in conjunction with the European Conference on AI
Monday 21st July, 2008 -- Patras, Greece
http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/ws-ecai08/

Topics and Goal:
Language technology is a key component in human-computer interfaces, as it
increases the chances for non-technical people to quickly and successfully
interact with computers. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can similarly
allow for easier communication as well as provide the familiarity they are used
to in conversations in their daily lives, while reducing the required learning time.

Research into ECAs has progressed to the point where it is common to include
them as an interface option, even in deployed commercial systems like website
assistants. However, like push-button telephone menus, their dialogue
capabilities have been extremely limited, due to ECA research that has focused
mainly on other issues such as believability and simulating low-level
multi-agent turn-based communication.

This workshop is intended to address this gap between the expectations and
actual capabilities of dialogue in ECAs, focusing on application areas where
it is already common to have ECA-based interaction. We welcome those
researchers who are interested in studying adding ECAs to existing advanced
dialogue systems, as well as those with applications involving ECAs who are
interested in endowing them with the ability to communicate via richer natural
language dialogue.

A further aim of this workshop is the use of affect in speech for dialogue-based
ECAs. Speech is a very natural form of interaction, and including affect in ECA
based interfaces provides for a more natural style of human-human conversation,
just as imperfect visual details underlie the ''uncanny valley'' phenomenon.
Understanding a user's affective state and communicating the internal affective
state in an ECA-based systems should provide for a more emotionally engaging
experience for the user, while helping establish trust.

We intend to explore topics from, but not limited to, the following areas:
- Dialogue strategies involving computer participants
- Infrastructure for interpretation and generation of natural language
- Representation and reasoning needed to add ECAs to existing applications
- Detecting affect in student utterances or generating affective feedback
- Integration of language with other modalities (e.g., speech and gesture)
- Authoring tools for ECAs that have dialogue systems
- Rigorous evaluation of any of the above topics

We welcome submissions for both oral (up to 8 pages) and poster presentation (up
to 4 pages) describing original, previously unpublished research.

Important Dates:
April 10, 2008  -  Workshop paper submission deadline.
May 10, 2008    -  Notification of workshop paper acceptance.
May 26, 2008    -  Workshop camera ready copy submission
July 21, 2008   -  Workshop date.
