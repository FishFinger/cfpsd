formal semantics as a subfield of linguistics. 

Call for Papers

Semantics and Linguistic Theory 19
April 3-5, 2009
The Ohio State University
http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/events/salt19/

Invited Speakers:
Regine Eckardt (University of Goettingen)
Delia Graff Fara (Princeton University)
Larry Horn (Yale University)
Chung-Chieh Shan (Rutgers)

Submission Deadline: December 28, 2008

We invite submissions of abstracts for papers (30-minute presentation plus
10-minute discussion) on any topic in natural language semantics with relevance
to linguistic theory. Abstracts must be anonymous. They should be at most 2
pages in length (A4 or US Letter), including examples and references, using a
12pt font with 1-inch (2.5 cm) margins on all four sides. These limitations will
be strictly enforced.

SALT 19 will feature a poster session. When you submit your abstract, you will
be asked to indicate whether you would like your abstract to be considered for
this session. Poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the
proceedings.

Policies:
Authors may be involved in at most two submissions and may be the sole author of
at most one abstract. No single author will be allowed to give more than one
presentation at the conference.

SALT does not accept papers that have been published or have been accepted for
publication at the time of the conference. In addition, preference will be given
to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We
therefore request that authors indicate prior or planned presentations of their
papers when they submit their abstracts.

Submission Details:
We will use Pasha for submission of abstracts; only pdf files can be accepted
through the system. To submit, please follow this link:
http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/events/salt19/abstracts/

Important Dates:
- Submission deadline: December 28, 2008
- Notification of acceptance: Early February, 2009
- Conference dates: April 3-5, 2009

If you have questions about SALT 19 or encounter problems with the submission
interface, do not hesitate to send us an e-mail: salt19ling.ohio-state.edu.

Proceedings:
All papers presented at the conference will be published in a SALT 19 volume
following the conclusion of the conference.

Support for SALT 19 comes from the following at OSU: the College of Humanities,
the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the Colleges of the Arts and
Sciences, the Center for Cognitive Science, and the Departments of Computer
Science and Engineering, East Asian Languages and Literatures, Linguistics, Near
Eastern Languages and Cultures, Philosophy, and Psychology.
