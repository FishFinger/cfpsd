SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

Third International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management (SUM 
2009)

Washington DC, USA, September 28-30, 2009

http://wwwinfo.deis.unical.it/~apugliese/SUM2009

A large amount of available data nowadays includes uncertain,
imprecise, and inconsistent information. The possibility of
integrating and exploiting these data calls for sound and efficient
techniques for managing uncertainty and handling inconsistency. These
issues, which have been traditionally addressed within the Artificial
Intelligence community, already play a key role in fields like
databases or the semantic Web.

The annual International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management
(SUM), grown out of this large interest in uncertainty and
inconsistency, aims at bringing together all those interested in the
management of uncertainty and inconsistency at large, fostering the
collaboration and cross-fertilization between the reasoning under
uncertainty community and the databases and semantic Web communities.

SUM 2009 is the third edition of the International Conference on
Scalable Uncertainty Management, following the successful previous
editions SUM 2007 in Washington DC, USA, and SUM 2008 in Naples,
Italy.

Submissions are solicited in all areas of massive uncertainty and
inconsistency, including (but not restricted to) the topics listed
below:

- probability logic
- fuzzy logic
- annotated logic
- Bayesian models
- Markov models
- possibilistic logic
- paraconsistent logic
- semantics of uncertain data
- formal models of uncertain data
- reasoning with uncertain and inconsistent information
- spatio-temporal uncertainty management
- probabilistic databases
- inconsistent databases
- uncertainty and inconsistency in the Web and in the Semantic Web
- uncertain database algebras
- query optimization with uncertainty
- query caching for uncertain databases
- indexing methods for uncertainty
- uncertain aggregate queries
- uncertainty in view management
- skyline query processing
- top-k queries and ranking
- approximate query processing
- uncertainty in data integration and exchange
- uncertainty in data streams
- uncertainty in information retrieval
- data sharing and uncertainty
- approximate schema and ontology mapping
- similarity in ontology languages
- similarity search and extraction
- information extraction
- vision and uncertainty
- audio processing and uncertainty
- multimedia and uncertainty
- text and uncertainty
- mobile systems and uncertainty
- image, speech, multimedia, and text information retrieval
- mining image, speech, multimedia, and text data
- personalization and user preferences
- mining in social networks
- uncertainty and trust issues
- ranking in information retrieval
- matchmaking and negotiation
- novel applications and systems

We especially want to encourage submissions from uncertainty and
inconsistency management in databases, as well as from uncertainty and
inconsistency handling in the Web and the Semantic Web. We seek both
theoretical and practical works.

Publication

The proceedings will be published by Springer as a volume in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science/Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI) series and will be available at the
conference. After the conference, we are also planning to edit a
special issue of a journal with selected papers from the conference.


Submission of papers

Submissions must be typeset using the Springer LaTeX2e style llncs for
Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The length should not exceed 12 pages
for full papers and 6 pages for short papers. Short papers should be
clearly marked as such in the title and in the EasyChair submission
system. Submissions which deviate substantially from these guidelines
may be rejected without review. Submissions will especially be judged
for originality and scientific quality. All accepted papers will be
included in the proceedings.


Important dates

Paper submission deadline: May 20, 2009
Accept/reject decisions: July 3, 2009
Camera ready papers due: July 10, 2009
Last day for author registration: July 30, 2009
