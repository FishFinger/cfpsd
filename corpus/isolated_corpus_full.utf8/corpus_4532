Who is interested in speaking at the CULP workshop?

Note that we already have one confirmed CHR-related talk, by Mike Elston 
of SSS Ltd.


 	     COMMERCIAL USERS OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING
                                          CULP 2009

 	  http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~toms/CULP2009/
                    Pasadena, CA, USA -- July 13-17
 			 Co-located with ICLP 2009

 				CALL FOR COMPANIES

Academic research in Logic Programming goes back at least as far as the early
1970s -- that is already more than 35 years. During most of that time, ICLP has
been the premier venue for presenting academic research, and many more related
workshops and symposia exist.  At the same time, Logic Programming is being
used widely in industry. However, it has enjoyed at lot less visibility there,
and until now it has lacked a designated forum that brings together industrial
practitioners and researchers.

The goal of this first Commercial Users of Logic Programming (CULP) workshop is
to put the commercial and practical use (and users) of Logic Programming in the
spotlight. It aims at providing professionals with an opportunity to share
their experience, and to enable contacts with other commercial users and
academics.

If you use Logic Programming in a commercial, industrial or governmental
setting, we warmheartedly invite you to consider giving a talk at the workshop.
Alternatively, if you know someone who would give a talk, please forward this
message to them.


FORMAT
------

CULP is organized as a workshop co-located with the 25th International
Conference on Logic Programming. The workshop takes place on a date to be
determined between July 13-17, 2009, in the Pasadena Convention Center in
Pasadena, California, USA.

Presentations will have 30 minute slots, of which at least 5 are reserved for
discussion. They inform participants about the use of logic programming in an
industrial setting.

Insights and reflections on many aspects are sought. For example, but not
exclusively:
- Programming in the different stages and styles of commercial development,
- Engineering, scalability and usability issues,
- Success stories and (non-)viability of Logic Programming in particular
   application areas,
- Aspects not directly related to application development, such as marketing,
   recruitment, management,...,
- ...

Novel research results are not expected. Of course, novel fields of application
and novel approaches will be very welcome.


SUBMISSIONS
-----------

If you are interested in presenting at CULP 2009, send an e-mail to
       tom -dot- schrijvers -at- cs -dot -kuleuven -dot -be
with your name, affiliation and a short description (at most one page)
of the proposed talk.

Full paper submissions are not required.
