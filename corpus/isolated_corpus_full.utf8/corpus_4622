** SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS **



DAARC2009
The 7th Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium

Goa, India
hosted by AU-KBC Research Centre, Anna University, Chennai
November 5-6, 2009

http://www.au-kbc.org/daarc2009/


Anaphora is a central topic in the study of natural language and
has long been the object of research in a wide range of disciplines
such as theoretical, corpus and computational linguistics, philosophy
of language, cognitive science, psycholinguistics and cognitive
psychology. On the other hand, the correct interpretation of anaphora
has played an increasingly vital role in real-world natural language
processing applications, including machine translation, automatic
abstracting, information extraction and question answering. As a
result, the processing of anaphora has become one of the most
productive topics of multi- and inter-disciplinary research, and has
enjoyed increased interest and attention in recent years.

In this context, the Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution
Colloquia (DAARC) have emerged as the major regular forum for
presentation and discussion of the best research results in this area.
Initiated in 1996 at Lancaster University and taken over in 2002 by
the University of Lisbon, and moving out of Europe for the first time
in 2009, to Goa, India, the DAARC series established itself as a
specialised and competitive forum for the presentation of the latest
results on anaphora processing, ranging from theoretical linguistic
approaches through psycholinguistic and cognitive work to corpus
studies and computational modelling.

The seventh Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium
DAARC2009) will take place in Goa, India, in November 5-6, 2009.  We
would like to invite anyone currently researching in the areas of
discourse anaphora and anaphor resolution, from any  methodological
perspective or framework, to submit a paper to DAARC2009.

The closing date for submission is April 7, 2009. Notification of
acceptance will be sent by June 15, 2009. Final versions of selected
papers to be included in the proceedings are expected by June 30,
2009.

Submissions (extended abstracts) must be anonymous and at most 3 pages
in length. For further details on the submission procedure and other
relevant info on the colloquium visit its website at:
