Full Title: Budapest Uralic Workshop 6 
Short Title: BUW 6 

Date: 11-Jan-2008 - 12-Jan-2008
Location: Budapest, Hungary 
Contact Person: Maria Sipos
Meeting Email: sipos@nytud.hu
Web Site: http://www.nytud.hu/bum6 (from 20 Aug 2007) 

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Language Family(ies): Uralic 

Call Deadline: 15-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers of phonology and
phonetics of the Uralic languages, covering all, phonological and phonetic
aspects of 'sound' ranging from articulatory or acoustic phonetics to the
syllable structure or the phonology of minor Uralic languages. 

One might say that phonological or phonetic descriptions are not in the focus of
Uralic studies nowadays. Nevertheless time to time relevant publications,
articles and books appear illuminating a neglected question or discussing a
repeatedly raised problem from a different aspect, not to mention
morphonological descriptions. To emphasize the importance of the subject is not
essential: irrespective of the theoretical framework, the treatment of 'sound'
is a relevant topic in Uralistics. The purpose of the workshop is to bring
together researchers of phonology and phonetics of the Uralic languages,
covering all, phonological and phonetic aspects of 'sound' ranging from
articulatory or acoustic phonetics to the syllable structure or the phonology of
minor Uralic languages. We invite papers addressing theoretical questions as
well as papers taking a specific, empirical viewpoint on one or more Uralic
languages. Presentations on lesser-studied languages or dialects and
non-historical descriptions are especially welcomed. The conference will include
plenary talks on general questions by internationally renowned experts, and oral
presentations, as well as posters.

Full Title: Gestures: A Comparison of Signed and Spoken Languages 

Date: 27-Feb-2008 - 29-Feb-2008
Location: Bamberg, Germany 
Contact Person: Ulrike Wrobel
Meeting Email: wrobel@daf.uni-muenchen.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 26-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description
Movements of the hands are an important part of natural communication.
Since the scholarly interest in issues of social interaction and spoken
language began to grow in the 1960s, spoken language linguists and
psychologists have described these parts of language as 'gestures'. Yet
their function appeared to be limited to accompanying speech: Gestures were
analysed as secondary articulation movements for a long time. 
From the beginning of sign language linguistics, however, it was clear that
these ideas would not hold for the movements of the hand used to speak
there: Articulating language by visible movements of the hands is of course
elementary to all signed languages.
In the 80s it was discovered that the communicative potential of manual
movements in spoken language goes further beyond accompanying language:
Gestures were no longer regarded as carrying additive information, but were
recognized as forming a core part of the shared communication process, even
as forming part of language itself. The spreading interest into these
properties of gesture provided grounds for the foundation of the
International Gesture Society and the launching of an interdisciplinary
journal called "Gesture". 

The workshop intends to focus on the consequences the two modalities afford
for the concept of gestures: How are gestures analysed in signed and spoken
languages? The following topics might be addressed:
- Transcription systems for movements of the hands
- Differences and similarities in movements of the hands in gestures and signs
- The nature of gestures and signs 
- Semantic constitution of gestures and signs
- Lexical problems concerning movements of the hands
- Morphophonological and syntactical uses of gestures and signs
- Gestures and signs as cognitive units
- Origo and deixis in signed and spoken languages
- Visual qualities of (narrative) perspectives, positions, viewpoints and
communicative roles.
Other topics are also welcome: The purpose of the workshop is to review the
concept of gesture for spoken and signed language by contrasting them. The
desirable aim of the workshop is a concerted appreciation of common
notions, terms, concepts, approaches and theories.
