LAST Call for paper

First French-speaking meeting around the framework Apache UIMA

Nantes, France, 7-11 July 2009
http://www.uima-fr.org/

Organized by the LINA CNRS UMR 6241 - University of Nantes
http://www.lina.univ-nantes.fr/

As part of the 10th edition of the Libre Software Meeting (LSM/RMLL)
under the conferences topic "Libre resources and software for
scientific research"
http://2009.rmll.info/Call-for-Communication-paper.html?lang=3Den


IMPORTANT DATES

May 29th, 2009: Intention of participation (stand for the registration) **N=
EW**
May 29th, 2009: Paper Submission Deadline **NEW**
June 3rd, 2009: Acceptance Notification **NEW**
July 7-11 2009: Conference and tutorial (to determine precisely with
the LSM organizers)


OBJECTIVES

The complex nature of NLP applications -and language itself- involves
mixing different models, resources
and algorithms in the same process, leading to interoperability and
data exchange issues.

The Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture
http://incubator.apache.org/uima) framework offers appealing solutions
to these problems. Apache UIMA is an open, industrial-strength,
scalable and extensible platform for creating, integrating and
deploying un-(/semi-)structured information (text, audio, video...)
management applications which help to build the bridge from
unstructured information to structured knowledge. Apache UIMA
dissociates the engineering middleware problems from NLP issues, its
principles (semantic search and content analytics) are undergoing a
standardization effort at OASIS
(http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uima/), its international
community is very active, and its Apache license fits research
objectives and allows collaboration with industrial partners.

>From 7 to 11 July 2009, the 10th edition of the LSM/RMLL (Libre
Software Meeting) will take place in Nantes, France. The LSM is an
opportunity for all sort of public (experts, beginners, professionals
or just curious people) to come together around the free software. It
is an event managed by Free, Libre and Open Source Software
users'associations from the whole country.

We would like to use this opportunity to organize a special meeting
around Apache UIMA to encourage the development of a user and
developer French-speaking community (http://www.uima-fr.org). We plan
to organize a one day meeting with both conferences and a tutorial
session. This meeting will be organized under the topic "Libre
resources and software for scientific research" of the RMLL
conferences.


TOPICS

  * Any Domain Type Systems Definition
