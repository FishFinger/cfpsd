Meeting Description:

Corpora - principled collections of data in electronic format - have emerge=
d
over the last decades as a powerful analytical tool both in applied and
theoretical linguistics. They have turned out of particularly significant
importance in studies on language variation and language varieties. Indeed,=
 the
wealth and amount of data made available through corpus compilation and que=
ry
tools have increasingly enabled researchers to explore differences across s=
poken
and written discourse, social, diachronic and geographic varieties, age gro=
ups,
gender, idiolects, etc.  The widening of studies on language variation and
language varieties, however, still calls for discussion on significant
methodological issues, which pose, among others, the following questions: W=
hat
are the major methodological problems in the research field? What is the ro=
le of
the comparative perspective? Which tools and methodology best suit research=
?

The conference intends to focus on such issues in order to provide a better
definition of the concepts under investigation and bring together significa=
nt
and innovative contributions in what is now understood as a widely research=
ed
area, thus presenting new tools and perspectives to be investigated. This i=
s
also the main general objective of the CLAVIER research group (Corpus and
Language Variation Research Group), a research centre recently founded by t=
he
Universities of Bergamo, Firenze, Modena and Reggio Emilia, Roma 'La Sapien=
za',
and Siena, and currently based in Modena. The point of departure is the
invaluable contribution of two complementary strands of linguistic investig=
ation
- corpus analysis and discourse analysis - to research on language variatio=
n in
English, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.=20

One of the purposes of the 2009 CLAVIER conference is to reinforce national=
 and
international cooperation with scholars and research centres that can widen=
 and
complement the interest in language variation currently driving research at=
 the
centre.

Plenaries:

Udo Fries (University of Z=FCrich)
Anna Mauranen (University of Helsinki)
Josef Schmied (University of Chemnitz)
Geoffrey Williams (University of Bretagne-Sud)=20

Call for Papers:

Extended deadline: July 15th 2009
Notification of acceptance: July 31st 2009

NB: Proposals for papers on any language are welcome

CLAVIER2009 would like to bring together different perspectives on language
variation and use. Plenaries and papers will aim at giving a special insigh=
t
into the following topics:

A. using historical corpora to investigate diachronic language variation
B. using corpora as an innovative tool in exploring geographic varieties
C. corpus linguistics in the investigation of non-native language use in
professional settings
D. corpus linguistics tools, special languages, and specialist lexicography=
.

Contributions concerning other topics will also be accepted on condition th=
at
they are relevant to the special theme of the Conference.

The conference will start early in the afternoon on the first day and close
around lunchtime on the third day. It will be immediately preceded by a
pre-conference workshop on specialist lexicography organized by the Modena
Lexi-Term research group. Conference participants are welcome to join the w=
orkshop.
