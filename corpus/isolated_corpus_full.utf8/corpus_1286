Co-hosted by the Korean Generative Grammar Circle and Dongguk University, Seoul
Invited Speaker: Marcel den Dikken (CUNY) 
Theme of General Session: Locality and Minimalism

2007 Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar will be held at
Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea, on August 8-11, organized by the Korean
Generative Grammar Circle. 

Call Deadline: 08-Apr-2007  
2nd Call for Papers 

SICOGG 9 
The 9th Seoul International Conference on Generative Grammar 
August 8-11, 2007 
Organized by 
The Korean Generative Grammar Circle (http://www.kggc.org ) 

General Session: Locality and Minimalism 

Invited Speaker: Marcel den Dikken (CUNY) 

While we especially encourage submissions touching on the theme of the general
session specified above, equal consideration will be given to papers from all
areas of generative grammar, which may include syntactic theory,
syntax-semantics interface, syntax-morphology interface, syntax-phonology
interface, syntactic acquisition, and others. The conference will consist of the
general session, the two additional workshops, and a series of lectures from the
invited speaker. The themes of the two additional workshops planned will be
described below. 

Abstracts should be anonymous and may not exceed 2 pages (A4), including
examples and references, with 2.54 cm (1 inch) margin on all four sides and
should employ the font Times New Roman 12 pt. Submissions are limited to a
maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author. Please send a
separate file containing the following information: (i) the title of the paper,
(ii) the author's name, (iii) affiliation, (iv) e-mail address, (v) telephone
number, and (vi) the preferred session (general or workshop(1) or (2)).
Abstracts should be sent electronically as Word or PDF attachments to Yeun-Jin
Jung at yjjung@deu.ac.kr no later than April 8, 2007. 

Abstracts will be reviewed by readers, and authors will be notified by March 31,
2007. Each speaker of the general and the workshop sessions will be allotted 20
minutes with 10 minutes for discussion. Accepted papers will be published in the
proceedings of 2007 Seoul International conference on Generative Grammar, which
will be distributed to the conference participants. All presenters will be asked
to provide camera-ready copies of their papers in publishable form by July 15,
2007. The text should be single-spaced and the general page limit is 20 pages
including appendices and references. 

All the information about the conference is available on our website:
http://mercury.hau.ac.kr/kggc/Conferences/SICOGG9/SICOGG9.htm or

date regarding possible alterations and changes. Additional questions concerning
the conference can be answered by sending to Myung-Kwan Park at parkmk@dgu.edu . 


Workshop 1: Syntax-Phonology Interface 

Recent developments in minimalism have stimulated vigorous debates on the
division of labor between syntax and phonology. The focus of research has been
put on a number of issues (although it is not limited to): (i) how much and what
types of syntactic information are accessible to the phonology, (ii) what
principles govern the linear organization of syntactic constituents, (iii)
isomorphism (or non-isomorphism) between syntactic and prosodic
boundaries/islands, (iv) constraints on chain pronunciation and ellipsis, (v)
possibilities of PF-movement and the relevant conditions, and (vi) relations
between focus and phrasal stress/information structure, etc. In many areas
related to such issues, however, it is still quite controversial whether a
particular linguistic phenomenon is an effect of narrow-syntactic computation or
an effect of PF mechanisms or a consequence of the interaction of manifold
syntactic and phonological peculiarities. Also, even among the accounts of a
phenomenon in terms of PF properties, controversies remain to be resolved over
the workings of the PF interface system itself. Given that properties of
interface systems have far-reaching consequences for our view of UG, a broad
array of issues and problems that have been raised in recent years from an
interdisciplinary point of view bear some scrutiny and assessment at the current
course of theoretical developments. 

Among the overall interface issues, this workshop aims to discuss issues on the
interaction between syntax and phonology, particularly the issues connected to
the ones mentioned above; but we also hope to extend the range of possible
topics to experimental findings on the syntax-phonology interface issues in the
applied linguistics field. 


Workshop 2: Light Verbs and Verbal Nouns 

We invite papers on theoretical and cross-linguistic approaches to the nature of
light verbs and/or verbal nouns. Light verb refers to a thematically incomplete
category which usually forms a complex predicate with theta-assigning
categories: in Korean and Japanese (and many other languages), verbal nouns
usually co-occur with the light verbs. 

The workshop may raise some of the following questions: 
(A) On the status of light verbs: 
(i) Is light vs. heavy distinction necessary across languages? 
(ii) Is a light verb lexical or functional? 
(iii) What is the role of light verb in connection to verbal nouns? 

(B) On the nature of verbal nouns: 
(i) What is the categorial status of VNs: V, N, or un(der)specified X? 
(ii) Are VNs or internal structures of VNs derived from V or N roots? 
(iii) In what ways do VNs differ from regular Ns? 

We also welcome diverse perspectives on these issues in relation to recent
developments in minimalist program: for example, the role of V and VP-shell,
copula, relators/linkers, gerunds, derived nominals, to list a few.

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

This session on 'Dynamic Phonology' is planned as part of the 38th Poznan
Linguistic Meeting (PLM). 

Citing the inherent variability found in speech, Port and Leary (2005, Language
81(4), 927-964) advocate abandoning formal phonology in favour of a dynamical
approach. While this proposal may be radical, it presents a clear challenge to
phonological theory to incorporate dynamic sound patterns. This session seeks to
go beyond traditional 'phonetically based phonology' by taking a discrete
perspective on inherently dynamic phenomena. We are looking for papers that
address any or all of the following questions. What kinds of dynamic phenomena
may (or may not) be modelled in phonological analyses? Which phonological
framework is best suited to incorporate the dynamics of speech? How can we
formalize formant transitions or coarticulation? Can transitions even be
considered as phonological objects? How can we represent 'fuzzy' boundaries
between phonological categories?

Please send abstracts to the PLM Organising Committee (plm@ifa.amu.edu.pl) in
accordance with the submission instructions.

Session organiser: Geoff Schwartz (email: geoff at ifa.amu.edu.pl)
