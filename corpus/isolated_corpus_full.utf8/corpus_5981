Meeting Description:

The purpose of the Typology Days in Tallinn is the following:

-To advance the scientific study of the Uralic languages (official language=
s as well as variants) and define their structures within the context of cr=
oss-linguistic diversity;
-To further mutual awareness, dialogue, and co-operation between the intern=
ational community of linguists specialized in the particular Uralic languag=
es and those interested in the Uralic data across theoretical frameworks an=
d subdisciplines;
-To provide a forum for the Uralic languages and for working towards a data=
base structure that is useful for linguists across linguistic frameworks, i=
n the spirit of linguistic typology; and by doing so, to identify the areas=
 of critically missing research in the Uralic linguistics.
-It is a twin event with Finiteness and Non-Finiteness, taking place on Nov=
ember 25, 2009 at the Institute of the Estonian Language, Tallinn.=20

 the Uralic languages.
