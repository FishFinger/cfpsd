Call for Papers

Submission deadline: 5 June 2009

Motivation
After the success of the first Workshop on Partial Parsing, we are happy to
announce Partial Parsing 2. Partial parsing has become a standard means of
integrating syntactic knowledge into high level applications such as information
retrieval, machine translation, or question answering, for which efficiency and
robustness is of importance. In comparison with chunking and deep parsing,
partial parsing consists in finding structure that is richer than chunks but
less exhaustive than full syntactico-semantic parses: partial parsing may
involve constructing nested structures (unlike simple chunking) without creating
the full parse of a sentence. However, partial parsing is not a single concept
but rather an area ranging from chunking to almost full parsing.  This workshop
will bring together  
researcher who work on partial parsing in its different interpretations.

Scope
The main areas of interest of the workshop include (but are not restricted to):
- linguistic richness of partial parsers for various applications: syntactic and
semantic headedness, the degree of hierarchical structure, semantic information
(anaphora, disambiguation);
- development methodologies for partial parsers: manual, machine learning, hybrid;
- the usability of language resources for the development of partial parsers;
- multi-lingual development of partial parsers, etc.;
- experience and utilization of existing tools for building partial parsers for
new languages;
- technical aspects of partial parsers:
robustness, scalability;
time and space complexity;
expressiveness of partial parsing formalisms (regular vs. context- free rules;
unification; type hierarchies; etc.);
- applications of partial parsers: information extraction, question answering,
machine translation, web text mining, acquisition of lexical information, etc.;
- evaluation methodologies for partial parsers: gold standards,
application-specific, reusability of evaluation resources for different partial
parsing tasks, etc.;
- ways of combining multiple partial parsers;
- comparison (classification) of partial parsers.

Submissions
Authors are invited to submit original research papers.  Papers should indicate
the state of completion of the reported results. In particular, any overlap with
previously published work should be clearly mentioned. Submissions will be
judged on correctness, novelty, technical strength, clarity of presentation, and
significance/relevance to the workshop.

Submissions should be no longer than 7 pages typeset in an 10pt font. Guidelines
are available at the RANLP 2009 web page: http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009.

Submission of papers will be handled using the START system, which will be
accessible from the workshop webpage.

Important Dates
Submission deadline: 5 June 2009
Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2009
Camera-ready version due: 24 August 2009

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
