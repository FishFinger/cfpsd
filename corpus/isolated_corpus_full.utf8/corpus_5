Call for Papers: ESSLLI'05 Student Session


We are pleased to announce the Student Session (StuS) of the 17th 
European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI'05, 
8-19 August, Edinburgh, http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/). We invite 
papers for oral and poster presentation from the areas of Logic, 
Language and Computation.
The ESSLLI Student Session encourages submissions from students at any 
level, undergraduate, as well as postgraduate. This year, unlike in the 
past, papers can be submitted for oral OR poster presentation 
separately.

Student authors are invited to submit a full paper, not to exceed 7 
pages of length exclusive of references. Papers are to be submitted 
with clear indications of the selected modality of presentation, i.e. 
oral or poster. The submissions will be reviewed by the student session 
program committee and selected reviewers.

The preferred formats of submissions are PostScript, PDF, or plain 
text, although other formats will also be accepted.

The paper and a separate identification page must be sent 
electronically to: gervain@sissa.it.

Deadline: 22nd February 2005.

For more information and the technical details of the submission, see:
