********* Final Call for Papers - ECIR 2010 *********

      32nd European Conference on Information Retrieval

      The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
      28 - 31 March 2010

      In cooperation with: BCS-IRSG, ACM SIGIR, The Open University, =

*****************************************************

       **01 Oct 2009: Paper submission deadline**


The European Conference on Information Retrieval provides an opportunity for
both new and established researchers to present research papers reporting
new, unpublished, and innovative research results within information
retrieval.

We are seeking the submission of high-quality and original research papers
that have not been previously published and are not under review for another
conference or journal. Submissions will be reviewed by experts on the basis
of the originality of the work, the validity of the results, chosen
methodology, writing quality and the overall contribution to the field of
Information Retrieval. ECIR has traditionally had a strong student focus.
Papers whose sole or main author is a young researcher and in particular,
postgraduate student or postdoctoral researcher are especially welcome.
Poster and demo submissions addressing any of the areas identified in the
conference topics are also invited. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate
work in progress and late-breaking research results. Papers that demonstrate
a high level of research adventure or which break out of the traditional IR
paradigms are particularly welcome.

The Program Chairs invite for the submission of original research papers and
posters in all areas of Information Retrieval, including but not limited to:

- Enterprise Search, Intranet, Desktop, Adversarial IR
- Web IR
- Digital libraries
- IR Theory and Formal Models
- Web log analysis
- Distributed IR, peer to peer IR, Mobile IR, Fusion/Combination
- Multimedia IR
- Cross-language retrieval, Multilingual retrieval, Machine translation =

for IR
- Topic detection and tracking, Routing, Content-based filtering, =

Collaborative filtering, Agents, Spam filtering
- Question answering, NLP for IR, Summarization, Lexical acquisition
- Text Data Mining
- Opinion Mining, Sentiment Analysis
- Text Categorization, Clustering
- Performance, Scalability, Architectures, Efficiency, Platforms
- Indexing, Query representation, Query reformulation, Structure-based =

representation, XML
- Metadata, Social networking/tagging
- Evaluation methods and metrics, Experimental design, Test collection
- Interactive IR, User studies, User models, Task-based IR
- User interfaces and visualization
- Other domain-specific IR (e.g., Genomic IR, legal IR, IR for chemical =

structures)
- Blog and online-community search

Authors are invited to submit research papers presenting original,
previously unpublished, work on or before 1 October 2009. Submissions must
be written in English following the LNCS guidelines and must not exceed 12
pages including references and figures. All papers will be refereed through
blind peer review. Accepted papers will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series. To allow a high degree of interaction, ECIR 2010
will have two presentation formats for full papers. They will either be
presented orally or in poster format. The 12 page limit in the proceedings
applies equally to these papers. The proceedings will be distributed to all
delegates at the Conference.
