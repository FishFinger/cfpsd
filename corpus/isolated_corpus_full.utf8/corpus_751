Conference Description:

The attention devoted to the linguistic phenomenon (or phenomena) known as English has resulted in a broad body of work in diverse research traditions, illustrating both the individual characteristics of the many Englishes, and the contributions that an understanding of these linguistic systems can make to our general knowledge of the human language faculty.

Our aims are (i) to encourage the cross-fertilisation of ideas between different frameworks and research traditions, all of which address the linguistics of English, and, furthermore, (ii) to promote discussion among researchers interested in linguistic theories (phonologists, syntacticians, variationists etc.) regarding what we mean when we use the word 'English' to describe the linguistic phenomena which we work to explain.

This conference aims, therefore, to provide a platform for work which deals with any aspect of the structure of contemporary varieties of English, in terms of their phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics etc., in any way which aims to be explanatory. Work on any variety (or number of varieties) is welcome, including variationist work which engages with issues of linguistic structure. We do not envisage this including work which is purely historical, but work which brings in diachrony in order to explain the structure of Present-Day English is certainly welcome. 

Abstracts are welcome on any area of the structure of contemporary varieties of English: phonology, phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, dialectology, etc.

Abstracts should be no longer than one side of A4, with 2.5cm margins, single-spaced, with a font size no smaller than 12, and with normal character spacing. All examples and references in the abstract should be included on the one single page, but it is enough, when referring to previous work, to cite ''Author (Date)'' in the body of the abstract - you do not need to include the full reference. 

Please send two copies of your abstract - one of these should be anonymous and one should include your name, affiliation and email at the top of the page, directly below the title. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by members of the organising committee and advisory board. The named file should be camera-ready, as it will be used in the abstracts booklet if the proposal is accepted. 

Abstracts must be in pdf file format and should be submitted by email to Lidia Philippe (iclce.toulouse@free.fr) with copy to Jacques Durand (jacques.durand@univ-tlse2.fr). 
 
To favour the presentation of work in progress, we plan to run a poster session for postgraduates only. Postgraduates interested in this possibility should send a proposal to Lidia Philippe (iclce.toulouse@free.fr). Please use the same format as for a paper submission (see above). If you want to submit the same abstract for a talk and a poster session, please indicate this in your email.

Time for papers: 30 minutes, plus 10 minutes for questions. 

An overhead projector will, of course, be available, and we will provide powerpoint facilities, if you notify us in advance. If you need other technical equipment, please say so in the message accompanying your abstract and we will do our best to provide it, although this cannot be guaranteed. 

Deadline for abstracts: 30th January 2007
