> "Code O:" How to Recover from Overwhelm
>
> "Overwhelm" is the new word-of the-day in the time management lexicon, as
> in, "I am dealing with overwhelm."  This may seem a fair descriptor of the
> world we live in today: tasks coming at us from all sides, and
> expectations for our work and personal life that simply cannot be met. The
> consequences of severe, persistent overwhelm can be serious: depression,
> stalled career progress, interpersonal messes.
>
> Note that in this usage, overwhelm is a noun, not a verb, implying that
> its origins are external to ourselves. I'm not going to argue about whose
> fault this state of affairs is - yours or theirs - but I will suggest here
> that you do have control over how you deal with "overwhelm."
>
> In this first article in my new series on time management, I lay out a
> series of steps you should take when you find yourself in the midst of
> overwhelm, that is, when you are so riddled with guilt and anxiety that
> you find yourself paralyzed, unable to take any action at all. If you have
> never found yourself in quite this bad a shape, my plan also rescues
> people from lesser degrees of trouble.
>
> The core principle for emerging from this state is to get you to engage in
> the moment. When we are in overwhelm, we are flying back and forth between
> the past (guilt) and future (fear) and passing right over the current
> moment - which is the only time over which we have any control.
>
> Code O: The Three Steps to Resuscitation
>
> Every code has a resuscitation phase. In this one, you are simply trying
> to get control of your emotions, and regain your ability to take action.
> The process will take anywhere from a few minutes to at most an hour to
> complete, so you do not need to worry about getting further behind on your
> priorities.
>
> Step One: Stop and take a deep breath.
>
> You need to bring your focus quickly back to this moment. This is a
> time-honored and time-tested way to do it. If you have trouble with this,
> W. Timothy Gallwey recommends actually saying the word "STOP!" aloud in
> order to get your own attention. (1)
>
> Step Two: Slow down.
>
> This advice seems counter-intuitive. You are behind! You need to go
> faster! Help! Remember the opening lines of Simon and Garfunkel's 59th
> Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)?
>
> "Slow down, you move too fast - you've got to make the morning last." (2)
>
> As the song says, slowing down actually leads to the feeling that you have
> more time. The key is to couple slow motion with attention to the moment.
> The effect is to block out everything and focus entirely on what you are
> doing in this moment. Perhaps this works because you are not "wasting" any
> time thinking about the past or future - so only 1/3 of the usual "stuff"
> is in your head.
>
> Productivity coach Martha Ringer says, "I practice 'exaggerated slowness'
> anytime I start to feel that 'way out ahead of myself' place. (3)
>
> You may doubt that this trick will help. When I recommended it to my then
> secretary several years ago, she looked at me as if I were crazy. The next
> day, however, she came back and said that it had been a miracle.
>
> Step Three: Complete a task.
>
> Randomly choose a task from your immediate environment and do it. Your
> priorities are not important in this step - in fact, an obsession with
> trying to find the very highest priority task to do may have precipitated
> the overwhelming episode in the first place!
>
> The point here is to get traction on the moment, engage your mind in work,
> and feel the victory of completing something. This will work with any task
> as long as it is something that needs to be done.
>
> After you have done a few tasks and are feeling calm and focused, try to
> move in one of these directions:
>
> 1.        Turn toward a high priority task or
> 2.        Begin to implement one of the stabilization methods described in
> the next section .
>
> In the unlikely event you just can't move to either of these, keep doing
> random (but needed) tasks and try to move on later.
>
> Assorted Methods to Stabilize
>
> This next set of activities can be done in any order, over several days or
> weeks. They are intended to get you back on your feet, and in a position
> to start putting together a long-term plan for organization and time
> management. Even if you stay in this phase for months, you will still be
> ahead of where you are now.
>
> Make a list of everything you have to do.
>
> The subtext here is that stress is increased the more you try to keep
> things in your head.4 Your brain was not designed to be a storage vault;
> it was designed to think.
>
> Begin by taking a blank piece of lined paper (or type if you like) and
> spend about 15 minutes writing down everything you can think of that you
> have to do. Big, little; now, later; work, home - everything that is in
> your head. Your eventual goal is to create an inventory of all potential
> work, but in the beginning, even before the list is complete, this
> exercise will almost immediately convert your previous existential,
> free-floating anxiety into focused energy. Now you can see before you, in
> black and white, the actual challenge you face. Now you have the chance to
> make better decisions about what to do next, as well as what you should
> not do at all. And you get the pleasure - and energy boost - of crossing
> off the tasks you complete.
>
> Jeffrey Mayer's method is the one I like best for this approach.5 Use a
> legal pad, date the top of the first page, and write one item on each
> line. Keep adding to this list as things come up. When a thing is done,
> cross it off by drawing a line all the way through. When a page is about
> 50 to 70% crossed out, tear off the page and copy the undone items onto a
> new page, and continue adding new items as they come up.
>
> Note that this is a "master" list, not a daily list. You should select no
> more than three critical tasks that you must do each day. Eventually you
> may want to work with a more sophisticated list system (the subject of
> future columns), but this simple running list will do for now.
>
> Clear your workspace.
>
> The goal at this stage is not organization, but focus. Thus, it is OK for
> the short run if you simply put everything from your desk on the floor.
> This gives you a clear space in which to do each task, without your eye
> (and mind) being drawn off-task by seeing the other work you need to do.
> As a simple next step, make a file folder for every project you are
> working on, and put these folders in one place. Then you can see all of
> your big tasks together, again giving you a concrete picture of your
> workload.

> Stephanie Winston, the "mother" of modern time management, describes this
> method in her book Getting Out from Under.6  She advises that when you are
> in crisis, it is better to make small adjustments so that you can get back
> in control. To apply this method, think of activities in your daily life
> that seem to take too much time, or that specifically add to your sense of
> overwhelm. Select one, and break it down into steps. Look at each step
> separately, and see if there is a way it can be done more quickly or
> efficiently, delegated to someone else, or eliminated altogether.
>
> For example, suppose you find yourself spending too much time doing
> laundry. The steps are collecting the dirty clothes, washing, drying,
> ironing, and distributing back to the owners. As a 10% solution, you could
> delegate the collecting and distributing to your children, and stop
> ironing the sheets!

> Face up to the AWOL syndrome.
>
> Mary McKinney, a psychologist who advises graduate students and faculty on
> achieving academic success, recently described this syndrome in her
> monthly newsletter. If you are like me, you will recognize this
> immediately. You have promised to have a chapter ready in June. August
> rolls around, and you have not even started - and you begin to fantasize
> that the chapter is a hallucination. Then in September you receive a
> politely worded e-mail asking for a progress report. You ignore it.
> Thereafter come more e-mails, followed by telephone calls at increasing
> frequency. You ignore them, all the while building up a store of guilt and
> fear. McKinley calls this going "AWOL."  (Read her original article at:
>
> http://www.successfulacademic.com/ezines/feb232006.htm.
>
> While you are there, sign up for her free newsletter via the link on her
> home page:
>
> http://www.successfulacademic.com/)
>
> The solution sounds painful - but it almost never is. Simply call or
> e-mail (the latter is usually easier unless you are very brave indeed) and
> say: "I am sorry I am late. Here is when I think I can get it done. Please
> let me know if that will work for you. SincerelyS." There is no need for
> going on and on about the late part - the recipient already knows you are
> late, and probably suspects that you are sorry. The only things that the
> recipient really wants to know are that you are alive and that you will
> re-negotiate a new deadline. I have experienced this syndrome many times
> in my career, and to date not one bad thing has happened to me as a result
> of owning up.
>
> "Overwhelm" may be inevitable, but by quickly recognizing it and
> performing a "Code O", you can minimize the time you spend there. The
> stabilization techniques will get you back on track and in a position to
> eventually make changes that will prevent serious overwhelm in the future
> - and those changes will be the topics of subsequent columns.
