International Workshop on the Semantic Representation of Spoken Language 
(SRSL7)
 
Salamanca, Spain (12-Nov-2007 - 13-Nov-2007)
http://www.dfki.de/~mpla/SRSL/
  
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in 
the semantic representation of spoken corpora, especially spontaneous 
speech. Spoken language is a pending issue in computational linguistics 
and artificial intelligence, both traditionally focused on written 
language, although semantic processing of speech is necessary for the 
understanding of both natural and human-machine interaction. The 
problems found when trying to linguistically structure spontaneous 
speech are leading to works focused on its semantic representation. 
In-depth research on the semantic representation of speech can provide 
us with a suitable basis for further analysis of related linguistic 
levels, like prosody or pragmatics.  
 
Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research 
concerning the semantic representation of spoken language. They can be 
full (6-8 pages) or short papers (3-4 pages).
 
Topics include:
 
-Corpus annotation: structures (frame-banks, proposition banks, etc.) 
and concepts (ontologies, named entities, etc.).
-Content identification and segmentation in spontaneous speech.
-Semantic interpretation in dialogues.
-Dialogue and discourse structures.
-Topic Detection and tracking.
-Multimodal Representations including speech.
-Natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems.
-Speech in embedded systems.
-Project descriptions about applications of spoken corpora semantic 
representations.
-Standardisation work.
 
Submissions must be written in English and should follow the Springer 
format. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the 
author's names and affiliations.
Submission will be via email and must be sent to 
manuel(dot)alcantara(at)dfki(dot)de. Accepted papers will appear in the 
proceedings of the workshop. Both full (6-8 pages including references) 
and short papers (3-4 pages including references) will have an oral 
presentation at the workshop within the framework of the CAEPIA 
conference in Salamanca (Spain).
