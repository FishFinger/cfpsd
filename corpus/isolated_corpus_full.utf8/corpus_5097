Meeting Description:

VERBAL-Workshop 'Sex & Sprache / Sex & Language', 6 - 7 December 2009, Annual
Conference of Austrian Linguistics (ÖLT), University of Salzburg

Even though there might be a biological foundation of sexuality, how we behave
sexually is also - or perhaps even primarily - a cultural phenomenon, being
informed by socially shared systems of beliefs and attitudes. This workshop will
explore the role that language plays in shaping and constructing these systems.
The VERBAL-workshop 'Sex & Language' is the third in the series '[x] & Language'
initiated by Eva Lavric. It will be organized by Marietta Calderón und Georg
Marko. The workshop will be part of the official programme of the Annual
Conference of Austrian Linguistics (ÖLT) at the University of Salzburg. The
conference fee for the ÖLT will probably be 20 euro. 

Call for Papers
We would like to invite you to submit an abstract of no more than 300 words to
marietta.calderon@sbg.ac.at by 15 August 2009. Individual presentations will be
allocated 30 minutes (including 10 minutes for discussion). The workshop
languages are English and German. We are planning to publish a volume of the
papers from the workshop.

We invite contributions that examine:
- Different genres and discourses (e.g. personal ads, pornography and erotica,
sex guides, internet forums, newspaper articles on sex crimes, scientific accounts)
- From different social domains (ranging from the media and entertainment to
science) 
- Drawing upon different methodologies and approaches ((critical) discourse
analysis, conversation analysis, comparative and contrastive synchronic or
diachronic analysis, lexicology, phraseology and paremiology, psycholinguistics,
etc.) 
- Focusing on a variety of topics (e.g. gender roles, ethnic roles, queer
voices, rape myths, tabooization, commercialization, etc.) 

There are no restrictions on the language or the semiotic mode of the material
to be analysed as we are looking for a wide range of different contributions.
