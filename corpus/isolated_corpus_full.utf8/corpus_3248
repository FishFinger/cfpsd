Meeting Description:

ALTW 2008: A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised
by the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event will be
the sixth annual instalment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and
the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various
guises since the early 90s. 

Call For Papers

Australasian Language Technology Workshop (ALTW2008)

8-10 December 2008
CSIRO ICT Centre, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia
http://www.alta.asn.au/events/alta2008
in conjunction with the Australasian Document Computing Symposium

Overview

The ALTA Workshop (ALTW) will be held in conjunction with the Australian
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), which focuses on issues ranging from the
fundamentals of document architectures and standards for mark up, through
various aspects of document processing, and we will continue the tradition of
holding a joint ADCS-ALTW session. This will be held on 8 December as the final
session of ADCS and the opening session of ALTW.

The goals of the workshop are:

- to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia
and New Zealand and encourage interactions;
- to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community and with the
wider international LT community;
- to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers; to
encourage dissemination of research results;
- to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;
- to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to
become aware of local LT research; and, finally,
- to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas.

As with the 2007 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in addition to the
regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive discussion of
research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage submissions from students
describing their thesis work and any preliminary results. Note that both
publication types will have the same status in the proceedings.

Topics:
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
- interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
- language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
- message and narrative understanding systems;
- information retrieval and question answering;
- natural language and multimodal systems;
- machine translation and translation aids;
- speech understanding and generation;
- evaluations of language systems;
- embodied conversational agents;
- computational lexicography;
- summarisation.

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT community, and
particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community
through the consideration of practical LT applications and through
multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from
industry.

Submission Format:
Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, NOT including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files
tailored for this year's conference. The style files and example documents are
available from the workshop website. We reserve the right to reject submissions
that do not conform to these styles including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems, please
contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be rejected without
being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send an early version with the
typographical complexity of your final intended version so that we can check it
is printable. All papers should include the full authors' names and
affiliations. (Note that this diverges from the ''blind'' submission guidelines
adopted for ACL conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the workshop
website. Contact the organisers for any questions regarding this process.

Proceedings:
A proceedings containing all papers (presentations and posters) will be produced
in online and CD-ROM formats. The online format will have an ISSN number.

Important Dates:
- Paper submission: 31 August 2008
- Submission date for Hons/Ugrad students: 17 September 2008*
- Notification of acceptance: 6 October 2008
- Camera-ready copy: 19 October  2008
- Workshop: 8-10 December 2008

We have instituted a later submission deadline for papers with first-named
authors that are current Honours or Undergraduate students. If you qualify for
this condition and plan to submit to this deadline then you must register an
''Intention to Submit'' with the workshop chairs by the normal submission due
date. Send an email to the organisers with title, authors, and abstract.

Workshop Co-Chairs:
- David Powers (Flinders University)
- Nicola Stokes (University College Dublin)

Enquiries:
The Australasian Language Technology Workshop is being organised by
ALTA, the Australasian Language Technology Association.

Meeting Description:

Symposium on Pragmatics and Intercultural Communication in Spanish 

Call for Papers

Venue: Stewart House/Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU
Co-ordinators: M.E. Placencia, Birkbeck, University of London &  C. García,
Arizona State University

Keynote speakers include/Conferencistas invitados: 
Kristine Fitch, University of Iowa, Francisco Raga Gimeno (Grupo CRIT),
Universidad Jaume I, Helen Spencer-Oatey, University of Warwick 

The purpose of this symposium is to provide a platform to explore different
aspects of intercultural communication in Spanish from a broadly defined
pragmatics perspective and thus contribute to the development of this area of
research with respect to the Spanish-speaking world. 

Intercultural communication between Spanish speakers from different regions and
ethnic groups, including local indigenous populations, as well as between native
speakers of Spanish and speakers of English and other languages who have Spanish
as L2, has received relatively little attention from a pragmatics perspective. 

This is, however, an area of rapidly growing importance given the social
realities of Spanish / Spanish cultures in contact with other Spanish language
varieties or other languages / cultures in different regions of the world.
Internal and external migration as well as globalization and the development of
new technologies are making intercultural communication an increasingly
important feature of social life. 

Both theoretical and empirical papers will be welcome, in addition to papers
focusing on methodological aspects of the study of intercultural communication
and the development of intercultural competence. Empirical papers may focus on
different domains of analysis and different contexts, including interactions
mediated by (new) technologies. They may also concentrate on the local context
of interactions or their relationship to the macro context, as in studies on
prejudice and racism in intercultural communication. Additionally, contrastive
studies will be welcome, as will studies of monolingual / monocultural
interactions that explore the connections between language and culture and
consider the wider implications for intercultural communication. 

The official languages of the Symposium are Spanish and English. 

Deadline for submission of abstracts: 11 January 2009 

Abstracts of 300 words max should be submitted in Word, Times New Roman, 12
points. The paper title should be centred and followed by the author's
(authors') name, affiliation and e-mail address. Abstracts for empirical studies
should include, in addition to the aims of the study, information of the corpus
employed, methodology and basic findings.
