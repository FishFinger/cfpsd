Meeting Description:

SSCS 2009 is a workshop held in conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2009 
(http://www.acmmm09.org).

Multimedia content often contains spoken audio as a key component. Although 
speech is generally acknowledged as the quintessential carrier of semantic 
information, spoken audio remains underexploited by multimedia retrieval 
systems. In particular, the potential of speech technology to improve 
information access has not yet been successfully extended beyond multimedia 
content containing scripted speech, such as broadcast news. The SSCS 2009 
workshop is dedicated to fostering search research based on speech technology 
as it expands into spoken content domains involving non-scripted, less-highly 
conventionalized, conversational speech characterized by wide variability of 
speaking styles and recording conditions. Such domains include podcasts, video 
diaries, lifelogs, meetings, call center recordings, social video networks, Web 
TV, conversational broadcast, lectures, discussions, debates, interviews and 
cultural heritage archives. This year we are setting a particular focus on the 
user and the use of speech techniques and technology in real-life multimedia 
access systems and have chosen the theme 'Speech technology in the multimedia 
access framework.'

The development of robust, scalable, affordable approaches for accessing 
multimedia collections with a spoken component requires the sustained 
collaboration of researchers in the areas of speech recognition, audio 
processing, multimedia analysis and information retrieval. Motivated by the aim 
of providing a forum where these disciplines can engage in productive 
interaction and exchange, Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS) 
workshops were held in conjunction with SIGIR 2007 in Amsterdam and with SIGIR 
2008 in Singapore. The SSCS workshop series continues with SSCS 2009 held in 
conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2009 in Beijing.

Call for Papers

The SSCS 2009 workshop will focus on addressing the research challenges for the 
field of Spoken Document Retrieval that were identified during SSCS 2008: 
Integration, Interface/Interaction, Scale/Scope, and Community.

We welcome contributions on a range of trans-disciplinary issues related to 
these research challenges, including:

Integration:
-Information retrieval techniques based on speech analysis (e.g., applied to 
speech recognition lattices) 
-Search effectiveness (e.g., evidence combination, query/document expansion) 
-Self-improving systems (e.g., unsupervised adaptation, recursive metadata refinement) 
-Exploitation of audio analysis (e.g., speaker emotional state, speaker characteristics, speaking style) 
-Integration of higher-level semantics, including cross-modal concept detection 
-Combination of indexing features from video, text and speech

Interface/Interaction:
-Surrogates for representation or browsing of spoken content 
-Intelligent playback: exploiting semantics in the media player 
-Relevance intervals: determining the boundaries of query-related media segments 
-Cross-media linking and link visualization deploying speech transcripts

Scale/Scope:
-Large-scale speech indexing approaches (e.g., collection size, search speed) 
-Dealing with collections containing multiple languages 
-Affordable, light-weight solutions for small collections, i.e., for the long tail

Community:
-Stakeholder participation in design and realization of real world applications 
-Exploiting user contributions (e.g., tags, ratings, comments, corrections, usage information, community structure)

Contributions for oral presentations (8-10 pages) poster presentations (2 
pages), demonstration descriptions (2 pages) and position papers for selection 
of panel members (2 pages) will be accepted. Further information including 
submission guidelines is available on the workshop website: 
http://ict.ewi.tudelft.nl/SSCS2009/

Important Dates:
Monday, June 15, 2009 (Extended) Submission Deadline 
Saturday, July 10, 2009 Author Notification 
Friday, July 17, 2009 Camera Ready Deadline 
Friday, October 23, 2009 Workshop in Beijing
