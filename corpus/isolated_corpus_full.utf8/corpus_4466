Meeting Description:

The 8th Conference on Languages of Far East, Southeast Asia and West Africa will
revive the tradition of biennials convened in the late 1990s - early 2000s in
Moscow and St. Petersburg. This time the conference will be hosted by the
Institute for Information in Social Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences in
conjunction with the University of Moscow and St. Petersburg. As before, the
Conference will focus on the remarkable far-reaching parallelism in syntactic
and semantic structures of the languages of the Far East, Southeast Asia and
West Africa which cannot be explained either by genealogical affinity, or by
geographic factors. Both individual language investigations and typological
studies are encouraged.


Further information about keynote speakers, registration fee and accommodation 
will be posted on the conference website at a later date.
