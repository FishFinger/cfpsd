Description of the conference:

In today's globalized world of mobilities and flows, multilingualism is
increasingly an everyday phenomenon that people encounter and have to cope with
in work, education, institutions, leisure time and media uses, for example. In
these various contexts, multilingualism can be mediated
not only by languages, but also by a range of other semiotic means such as
genres, discourses, styles, embodied action and visuality.  

At the same time multilingualism is a mediational system in itself, sustaining,
but also mobilizing and reorganizing language user identities, relationships and
possibilities for action and the relative values of languages. Multilingualism
can thus have repercussions in terms of what resources and possibilities
individuals and groups have to agency and participation. 

The conference on Mediating Multilingualism approaches mediation and
multilingualism from this double perspective: in its focus are the different
ways and means for mediating multilingualism, as well as multilingualism as a
mediational system. The aim is to shed light on the complexities of this
relationship and to develop new ways of investigating and understanding the
roles, meanings and modalities of mediation in multilingual settings. To this
end, the conference aims at bringing together researchers, students, teachers
and other practitioners who share an interest in exploring the interface between
mediation and multilingualism as a particular linguistic, social, cultural and
ideological contact zone where the meanings of languages, identities and
relationships are reassessed and renegotiated. 

The conference is organized at the University of Jyväskylä as the 26th Summer
School of Applied Language Studies. It will consist of invited keynote lectures,
workshops and paper sessions. The topics of the keynote lectures and workshops
will be announced later. 
 
Call for Papers

Submissions are solicited for 20-min. papers and posters relating to the
conference theme. Studies on any languages and disciplinary takes (e.g.
sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, discourse studies, pragmatics,
ethnography, and language learning and teaching) are welcome. The main working
language of the conference is English. Individual papers and posters can be
presented in other languages, but no interpretation services are automatically
provided by conference organization. Young scholars are encouraged to
contribute; five postgraduate students from non-EU countries will be excused
from paying the conference fee (applications to be included in the online
registration form, to appear on the conference website). 

Abstracts in English (max. 300 words) should be submitted via 'submission' on
the conference website
http://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/kielet/conference2008/en. The deadline for
submissions is January 15, 2008. All submissions will be reviewed; notification
of acceptance March 15, 2008.

Full Title: SYNLAC Workshop 2007: Language & Culture 

Date: 06-Dec-2007 - 07-Dec-2007
Location: Sydney, Australia 
Contact Person: Seiko Yasumoto
Meeting Email: Seiko.Yasumoto@usyd.edu.au

Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics; Discourse Analysis;
Sociolinguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description

The ultimate purpose of SYNLAC Workshop is to foster interaction between
linguistics and cultural studies. Through the workshop we encourage participants
in the workshop to expand their intellectual and academic horizons and create a
truly interdisciplinary atmosphere. We ask presenters to use non-technical
language and to get the audience actively involved. The length of presentations
in the workshop is in principle either 60 or 90 minutes; however, we will accept
shorter presentations. 

The deadline for abstract submission has now been extended to 31 October 2007.

SYNLAC Workshop 2007: Language & Culture
Workshop Theme: Media, Cultures and Social Networks
Date: 6th (Thursday) - 7th (Friday) December 2007
Venue: Camperdown Campus of The University of Sydney
Sponsored by The School of Languages and Cultures, The University of Sydney.

The Sydney Network for Language and Culture (SYNLAC) is pleased to invite you to
attend the 2007 Workshop either as a presenter or a participant. SYNLAC Workshop
2007 is calling for presentations that address the theme of Media, Cultures and
Social Networks:

The dynamics of political and economic groupings in the global scene are
constantly in a state of flux. Since the second half of the twentieth century,
nation-states have been merging into a progressively diminishing number of
political and economic blocs of different degrees of stability and harmony. The
second half of the twentieth century and by extension, the first half of the
twenty first century, will be seen as an era of transitions on a global scale.
Everyday a countless number of discourses and images of such reorganization is
disseminated and reinforced through mass media. It may well be argued that
without mass media such global reorganization would occur at a much slower pace
or not occur at all. In examining what may be obscured by media products and
processes, there is often a sense of the existence of interconnecting threads or
that of social networks. At the same time, these networks may themselves be
defined across a range of multi-modal products and processes such as newspapers,
magazines, journals, television, the internet and mobile telephony.
Internationally, media products and processes themselves appear intertwined in
ways not fully understood as possible drivers of the formation of economic and
political blocs. If we accept the possibility that media does indeed drive
global dynamics or form a substantial component of them, we believe it would be
necessary (1) to critically review media dynamics by taking into account the
values, interests and representations of entire social networks, and (2) to
investigate the range of discourses and images that are created and maintained
by these networks as well as their attendant purposes. In so doing, we believe
new insights into the interplay between language and culture in global politics
and economics will be gleaned.

We plan to produce a refereed publication based on the presentations featured in
the workshop.

If you wish to give a presentation, please send an abstract of 300 words to one
of the following board members:
Seiko Yasumoto, Keizo Nanri, Makoto Sasaki, Jose Meurer.
Please indicate how much time you anticipate your presentation will last, your
audio-visual equipment needs and include your current contact details.

The closing date of abstract submission is 31st (Wednesday) October 2007.
There is a $15 charge for registration which includes both morning and afternoon
refreshments.
