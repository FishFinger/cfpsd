                                  Scope

 Modelling is THE central task in informatics. Models are used to
 capture, analyse, understand, discuss, evaluate, specify, design,
 simulate, validate, test, verify and implement systems. Modelling needs
 an adequate repertoire of concepts, formalisms, languages, techniques
 and tools. This enables addressing distributed, concurrent and complex
 systems.

 Objects, components, and agents are fundamental units to organise
 models. They are also fundamental concepts of the modelling process.
 Even though software engineers intensively use models based on these
 fundamental units, and models are the subjects of theoretical research,
 the relations and potential mutual enhancements between theoretical and
 practical models have not been sufficiently investigated. There is
 still the need for better modelling languages, standards and tools.
 Important research areas are for example UML, BPEL, Petri nets, process
 algebras, or different kinds of logics. Application areas like business
 processes, (Web) services, production processes, organisation of
 systems, communication, cooperation, cooperation, ubiquity, mobility
 etc. will support the domain dependent modelling perspectives.

 Therefore, the workshop addresses all relations between theoretical
 foundations of models on the one hand and objects, components, and
 agents on the other hand with respect to modelling in general. The
 intention is to gather research and application directions to have a
 lively mutual exchange of ideas, knowledge, viewpoints, and
 experiences.

 The multiple perspectives on modelling and models in informatics are
 most welcome, since the presentation of them will lead to intensive
 discussions. Also the way objects, components, and agents are use to
 build architectures / general system structures and executing units /
 general system behaviours will provide new ideas for other areas.
 Therefore, we invite a wide variety of contributions, which will be
 reviewed by the PC-members who reflect important areas and perspectives
 for the Modelling of Objects, Components, and Agents (MOCA).

                                 Topics

 We look for contributions describing original research in topics
 related to formal methods in combination with object-orientation,
 components, or agents addressing open problems or presenting new ideas.
 Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
   * Uses of models of objects, components, and agents:
     design, specification, analysis, synthesis, composition,
     transformation, testing, validation, simulation, verification,
     assessment, software engineering, software development,
     re-engineering, code generation, prototyping, configuration,
     presentation, evolution, model checking, etc.
   * Concepts used within modelling of objects, components, and agents:
     objects (OOP, OOD, OOSE), components (CBD, CBSE), agents (AOP,
     AOSE, ABM), multi-agent systems (MAS), services, roles,
     interactions, organisations, processes, etc.
   * Concepts to be modelled with objects, components, and agents:
     software architecture, intelligence, coordination, negotiation,
     cooperation, organisation, encapsulation business objects,
     e-commerce, workflows, web services, flexible manufactoring, bio
     informatics, etc.
   * Techniques for modelling of objects, components, and agents:
     formal languages, visual languages, Unified Modelling Language
     (UML), Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), object-oriented
     Petri nets (OOPN), agent-oriented Petri nets, graph grammars and
     transformations, process algebras, logics, domain-specific
     languages (DSL), architecture description languages (ADL),
     event-driven process chains (EPC), discrete event systems,
     comparisons between modelling techniques, heterogeneous designs,
     multi-formalism modelling
   * Properties of models of objects, components, and agents:
     concurrency, distribution, mobility, autonomy, emotions,
     complexity, adaptability, self-organising, reliability,
     consistency, safety, deadlock prevention, evolution, scalability,
     etc.
   * Modelling methodologies, paradigms and principles
   * Embedding of formal techniques in traditional software engineering
     approaches
   * Tools and implementation technology in the fields mentioned above

                               Submissions

 The program committee invites submissions of full contributions (10 -
 20 pages) or short contributions (up to 6 pages). For your submission
 in PDF format please use the online conference management system at

          http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=moca09

 Just create a new account and then upload your paper. (Later you will
 be able to see your reviews there.)

                          Submission Guidelines

 Please use the LaTeX document class svmult.cls for your contributions.
 Please also use BibTeX for your references (in particular for the final
 papers). An up-to-date version of svmult.cls together with extensive
 documentation can be found at

           ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/compgl/mult

 or directly at

         ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/compgl/mult.zip

 Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings which will
 appear as a technical report of the Department of Informatics,
 University of Hamburg, and which will be available at the workshop.

 The submissions will be evaluated by the international program
 committee.
 It is planned to publish post proceedings after a further review
 process in a book, dedicated to the workshop topics.
