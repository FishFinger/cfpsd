Meeting Description

The First Oxford Workshop on Romance Verb Morphology will be held in Trinity
College, Oxford, UK from 27-28 August 2008 (Wed-Thu). The conference aims to
provide a forum for presenting research carried out by the members of the
AHRC-funded research project 'Autonomous Morphology in Diachrony: comparative
evidence from the Romance languages' at the University of Oxford
(http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/romance-morphology/). The focus of this two-day
conference will be on basic features of the structure of Romance verb paradigms,
especially on the notion of autonomously morphological structures in the Romance
inflectional system and their importance in diachronic change in the
paradigmatic system.
