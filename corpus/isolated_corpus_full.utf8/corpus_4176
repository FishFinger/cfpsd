typologists. Papers discussing correlations between individual word-formation
processes as well as between WF processes and genetic types and/or
geographically related languages are most welcome.  Space will also be given to
any other typologically oriented research into word-formation as well as papers
discussing the scope of word-formation and the relation between word-formation
and other linguistic disciplines.

Abstract of papers (500 words max.) clearly defining the topic and the
objectives pursued in the paper should be submitted by e-mail as Word
attachments to:

on the success of the first impoliteness conference (LIAR) at the University of
Huddersfield. However, we also welcome any papers that are related to politeness
theory, application or practice in any form. Researchers and postgraduates
working in fields such as linguistics, sociology, psychology, communication
studies, business studies, organizational studies, conflict resolution studies,
literature and philosophy are particularly welcomed, though the conference is
open to all interested parties.

Please contact the organizers regarding any proposals for panels.
