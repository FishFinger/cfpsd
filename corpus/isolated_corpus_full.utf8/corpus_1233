Subject: Workshop on Features 

	

Full Title: Workshop on Features 
Short Title: FEATURES 

Date: 01-Sep-2007 - 02-Sep-2007
Location: London, United Kingdom 
Contact Person: Anna Kibort
Meeting Email: a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description

The Workshop on Features (1-2 September 2007) will be associated with 
the LAGB 2007 conference at King's College London. It will bring together
linguists who have grappled with features as a component of theoretical models
together with others who have considered their range and variability in the
world's languages. 

First Call for Papers

Workshop on Features, 1-2 September 2007
King's College London
in association with the 2007 LAGB meeting

Deadline for abstracts: 9th April 2007

In attempting to understand language, a central notion is features. Examples are
person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, plural, dual...) tense (present,
past...), and inflectional class (I, II, III, IV...). Features have proven
invaluable for analysis and description, and have a major role in contemporary
linguistics, right across the range of the discipline. Yet little is firmly
established about features: we have no readily available inventory of which
features are found in the world's languages, no generally agreed account of how
they operate across different components of language and no certainty on how
they interact. Features are widely used, but are little discussed. The
conference will therefore bring together linguists who have grappled with
features as a component of theoretical models together with others who have
considered their range and variability in the world's languages.

There will be six guest speakers who have agreed to talk on the following topics:
- David Adger 'Features and functional categories' 
- Peter Austin 'Features and clause linkage' 
- Ann Copestake 'Features and computational semantics' 
- Ron Kaplan 'Formal aspects of underspecified features' 
- Maria Polinsky 'Featural asymmetries in long-distance agreement: why gender is
different from person' 
- Ivan Sag 'Feature geometry and predictions of locality'

Abstract format

Abstracts of talks (25 minutes plus 15 minutes discussion) on topics relating to
features must be presented as follows: the complete abstract (with the title of
paper, name of author and e-mail address, and author's affiliation) must be 
no longer than one A4 page with margins of at least 2.5cm on all sides. Only the
first page of any abstract submitted will be considered - no appendices or pages
for references can be accepted. You may use single spacing but type must be no
smaller than 12 points. If the paper is accepted, the abstract will be
photocopied and inserted directly into the collection of abstracts given to
participants, so the presentation should be clear and clean.

Abstract submission

Abstracts should be submitted by e-mail. You will need to send an e-mail with
two attachments: one of the attached files should be an anonymous copy of the
abstract (and should be named yoursurname-anon.pdf, or yoursurname-anon.doc,
etc.), and the other should have your name and affiliation, i.e. be camera-ready
(and should be named yoursurname-name.pdf, etc.). The attached files should be
in one of the following formats: pdf (preferred), or Word, or plain text. Any
special characters should either be embedded in a pdf file, or be in the Doulos
SIL font, which can be downloaded for free from this site:
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=DoulosSIL_download
   The e-mail should be sent to Anna Kibort (a.kibort@surrey.ac.uk). If several
authors are named in the abstract, you should specify one name and e-mail
address for correspondence in the body of the e-mail that you send the
attachments with. In the body of the e-mail you should also specify any special
requirements regarding audiovisual equipment. While we will make every effort to
provide such equipment, we cannot guarantee that it will be available. 

All abstracts must arrive by or on 9th April 2007.

The programme organisers of the Workshop are Greville Corbett and Anna
Kibort, Surrey Morphology Group (www.surrey.ac.uk/LIS/SMG/). The Workshop is
supported by the ESRC, within a project on Grammatical Features (grant number
RES-051-27-0122). The local organisers of the LAGB meeting at King's College
London, Devyani Sharma and Eleni Gregoromichelaki, have kindly agreed to take on
the local arrangements.
