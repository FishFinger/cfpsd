Linguistic Field(s): Syntax 

Call Deadline: 31-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:

Syntactic differences across languages have been regarded as the result of
variation on universal principles, and this variation has been captured in terms
of parameters. Among the most frequently mentioned syntactic issues in the
parameter approaches are the licensing conditions of null subjects, the
head-complement orders, the occurrence of certain types of overt syntactic
movement. However, the notion of syntactic parameters is not uncontroversial
(Uriagereka 1994, Baker 2001, Newmeyer 2004, 2005, Aronoff 2003, among others).
The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss syntactic facts that
either support or challenge the parameter approaches, in the Minimalist
theoretical framework. In addition to the "regular" mode of studies,
experimental studies, acquisition studies, and sign language studies are all
welcome. 

Important Dates:

August 31, 2007: Deadline for submitting the abstract.
November 30, 2007: Notification of acceptance.
 
Form and submission of abstracts:

An abstract (.pdf or .doc file) should be up to 3 pages long, including data and
references.

The abstract should start with the title of the paper, followed by the text of
the abstract.

Please do not include the author's name in the abstract. On a separate page,
please give the author's name, affiliation, e-mail address, telephone number,
mailing address, the paper title and the session number (title).
