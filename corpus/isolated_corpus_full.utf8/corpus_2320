GoTAL - 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing

Gothenburg, Sweden

25-27 August 2008

[www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal http://www.cse.chalmers.se/gotal.html]

The GoTAL conference will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden on 25-27 August, =

2008.
The conference is hosted by
Chalmers University of Technology jointly with
Gothenburg University, as part of the activities of
the Centre for Language Technology (CLT).
GoTAL is the sixth in the series of the TAL conferences, following
FracTAL (Besan=E7on, France, 1997),
VexTAL (Venice, Italy, 1999),
PorTAL (Faro, Algarve, Portugal, 2002),
EsTAL (Alicante, Spain, 2004), and
FinTAL (Turku, Finland 2006).
The main purpose of the TAL conference series is to bring together
scientists representing linguistics, computer science and related fields,
sharing a common interest in the advancement of computational linguistics
and natural language processing.


=3D=3DSCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE=3D=3D

research
on all aspects of computational linguistics and natural language and =

speech
processing, including, but not limited to:

=3D=3DPAPER SUBMISSION=3D=3D

We welcome submissions both from academia and the industry on any topic =

that
is of interest to the NLP community, particularly encouraging research
emphasizing multidisciplinary aspects of NLP and the interplay between
linguistics, computer science and application domains such as biomedicine,
communication systems, public services, and educational technology.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or
well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of
the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results
should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance
for quantitative results is encouraged. Submissions should contain =

original
material that has not been previously presented to the scientific =

community.
A parallel submission to other publication fora as well as a significant
overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly
indicated to the program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee =

members.
The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical =

quality,
and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories:
- **full papers**, describing substantial research with well-evaluated =

results
- **short papers**, typically describing ongoing research and preliminary =

results


All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference
proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk
and short papers will be presented as a poster.

Submissions will be made using EasyChair. The URL will be given here as =

soon
as the GoTAL submission service opens (in January). Also the lengths and =

styles
of submissions will be specified then.



=3D=3DPROCEEDINGS=3D=3D

The previous three TAL conferences had proceedings published in LNCS/LNAI.
For GoTAL, this has not yet been confirmed (as of 20 December 2007).

There will be three keynote speakers, whose names will be announced here
later.
