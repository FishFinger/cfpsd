Background

We are currently witnessing an increasing interest in multilingualism in many
different fields including IR (CLEF: Cross language Evaluation Forum, annual),
summarization (DUC), semantic aspects (SemEval 2007 Task 1: Evaluating WSD on
Cross-Language Information Retrieval), textual corpora, etc. Although issues
related to multilingualism have been debated in different workshops (as those
listed above), they are often considered from a computational perspective and
for specific applications. Seldom have multilingual resources and the different
problems related to their development and modelling have been considered as such.  

Also, the importance of assessing the quality of language resources is
increasingly recognized as far as monolingual resources and tasks are concerned.
Regarding specialized language resources the usual emphasis put on scale is
gradually shifting towards a concern about quality of corpora and language
resources. Also, as we start emphasizing the need to assess the quality of
multilingual resources, a set of new issues arises, such as quality criteria,
more detailed classification of factors that apply to monolingual as well as
multilingual resources, typologies of specialized corpora, terminological
characteristics that may appear in a language but not in another. There is an
acute need for addressing these issues and to explore multilingual and
comparative approaches in specialized language resources. These approaches will
come from different fields, including - but not limited to - linguistics,
terminology, information science and computational linguistics.

This workshop aims at bringing together experts from different backgrounds
concerned by the acquisition and modelling of multilingual specialized
information. The workshop will provide an opportunity to share experience on
multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized
information. It will also be a forum for discussing issues of a more fundamental
nature.

Topics

Equivalence in specialized resources and specialized corpora;
Multilingual and comparative approaches to the processing of specialized corpora;
Corpus-based approaches to multilingual modelling of terminological data;
Multilingual resources for terminology processing;
Linguistic evidence for multilingual NLP such as identification of cognates,
transliteration, morphological evidence, etc.
Comparative approaches to terminological variation and semantic relationships;
Comparative approaches to discourse analysis;
Comparative and multilingual approaches to document characterization;
Modelling of multilingual data in ontologies or other terminological resources;
Evaluation of multilingual resources and methods for acquiring them.

Submissions

Abstracts should be 5 pages long and sent in PDF format to Marie-Claude L'Homme
(mc.lhomme@umontreal.ca). Authors are requested to send an anonymized version of
their abstract. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings
and should adhere to the stylesheet that will be adopted for the LREC
Proceedings (to be announced later on the conference web site).

Important Dates

Submission of abstracts: 10 February 2008
Notification of acceptance: 10 March 2008
Final version for the proceedings: 12 April 2008

Meeting Description

AJIHLE is an association of junior researchers working in the field of
historical  linguistics and the history of linguistics who have not done their
PhD. It was founded in 1999 with the aim of functioning as a meeting point for
discussions and linguistic debate, and most of all, for the interchange of ideas
between philologists and linguists . After seven editions (Córdoba 2001,
Salamanca 2002, Jaén 2003, Madrid 2004, Sevilla 2005, Granada 2006 y Alcalá de
Henares 2007), the 8th edition will take place in Barcelona, between the
University of Barcelona (Universitat de Barcelona, UB) and the Authonomous
University of Barcelona (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, UAB). 
This congress will count with the participation of recognized specialists in
this area, such as:
Dr. Ralph Penny, Emeritus Professor, Queen Mary College, London.
Dr. Coloma Lleal, Historical Linguistics Professor, University of Barcelona.
Dr. José Manuel Blecua and Dr. Gloria Clavería, Historical Linguistics
Professors, Authonomous University of Barcelona.
Appart from individual contributions, there will also be two round tables,
organized by the association members, which will present two problematical
topics related with the history of Spanish and with historiographical issues. 
For far information, visit the webpage:
http://seneca.uab.es/files/8cnajihle/ 

Only contributions related with historical linguistics, the history of
linguistics or comparative analysis between Spanish and other languages -from a
historical perspective -will be welcomed. Spanish will be the meeting official
language. These are the areas where proposals will be admitted:

Historical Phonetics and Phonology
Historical Morphology and Syntax
Textual criticism
Historical Lexicography, lexicology and semantics
Ortography
History of linguistics and of linguistic ideas
History of Spanish and of linguistic ideas' methodology. Periodization
Historical Phraseology

Proposals by researchers possessing their PhD after the 31st of January 2008
will not be admitted.
