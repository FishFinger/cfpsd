Meeting Description:

Background:

The National Translation Mission - Central Institute of Indian Languages (N=
TM-CIIL) academic events woven around the translated versions of some the m=
ost celebrated novels in the history of Indian literature are designed to g=
enerate discursive discourse on the original-translation pair. These transl=
ated novels were a part of Macmillan project of translations which were ori=
ginally a collaboration between writers, translators and publishers to try =
and paint a vivid and general picture of Indian life as portrayed in the se=
rious fictions in Tamil, Telugu, Bangla, Malayalam, Oriya, Urdu, Gujrati, H=
indi and other Indian languages. Any event on Translation attempts to bring=
 various horizons together to meet, interact, unearth the other and provide=
 something concrete that will define or invite discourse on signs, signifie=
rs and signified of both the existing and the translated text. The proposed=
 NTM - CIIL events intends to break fresh grounds on translation scenario, =
in general, and are expected to provide material for South Asian literary c=
ourses and programmes, in particular.=20

This intended discourse attempts to direct us towards multiple perspectives=
 from which Translation can be looked at. Let us begin by stating that this=
 is an endeavor to look at the ways how narratives can be used in culture. =
The texts in discussion contribute to the most crucial negotiations in cult=
ural, social and political space. The importance to study these texts gain =
significance as they create the major debating spaces to negotiate ideas re=
garding social institutions like marriage, masculinity, the family, 'the wo=
man question', statements like representation, questions on difference vs .=
 commonality of experience (postcolonial attitude), the politics of transla=
tion, question of 'third language' so on and so forth. Under such circumsta=
nces then, these perspectives could proceed from language or could throw up=
 debates that have nothing to do with language. They could look at translat=
ion as a site of cultural traffic, as a site of cultural give-and-take, as =
a site of struggle, as an agent and catalyst of social change, as a place w=
here questions about human conditions, questions about the individual and a=
bout his/her equation with society and culture are asked and addressed as i=
n original literature.=20

Call for Papers:

The NTM-CIIL Macmillan series proposes to discover hitherto unrealized pote=
ntial of Translation.  These seminars should explore and investigate the dy=
namics of Translation per se- as an entity in its own right in the target m=
ilieu and see how the instant case situates itself with reference to variou=
s questions that one could ask.=20

In practical terms this means that one should:

-Look at the translation,=20
-Elucidate its dynamics as an object in itself,
-Analyze how adequate it is as an incarnation in the other language=20
-How creative a build-up it is on the original?
-On what lines it is a creative build-up?=20
-Relevance of various theories/streams of thought in understanding the nuan=
ces of translation

Please send abstracts of your paper by 10th July, 2009 to sriparna2006@gmai=
l.com
