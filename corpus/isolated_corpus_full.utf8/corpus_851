COLLOQUIUM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES

Genres of spoken and written texts are being intensively studied from var=
ious angles, e.g., communication studies, discourse analysis, computation=
al linguistics, without arriving at a generally accepted definition. The =
web is new, so it is not clear how to apply traditional notions of genre =
to web pages. In this colloquium we would like collect submissions that s=
tudy characteristics of web genres with respect to traditional paper genr=
es represented in electronic corpora like the BNC. 

Web documents are often characterised by a high level of genre hybridism,=
 by a fragmentation of
textuality across several documents, by the impact of technical features =
such as hyperlinking, posting facilities and multi-authoring. The web is =
a huge reservoir of documents that can be easily mined for building all s=
orts of corpora with many collections being built according to subjective=
 criteria for corpus composition, genre annotation, genre representativen=
ess and genre granularity. In this colloquium we would like to invite sub=
missions contributing to a reference corpus of web genres. The main goal =
of the colloquium is to draw up an initial list of characteristics and re=
quirements for building, annotating and evaluation reference corpora of w=
eb genres. For
instance:

* To what extent should genre hybridism and authorial creativity be  repr=
esented in a genre collection? These two phenomena appear to be very comm=
on on the web.

* To what extent is it possible to include "emerging genres", i.e., genre=
s still in a transitional phase in genre evolution? The web is currently =
thriving with emerging genres.

* How many granularities of the unit of analysis should be included? Only=
 genres representing web sites? Only genre representing web pages? Both? =


* What "format" should be used to store these units in a collection (e.g.=
, a database-like form, DOM trees, a net of graphs, in HTML format, in a =
text-only version, with or without embedded images, removing boilerplate =
components)?

* What level of genre granularity and similarity should be applied in the=
 reference corpus? Genre collections often show different levels of  gran=
ularity, including genres and super-genres. Should similar genres, such a=
s "tutorial" and "how-to", be accounted for separately? 

TOPICS:

The topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Text theory for the development of web corpora
- Modelling corpora of web genres
- Innovative genre classification schemes accounting for multi-genre and =
no-genre web documents
- Modelling genre annotation scheme for web documents (metadata organizat=
ion)
- Assembling a list of web genres for a reference corpus
- Creating comparable corpora of web genre 
- Automatic genre classification vs. human genre classification
- How to evaluate the corpus: using statistical measures, relying on corp=
us linguists, librarians, or web users?

PARTICIPATION

The aim of this colloquium, the first ever organized on this topic, is to=
 bring together researchers from different communities such as corpus lin=
guistics, genre analysis, digital genre community, computational linguist=
ics, and information retrieval in order to promote the discussion and dev=
elopment of new ideas and methods to create new corpora for language
studies and as evaluation resources.

Please, submit abstrats to: webgenres@googlemail.com

Abstract submissions should include: 
     * Presenter contact information (mailing address, phone, e-mail & fa=
x) 
     * A paper proposal (250 word max) 
     * An abstract for the program (50 word max) 
     
The deadline for submissions is Dec 15, 2006
Notification of acceptance will be sent out by Jan 11, 2006
