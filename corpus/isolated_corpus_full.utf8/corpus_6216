To the Corpora List,

I would like to invite researchers in Arabic Computational Linguistics  =

to submit abstracts for colloquia,
individual paper or posters for GURT 2010 at Georgetown.  We hope this  =

meeting will provide an opportunity
for researchers to share their work on Arabic Computational  =

Linguistics with each other and with a wider
Arabic Linguistic audience.  Included below is the call for papers,

G. Katz

Georgetown University Round Table 2010: Arabic Language and Linguistics
		March 12 - 14, Washington DC

The study of the Arabic language has a long and rich history: Earliest
grammatical accounts date from the 8th century, and included full  =

syntactic,
morphological and phonological analyses of the vernaculars and of  =

Classical and
Modern Standard Arabic -- the religious language of the Quran and the  =

language
of poetry. In recent years the academic study of Arabic has become  =

increasingly
sophisticated and broad.

GURT 2010 seeks to explore the Arabic language from a variety of  =

perspectives
including research from the following linguistic subfields: Syntax,  =

Semantics,
Morphology, Phonology and Phonetics, Computational linguistics,  =

Historical
linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Anthropological linguistics.


Plenary Lectures:

	"Hybridity and the Crossing of Linguistic Borders"
	Mushira Eid, The University of Utah

	"Statistical and Symbolic Paradigms in Arabic Computational  =

Linguistics"
	Ali Farghaly, Monterey Institute of International Studies

	"Can Arabic Sociolinguistics develop without Arabic Dialectology?:
	The Case of  Urban Sociolinguistics"
	Catherine Miller, French Council of Research (CNRS)

	"Critical Languages and Critical Thinking: Re-framing Academic Arabic  =

Programs"
	Karin Ryding, Georgetown University

	"Ideology, Grammar Making, and the Standardization of Arabic"
	Yasir Suleiman, The University of Cambridge

GURT 2010 Conference Workshops (Friday, March 12)

	Arabic Language Teaching
	Raghda El-Essawi, The American University of Cairo

	Arabic Computational Linguistics
	Nizar Habish and Mona Diab, Columbia University

	Arabic Language Policies and Planning
	Keith Walters, The University of Texas at Austin


We invite proposals for presentations related to Arabic Language and  =

Linguistics

(1) Colloquia: Scheduled for 2-hour blocks. Colloquium organizers may  =

organize as they choose,
but time should be allocated for opening and closing remarks,  =

presentations, discussion and audience response.
Organizers serve as the liaison between participants and the  =

conference organizers.

(2) Individual papers: 20 minutes long with a 10-minute discussion  =

period.

(3) Poster presentations: displayed for a 2-hour block; an opportunity  =

to report on work in progress in one-on-one discussions.

The abstract submission deadline is: November 15, 2009.
