Location: Odense, Denmark 
Contact Person: Costanza Navarretta
Meeting Email: costanza@hum.ku.dk

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Cognitive Science; Computational
Linguistics; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Multimodal communication: from human behaviour to computational
models' aims to provide a multidisciplinary forum to present results and discuss
issues that concern research on human multimodal communication, its modelling
and representation for computational systems. The workshop will be held in
conjunction with the 17 Nordic Conference of Computational
Linguistics (NODALIDA 2009), in Odense, Denmark on May 14th 2009. 

Call for Papers

Human communication is naturally multimodal, involving the interaction of
modalities such as speech, facial expressions, hand gestures and body posture.
In order to have a better understanding of human-human communication and to
improve human-computer interaction it is essential to identify, describe,
formalise and model the interaction of the different modalities in interhuman
communication. The past two decades have witnessed numerous initiatives and
research efforts to
improve the state of the art, including collection and annotation of multimodal
data, automatic recognition of the different modalities, modelling and
generation of multimodal data. However, there are still many questions and
problems concerning the annotation of multimodal data, the technology for
capturing data, not to mention the interpretation and reproduction of complex,
natural multimodal behaviour. The present workshop aims to provide a
multidisciplinary forum to present results and discuss issues that concern
research on human multimodal communication, its modelling and representation for
computational systems. We invite unpublished contributions in this field. Topics
of particular interest include, but are not limited to: 
- Cognitive aspects of multimodal communication
- Formal frameworks and descriptions of multimodal communication
- Representational issues (e.g. definition of annotation units, granularity of
descriptions, spatio-temporal models of non-verbal modalities, definition of
default values, representation of multimodal meaning, inclusion of world context
etc.)  
- Interaction of the different modalities
- Multimodality in intercultural communication
- Definition of communicative functions in multimodal communication
- Methodologies and tools to annotate, process and/or produce multimodal
communication
- Multimodal signal processing and its integration with manual annotation
- The annotation and validation of multimodal data
- Machine learning applied to multimodal data 
 
Important Dates:
Full paper submission: March 1, 2009
Notification: March 23, 2009
Camera-ready paper submission: April 14, 2009
Multimodal Communication Workshop: May 14, 2009

Submission Guidelines:
Paper submissions should not exceed six (6) pages, including
references. As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include
the authors' names and affiliations.  
Submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL proceedings,
as NODALIDA 2009 (see the information for authors under
http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/nodalida2009) and  must use either the LaTeX style files
or Microsoft Word document template.

Paper submissions should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. As
reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. 

Submission must be electronic and must be sent at 
multicom2009@cst.dk and costanza@hum.ku.dk 
no later than March 1, 2009.  The only accepted format for submitted papers is
