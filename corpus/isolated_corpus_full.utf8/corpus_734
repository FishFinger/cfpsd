Final call for papers

 

 

RIAO 2007 Large-Scale Semantic Access to Content (Text, Image, Video and Sound) - 8th Conference - May 30 to June 1, 2007 Pittsburgh, PA, USA

 

RIAO'2007 will be held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA from May 30 through June 1, 2007. The RIAO conferences, organized by the "Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationales d'Informatique Documentaire - C.I.D., treat robust and large-scale scientific and industrial solutions to information processing. This is the 8th RIAO after conferences in Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988), Barcelona (1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997), Paris (2000), and Avignon (2004).

 

The conferences are composed of peer-reviewed scientific sessions and demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and advanced research prototypes.

Scope of the Conference                       

 

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished research that has been validated to the level of the creation of a functioning prototype. We are interested in large-scale solutions to the problem of accessing the semantic content found in unstructured text, images, video and audio. Submissions could describe solutions to these problems from the following suggested perspectives:

 

    * Automatic indexing of video, images, and speech

    * Improved indexing of text, image, video and sound

    * Ontologies and unstructured data

    * Semantic Web and Ontologies for Full-Scale Information Retrieval

    * Automatically producing textual descriptions of images

    * Automatically adding metadata to video and sound

    * Indexing and retrieval of mixed-media documents

    * Indexing interactive documents

    * Natural interface dialogue

    * Multimedia question answering systems

    * Competitive Intelligence

    * Intelligent Search Agents

    * Multimodal search

    * Architectures for semantic treatment of very large databases

    * Algorithms for semantic treatment of very large databases

    * Comprehension-based question answering and summarization

    * Cooperative indexing between media

    * Semantics for less studied languages

    * Semantic representations and standards

    * Collaborative construction of semantic resources

    * Indexing multilingual collections

    * Automatic extraction of ontologies from unstructured data

    * Aligning multilingual ontologies

    * Language resources for multimedia indexing

    * Extracting semantic resources from raw data

    * Semantic annotation of blogs and videoblogs

    * Exploiting large-scale resources for e-learning

    * Structuring cultural heritage

    * Technological, commercial, industrial watch systems

    * Semantic access to large and open archives

      

      

Paper Submission           

 

We welcome submissions both from the research community and industry concerning the main conference theme of treating the semantic content of large quantities of text, images, videos, and sound.

 

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical significance for quantitative results is encouraged.

 

Submissions should contain original material that has not been previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel submission for other publication or a significant overlap in contents with previously published work should be clearly indicated to the program committee.

 

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation.

 

Papers must be submitted on the conference's web site: http://www.riao.org/cyberchair/cyberPapers/ <http://www.riao.org/cyberchair/cyberPapers/> 

 

Papers can be submitted in two categories: long papers or short papers. Full papers are appropriate for describing substantial research with well-evaluated results and short papers will typically describe ongoing research and preliminary results. All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference proceedings. At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.

 

Long papers must not be more than 20 pages (on one column, single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an abstract. Short papers must not be more than 6 pages (on one column, single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an abstract. Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.

 

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees and through the CID after the conference.
