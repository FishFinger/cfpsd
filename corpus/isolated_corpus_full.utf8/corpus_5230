Call for Papers and Participation

Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems 2009

13th-14th September, at Queen Mary University of London


*Overview and goals*

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialogue Systems (YRRSDS) is an
annual workshop designed for post-graduate students, post-docs and junior
researchers working in research related to spoken dialogue systems in both
academia and industry. The roundtable provides an open forum where
participants can discuss their research interests, current work and future
plans. The workshop has three main goals:
- to offer an interdisciplinary forum for creative thinking about current
issues in spoken dialogue systems research
- to provide young researchers with career advice from senior researchers
and professionals from both academic and industrial backgrounds
- to develop a stronger international network of young researchers working
in the field.

(Important note: There is no age restriction to participating in the
workshop; the word 'young' is meant to indicate that it is targeted towards
researchers who are at a relatively early stage in their career.)

*Topics and sessions*

Potential roundtable discussion topics include: best practices for
conducting and evaluating user studies of spoken dialogue systems, the
prosody of conversation, methods of analysis for dialogue systems,
conversational agents and virtual characters, cultural adaptation of
dialogue strategies, and user modelling.

YRRSDS=E2=80=9909 will feature:
- a senior researcher panel (both academia and industry)
- a demo and poster session
- a special session on frameworks and grand challenges for dialogue system
evaluation
- a special session on EU projects related to spoken dialogue systems.

Previous workshops were held in Columbus (ACL 2008), Antwerp (INTERSPEECH
2007), Pittsburgh (INTERSPEECH 2006) and Lisbon (INTERSPEECH 2005).

*Workshop date*
YRRSDS'09 will take place on September 13th and 14th, 2009 (immediately
after Interspeech and SIGDial 2009).

*Workshop location*
The 2009 YRRSDS will be held at Queen Mary University of London, one of the
UK's leading research-focused higher education institutions. Queen Mary=E2=
=80=99s
Mile End campus began life in 1887 as the People's Palace, a philanthropic
endeavour to provide east Londoners with education and social activities,
and is located in the heart of London's vibrant East End.

Communication Association. ISCA will consider applications for a limited
number of travel grants. Applications should be send directly to
grants@isca-speech.org, details of the application process and forms are

negotiating with other supporters the possibility of offering a limited
number of travel grants to students.

interests, a description of their research work, and a short discussion of
what they believe to be the most significant and interesting issues in
spoken dialogue systems today and in the near future. Participants will als=
o
provide three suggestions for discussion topics.
Workshop attendance will be limited to 50 participants. Submissions will be
