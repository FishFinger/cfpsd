Meeting Description

11th 'Rencontres Jeunes Chercheurs' (Young Researchers' Meeting) will be held at
Paris, May 30-31 2008. Graduate students, PhD students and young doctors are
invited to participate. This year's topic is 'Research Objects, Tools and
Concepts'. 

Since its creation in 1998, the "Rencontres Jeunes Chercheurs" conference
organised by the "Ecole Doctorale Langage et langues" (ED268, University of
Paris III) offers to young researchers the possibility to present their research
projects.
This year's edition will be devoted to the topic:

Research Objects, Tools and Concepts

Often, and especially among young researchers, theoretical posits and
methodological approaches are inherited, without always being (re)motivated. The
''Rencontres des Jeunes Chercheurs 2008'' thus invites young researchers to
discuss their theoretical and methodological approaches, to explain and to
justify their choices.

The following topics may be considered (the list not being exhaustive):
 
- How does one constitute a research object that is not given as such in the
reality? What is an interesting object for research matters, a non-trivial object?
- How can one examine the appropriateness of a tool for a given object? 
- How do we determine the criteria required to elaborate our corpus? 
- How does one construct his proper theoretical assumptions for his first research?
- What are the benefits of a multiperspective approach for one research object?
What is the interest in the use of different disciplinary fields? How should
such an approach be designed?
- Will the choice of a theoretical background or a methodological design
proposed for a specific research influence the researcher and its issues?
- Is there an interaction between research objects and theories? If so, of what
kind? How do they construct each other?
- How are concepts created? What is their evolution in time, leading sometimes
to a loss of all relations with their origins? 

Different perspectives are encouraged for the discussion of these topics:
case-studies, comparative or historical studies, descriptions of methodological
designs or of the use of a given tool or concept. The aim is not to decide which
theory is best, but rather to consider the reasons of the adoption of a given
theory, the properties that make a research object interesting for a study, or
the contributions of a specific methodology.

The Ecole Doctorale 268 welcomes papers coming from all fields in linguistics
and also papers devoted to the philological study of texts, either form an
historical or a literary perspective.
