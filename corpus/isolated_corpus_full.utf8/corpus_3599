                                   EACL 2009 Workshop 
              GEMS : GEometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics
                      Athens, Greece; March 30 or 31, 2009 

	                         URL: http://art.uniroma2.it/gems/

                **** Submission Deadline:  December 19, 2008 ****
****************************************************************************
***


Distributional models and semantic spaces represent a core topic in 
contemporary computational linguistics for their impact on advanced tasks
and 
on other knowledge fields (such as social science and the humanities).

The goal of the GEMS workshop is to further stimulate research on semantic 
spaces  and distributional methods for NLP, by adopting an interdisciplinary

approach to allow a proper exchange of ideas, results and resources among 
often independent  communities. In particular, the workshop will provide a 
common ground for a fruitful discussion among experts of distributional 
approaches, collocational corpus analysis and machine learning; researchers 
interested in the use of statistical models in NLP applications (e.g.
question 
answering, summarization and textual entailment) and in other fields of 
science; and experts in formal computational semantics.

The workshop aims at gathering contemporary contributions to large scale 
problems in meaning representation, acquisition and use, based on 
distributional and vector space models. The workshop aims also to shed 
new light on the use of such  techniques  on complex linguistic tasks, 
such as linguistic knowledge acquisition, semantic role labeling, 
textual entailment recognition, question answering, document 
understanding/summarization and ontology learning.

The workshop is endorsed by SIGLEX, the ACL Special Interest Group on the 
Lexicon.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite submissions on any topic of current interest related to the
application of semantic spaces to NLP and related disciplines, such as:

  - Document-based, Collocational and Syntagmatic spaces
  - Eigenvector methods (e.g. Singular Value and Tucker Decomposition)
  - Higher order tensors and Quantum Logic extensions
  - Feature engineering in machine learning models
  - Computational complexity and evaluation issues
  - Graph-based models over semantic spaces
  - Logic and inference in semantic spaces
  - Psychological and cognitive theories of semantic space models
  - Applications in the humanities and social sciences

We also especially encourage submissions on the empirical  evaluation of the

above computational models within the  following NLP tasks:

  - Word sense disambiguation and discrimination
  - Selectional preference induction
  - Acquisition of lexicons and linguistic patterns
  - Conceptual clustering
  - Kernels methods for NLP (e.g. relation extraction and textual
entailment)
  - Quantitative extensions of Formal Concept Analysis
  - Modeling of linguistic theories and ontological knowledge:


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit papers on original, unpublished work in the 
topic area of this workshop. In addition to long papers presenting completed

work, we also invite short papers and demos: 

  - Long papers should present completed work and should not exceed 8 pages.

  - Short papers/demos can present work in progress or the description of 
     a system, and should not exceed 5 pages. 

As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are  anonymous.  The 
papers  should not include the authors' names and affiliations or any 
references to web sites, project names etc. revealing  the authors'
identity.
Self-references that reveal the author's identity,  e.g., "We previously 
showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided.  Each submission will be 
reviewed by at least two members of the program committee.  Accepted papers 
will be published in the workshop proceedings. 

All submissions are to be formatted using the EACL 2009 stylefiles.
Submission will be electronic, via a web-service to be announced later. 
Please consult the Workshop web page for more details.
