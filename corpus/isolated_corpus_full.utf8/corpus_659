Meeting Description:

Theme session on motivation in language at the 10th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference. 

Call for Abstracts for a Theme Session ''Motivation in Language'' at the 10th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference in Krakow, Poland, July 15-20, 2007

Organizers:	Klaus-Uwe Panther, Hamburg University, panther@]uni-hamburg.de
		        Günter Radden, Hamburg University, radden@uni-hamburg.de

Abstracts should be no longer than 500 words (including references) and be sent as attached Word documents to both Günter Radden and Klaus-Uwe Panther. 

Deadline: October 31, 2006. 

The notion of motivation is central to functional and cognitive approaches to language. However, the term motivation is often presumed to be self-explanatory and hence rarely defined. Some scholars view motivation as a non-arbitrary relationship between form and meaning, some as the structural resemblance of language to conceived reality, others apply motivation to the extension of senses, and still others equate motivation with meaningfulness and explanation. Each of these characterizations contains important facets of motivation. The purpose of the theme session is to bring together these different elements of motivation and integrate them into a unified theory of motivation. As a working definition we will adopt the definition of linguistic motivation proposed in Radden & Panther (2004): 
A linguistic unit (target) is motivated if some of its properties are shaped by a linguistic source (form and/or content) and language-independent factors. 

As suggested by the term shape, linguistic motivation is assumed to involve a causal relation which, however, is non-deterministic. Any motivational process requires a basis to operate on. In linguistic motivation, the basis is a linguistic source and may be the form, the content, or both the form and content of a linguistic unit. The source serves as an enablement for a motivational process. A motivational process is normally triggered by language-independent factors such as perceptual principles. The motivational process may shape certain properties in speakers' linguistic behavior and ''freeze'' into stable linguistic structures. It is this final entrenched stage as a linguistic target of a motivational process that is usually referred to as 'motivated.' 

Presentations that address aspects of motivation within this or a wider framework are welcome in this theme session. Special attention is devoted to language-independent factors. The inventory of language-independent factors in linguistic motivation includes: 

Ecological motivation, i.e. the motivation of a linguistic unit due to its place, or ''ecological niche'', within a system, as in changes affecting the phonological, semantic or syntactic system;
Genetic motivation, i.e. historical factors motivating present-day language structure, as in grammaticalization; 
Experiential motivation, i.e. the motivation of linguistic phenomena due to bodily or interactional experiences, as in primary scenes and image-schematic situations such as motion;
Perceptual motivation, i.e. organizing principles that are pertinent in the structuring of both perception and language, in particular attention to salience, recognition of similarity, and viewing arrangement. Specifically, these principles include such diverse phenomena as figure/ground alignment, active zones, conceptual grouping, iconicity, vantage point, subjectivity, mental scanning, and fictive motion;  
Cognitive motivation, i.e. general cognitive abilities for developing and accessing knowledge structures that may affect language structure, such as categorization, framing, constructing and blending mental spaces, mappings within a domain (metonymy) and across domains (metaphor), and drawing inferences; 
Communicative motivation, i.e. the principle of economy of coding in its interaction with the requirement of clarity, e.g. the function of conversational implicatures in minimizing coding effort;
Cultural motivation, i.e. the impact of cultural factors on language, e.g. in different conceptualizations of metaphors;
Socio-psychological motivation, e.g. social and psychological factors triggering sound changes.
