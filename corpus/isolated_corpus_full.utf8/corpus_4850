Meeting Description:

The present workshop aims to provide scholars interested in all of the subfields
of accent attitude research a forum for an exchange of research results on
existing and new topics, as well as for a discussion of methodological issues. 

Call for Papers

The original thrust of research into attitudes towards accent variation focused
on the relation between sociophonetic variation and perceptions of individual
traits such as social status, intelligence, reliability, etc. With time, a wider
range of topics came to be investigated, ranging from the influence of accent
attitudes on housing decisions (Purnell et al. 1999) to the interaction between
speech 'accentedness' and acceptance of voice user interfaces (Niculescu et
al.2008) to the role accent plays in children's social preferences (Kinzler et
al.in press). However, there are issues that certainly deserve further study.
What kinds of speech stimuli should be used? How to express the correlations
between phonetic variation and the attitudinal data? How to quantify phonetic
variation and attitudes in the first place? Do accent attitudes 'matter' at all?

Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
- Methodologies of accent attitude research;
- The role of (the perception of) phonetic detail in accent evaluation;
- Attitudes to 'foreign' accents;
- Accent attitudes in non-native respondents;
- Impact of accent attitudes on foreign language teaching;
- 'Folk linguistic' aspects of accent attitudes;
- Interaction between phonetic variation and cultural stereotypes;
- Use of accent for stereotyping in the media (e.g. films, etc.);
- Interaction between accent attitudes and various social and psychological
phenomena (e.g. construction of identity, social discrimination, etc.).
