Amman 
Amman, the modern capital of Jordan, is one of the oldest inhabited places
in the world. Recent excavations have uncovered homes and towers believed
to have been built during the Stone Age with many references to it in the
Bible. Amman was known as Rabbath -Ammon, the capital of the Ammonites. It
was also referred to as ''the city of waters''.

In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia after the
Ptolemaic ruler Philadelphus. the City later came under Seleucid as well as
Nabataean rule, until the Roman General Pompey annexed Syria and made
Philadelphia part of the Decapolis league - a loose alliance of initially
ten free city states under over all allegiance to Rome. Under the influence
of the Roman culture, Philadelphia was reconstructed in typically grand
Roman style with colonnaded streets, baths, a theatre and impressive public
buildings.
During the Byzantine period, Philadelphia was the seat of a bishop and
therefore several churches were built. The city declined somewhat until the
year 635 AD. As Islam spread northwards from the Arabian Peninsula, the
land became part of its domain. Its original Semitic name Ammon or Amman
was returned to it.

Amman 's modern history began in the late 19th century, when the Ottomans
resettled a colony of Circassian emigrants in 1878. As the Great Arab
Revolt progressed and the state of Transjordan was established, King
Abdullah I, founder of the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan, made Amman his
capital in 1921. Since then, Amman has grown rapidly into a modern,
thriving metropolis of well over a million people.


Tourist Attractions in Jordan

Roman Forum in Amman
The Roman time Public Square, bordered by the theatre and the Odeon, once
was among the largest of the Empire (over 100 * 50 meters). A row of
columns in the front of the theatre is what remains of the colonnades which
once flanked it.

Roman Theatre in Amman
An imposing monument set into the side of the mountain. Its 33 rows of
seats can accommodate almost 6000 spectators. The theatre, which dates back
to approximately the mid 2nd century AD, comes back to life with musical
and dance performance held regularly under the moonlit summer. 

Odeon in Amman
Adjacent to the theatre and set on the east side of the Forum, the Odeon
dates back to the 2nd century AD. The lower seats of this monument, which
could accommodate up to 500 spectators, have been restored and the Odeon is
used occasionally for concerts.

Jerash (Gerasa)
Straddling one of the ancient worlds key trade routes, Jerash offers
extensive and breathtaking ruins of colonnaded streets, arches, temples,
and baths in a remarkable state of preservation and completeness. The
visitor is free to wander through these sites and observe at close hand the
intricacy and sophistication of the workmanship and the artistry of the
cravings and decorations. During the summer, the Jerash Festival of culture
and arts brings together the finest talent, both Arab and international, to
revive one of the great monuments of civilization. 

Ajlon Castle 
 Twenty four kilometers west of Jerash, overlooking the Jordan Valley north
of Amman, Ajlon was built in 1184 by the Ayyubid to encounter the Crusader
advance in east Jordan and to protect the communications between Cairo and
Damascus. The hulking remains of these once powerful citadels await the
eager explorer with their mighty military exteriors, their dark inner
passageways, and their mute testimony to the struggles for power so
familiar to this historic land. 

Madaba
Madaba is an  archaeological park and an ancient city of mosaics. It has
the oldest preserved ancient mosaic map of the holy lands. 

Mount Nebo
Mount Nebo is one of the most revered holy sites of Jordan, located just a
short drive west of the Roman Byzantine town of Madaba, for this is where
Moses was buried. The sites association with the last days of Moses is
described in moving words in Deuteronomy (43:1-7). The episode of Balak and
Balam (2:13-26) also takes place here.
The site's other name is Pisgah: ''And Moses went up from the plains of
Moab to Mt Nebo, to the top of  Pisgah which is opposite Jerico''. From the
mountaintop, you can admire the dazzling view across the Jordan Valley and
the Dead Sea, to the rooftops of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. 

Dead Sea
The Dead Sea eastern coast in Jordan is one of  the most spectacular
natural and spiritual landscapes in whole world.
The leading attraction at the Dead Sea is the warm, soothing, super-salty
seawater, which is nine times saltier than Mediterranean Sea water. It is
rich in chloride salts of Magnesium, sodium and potassium, in bromine,
potash and several other minerals and salts. This unusually salty, buoyant
and mineral-rich water has attracted visitors since ancient times, all of
whom have floated effortlessly on their backs while soaking up the water's
healthy minerals along with the gentler, filtered rays of the Jordanian sun.
The Dead Sea's total attraction is due to its unique combination of several
factors: the chemical composition of its water, the filtered sun rays and
oxygen -rich air, the mineral- rich black mud along the shoreline, and the
adjacent fresh water and thermal mineral spring. 

Umm Qays
This is the most dramatically situated of the Decapolis cities. At Umm
Qays, one can explore fascinating ruins -a stunning black basalt theater, a
colonnaded main street, and a city gate, among others -and enjoy
spectacular views of the Jordan Valley, the Sea of Galilee, and Golan
heights. Umm Qais has a charming museum in a restored Ottoman house in
addition to its other attractions.
