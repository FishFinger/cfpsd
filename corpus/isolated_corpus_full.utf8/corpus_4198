Meeting Description:

IJCAI'09 Workshop on User-contributed Knowledge and Artificial Intelligence
July 2009, Pasadena, California, USA
http://lit.csci.unt.edu/~wikiai09 

Call for Papers

Overview:
The performance of an Artificial Intelligence system often depends on the amount
of world knowledge available to it. During the last decade, the AI community has
witnessed the emergence of a number of highly structured knowledge repositories
whose collaborative nature has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of world 
knowledge that can now be exploited in AI applications. Arguably, the best-known
repository of user-contributed knowledge is Wikipedia. Since its inception less
than eight years ago, it has become one of the largest and fastest growing
online sources of encyclopedic knowledge. One of the reasons why Wikipedia is
appealing to contributors and users alike is the richness of its embedded
structural information: articles are hyperlinked to each other and connected to
categories from an ever expanding taxonomy; pervasive language phenomena such as
synonymy and polysemy are addressed through redirection and disambiguation
pages; entities of the same type are described in a consistent format using
infoboxes; related articles are grouped together in series templates.

Many more repositories of user-contributed knowledge exist besides Wikipedia.
Collaborative tagging in Delicious and community-driven question answering in
Yahoo! Answers and Wiki Answers are only a few examples of knowledge sources
that, like Wikipedia, can become a valuable asset for AI researchers.
Furthermore, AI methods have the potential to improve these resources, as
demonstrated recently by research on personalized tag recommendations, or on
matching user 
questions with previously answered questions. Consequently, we believe the time
is ripe for a dedicated event focused on the synergy between repositories of
user- contributed knowledge and the research in Artificial Intelligence.

The workshop is intended to be highly interdisciplinary. We encourage
participation of researchers from different perspectives, including (but not
limited to) machine learning, computational linguistics, information retrieval,
information extraction, question answering, knowledge representation, and
others. We also encourage participation of researchers from other areas who
might benefit from the use of
large bodies of machine-readable knowledge.

Topics:
Topics covered by this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Using user-contributed knowledge as a source of training data for AI tasks
- Automatic methods for improving the quality of user contributions
- Routing tasks to people who have the expertise to perform them well
- Integrating Wikipedia with existing ontologies (e.g. WordNet, CYC, ODP)
- Extracting annotated data from user contributions
- Enriching user contributions with new types of structural information
- User-contributed knowledge and the Semantic Web / Web 2.0
- Automatic extraction and use of cross-lingual information
- Computerized use of satellite Wiki projects such as Wiktionary, Wikibooks or
Wikispecies

Workshop Format:
The workshop is planned as a one-day event (full day), which will consist of an
invited talk, paper and demo presentations, and a discussion panel.

Submission Info:
We invite the submission of regular full papers (up to 6 pages), short papers
reporting on late-breaking results (up to 3 pages), and descriptions of system
demonstrations (up to 1 page) using the IJCAI style. Submissions that have been
accepted for publication elsewhere or are under review for another conference
must clearly state so on the front page of the paper. 

Submissions should be properly anonymized to make them suitable for double-blind
review. The papers will be submitted through the following 
EasyChair site:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wikiai09

Important Dates:
Deadline for long paper submission: March 6, 2009
Deadline for short papers and demos: March 27, 2009
Notification of acceptance: April 17, 2009
Camera-ready papers due at IJCAI: May 8, 2009
Workshop date: July 13, 2009
