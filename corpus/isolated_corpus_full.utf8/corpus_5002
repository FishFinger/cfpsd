Meeting Description:

Beyond Translation Memories: New Tools for Translators 
MT Summit XII, Ottawa, August 29th 2009 

Call for Papers

Workshop Purpose and Theme
Since the late 1970s, when research on translation memories began, and the late
1980s, when the first commercial TM products became available, there have been
few major breakthroughs which have led to new tools designed to support the
activity of human translators. Instead, most research in the field has focussed
on improving existing tools, be it translation memories, full machine
translation, terminology databases, alignment editors, monolingual spelling or
grammar checkers, voice recognition, workflow management, etc. The results have
certainly been encouraging, often allowing translators and translation firms to
work more efficiently and effectively. But have all the needs of translation
practioners been fully satisfied? Beyond the recycling of full-sentence
repetitions and their so-called fuzzy matches, are there new avenues left to
explore?

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion - and
perhaps even the demonstration - of such new tools for translators. Researchers,
developers and practioners are invited to share ideas, approaches, perspectives
and experiences that pertain to new technology or new ways of using existing
technology to support and facilitate the translation process. 

Topics of interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- new ways of combining existing tools (ex: hybrid Translation Memory and
Machine Translation systems)
- text translatability evaluation tools
- pre-translation authoring tools
- measuring terminology implantation
- cooperative translation systems
- web-based translation tools
- post-editing tools
- typing prediction tools
- speech recognition for translation dictation
- terminology search in comparable (as opposed to parallel) corpora
- information retrieval tools for finding background material relevant to the
source text

Submission of papers
Authors are invited to submit a paper (max 8 pages) on the topics mentioned or
related to the workshop theme. All papers should be written in English.
Submissions should follow the MT Summit formatting guidelines. Papers should be
anonymous and submitted with a separate cover sheet including the following
information:
- paper title;
- author's name(s), affiliation(s), address(es) and e-mail address(es).

Papers should be sent in PDF format to: Marie-Josée Goulet,
marie-josee.goulet@uqo.ca

Paper submission deadline: May 29, 2009
Notification of acceptance: June 29, 2009

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help 
keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful treat!

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non 
Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be 
offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers 
only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
