Call Deadline: 03-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

The Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW) provides a forum for the exchange
and propagation of research results concerning the annotation, manipulation and
exploitation of language corpora, and fosters efforts aimed at harmonization and
interoperability of annotation tools and frameworks. 

Call for Papers

The Third Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW III)
Held in conjunction with ACL-IJCNLP 2009
Suntec, Singapore
6-7 August 2009
http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/LAW-09.html

Linguistically annotated corpora play a major role in parsing, information
extraction, question answering, machine translation and many other areas of
computational linguistics, and provide an empirical testbed for theoretical
linguistics research. This has led to a proliferation of annotation systems,
frameworks, formats, and schemes. Recognition of the need to harmonize
annotation practices and frameworks has become increasingly critical, as
witnessed by numerous workshops dealing with different aspects of linguistic
annotation over the past few years. The Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW)
provides a forum for discussing these different aspects. Specifically, the goals
of this workshop include:

(1) The exchange and propagation of research results with respect to the
annotation, manipulation and exploitation of corpora, taking into account
different applications and theoretical investigations in the field of language
technology and research;
(2) Working towards the harmonization and interoperability from the perspective
of the increasingly large number of tools and frameworks that support the
creation, instantiation, manipulation, querying, and exploitation of annotated
resources;
(3) Working towards a consensus on all issues crucial to the advancement of the
field of corpus annotation.

The workshop will include presentations of long (8 page) and short (4 page)
papers, a poster session, and demonstrations of annotation tools, databases, and
the like. Long papers should reflect work in an advanced state, but short papers
and posters may describe more preliminary work and pilot studies. Posters and
proposals for a system demonstration are to be submitted in the form of a short
(4 page) paper. A demonstration proposal should provide an overview of the
system to be demonstrated, including functionality, supported input/output
formats or structures, supported languages and modalities, etc. Accepted
proposals will also appear in the proceedings and are intended to provide
background for the demonstration.

The topics of all contributions may cover any aspect of linguistic annotation
including:
- New annotation schemes for linguistic phenomena at any level, or proposals for
significant improvements to existing schemes
- Evaluation of emerging or existing standards for linguistic annotation
- Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation
- Linguistic considerations for merging of annotation of distinct phenomena
- Evaluation considerations for corpus annotation
- Comparison and/or evaluation of existing annotation systems, including
functionality, common/missing features, accommodation of different input/output
formats and resource types (lexicons, knowledge bases, ontologies, etc.)
- Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures
and annotated data
- Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different
phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them
- Assessment of, and potential means to achieve, interoperability of annotation
formats/frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks,
frameworks, modalities, and languages

Submissions
Long paper submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length. Short papers,
posters and demo descriptions should not exceed 4 pages. Format requirements are
the same as for full papers of ACL 2009.  See
http://www.acl-ijcnlp-2009.org/main/authors/stylefiles/index.html for style
files.  Submission will be electronic, using the Workshop's
submission webpage at START: https://www.softconf.com/acl-ijcnlp09/LAW/

Please indicate on the front page:
- long paper, short paper, poster, or demonstration proposal;
- all applicable paper categories from the following list (indicate multiple
categories if appropriate): annotation frameworks and/or physical formats,
annotation scheme design (on linguistic grounds), annotation tools and systems,
corpus annotation, syntax, semantics, predicate-argument structure, morphology,
anaphora, discourse, opinion/sentiment;
- language(s) your work applies to, as well and those you plan to handle in the
future. If your work is language independent, indicate this as well;
- any non-standard equipment needed for your paper or demonstration.

All papers must be written and presented in English.

Reviewing
The reviewing of the papers will be blind. The paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the
author's identity should be avoided. For example, instead of "We previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...", write "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Important Dates
Papers due: April 3, 2009
Acceptance/rejection notification: April 30, 2009
Final version due: May 15, 2009
Workshop Dates: August 6-7, 2009
