Meeting Description:
The 'Movement and Word Order in Bantu' Conference aims to bring together
linguists with different theoretical perspectives to discuss word order and
morphology and their links to information structure. 

Word order and information structure have increasingly attracted attention in
both empirical and theoretical research. Bantu languages provide a rich testing
ground for the investigation of how information structure is encoded because
they employ a variety of morphological, syntactic and intonational markings of
information structure. Our aim with this conference is to bring together
Bantuists working from different theoretical perspectives to discuss among
others the following issues: 

Is there movement in wh-questions and/or in topic and focus constructions? 

Is there a direct correlation between particular morphemes - such as for example
subject and object markers, conjoint/disjoint markers and focus particles - and
information structure? If so, what are the theoretical implications? 

What is the structure of the left and right periphery and the middle field in
Bantu? Are there designated focus and/or topic projections? 

What is the typology of focus and wh-positions in Bantu? Do different positions
correlate with any systematic interpretational differences? 

Which topicalization positions and/or strategies are available in Bantu? Do they
show any systematic differences in interpretation? 

Call for papers: 
We invite abstracts for presentations dealing with these and related questions.
Time for presentations is 30 minutes including discussion. Abstracts should be
no longer than one page A4, including data and references, with 2.5 cm margins
and 12 point font size. Please send two copies of your abstract. One of these
should be anonymous, and one should include your name, affiliation and email at
the top of the page, directly below the title. Abstracts should be submitted
electronically, in PDF, RTF, DOC format. Email abstracts to:
bantu_conference@let.leidenuniv.nl by 1 November 2007.

Topics of the conference

Kango, traditionally defined as constructions based on morpheme(s) of
Chinese origin usually written in ''kanji (Chinese ideograms)'', constitute
an important part of the Japanese language. They raise specific questions
for their treatment and analysis. 
This international conference aims to sketch out an inventory of the
current knowledge about kango and open new research perspectives in this
field of study. Any linguistic branch related to kango may be concerned:
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics, pragmatics,
acquisition (L1 or L2), computational linguistics etc., in diachronic or
synchronic aspects. Comparative studies (Chinese-Korean, Chinese-Vietnamese
etc.) are also welcome.

Submission

Please submit abstracts as an anonymous PDF or Word format file
(.rtf/.doc), attached to an email message. Abstracts may be written either
in French, in Japanese or in English, and should include references.
Presentations will be about 30 minutes long, and will be followed by a
15-minute discussion.

Please submit
-  a one page abstract, 500 words maximum [references excluded]
(English/French) + references + five keywords.
or
-  one page, 1000 characters maximum [references excluded] (Japanese) +
references + five keywords 
by October 15, 2007 to the following address: nakajima@tiscali.fr.   
Please indicate in the body of your email message (but not in your
abstract), the name(s), affiliation(s) and email(s) of the author(s). 
Please also use the following subject header for your email: ''kango-2008;
Last name, First initial'' (for instance, ''kango-2008; Dupont; P''). 

Accepted proposals should be later completed by a more detailed abstract of
3 pages maximum by January 31 for a draft version of the proceedings.
