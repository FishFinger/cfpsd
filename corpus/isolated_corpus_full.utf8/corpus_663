Globalization and Communication: Enrichment and Threat

A 3 days international conference
14-16 June 2007 - Gdansk

The inexorable progress of globalization in the sphere of communication warrants
their inevitable confrontation. Languages (their paradigms, particularly the
lexical-syntactic ones) are getting to be more and more effective tools of
unification under the influence of English which nowadays functions as a Lingua
Franca. This is especially the case if we take into consideration new mass media
(internet, etc).

However, as Roland Breton rightly pointed out, ''considering a language as no
more than a means of communication is dangerous reductionism''. In fact, the
majority of linguists and experts in other relevant fields of knowledge ask
themselves the questions of crucial importance: does the integration of
communicative techniques determined by mass media bring to the fore pragmatic
and economic aspects of languages at the expense of semantic subtleties and
aesthetic aspect? Do these tendencies, by any chance, lead to the fading of
traditional ethnocultural functions of languages, which could eventually
threaten their identity?

From this standpoint globalization can be viewed as an extremely complex
phenomenon that requires a multidimensional and multidisciplinary description. A
few topics for discussion and analysis are presented below:

A new hierarchy of language functions? (particularly in the informational,
expressive, connotative, or ethno-cultural aspect).

The dynamics of changes in the internal structure of the system (lexical
creativity, morpho-syntax). 

The whole range of technolects and professiolects (especially the language of
media and the new ''eurolect''). 

Discourse and linguistic pragmatics: the function of persuasive discourse,
political correctness, neutralization of official formulas, aesthetic
standardization.

Language policy and normative tendencies in the era of linguistic integration. 

Challenges of language instruction and translation in the era of linguistic
globalization Functions of the media in the language acquisition process, the
role of cultural factors in foreign language instruction, pragmatic aspect of
translation, machine translation, etc. 

The advent and expansion of new areas of linguistic exploration or communicative
and informational strategies corpus linguistics, computational linguistics,
urban dialectology, internet, language technology (Acktil, E-globalcom.net),
electronic corpora, telecommunicational codes, etc.
