> 11th Australian Workshop on Requirements Engineering
> Creating Value for Business Through Effective Requirements  
> Discovery and
> Analysis
>
> 4th - 5th December 2006
> at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.
>
> AWRE'06 URL: http://awre2006.cis.unisa.edu.au/
>
> Call for Papers
>
> Requirements engineering in recent years has emerged as an important
> field of research and practice in software engineering and information
> systems worldwide. In Australia, likewise, there is an increasing
> interest in industry and academia to better understand the RE  
> processes
> and products and their impact on improving software and systems  
> development.
>
> The 11th Australian Workshop on Requirements Engineering (AWRE'06)  
> will
> continue the tradition of being a leading event in Requirements
> Engineering in Australia and increasingly attracting many researchers
> and professionals from all over the world. AWRE'06 will be held on  
> 4th -
> 5th December 2006 at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.  
> The
> workshop will be followed by 17th Australasian Conference on  
> Information
> Systems ACIS 2006 also held in Adelaide.
>
> The workshop will consist of presentations of accepted papers as  
> well as
> discussion panels. Participation by active researchers and  
> practitioners
> both in industry and academia and by research students is strongly
> recommended.
>
> The Conference Chairs are currently seeking to make arrangements  
> for the
> best papers (as selected by the Programme Committee) to be  
> published in
> a special issue of an academic journal - details will be advertised as
> soon as they become available.
>
> Topics of Interest (non-exclusive):
> Requirements process and activities
> Requirements engineering problems, methods and tools
> Requirements characteristics and representation
> Requirements engineering and business analysis
> Requirements engineering for service-oriented architecture (SOA)  
> and systems
> Advances in formal methods and their application in requirements  
> engineering
> Requirements engineering and software architecture
> Requirements engineering for e-Commerce, e-Business and m-Commerce
> Creativity techniques and creative processes in requirements discovery
> and conceptual modelling
> Social, cultural and organisational issues impacting requirements and
> the requirements process
> Multi-disciplinary requirements engineering
> Research approaches and methods in requirements engineering
> Practitioner perspectives of requirements engineering
> Requirements engineering Education and Training
>
> AWRE'06 invites two types of papers:
>
> Research papers: Authors should present research objective/question  
> and
> results clearly. They should indicate the research method used as well
> as the significance of the contribution to the field.
> Experience papers: Authors should present a significant experience and
> lessons learned clearly. Examples of experience papers are a  
> success or
> failure report about the transfer of known research results to  
> evaluate
> or improve current practice. Papers which describe current  
> practices and
> rationale could also be categorised as experience papers.
>
> AWRE'06 invites proposals for discussion panel:
>
> Interesting and significant topics for discussion are invited. Each
> panel may be made up of 3 or 4 panellists and run for about 1 hour.  
> The
> panel proposal should contain a 200-word abstract outlining the topic,
> its significance, the structure and content of the panel and should be
> accompanied by the full names and affiliations of the panel  
> chairperson
> and each panellist.
>
> Important Dates:
> September 8, 2006       Paper submissions and Panel proposals
> October 9, 2006          Notification of paper acceptance
> November 10, 2006       Final version for publication
> November 17, 2006       Final day for Panel position statements and
> Final day for Registration
> December 4-5, 2006      Conference dates
