Last Call for Papers

The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS), LAboratoire de SEmioLinguistique, Didactique et Informatique (LASELDI, Univ. de Franche-Comté) and Maison des Sciences de l'Homme Claude Ledoux, France, are pleased to announce the 2008 NooJ Conference to be held in Budapest, Hungary, 8-10 June, 2008.

NooJ is a freeware, linguistic engineering development environment used to formalize various types of textual phenomena (orthography, lexical and productive morphology, local, structural and transformational syntax) using a large gamut of computational devices (from Finite-State Automata to Augmented Recursive Transition Networks). NooJ includes tools to construct, test, debug, maintain and accumulate large sets linguistic resources, and can apply them to large texts. NooJ is used as a linguistic engineering development platform, a corpus processor, an information extraction system, a terminological extractor, a Machine Translation development tool as well as to teach linguistics and computational linguistics.

To learn more about NooJ, download the software, linguistic resources, manual, tutorials and reference papers: www.nooj4nlp.net.

This conference will hopefully provide an opportunity for NooJ users, as well as other researchers interested in corpus linguistics, to meet and to exchange their experience of development, research or teaching. It will also be the occasion to present and discover the recent developments of NooJ (v2.0).

To submit a paper, please send a one-page abstract before March 7, 2008 to nooj08nytud.hu . The abstract, in French or in English, should contain the title of the article, the name, institution, surface mail and electronic address of each co-author. All papers will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee. Authors will be notified whether their papers are accepted or rejected by 30 April, 2008 the latest. The timeslot is 30 minutes for presentations, including 5 minutes for discussions.
