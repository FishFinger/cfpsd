questions and debate will be opened up around the following topics.

Modes, media and technology: What does it mean to learn using the potentials and
constraints of different modes, media and technologies?

Curriculum, pedagogy and assessment: What does multimodality mean for
curriculum, pedagogies and forms of assessment?

Diversity of learning environments: What does it mean to make multimodality in
different social, cultural, modal, medial, formal, informal, global, and local
environments for learning?
