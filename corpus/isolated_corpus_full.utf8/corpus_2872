Call For Papers

Special issue of the Journal of Politeness Research, 2010

Politeness and impoliteness in computer-mediated communication
Guest editor: Miriam A. Locher

The aims of this special issue are the following: 

(1) Continue to develop the latest discussion on politeness with respect to
the question of norms of appropriateness

(2) Further the current theoretical discussion on the interconnectedness of
politeness, face and identity construction. 

(3) Work with empirical data on computer-mediated communication and discuss
politeness issues by paying attention to the specifics of the online context.


Potential contributors are invited to work with the latest literature on
politeness and impoliteness and elaborate on it in connection with their
specific types of computer-mediated communication data. In order to reflect
the diversity of online interaction, the papers will cover different types
of computer-mediated communication (e.g. email, forum, blog, chat,
YouTube). The special issue will contain seven papers (7000 words,
including references) and an introduction written by the editor. All
contributions will be peer-reviewed by anonymous reviewers. Authors
interested in contributing should submit an abstract of 500 to 700 words to
the editor (locher@ens.unibe.ch) in which they outline how they envisage
meeting the aims of the special issue by 1 May 2008. Further information
can be found at 

http://ens.unibe.educanet2.ch/locher/.ws_gen/index.htm

Deadline for abstracts:  1 May 2008
Notification of acceptance: 15 May 2008
Paper deadline: 1 December 2008

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
