Meeting Description

The International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM) 2007
seeks to provide a renewed opportunity for interaction between language
professionals with different methodological backgrounds. The symposium focuses
on the languages that are in active use for biology and medicine. We are calling
for original research papers on, but not limited to the topics listed below.
Papers focusing on application aspects of languages in biology and medicine are
also invited. 

- Natural language: text mining, retrieval and management;

- Ontology language: ontology construction, extension and management;

- Logic language: knowledge representation and induction;

- Sequence language: RNA structure prediction, protein domain prediction;

- Database language: database interface, query language;

- Visualization language: information visualization, molecular visualization. 

1st Call for Papers 

2nd International Symposium on Languages in Biology and Medicine (LBM 2007)

6-7 December 2007 @ Biopolis, Singapore, (http://lbm2007.biopathway.org/)

Language is a powerful tool that in its many manifestations is a system, used
for communication, comprising a finite set of arbitrary symbols and a set of
rules (or grammar) by which the manipulation of these symbols is governed. In
biology and medicine, the importance of languages used to represent knowledge,
communicate and query information is immense. Likewise auxiliary tasks such as
translation, summarization and information extraction play important roles
supporting scientific research. The automation of such tasks has significantly
advanced knowledge discovery in biomedicine. 

Incumbent technologies that discover, read and process language are continually
stretched by the vigorous demands of bio-medical scientists and there is the
continual need and incentive for language techniques to evolve. Despite this,
the distinct communities involved in language processing rarely borrow from one
another or look over the fence to see what other approaches are in use. And yet
synergistic interactions across methodological disciplines and across different
topics are frequently the harbingers of revolutionary technologies. In this
context, it is imperative that we adopt diversification, more lateral and
creative interaction between language professionals. 

LBM2007 will consist of oral paper and poster presentation, invited speeches and
a panel discussion. In addition to on-line conference proceedings, oral paper
presentations will be published in BMC Bioinformatics and receive a MEDLINE
citation. The symposium is co-located with the International Conference on
Genome Informatics (GIW), which will be held in Singapore from December 3 to 5,
2007. 

Submission of Papers

Submission should follow BMC instructions for authors which could be found at
http://lbm2007.biopathway.org/PaperSubmission and should not exceed 14 pages
including references. Additional pages could be given to figures and tables.
Paper review will be double blind, so papers should not include authors' names
and affiliations. Self-references are to be avoided, --instead of ''As we showed
in Smith et al. 1999...'', say ''As Smith et al. 1999 showed....'' Paper
submission software will allow authors to enter full author information
separately. The paper submission site is http://www.easychair.org/LBM2007.
Manuscripts must be submitted no later than September 9, 2007. 

Important Dates 

Paper submission due: September 9, 2007 
Notification of acceptance: October 15, 2007 
Camera ready due: November 1, 2007

Call for Papers

Ellipsis has been a target of investigation from the earliest days of generative
grammar. Formalizing a general principle of recoverability of deletion has been
a core issue, plus there have been intensive debates about how to formalize a
notion of 'identity' between the antecedent and the target of deletion. In
addition, much attention has been paid concerning the roles of competence vs.
performance in licensing elliptical parts. In this workshop, we would like to
explore the nature of these issues from diverse perspectives of linguistic
areas: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. In particular, the workshop
will focus on three independent (but maybe interrelated) phenomena: fragments,
RNR, and Case deletion. These three phenomena raise nontrivial issues in
connection to syntax-discourse interface issues since it is unclear whether
these facts are regulated under formal (computation) modules or under
discourse-semantic modules. The workshop aims at exploring how formal grammar
and functional principles interrelate and shedding fresh light on how syntax and
discourse interact.

We welcome abstracts particularly concerning the following three main topics:
1. Fragments, short answers, or nonsentential utterances
2. Right node raising or verbless coordination 
3. Case marker deletion or Xo deletion in general

Other related topics may include (multiple) sluicing, stripping, gapping,
VP-ellipsis, N'/DP-ellipsis, null pronouns. However, we strongly encourage the
abstracts of these sub-topics to be closely tied to at least one of the three
main topics above.

Important Dates:
-Deadline for Abstract Submission: May 31, 2007
-Notification of Acceptance/Rejection: August 31, 2007

Submission of Abstracts:

A two-page abstract including everything should be sent electronically to both
cil18@cil18.org and hdahn@konkuk.ac.kr. An MS Word and/or .pdf file may be accepted.
