Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2009=20

Meeting Description:

We invite papers or posters for a two-day symposium which will focus on
corpus-based work in the field of Translation Studies. Areas of interest in=
clude:
- The relationship between non-translated texts and translated texts in one=
 language
- The relationship between source texts and target texts
- Innovative methods and techniques for collecting and analyzing data in
Translation Studies=20

Final Call for Papers

Background:
The introduction of a corpus-based methodology in the field of Translation
Studies (Baker 1993) gave rise to a large number of empirical studies that
investigate the fundamental characteristics of translated texts and their
relationship to their source texts and non-translated texts. These studies =
have
yielded interesting insights into the nature of translated language and the
translation process, such as the so-called translation universals, the ideo=
logy
of translation and stylistic differences between translators.
Nevertheless, important methodological and conceptual challenges lie ahead.=
 Some
languages, for instance, are less well-studied within corpus-based Translat=
ion
Studies. Obviously, in order to empirically verify general hypotheses about
translation products and processes, as many languages as possible have to b=
e
studied.

In addition, some general hypotheses, like the explicitation hypothesis, ne=
ed
conceptual refinement: to what extent, for instance, is explicitation at
syntactic level identical to explicitation at discursive level? Most
importantly, how can general hypotheses be put to the test or, in other wor=
ds,
how do we 'translate' (operationalise) hypotheses so that they are empirica=
lly
testable in a corpus?

The two-day symposium wants to encourage corpus-based work on translations =
in
less well-studied languages as well as corpus-based work that push
methodological and conceptual frontiers in Translation Studies. Possible
questions / hypotheses include (but are not limited to): untranslatability =
or
implicitation, deictic shifts in translation, information structure asymmet=
ries
between source and target texts, register differences within translated
language. More information can be found on the conference website.

Submission Requirements:
Abstracts for papers should be written in English and should clearly articu=
late:
- The corpus materials used;
- The research hypothesis as well as the operationalisation of this hypothe=
sis
in corpus-linguistic terms;
- The results of the analysis and its theoretical implications (statistical
analysis of the corpus data is a plus).

Abstracts for posters report preferably on work-in-progress in corpus
based-translation studies. Abstracts should be written in English and shoul=
d
clearly articulate:
- The corpus materials used;
- The research hypothesis as well as the operationalisation of this hypothe=
sis
in corpus-linguistic terms;
- The preliminary results.

Although one of the objectives of the symposium is to stimulate corpus-base=
d
research on less well-studied languages, contributions on well-studied lang=
uages
will also be welcomed.

Submission Procedure:
For purposes of easy editing, please download the abstract template availab=
le at
our website. Send your abstract (500 words, excluding references) to
gert.desutter@hogent.be. Specify your name(s), affiliation and contact deta=
ils
in the message body only.

Abstracts are due on September 30, 2009 and will be reviewed anonymously by=
 two
members of the local organising committee and the scientific committee.
Notification of acceptance is scheduled on October 30, 2009.
