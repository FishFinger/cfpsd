SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by
   uploading them to:
   http://springer.cviog.uga.edu

   Submissions must be received by October 14, 2009 and must be in
   either, MS doc or pdf format.  A typical submission would be
   about 9 pages long (but papers can be between 5 to 14 pages).
   At this point, all reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable;
   however, authors of accepted papers will later be asked to
   follow a particular typesetting format/instructions to prepare
   their papers for publication/press, see
   http://www.springer.com/authors/book+authors?SGWID=0-154102-12-417900-0

   Papers must not have been previously published or currently
   submitted for publication elsewhere.  However, we will consider
   and encourage submissions that are the extended versions of
   already published conference papers (the general rule is that
   submissions have about 40% new material).
   The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper,
   authors' names, their affiliations, city and country.  The first
   page should also identify the name of the Contact Author and a
   maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the
   content of the paper (the keywords should be selected from the
   list of topics that appear at the begining of this announcement.)

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
   impact, soundness, and good English write-up. Each paper will be
   refereed by two experts in the field.  The referees' evaluations
   will then be reviewed by the editors who will recommend a decision.

CONTACT INFORMATION:

   Questions should be sent to Editorial Board - Advances in
   Computational Biology:
   ed-springer@springer.cviog.uga.edu

IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

   Paper Submission (5 to 14 pages):  October 14, 2009
   Notification of acceptance: October 28, 2009
   Submission of final paper for publication: November 10, 2009
   Signed Copyright/Consent form: November 10, 2009

   March 2010: Anticipated publication of the book entitled
               "Advances in Computational Biology". Will be
               published by Springer (in book series, Advances in
               Experimental Medicine and Biology, AEMB).  Indexing:
               Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Biological Abstracts,
               CSA, Biological Sciences & Living Resources, Biological
               Sciences, and others.

This email is sent to lists whose members include scientists and
researchers with interests in the following general areas: computer
science, computer engineering, computational biology, bioinformatics,
and applications.
