Full Title: Berkeley Review of Education 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Sep-2009 

The Berkeley Review of Education (BRE) is a peer-reviewed interdisciplinary
journal that engages issues of educational diversity and equity from
various linguistic, developmental, sociohistorical, and cultural
perspectives. Published online and edited by students from the Graduate
School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley, the BRE
encourages submissions on research and theory from senior and emerging
scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers.

The BRE encourages submissions that foster critical communication spanning
a broad range of disciplines including anthropology, cultural studies,
ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, linguistics, sociology, and
women's studies. The journal invites submissions that re-imagine what a
critical approach to education might look like from within and among the
traditional and alternative theoretical paradigms entailed in multiple
fields of inquiry.

The BRE publishes research papers and theoretical essays. Full-length
research papers present original empirical research that can employ a broad
range of methods used within educational research and across the
humanities, social sciences, and other disciplines. Theoretical essays
highlight new directions for educational research or contextualize previous
research in light of new theoretical problems.

Manuscripts should be submitted online through the BRE website,
http://repositories.cdlib.org/ucbgse/bre. Queries may be addressed to the
editor at bre_editor@berkeley.edu.
