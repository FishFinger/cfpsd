Call Deadline: 30-Sep-2007 

Meeting Description:

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, knowledge
bases and ontologies, grammars, etc. support the development of language
processing applications that are increasingly important to the global
society. Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such
resources for the world's major languages over the past decades, and new
projects are developing similar resources for less widely-used languages.
Some standards and best practices have emerged for representing and linking
language corpora and annotations, efforts such as 'Global WordNet' and the
development of framenets in multiple languages seek to create and link
specific lexical and semantic resources across languages, and there are
efforts to integrate such resources into general ontologies such as SUMO.
As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is
increasingly important to develop resources in the world's languages that
can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with common software, and
that contain linguistic information for the same or comparable phenomena.
We envision the eventual development of a 'global web' of language
resources, wherein, for example, linguistically-annotated corpora in
multiple languages are inter-linked via the use of common categories, or
categories that are mapped to one another; resources such as wordnets and
framenets are linked not only to versions in different languages, but also
to each other; and common representations enable analysis and use of
resources in different languages and of different types within available
systems. 

Paper Submission Deadline Extended to September 30, 2007

ICGL
First International Conference on Global Interoperability 
for Language Resources

City University of Hong Kong
Hong Kong
9-11 January 2008
http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

The first international conference on Global Interoperability for Language
Resources will bring together designers, developers, and users of corpora
and other language resources from across the globe, in order to: 

-  assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for 
   resource representation, annotation, interlinkage, and 
   access;
-  consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) 
   multi-lingual and multi-modal interoperability and 
   standardization;
-  consider the requirements for achieving interoperability 
   among multi-lingual resources of different types, 
   including corpora, lexicons, knowledge bases, 
   ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and frameworks 
   that enable their creation and exploitation;
-  consider the ways in which web technologies are and may 
   be used to enable resource interoperability and inter-
   linkage;
-  work toward the definition of best practice guidelines 
   and standards for language resource representation, 
   annotation, and use that will enable interoperability;
-  consider means to map or harmonize linguistic 
   information in order to better enable cross-lingual 
   studies;
-  provide direction for developers of resources for less 
   widely used languages;
-  promote collaboration and cooperation among developers 
   of language resources across the globe;
-  consider ways to provide central or distributed access 
   to language resources developed throughout the world.

Topics
Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following topics:

-  multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, 
   with focus on the mechanisms enabling interoperability;
-  support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in 
   systems/frameworks for resource creation, annotation,  
   use, and access;
-  existing and proposed standards and best practice guidelines 
   for language resources, including standards for linguistic 
   annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
-  systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the 
   development and exploitation of interoperable language 
   resources;
-  evaluation of existing resources, systems and 
   frameworks, and/or standards in terms of support for 
   interoperability;
-  harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language 
   resources, including corpora, wordnets, framenets, 
   ontologies, etc.;
-  web-based technologies for resource interoperability, 
   inter-linkage, and access;
-  interoperability of ontologies for language processing 
   research;
-  support for multi-linguality, multi-culturality, and 
   multi-modality.

In addition to full-length paper presentations, the Program Committeealso
invites proposals for posters addressing any of the above topics.Posters
describing existing or developing resources or tools that provide an
assessment of needs and/or considerations for interoperabilityare
especially encouraged.

Proceedings
Accepted papers will be included in conference proceedings, to be published
by City University Press, Hong Kong. A selection of outstanding conference
presentations will be published in a special issue of the journal
''Language Resources and Evaluation''.

Submissions 
Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in length, including
bibliography and any appendices. Author instructions are provided on the
conference web site
(http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/2008/html/paper.jsp).Submissions are made
through the START system, accessible at http://icgl08.cs.vassar.edu
