Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; General Linguistics; Lexicography;
Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2008 

Meeting Description:

To tackle this very complex trans- and interdisciplinary issue, the conference
will focus on the discourses of - and the actual living in - these spaces. What
are, for instance, the instruments that assess not only social relations but
also relations to space and time and that allow us to analyse and differentiate
'being' and 'doing' in environments traditionally considered 'urban' and 'rural'? 

Call for Papers

The ''urban'' and the ''rural'' have been of scientific interest to human and
social studies at regular intervals. The global market, knowledge economy and
sustainable development - influential agents and watchwords of our times - are
reshaping public as well as private, urban and rural spaces. The conceptual
opposition between the ''urban'' and the ''rural'' has been considerably blurred
with the emergence of urban sprawl, which, in turn, gave rise to the recent
phenomena of periurbanisation, rurbanisation and the creation of urban
outskirts. However, while scientific discourses proceed to a levelling out of
the city/country dialectic, the opposition appears to persist in the collective
imagination (conveyed by politicians, artists or local associations for instance). 

This conference proposes to rethink the intricate urban-rural paradigm,
regarding, on the one hand, diverse modes of appropriation (physical, visual,
temporal) available to the resident, and, on the other hand, public and shared
representations (as found in literature, the arts, political and scientific
discourses).

The objective of the colloquium is to offer a genuine exchange platform for
current research projects, the main target audience being young researchers and
doctoral students. Two grants of 200 each, offered by the Fonds National de la
Recherche, will thus be awarded by the scientific committee to the most
pertinent proposals. Futhermore, there will be an opportunity to present and
discuss posters of those researchers not giving a paper. The author of the most
relevant poster may be invited - following the advice of the scientific
committee - to contribute an article to the publication of the conference papers.

The conference Representation and Practices of Living Spaces is organized by the
association Humanités Associées, an association of young researchers in social
and human sciences (www.humanites-associées.lu). It will take place from 4-5
December 2008 at the University of Luxembourg. The working language is English.
Conferences may also be held in French, if accompanied by a powerpoint
presentation in English. 

Registration fees are 50 for speakers, 20 for professional participants and
10 for student participants. 

Abstracts of approx. 300 words, written in French or English, and a short CV
should be sent before 1 October 2008 to the following e-mail address: 
conference@humanites-associees.lu
