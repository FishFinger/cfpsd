 I. General Session

Abstracts from all areas of formal linguistics and from any theoretical
perspective are invited for 20-minute talks in the general session.

II. Special Session: Prosody in Grammar, Acquisition, and Processing

We welcome submissions on these topics, particularly (though not limited to) the
following areas, including approaches from a cross-linguistic perspective:

- The relation between syntactic and prosodic phrasing
- The relation between phrasing and phrasal prominence
- The interaction between prosody, information structure, and word order
- The interaction between syntactically informed prosody at the phrasal level
and lexically informed rhythm at the metrical level
- The role of  prosody in determining binding relations, quantifier interaction,
the focus domain of the sentence, as well as the implications of prosody-meaning
relations for the architecture of the grammar
- The role of 'silent prosody' in online parsing
- The processing of informational and contrastive focus

III. Instructions for abstract submission

Abstracts must be at most one page long on a letter-size sheet (81/2 inches by
11 inches) with one-inch margins, or A4-size sheet (210 mm by 297 mm) with 2.5
