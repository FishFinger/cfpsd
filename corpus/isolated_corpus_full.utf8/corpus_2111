CALL FOR PAPERS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The rapid creation and consumption of social media content continues to
drive the evolution of the Internet and the Web. Social media content
now accounts for the majority of content published daily on the web.

As the space evolves, researcher and industrial practitioners find
themselves at a key point for collaborating on research, implementation
and deployment of a wide range of analyses and applications. The
International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media invites researchers
in the broad field of social media analysis to submit papers for its
second meeting. Following in the tradition of earlier workshops and the
first meeting in Boulder, USA in 2007, we anticipate an exciting, high
quality event which will bring together academic and industrial
practitioners to present and to discuss new research, applications,
thoughts and ideas that are shaping the future of social media analysis.
