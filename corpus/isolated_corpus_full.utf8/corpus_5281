Meeting Description:

The Slavonic Department of the University of Regensburg (Bj√∂rn Hansen and Sandra
Birzer) invite abstracts for the international workshop 'Yiddish language
structures' to be held 30 November - 1 December 2009 in Regensburg/Germany. 
The main focus is supposed to be on structural aspects of the description of the
Yiddish language system which includes both theoretical and empirical questions.
The idea is to bring together specialists from the field of Yiddish linguistics
and General Linguists working on language change and language contact.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Phonology, lexicology, morphology and syntax of Yiddish
- Contact-induced grammaticalization
- Borrowing asymmetries
- Corpus linguistic research on Yiddish

The following scholars have been asked to deliver a keynote talk at the workshop:
Steffen Krogh (University of Aarhus) - confirmed
Johan van der Auwera (University of Antwerp) - confirmed
Yaron Matras (University of Manchester) - confirmed
Gertrud Reershemius (Aston University) - confirmed

The workshop is also meant to be a forum to discuss the new project of an
on-line 'Corpus of Modern Yiddish' (CMY) which aims at compiling a balanced text
corpus of Modern Yiddish of about 10 million words. The CMY is a joint project of
scholars from Regensburg and Moscow.

The conference languages will be English, Yiddish and German.
