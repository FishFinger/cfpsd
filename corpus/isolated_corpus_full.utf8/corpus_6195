*** SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 31 ***

ICGL2010: The Second International Conference on Global =20
Interoperability for Language Resources

18 =96 20 January 2010

City University of Hong Kong
Hong Kong SAR, China

http://icgl.ctl.cityu.edu.hk/

Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, =20
knowledge bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the
development of language processing applications that are increasingly =20=

important to the global society. Substantial
effort has been devoted to the creation of such resources for the =20
world=92s major languages over the past decades, and new
projects are developing similar resources for less widely-used =20
languages. Some standards and best practices have emerged
for representing and linking language corpora and annotations. Efforts =20=

such as the =93Global WordNet=94 and the development
of framenets in multiple languages seek to create and link specific =20
lexical and semantic resources across languages, and
there are efforts to integrate such resources into general-purpose =20
ontologies such as SUMO. In addition, several
projects are addressing metadata needs for language resources.

The Second International Conference on Global Interoperability for =20
Language Resources will bring together designers,
developers, and users of language resources, tools, frameworks, and =20
infrastructures from across the globe. The
conference includes keynote speeches from several leading figures in =20
the area, and is organized to allow interactive
discussion among participants in order to:

=95  assess the state of the art in methods and schemes for resource =20
representation, annotation, processing, interlinkage, and access;
=95  consider the ways in which web technologies are and may be used to =20=

enable resource accessibility, interoperability and inter-linkage;
=95  consider the requirements for (and obstacles to) full =20
interoperability, especially with regard to multi-lingual and multi-=20
modal data;
=95  consider the requirements for achieving interoperability among =20
multi-lingual resources of different types, including corpora, lexicons,
     knowledge bases, ontologies, etc., as well as the systems and =20
frameworks that enable their creation and exploitation;
=95  work toward the definition of best practice guidelines and =20
standards for language resource representation, annotation, and use that
     will enable interoperability;
=95  consider means to map or harmonize linguistic information in order =20=

to better enable cross-lingual studies;
=95  provide direction for developers of resources for less widely used =20=

languages;
=95  promote collaboration and cooperation among developers of language =20=

resources and tools across the globe;
=95  consider ways to provide central or distributed access to language =20=

resources developed throughout the world.

This year=92s conference will include a special focus on the use of web-=20=

based technologies for interoperability and open
access to language resources. A special session will be devoted to =20
defining a major international collaboration among
the U.S.-funded SILT project, the EU-funded FLaReNet project, and =20
representatives of the Asian language processing
community.

Topics
Paper submissions are invited on (but not limited to) the following =20
topics:

=95  web-based technologies for resource interoperability, inter-=20
linkage, and access;
=95  multi-lingual and/or multi-modal language resources, with focus on =20=

the mechanisms enabling interoperability;
=95  support for multi-linguality and multi-modality in systems/=20
frameworks for resource creation, annotation,  use, and access;
=95  existing and proposed standards for language resources, including =20=

standards for linguistic annotations at any and all linguistics levels;
=95  systems, frameworks, and architectures to support the development =20=

and use of interoperable language resources;
=95  evaluation of existing resources, systems and frameworks, and/or =20=

standards in terms of support for interoperability;
=95  harmonization, integration, and/or linking of language resources, =20=

including corpora, wordnets, framenets, ontologies, etc.;
=95  ontologies for language resources, especially for support of  =
multi-=20
linguality, multi-culturality, and multi-modality;
=95  metadata for language resources.

Proceedings
Accepted papers will be included in conference proceedings. A =20
selection of outstanding conference presentations will be
published in a special issue of the journal Language Resources and =20
Evaluation.

Submissions
Submissions for full papers should be no more than 8 pages in length, =20=

excluding references. Poster and short paper submissions
should be no more than 4 pages in length, excluding references. Author =20=

instructions are posted on the conference web site.
