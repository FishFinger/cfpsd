CALL FOR PAPERS

*Apologies for cross-posting*

Upcoming deadlines:
Abstract registration: 27 November,
Paper submission: 4 December



Scope and Aims
==============

The Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence is organised
biennially by the Hellenic Artificial Intelligence Society (EETN). It
has already been established as one of the most prominent forums for
Greek and International AI scientists to present original and
high-quality research on emergent topics of Artificial Intelligence.

SETN 2010 highly encourages international participation and the
language of the conference is English.

The 6th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SETN-2010) will
be held in Athens, Greece, 5-7 May 2010. SETN-2010 is organised by EETN,

The conference aims:

 - to bring together researchers who work actively on the field of 
   Artificial Intelligence, to support the exchange of opinions and the
   formation of new research groups and collaborations,

 - to disseminate original and highly-qualitative results of the Greek
   AI community and Greek research labs, fostering international
   collaborations,

 - to inform undergraduate and postgraduate students about the current
   state of affairs of AI research as conducted by scientists in
   Greece and worldwide,

 - to promote research results to companies and facilitate the
   development of innovative products.

>From biomechanics to intelligence" (tentantive title)


Venue
=====

SETN-2010 will be held at the conference centre of the
Eugenides Foundation, Athens.
See also http://www.eugenfound.edu.gr/

All areas of the conference centre are fully accessible.


Publication and Presentation
============================

All accepted papers be included in the conference proceedings and
will also be presented as a poster or an oral presentation.

Authors will be asked upon submission to state their preferred mode of
presentation, which the program committee will attempt to fulfill to
the maximum extend that organizational factors permit. Besides being
presented at the poster session, poster presentations will also be
given a slot for short oral presentations aimed at attracting people
to the poster session.

The choice between poster and oral presenation does not reflect paper
quality, but rather how the work presented can be better explained.
Papers presented as posters are also long papers in the proceedings.
The proceeding will make no reference to, or distinguish papers in any
other way, by the mode of presentation.

The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer LNAI
(Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series and must be prepared
according to the "Instructions for Authors" to LNAI/LNCS Proceedings.

For more information see:
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0

Papers must not exceed 10 pages in this format.

For each accepted paper, at least one author will be required to
register by the camera-ready submission date. Authors are expected to
present the paper at the conference in order to be included in the
proceedings.



Submission Instructions
=======================

Papers must be in English and present original, previously unpublished
work. Papers can be submitted only electronically, through
the ConfMaster service at http://setn10.confmaster.net/
Note that the submission of an abstract one week week before the
full-text submission is obligatory (see also "Important Dates" below).

The submission should be made by contact authors, either by creating a
ConfMaster account or by loging in to existing accounts from previous
conferences. At the paper registration page, a "track" and secondary
keywords must be selected, which will help assign appropriate
reviewers to the paper and also organize accepted papers in
thematically relevant conference sessions. Futhermore, the paper can
be submitted for either poster or oral presentation, depending on 

The full-text PDF file can
be omitted in the abstract registration phase (ending November 27th)
and only be uploaded for the final submission (by December 4th).

Submissions will be subject to single-blind review, and author
information should be included in the submitted paper.



Special Sessions
================


EETN member papers:

Selected recent papers of EETN members will be presented in a Special
Session of SETN-2010. Submissions must include the full text of the
paper, abstract, and bibliographic reference of the original
publication. The full text will not be re-printed, and only abstracts
and bibliographic references to the original publication will appear
in the companion volume of the SETN-2010 proceedings.

The submission deadline is Jan 18th, 2010 and notifications will be
sent out by February 8th, 2010.

Submissions and inquiries should be addressed to
Dr. Efstathios Stamatatos, at selected-papers@setn2010.gr
Expect explicit confirmation of receipt of your submission within 2
working days, otherwise please assume that your email has not been
received.


Intelligent system demonstrations:

SETN-2010 invites demonstrations of state-of-the-art AI implementations,
providing researchers the opportunity to show their research in action
and interact with the audience. We invite the submissions of
demonstration proposals from both commercial organizations and
research groups. We encourage the presentation of research prototypes,
interesting mature systems, as well as commercial products.

Submissions should focus on the content of the demonstration, rather
than technical details about the system itself, make reference to
relevant technical papers (including papers submitted to SETN-10), and
must not exceed 4 pages in the LNAI/LNCS format. The inclusion of
screenshots in encouraged.

Submissions that are in tandem with a technical paper submitted to
SETN-2010 should clearly state so in the system demonstration
submission. It is also possible that a system demonstration submission
is made on the condition that the relevant SETN-2010 technical paper
is accepted. System demonstration submissions that have such
dependencies should clearly state so in the system demonstration
submission.

The submission deadline is Jan 18th, 2010 and notifications will be
sent out by February 8th, 2010.

Submissions and inquiries should be addressed to
Dr. Efstathios Stamatatos, at sys-demo@setn2010.gr
Expect explicit confirmation of receipt of your submission within 2
working days, otherwise please assume that your email has not been
received.


Best Student Paper Award:

The conference will award the best student paper. A paper is eligible
for the award if it is (a) a regular submission and the primary author is
a full-time student at the time of submission, or (b) an unpublished MSc
thesis. After a pre-selection round, the top submissions will
be presented at a special session of SETN-10 in front of the public
and a committee that will award the best work.

MSc theses to be considered for the award should be registered by the
thesis supervisor, providing a short description of the work and
emphasising its strong points. A copy of the full text of the thesis
should be attached. Please register by contacting Dr. Stamatatos at
Aegean University or at student-paper@setn2010.gr

Regular papers to be considered for the award should declare that the
primary author is a student by emailing Dr. Efstathios Stamatatos
at student-paper@setn2010.gr or selecting the relevant button
at the electronic submission service.

Expect explicit confirmation of receipt of your email within 2
working days, otherwise please assume that your email has not
been received.

The submission deadline for MSc theses is Jan 18th 2010 and for
regular papers November 27th (abstract) and December 4th (full text).

Acceptance of regular papers in the main programme will be notified by
February 1st and notification of acceptance of both regular papers and
MSc theses to the Best Student Paper Award session will be notified by
February 8th, 2010.
