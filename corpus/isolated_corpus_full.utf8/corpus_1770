                          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                       Joint HCSNet-HxI Workshop on
         Human Issues in Interaction and Interactive Interfaces

                               Sydney
                          September 13--14


Introduction

HCSNet (www.hcsnet.edu.au) and HxI (www.hxi.org.au) are organising a
joint workshop on Human Issues in Interaction and Interactive
Interfaces. This workshop is designed to bring together researchers
interested in a range of issues, with a focus on the non-technical,
related to human-machine interaction and computer-mediated human-human
interaction. A specific sub-theme will be mediating collaboration and
community between humans in distributed environments, in particular as
targetted by HxI's Bracetto project. The aim is to identify shared
interests, understand different perspectives, and to take first steps
towards developing future collaborations. HCSNet will fund travel for
a number of Australian participants from outside the Sydney area.

We invite participants from HCI, Language Technology, Psychology,
Communication Science, Auditory Interfaces, Artificial Intelligence,
Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Linguistics and Speech Science,
Sociology, and other fields of interest to the human side of
interactive interfaces. 

Possible themes of interest include:
* Measuring and minimizing cognitive load;
* Human information processing issues;
* Human Factors and Evaluation;
* Representing and detecting emotions;
* Measuring and enhancing engagement;
* Managing dialogue interaction;
* Context and participant awareness;
* Managing virtual communities;
* Activity modeling and interaction design;
* Effective multimodal interaction;
* User modeling and personalisation;
* Communication for collaboration;
* Strategies for dialogue management and repair;
* Non-verbal vs verbal communicative cues.


Proposed Outcomes

Effective Interactive Interfaces is a designated Priority Area for
HCSNet. HxI is developing novel technologies for mediating interaction
between humans, human and machines, and humans and information. The
workshop aims to bring sub-communities together, to discuss specific
problems and issues that may stimulate new collaborations.


Invited Speakers

Gloria Mark of the University of California at Irvine is confirmed as
an invited speaker. We hope to confirm a second high-profile
international speaker shortly.
We also plan to involve targetted industry and user communities for
the purpose of highlighting problems and issues of value to them.


Participation and Format

We welcome participation from a range of disciplines and perspectives,
as outlined above, from both academia and industry, and we would like
to involve as many as possible in discussion.
* Attendees are asked to submit a short abstract of up to about 250
  words. Submissions should contain:
  - research interests pertinent to the workshop theme; and/or
  - thoughts on issues deemed to be important and potential points of
    interaction with other disciplines.
* Attendees should indicate whether they wish to give a SHORT 
  presentation of 5-10 minutes, or a LONGER presentation of 10-15
  minutes. A longer presentation should contain a strong position
  statement, discussion issue, or an interesting minor result.

Please submit abstracts to Lawrence Cavedon, lcavedon@cs.rmit.edu.au,
by the date indicated below.

The format of the workshop will be designed to promote interaction and
collaboration. As well as presentations, we plan panels, discussion
issues raised by industry/user groups, and break-out sessions.


Funding

HCSNet-HxI is able to provide funding support (covering travel and
accommodation) for a number of participants travelling from outside
Sydney. SUBMISSION OF AN ABSTRACT DESCRIBED ABOVE IS A PREREQUISITE
FOR BEING CONSIDERED FOR TRAVEL FUNDING. If not all participants can
be covered, funding grants may be allocated based on specified
interests, as described in the submitted abstract.


Dates

Wed Aug 15:                     Due date for abstracts
Wed Aug 22:                     Awards of travel funding notification
Thur Sept 13--Fri Sept 24:      Workshop

develop technologies that support humans in their interactions with
each other, their environments and information.
