Meeting Description:

Third International Conference 'Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis Across Disciplines' 2010 (CADAAD 2010).

General Theme:  Ideology, Identity and Interaction

We are pleased to announce that the third international conference Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis across Disciplines will take place 13-15 September 2010. The last two CADAAD conferences have attracted a wide geographical representation of researchers. In response to this, we have decided to move CADAAD outside of the UK. CADAAD 2010 will be hosted in central Europe, by the University of Lodz, Poland.  

The conference aims to promote new directions in cross-disciplinary critical discourse research. We welcome contributions from all areas of critically applied linguistics. We especially encourage papers which assess the state of the art and explore new methodologies in critical discourse research oriented toward the general theme of ideology, identity and interaction.  Possible areas of analysis include but are by no means limited to the following:

-Identities in discourse 
-Political communication
-Language in the news
-Language in the new media
-Discourse of advertising
-Institutional discourse
-Language and globalisation
-Business communication
-Scientific discourse
-Health communication
-Language and ecology

Reflecting the commitments of the CADAAD project, the following keynote speakers have confirmed their participation:

Paul Chilton (Lancaster University)
Seana Coulson (University of California San Diego)
Anna Duszak (University of Warsaw)
Robert Hodge (University of Western Sydney)
Martin Reisigl (University of Vienna) 

Call for Papers:

Papers will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. The language of the conference is English.

Abstracts of no more than 350 words (excluding references) should be sent by email as a Word attachment to discourse@cadaad.org by 15 January 2010. Please include name, affiliation, email address and paper title in the body of the email. All abstracts will be accepted subject to review by an international Scientific Committee. Notification of acceptance decisions will be communicated via email by the end of February 2010.

Presenters will be invited to submit papers based on the general theme for publication in the CADAAD journal.

The conference is organised by Piotr Cap (local organiser) and Chris Hart (initiator of the CADAAD project).
