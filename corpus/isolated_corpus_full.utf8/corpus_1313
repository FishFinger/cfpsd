Meeting Description:

A Workshop in conjunction with:

Using Context 

Call for Papers:
Contextual Information in Semantic Space Models (CoSMo 2007):
Beyond Words and Documents

Roskilde University, Denmark
August 20, 2007

Workshop website:
http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~baroni/beyond_words

Co-chairs:
Marco Baroni (University of Trento)
Alessandro Lenci (University of Pisa)
Magnus Sahlgren (Swedish Institute of Computer Science)

Topics of the Workshop: 
Some variation of the so-called distributional hypothesis - i.e. that words with
similar distributional properties have similar semantic properties - lies at the
heart of a number of computational approaches that share the assumption that it
is possible to build semantic space models through the statistical analysis of
the contexts in which words occur.

However, the very notion of context on which semantic spaces rely on gives rise
to various crucial issues both at the theoretical and at the computational
level, which in turn determine a large space of parametric variations. The aim
of this workshop is to foster a fully cross-disciplinary debate around the major
open questions pertaining to the definition and usage of context in
context-based semantic modeling.

In particular, we invite papers on the following topics:

- using new linguistic and extra-linguistic contexts in semantic space modeling;
- integration of different context sources (linguistic, extra-linguistic, etc.)
to bootstrap semantic spaces;
- plausible contexts for cognitively and neurally realistic semantic space models;
- effect of context choice on the performance of semantic space models in
applicative settings;
- critical analysis of the limits of current context-based models of meaning and
future perspectives.

Paper Submission:
The papers should not be longer than 8 pages, and they should be submitted
anonymously in PDF format following the LNCS guidelines (see Workshop's website
for link to style-sheets).

Paper selection will occur through a blind review process. Each paper will be
read by 2 reviewers.

Online paper submission is now open at:

Important Dates:

- Paper submission: May 15

Call Deadline: 09-Apr-2007 

Meeting Description:

This workshop aims to bring together grammar engineers from different frameworks
to compare research and methodologies, particularly around the themes of
evaluation, modularity, maintainability, relevance to theoretical and
computational linguistics, and evaluation for internal purposes. 

Second Call for Papers

Grammar Engineering across Frameworks                
July 13-15, 2007
Stanford, California, USA
http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~thking/GEAF07.html

This workshop is part of the 2007 LSA Summer Institute. (But note that workshop
attendees do not have to register for the Institute.)

Recent years have seen the development of techniques and resources to support
robust, deep grammatical analysis of natural language in real-world domains and
applications. The demands of these types of tasks have resulted in significant
advances in areas such as parser efficiency, hybrid statistical/symbolic
approaches to disambiguation, and the acquisition of large-scale lexicons. The
effective development, maintenance and enhancement of grammars is a central
issue in such efforts, and the size and complexity of realistic grammars forces
these processes to be tackled in ways that have much
in common with software engineering. This workshop aims to bring together
grammar engineers from different frameworks to compare their research and
methodologies.

Panel Discussion on Evaluation: How can we develop evaluation methodologies and
metrics which can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis?

Mary Dalrymple, Oxford University (moderator)
Roger Levy, University of California, San Diego
Stephan Oepen, University of Oslo
Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder

Paper Topics:

The workshop is soliciting submissions for papers on the following themes:

 1. Evaluation: Proposals concerning evaluation methodologies and metrics which
can capture the added benefits of deep linguistic analysis; evaluation 
techniques which can compare grammars across varieties/languages

 2. Modularity: Reflections on which aspects of linguistic structure can most
easily be separated out from each other, why and how the analyses of separate
linguistic phenomena are interconnected/interdependent, and the role of
frameworks on promoting or inhibiting modularity

 3. Maintainability: Techniques for improving long-term and multideveloper
maintainability of grammars; impacts of considerations of maintainability on
choices of linguistic analysis

 4. Relevance to theoretical and computational linguistics: Reflections on how
to present grammar engineering work to other research communities.

 5. Regression testing: Evaluation for internal purposes; methodologies and
techniques for test suite construction, role of test suites in day-to-day
progress on grammars

Special Demo Session:

In addition to the panel and papers, there will be a demo session.  If
you wish to give a demonstration of a system relevant to the ''Grammar
Engineering Across Frameworks'' theme, please submit a title of the
demo and a one-paragraph description through Easy Chair, by June 1,
2007.  You do not have to have a paper in the workshop in order to
give a demo.

Proceedings:

We plan to publish the proceedings (full papers) as an online volume through
CSLI publications after the workshop.
