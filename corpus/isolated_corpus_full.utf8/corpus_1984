Meeting Description

The track of Applied Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers
working in natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL),
applied linguistics (AL) and related areas. The rapid pace of development in
natural language processing in textual studies, speech recognition, speech
production, and data mining has led to a revived interest in tools able to
understand, organize and extract information from natural language sources.
These include the analysis of online materials, most of them in textual form or
text combined with other media (visual, audio), the use of innovative
human-computer interfaces, such as interactive agents, which benefit from
language understanding, and the use of computational tools to facilitate
intelligent tutoring systems and instructional methodology. In addition, natural
language processing can facilitate human-computer interaction for people with
special needs, assist in the organization of classification systems, and
coordinate text segmentation. While papers and contributions on traditional
issues are welcome, the 2008 special track will emphasize applications by the
NLP/CL community, particularly in areas such as multilingual processing,
learning environments, multimodal communication, bioNLP, spam filtering,
language acquisition, textual assessment, language varieties, materials
development, generic classification, and educational applications etc. We also
encourage papers in information retrieval, speech processing and machine
learning that present actual applications that can benefit from or have an
impact on NLP/CL.

Submission Guidelines 
Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting
guidelines. The papers should be original work and not submitted (or in
submission) to any other conference. Papers should not exceed 6 pages and are
due by November 20, 2007. For FLAIRS-21, the 2008 conference, the reviewing is a
double blind process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on
submitted papers, to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be submitted as
PDF through the EasyChair conference system. (n.b. Do not use a fake name for
your EasyChair login - your EasyChair account information is hidden from
reviewers. Authors should indicate the special track if one exists that closely
matches the topic of their paper. All submissions will be done electronically
via the FLAIRS web submission system available through the paper submission site
at http://www.easychair.org/FLAIRS-21/ 
Please, check the website http://www.flairs.com/ for information regarding
submission.

Conference Proceedings
Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press.  Selected authors will be
invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the
International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) to be published
in 2008.
