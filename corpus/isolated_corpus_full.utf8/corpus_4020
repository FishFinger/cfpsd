>
>Scope
>
>There has been growing interest over the last few years in learning
>grammars from natural language text (and structured or semi-structured
>text).  The family of techniques enabling such learning is usually
>called "grammatical inference" or "grammar induction".
>
>The field of grammatical inference is often subdivided into formal
>grammatical inference, where researchers aim to proof efficient
>learnability of classes of grammars, and empirical grammatical
>inference, where the aim is to learn structure from data.  In this
>case the existence of an underlying grammar is just regarded as a
>hypothesis and what is sought is to better describe the language
>through some automatically learned rules.
>
>Both formal and empirical grammatical inference have been linked with
>(computational) linguistics.  Formal learnability of grammars has been
>used in discussions on how people learn language.  Some people mention
>proofs of (non-)learnability of certain classes of grammars as
>arguments in the empiricist/nativist discussion.  On the more
>practical side, empirical systems that learn grammars have been
>applied to natural language.  Instead of proving whether classes of
>grammars can be learnt, the aim here is to provide practical learning
>systems that automatically introduce structure in language.  Example
>fields where initial research has been done are syntactic parsing,
>morphological analysis of words, and bilingual modeling (or machine
>translation).
>
>This workshop at EACL 2009 aims to explore the state-of-the-art in
>these topics.  In particular, we aim at bringing formal and empirical
>grammatical inference researchers closer together with researchers in
>the field of computational linguistics.
>
>
>
>Topics
>
>We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
>research on all aspects of grammatical inference in relation to
>natural language (such as, syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology,
>phonetics), including, but not limited to
>
>  * Automatic grammar engineering, including, for example,
>    - parser construction,
>    - parameter estimation,
>    - smoothing, ...
>  * Unsupervised parsing
>  * Language modelling
>  * Transducers, for instance, for
>    - morphology,
>    - text to speech,
>    - automatic translation,
>    - transliteration,
>    - spelling correction, ...
>  * Learning syntax with semantics
>  * Unsupervised or semi-supervised learning of linguistic knowledge
>  * Learning (classes of) grammars (e.g. subclasses of the Chomsky
>    Hierarchy) from linguistic inputs
>  * Comparing learning results in different frameworks (e.g. membership
>    vs. correction queries)
>  * Learning linguistic structures (e.g. phonological features,
>    lexicon) from the acoustic signal
>  * Grammars and finite state machines in machine translation
>  * Learning setting of Chomskyan parameters
>  * Cognitive aspects of grammar acquisition, covering, among others,
>    - developmental trajectories as studied by psycholinguists working
>      with children,
>    - characteristics of child-directed speech as they are manifested
>      in corpora such as CHILDES, ...
