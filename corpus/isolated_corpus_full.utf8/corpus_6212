PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

The 33rd Annual ACM SIGIR Conference 18-23 July 2010, Geneva, Switzerland
http://www.sigir2010.org

SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new =

research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques =

in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The Conference and =

Program Chairs invite all those working in areas related to IR to submit =

original papers, posters, and proposals for tutorials, workshops, and =

demonstrations of systems. SIGIR 2010 welcomes contributions related to =

any aspect of IR theory and foundation, techniques, and applications. =

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

* Document Representation and Content Analysis (e.g., text =

representation, document structure, linguistic analysis, non-English IR, =

cross-lingual IR, information extraction, sentiment analysis, =

clustering, classification, topic models, facets)

* Queries and Query Analysis (e.g., query representation, query intent, =

query log analysis, question answering, query suggestion, query =

reformulation)

* Users and Interactive IR (e.g., user models, user studies, user =

feedback, search interface, summarization, task models, personalized search)

* Retrieval Models and Ranking (e.g., IR theory, language models, =

probabilistic retrieval models, feature-based models, learning to rank, =

combining searches, diversity)

* Search Engine Architectures and Scalability ( e.g., indexing, =

compression, MapReduce, distributed IR, P2P IR, mobile devices)

* Filtering and Recommending (e.g., content-based filtering, =

collaborative filtering, recommender systems, profiles)

* Evaluation (e.g., test collections, effectiveness measures, =

experimental design)

* Web IR and Social Media Search (e.g., link analysis, query logs, =

social tagging, social network analysis, advertising and search, blog =

search, forum search, CQA, adversarial IR)

* IR and Structured Data (e.g., XML search, ranking in databases, =

desktop search, entity search)

* Multimedia IR (e.g., Image search, video search, speech/audio search, =

music IR)

* Other Applications (e.g., digital libraries, enterprise search, =

vertical search, genomics IR, legal IR, patent search, text reuse)
