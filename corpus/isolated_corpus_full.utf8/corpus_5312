HCSNet Perception and Action Workshop: Tools and Techniques for Conducting EEG and MEG Experiments

Saturday 8th - Sunday 9th August 2009
Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane

http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/node/3105

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS AND PARTICIPATION
The Human Communication Science Network Perception and Action Priority Area invites students and researchers interested in developing skills and knowledge in the use of EEG and MEG techniques to participate in a two-day workshop to be held at the Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, on Saturday 8th and Sunday 9th August 2009. Programmed to introduce both techniques to researchers, the workshop will present sessions on the principles behind each technique, how to design experiments using the techniques, and how to analyse and interpret data gathered with each technique. There will be opportunities to discuss with panels of experts plans for experiments, particularly with a view to helping researchers new to each of the techniques design research projects likely to usefully answer their questions of interest.

AUDIENCE
This workshop will be of particular interest to researchers conducting or planning experiments in perception, action, intersensory interactions, cognition, behavioural and cognitive neuroscience, and related disciplines.

EVENT FORMAT
The Perception and Action Priority Area calls for papers from researchers and from students working in any area of perception and action research. Those conducting or planning experiments in perception, action, intersensory interactions, cognition, behavioural and cognitive neuroscience, and related disciplines especially are invited to attend and present. All types of research are welcome; there is no need for the research being presented to involve either EEG or MEG. Presentations can be finalised results, works in progress, or plans for new research. Speakers will present for 30 â 35 minutes with 10 minutes for questions and there will be opportunities for researchers to get feedback and to have their own questions answered. 

INVITED SPEAKERS
The keynote presentation will be given by Associate Professor Paul Corballis, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. Paul's primary research interests are in the cognitive neuroscience of human visual perception and attention. There will also be presentations by Dr Blake Johnson and Dr Mark Williams from the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science (MACCS), Macquarie University.

SUBMISSION FORMAT
We welcome 300-500 word abstracts of proposed presentations from prospective participants. Abstracts are to be submitted online via the workshop's web page by 3rd July 2009 (see the link at the top of this call).
Submissions deadline: Friday 3rd July 2009

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Registration for the workshop is free for HCSNet members. Participants are required to sign up to HCSNet and register for the workshop 2 months in advance of the event. For non-HCSNet members registration is $50 per day. For members and non-members please follow the link above to register once registration has opened.
Registration: Friday 29th May to Friday 24th July 2009

TRAVEL BURSARIES
HCSNet will fund up to 10 x $500 travel support awards for interstate participants who will present papers at the workshop. In addition, up to 10 x $500 travel awards are available to interstate students who will present papers at the workshop. The provision of a submission as described above is a prerequisite for funding. If not all participants can be covered, funding grants will be allocated based on the relevance of your abstract to the workshop theme; also, students and early career researchers (in HCSNet terms, those who have received their PhDs in the last fifteen years) will have priority. Please ensure that you indicate at the time of submission if you wish to be considered for a travel grant.
