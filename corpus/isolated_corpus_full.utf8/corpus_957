FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
Exemplar-Based Models of Language Acquisition and Use
http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~davec/workshop.htm
13 - 17 August 2007

organized as part of
the European Summer School on
Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2007 https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/
6 - 17 August, 2007 in Dublin

Workshop Organizers:
Rens Bod=09=09rb@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk
Dave Cochran=09=09davec@cs.st-andrews.ac.uk

Workshop Purpose:
Exemplar-based models conceive of linguistic representations as being 
directly shaped by speakers' memories of specific tokens of linguistic 
items. Such models are being considered by a growing number of 
researchers in virtually all areas of linguistics, from language 
acquisition and psycholinguistics to computational linguistics and 
statistical natural language processing. This workshop aims at bringing 
together linguists working to expand their exemplar-based models by 
computational modeling, and computational linguists interested in 
extending exemplar-based models to aspects of language cognition. The 
workshop is open to all members of the Language, Logic and Information 
community, and is in particular intended as a forum for advanced PhD 
students and more senior researchers to share their research.

The text of the full call, including suggested topics, submission 
details, workshop format and information about local arrangements, may
