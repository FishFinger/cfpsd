Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 11-Sep-2009 

Meeting Description:

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown that there is
a relation between formal linguistic theory and the practice of syntactic
annotation. Since the practices of building syntactically processed corpora have
proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent, the connection between treebank development and
linguistic theories and paradigms need to be tightly connected in order to
ensure the necessary information flow between them. The series of workshops on
'Treebanks and Linguistic Theories' (TLT) aims to provide a forum for
researchers and advanced students working in these areas. The edition to be held
in Milan will be the eighth of the series.

Workshop Motivation and Aims

Treebanks are language resources that provide annotations at various levels of
linguistic structure beyond the word level. They typically provide syntactic
constituent or dependency structures for sentences and sometimes functional and
predicate-argument structures. Treebanks have become crucially important for the
development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human
language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general.

There are a number of ongoing projects aiming at compiling representative
treebanks for less-resourced languages (like ancient, or dead languages, such as
Old English, Medieval Portuguese, Latin and Greek) and a number of on-going
projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for high-resourced
languages (like English). In addition, there are projects that develop tools or
explore annotation beyond syntactic structure (including, for instance,
semantic, pragmatic and rhetoric annotation) and beyond a single language
(creating parallel treebanks, with cross-language annotation schemas, theories
and applications).

Experiences in building syntactically processed corpora have shown that there is
a relation between formal linguistic theory and the practice of syntactic
annotation. Since the practices of building syntactically processed corpora have
proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent, the connection between treebank development and
linguistic theories and paradigms need to be tightly connected in order to
ensure the necessary information flow between them. This series of workshops
aims to provide a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these
areas. We encourage interested potential participants to read the proceedings of
the previous workshops (see the Link page).

Call for Papers

Submissions are invited for papers, posters and demonstrations presenting high
quality, previously unpublished research on the topics described below.
Contributions should focus on results from completed as well as ongoing
research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and
perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Papers
and poster abstracts will be published both on paper and as online proceedings.
TLT8 will be co-located with 'FrameNet Masterclass and Workshop', which will be
held on 3 December 2009. The Masterclass will be given by Charles Fillmore. For
more details on this event and on how to submit a contribution, please see the
co-located event Web page (http://tlt8.unicatt.it/framenet.htm).

Workshop Topics

The workshop invites submissions that discuss relevant innovative work in
treebanking, including the relations and links between, and possibly merging of,
various aspects of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic annotation;
furthermore, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks and/or
cross-language annotation schemas, on the relation between linguistic theory and
the practice of annotation, and on applications of information in treebanks are
encouraged as well.

We invite submission of papers and posters on the following topics: 
- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research
- semantically and pragmatically annotated treebanks
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks
- tools for creation and management of treebanks
- treebanks of less-resourced languages and ancient and dead languages
- theories, schemas and applications for parallel treebanks
- standards for treebanks

Important Dates
Deadlines: always midnight, UTC ('Coordinated Universal Time'), ignoring DST
('Daylight Saving Time')
- Deadline for paper submission: 11 September 2009
- Notification of acceptance: 9 October 2009
- Final version of paper for workshop proceedings: 3 November 2009
- Workshop: 4-5 December 2009

Instructions for Submission

We invite the submission of full papers describing original, unpublished
research related to the topics of the workshop. Please see the paper submission
page (http://tlt8.unicatt.it/authorskit.htm) on how to submit and what style to
use. Papers should not exceed 12 pages.

Please note that as reviewing will be blind, the papers should not include the
authors' names and affiliations or any references to web-sites, project names
etc. revealing the authors' identity. Furthermore, any self-reference should be
avoided. For instance, instead of ''We previously showed (Brown, 2001)...', use
citations such as ''Brown previously showed (Brown, 2001)...''.

Submitted papers can be for oral, poster or demo presentations. There is no
difference between the different kinds of presentation both in terms of
reviewing process and publication in the proceedings.

This year we particularly encourage PhD and Master students to submit short
papers (not exceeding 6 pages) for poster or demo presentations, describing
their ongoing research related to the topics of the workshop. The short papers
will be reviewed. The accepted short papers will be published in the
proceedings, as well as the others.

Presentation

The oral presentations at the workshop will be 30 minutes long (25 minutes for
presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion).

Please forward this call to colleagues of yours who may be interested.
