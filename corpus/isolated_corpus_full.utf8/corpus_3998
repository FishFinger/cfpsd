Full Title: 2nd International Conference on Latgalistics 

Date: 15-Oct-2009 - 17-Oct-2009
Location: Rezekne, Latvia 
Contact Person: Ilga Suplinska
Meeting Email: Ilga.Suplinska@ru.lv

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Historical Linguistics; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-May-2009 

Meeting Description:

The 2nd International Conference on Latgalistics follows the first such
conference held in St.Petersburg in September 2008. Topics from linguistics,
literary sciences, history, and folklore from the region of Latgale in Eastern
Latvia will be put into an interdisciplinary perspective of international
studies on multilingualism, multiculturalism, regional and minority languages,
and centre-and-periphery studies. 

Call for Papers

The 1st International Conference on Latgalian Studies took place from September
19th-20th, 2008 in Saint-Petersburg with the aim of starting off a new tradition
of conferences. In the second conference, we will be aiming for a more general
debate on a new understanding of centres and peripheries from a perspective of
regional and minority languages, folklore, literature, and processes which are
connected with these topics in society, education and politics, such as
regionalism, questions of locality and globality, decentralisation, identity,
and multiculturalism. The point of departure of the discussions will be based on
issues relating to the region of Latgale - but scholars working on one or
several of the conference fields regarding other regions are wholeheartedly
encouraged to participate in order to give the conference a contrastive perspective.

The conference will also provide the framework for the presentation of the
results of the Ethnolinguistic Survey of Latgale, conducted by R?zekne
University College and the University of Milan, in the monograph Valodas
Austrumlatvij?  (Languages in Eastern Latvia). Interested scientists as well as
representatives of cultural and educational institutions and the media are
kindly invited also to this event. 

The conference envisages to create interdisciplinary debates between the
following fields: 
- Applied linguistics,
- Theoretical linguistics,
- History of culture and art,
- Folklore and literary science, and 
- Innovative methods in the teaching of language, culture or history.

The conference will be dedicated to the commemoration of the Latgalian poet
Marija And??ne who would have turned 100 years on September 8th, 2009. In 1933,
Marija And??ne published the first collection of her poetry, Reits (Morning), in
which for the first time the orthographic principles of Latgalian as developed
by P. Strods were used. After World War II, the poet lived in the United States,
where she became the most recognised representative of Latgalian poetry. M.
And??ne studied educational science at the State Teachers' Institute in R?zekne,
the predecessor of today's R?zekne University College. She collected Latgalian
folklore, and was through her work an inspiration for many pupils. Her life and
work are an excellent example of active philological work as a contribution to
the development and maintenance of traditional languages, literature and folklore.
