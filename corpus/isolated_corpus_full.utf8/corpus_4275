Meeting Description:

Chronos 9 - International Conference on Tense, Aspect and Modality. University
of Paris 7, 2 - 4 September 2009 

Call for Papers

Chronos is a series of biannual conferences dedicated to current research on the
morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense, aspect and
modality. The conferences aim to bring together researchers working from
different perspectives and in different theoretical frameworks.

Main Session: morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of markers of tense,
aspect and modality. 

Parasession: Endangered & less documented languages.
Special Associated Workshop: Scalar structure & event structure.

Chronos 2009's thematic parasession will be dedicated to the
tense/aspec/modality systems of endangered and less documented languages. Not
only are such languages often facing a serious danger of rapid extinction; they
are also a relatively intact source of fecund data, which might shed some new
light on the empirical generalizations, and theoretical/formal constructs
currently prevalent within the community - indeed, these have generally been
elaborated through observations bearing on a handful of well-documented languages.

In addition to this special theme, Chronos 2009 will also comprise a host
workshop dedicated to the relationship between scalar structure & event
structure (co-organized by U. Paris 7 and U. Chicago): this particular empirical
field has proved very fruitful over the past few years, by nourishing a wealth
of new formal & theoretical approaches to aspectual meaning. The Chronos 2009
host workshop will constitute a unique opportunity of bringing together and
confronting different recent approaches to the connection between aspect and
scalarity.
Submissions to the conference are not restricted to the special topics here
listed. We welcome proposals relating to any area in the linguistics of tense,
aspect and modality.

Invited Speakers: 
Alan Dench, University of Western Australia
Denis Creissels, Université de Lyon 2
Leora Bar El, University of Montana
Martina Faller, University of Manchester
Chris Piñón, Université de Lille 3

Submission Guidelines: 
Abstracts are invited for 20-minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for
discussion). All presentations will be delivered in French or in English. 
- Preference will be given to presentations not duplicated at any major
conferences (e.g., LSA, LSRL)
Abstracts must be anonymous and written in French or in English. They should be
no longer than two pages in length using 1 inch/2.5 cm margins on all sides and
in 12pt font size (Times New Roman preferred). Any non-standard fonts should be
embedded in the PDF document. Submissions are limited to one individual and one
joint abstract per author.

Abstract submission deadline: April 20, 2009

Instructions for abstract submission:
Authors are asked to submit their anonymous abstracts as pdf files via the Pasha
abstracts submission website at: http://chronos9.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/

For multiple authors: after submitting your abstract through PASHA, please send
a separate email to chronos9@linguist.jussieu.fr with the following information:
Title of the paper
Name of author(s)
Affiliation(s)
Address(es)
Phone number(s)
Email address(es)
Section for which you want to be considered (workshop, parasession, main session)

Notifications of acceptance: mid June, 2009. Should you encounter any
