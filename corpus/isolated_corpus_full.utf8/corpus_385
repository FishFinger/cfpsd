Meeting Description:

This is just a reminder that the deadline for FDSL 6.5 to be held in Nova Gorica
(Slovenia) is approaching.

The FDSL (Formal Descriptions of Slavic Languages) conference is becoming an
annual conference. This year's FDSL will be held at the University of Nova
Gorica on Dec 1-3, 2006. FDSL was up until now, a biannual conference held in
Potsdam & Leipzig. Since this is the first time FDSL is organized only one year
after the last FDSL (FDSL 6 was held in Potsdam in 2005) and the first time it
will travel outside of Germany, it is given the name FDSL (halftime) 6.5.

The Department of Slovenian studies at the University of Nova Gorica is pleased
to invite abstracts for submission to the Formal Descriptions to Slavic
Languages 6.5 conference to be held at the University of Nova Gorica on December
1-3, 2006.

Invited speakers:
- Zeljko BoSkovic (=Zeljko Boskovic), University of Connecticut
- Tatjana Marvin, Univerza v Ljubljani
- Ora Matushansky, CNRS/ Université Paris VIII
- Draga Zec, Cornell University

Abstracts are invited for 20 minute presentations (plus 10 minutes for
discussion, for a total of 30 minutes) on topics dealing with formal aspects of
Slavic syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology or psycholinguistics. Unlike in
previous FDSL conferences, there will not be any parallel sessions in FDSL 6.5,
but in addition to the main session there will also be a poster session.

The deadline for the receipt of abstracts is July 1, 2006

Abstracts are not to exceed two pages (including examples and references). They
must be written in 12-point font and they must be ANONYMOUS with only a title.
They should be sent as .pdf attachments to: fdsl.6.5@gmail.com. We will accept
only electronic submissions.

Please include the following information in the email:
1. Title
2. Your name
3. Address/affiliation
4. Email address
5. Whether you wish your abstract not to be considered for the poster
    session.

Meeting Description:

The International Society for Gesture Studies invites participation in its
third Conference, ''Integrating Gestures'' June 18-21, 2007 on the campus
of Northwestern University Evanston, Illinois  USA

The International Society for Gesture Studies announces its third
Conference, ''Integrating Gestures,'' to be held June 18-21, 2007, at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (just north of Chicago).  
Following on the two previous conferences, ''Gesture:  The living medium''
(Austin, Texas), and ''Interacting Bodies'' (Lyon, France), we invite your
participation. 

Gesture is ubiquitious in human communication, from the earliest
developmental stages on, and is seen as a part of language use, of spatial
thought, in the expression of emotion, in the arts...in all the ways we
communicate.   The emphasis of this conference is on the ways in which
gesture is common between, and unifies, these many kinds of communication
and resesarchers' many approaches to studying these processes.

The Society and the Conference seek proposals dealing with any aspect of
gesture, in humans, in other species, and in computational systems.  
Examples of topics which would be appropriate are
		-	gesture and speech in communication;
		-	gesture and sign languages;
		-	gesture and space;
		-	gesture and language development;
		-	gesture and neurocognition;
		-	gesture in human-computer interaction and in virtual humans;
		-	gestures, human evolution, and primate communication;
		-	gesture recognition;
		-	gesture and culture;
		-	gesture in the arts (dance, music, film);
		-	gesture and the communication of emotion; 
		-	as well as others.

The Conference welcomes proposals in a variety of formats:
		-	individual papers (20 minutes + 10 minutes for discussion);
		-	posters;
		-	integrated thematic sessions (60 or 90 minutes); and 
		-	data sessions (60 or 90 minutes).
in addition, there will be one plenary keynote per day.

Deadline for submissions:  November 15, 2006
