 TENTH WORKSHOP ON THE SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF DIALOGUE (SEMDIAL)

 Potsdam (Germany)
 September 11-13 2006

brandial06 will be the tenth in a series of workshops that aims to
bring together researchers working on the semantics and pragmatics of
dialogues in fields such as artificial intelligence, formal semantics
and pragmatics, computational linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.
The SemDial conferences are always stimulating and fun, and
Potsdam/Berlin is a great place to visit.

INVITED SPEAKERS: 

- James Allen       (University of Rochester, USA)
- Elisabeth Andre   (University of Augsburg, Germany)
- Manfred Krifka    (Humboldt University and ZAS, Germany)
- Emanuel Schegloff (University of California LA, USA)

SUBMISSIONS:

We invite papers on all topics related to the semantics and
pragmatics of dialogues, including, but not limited to:

- models of common ground/mutual belief in communication
- modelling agents' information states and how they get updated
- multi-agent models and turn-taking
- goals, intentions and commitments in communication
- semantic interpretation in dialogues
- reference in dialogues
- ellipsis resolution in dialogues
- dialogue and discourse structure
- interpretation of questions and answers
- nonlinguistic interaction in communication
- natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems
- multimodal dialogue systems
- dialogue management in practical implementations
- categorisation of dialogue moves or speech acts in corpora
- designing and evaluating dialogue systems

For the first time, we will have a special session (one afternoon), on
** Visual Attention and References to the Visual Situation **
separately reviewed and chaired by Massimo Poesio (University of
Essex) and Hannes Rieser (Universitaet Bielefeld). Topics of interest
include (but are not limited to): linguistic and philosophical studies
of deixis; eye-tracking studies of reference resolution in situated
language use; and computational models of deictic references and
reference interpretation. As always, especially encouraged are
interdisciplinary submissions, e.g., providing a sound theoretical
analysis based on solid empirical evidence.  The Programme Committe 
for this session includes John Kelleher (Dublin Institute of Technology) 
and Geert-Jan Kruijff (DFKI, Saarbruecken). More PC members TBA.

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

Authors should submit an *anonymous* paper of at most 8 pages (for
talks with a duration of 25' plus 10' discussion) via the web-site
(please indicate if you are submitting for the special session). For
the accepted talks, a LaTeX style will be made available for the
preparation of the final version.

The Foundation for Endangered Languages: Tenth Conference in association with the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, India. 25-27 October 2006. This year's conference concerns the effects of multilingualism on smaller languages. 

The Foundation for Endangered Languages, in association with the Central Institute of Indian Languages, will hold its annual 2006 conference in India, home of more than a thousand languages and dialects, and a consciously multilingual policy stance by the Government of India. Although many of these languages enjoy political and economic patronage, others are struggling to survive. Among these strugglers are the languages of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where communities are not only tiny, but also some of the most anciently independent tribes on the planet. The viability of many such small languages is threatened.

This year's conference concerns the effects of multilingualism on smaller languages. A crucial question for this conference is how far poorly-conceived language planning policies may actually contribute to environmental imbalance and instability, dangers that are often very little understood. As we understand the effort to revitalize languages, this is no more than the support they need to develop in the face of new demands, including the increased bi- and multi-lingualism coming from globalization, urbanization and language contact.
Some Issues for the Conference:

We hope to discuss these issues in terms of actual language situations presented by our participants.

-     Are minority languages threatened, or strengthened, through bilingualism or multilingualism with other languages? Is it essential for the survival of a small language to sustain a minimum-sized core group of language-dominant speakers?

-        What factors beside the prospect of competitive economic benefits can sustain language use in a community (and indeed re-orient the language planners)?

-         Is bilingual language planning important for families based on cross-cultural/linguistic marriages? More generally, what role is there for language planners in the future of a small language or dialect? Is language survival helped or hindered by a flexible policy in recognizing what languages are actually in use?

-       How significant are social networks for sustaining 'vital voices'? Does the context of a consciously multilingual society foster use of smaller languages? Is code-switching as common in small minority communities and tribes as it is in the elites?

-          How compatible is western-style formal education with traditional language use? Are there other models for transmission?

-        Are the prospects of minority languages affected by the metropolitan languages through which they may be known to a wider world?

-          Does a language's vitality benefit if it is not closely related, or structurally similar, to its neighbours?

-           Is language documentation the only feasible outside response to the needs of vital but vanishing voices?

-           How can modern - often cheap - technology benefit the smallest languages?

'Vital Voices' refers to the growing awareness that the survival and development of endangered languages are necessary for humanity's future, however endangered they may look amidst the statistics generated for policy in our globalized economy.
The Conference Venue

The Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, (CIIL) was set up by the Government of India in July 1969. It is a large institute with seven regional centers spread all over India, and is engaged in research and training in Indian languages other than English and Hindi. It helps to evolve and implement India's language policy and coordinate the development of Indian languages. Mysore is a city in the Southern Indian state of Karnataka. The former capital of the princely state of Mysore, ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty since the 14th century, it is now the administrative seat of Mysore District, the second largest in Karnataka, 135 km from Bangalore, the state capital. The city is known for its palaces and many other attractions. One of these is the Brindavan Gardens laid out beside the Krishnarajasagar dam (19km), particularly beautiful at night. There are also the Royal Palace, the Chamundi Hills, Srirangapatnam Temple, Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary, Oriental Research Instit!
 ute, and Museums of Folklore, and of Art and Archeology. The conference dates (25-27 October) will allow participants, if they wish, to witness Diwali (the festival of lights) on 23 October before coming to Mysore. A language-related excursion is planned for 28-29 October after the conference.

Meeting Description:

This workshop, the latest in a series that has been running
successfully since 1990, aims at bringing together researchers
interested in various aspects of the TAG formalism including relations
to other grammar formalisms -- this is the reason for the '+' in the
workshop's name. In the past, interaction between such formalisms has
been productive, leading for example to the development of
broad-coverage grammars, and to new insights into properties of
different formalisms. Such related formalisms would include minimalist
syntax, categorial grammar, dependency grammars, HPSG, LFG, and others
which share with TAG general properties such as lexicalization of
syntactic structure, a simple notion of local grammatical dependency,
or mildly context sensitive generative capacity. 

The Eighth International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and
Related Formalisms (TAG+8)

endorsed by
The Association for the Mathematics of Language (ACL SigMoL)

15-16 July 2006
Sydney, Australia

CALL FOR PAPERS

An important subfield of computational linguistics and natural
language processing is research that centers around formal machinery
for describing language.  This covers a wide range of
interdisciplinary work in the cognitive science of language, including
the mathematical and algorithmic properties of this machinery, the
grammatical description of natural language, and the mechanisms of
human language use.  The results of this research will often drive
more applied and empirical areas such as efficient algorithms and
models for machine learning.

Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a prominent formalism in the study of
natural language because of its attractive formal properties and its
extended domain of locality. TAG has been studied extensively in the
last three decades with respect to both its mathematical properties
and computational applications, as well as its role in constructing
grammatical theories, models of language processing and applications.

This workshop, the latest in a series that has been running
successfully since 1990, aims at bringing together researchers
interested in various aspects of the TAG formalism including relations
to other grammar formalisms -- this is the reason for the ''+'' in the
workshop's name. In the past, interaction between such formalisms has
been productive, leading for example to the development of
broad-coverage grammars, and to new insights into properties of
different formalisms. Such related formalisms would include minimalist
syntax, categorial grammar, dependency grammars, HPSG, LFG, and others
which share with TAG general properties such as lexicalization of
syntactic structure, a simple notion of local grammatical dependency,
or mildly context sensitive generative capacity.

Invited speakers:

  * Mark Johnson, Brown University
  * TBA

We invite submissions on all aspects of TAG and related systems and
anticipate holding sessions devoted to:

  * syntactic and semantic theory; 
  * mathematical properties; 
  * computational and algorithmic studies of parsing, 
    interpretation and generation; 
  * psycholinguistic modeling; and 
  * applications to natural language processing.

A key goal is thus to deepen knowledge of the formalisms that can be
used to describe natural language; the intention is for this workshop
to act as a forum for doing this, in the context of an increasing
empirical focus in the fields of computational linguistics and natural
language processing.  Equally, however, it is a goal of the workshop
to encourage the connection of formal results to this empirical work.

Anonymous abstracts may be submitted for two sorts of presentations at
the workshop: spoken presentations and poster presentations. Poster
presentations are particularly appropriate for brief descriptions of
specialized implementations, resources under development and work in
progress. Regardless of type of submission, abstracts may not exceed
two pages in length (not including data, figures and references). All
abstracts are to be submitted electronically using the ACL START
conference submission system.

The electronic submission website is at
http://www.softconf.com/acl/W15-COLINGACL2006/submit.html.

The workshop website is at http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/TAG+8/.

The ACL website is at http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au/.

Important dates:

  * Deadline for submission of abstracts: April 7 2006.
  * Notification of acceptance: May 9 2006.
  * Deadline for camera-ready submission: June 6 2006.
  * Workshop dates: July 15 to 16 2006.

Proceedings including full papers for accepted abstracts (including
both oral presentations and poster presentations) will be available
on-line and at the workshop. In addition, we will explore
possibilities for subsequent publication of workshop articles, for
example through a special issue of a journal.

Meeting Description:

INTERACTION AND EMERGENT PHENOMENA IN SOCIETIES OF AGENTS 

2006 FALL AAAI SYMPOSIUM  
October 12-15, 2006, at the Hyatt Crystal City in Arlington, VA

INTERACTION AND EMERGENT PHENOMENA IN SOCIETIES OF AGENTS 
http://pages.towson.edu/gtrajkov/FSS2006 

Whereas multiagent systems have been extremely helpful in solving engineering problems, much of what we find exciting lies in their applications to contemporary human life. In particular, the focus of this meeting will be on self-constituting systems and networks composed of human and non-human agents characteristic of emergent cyber cultures, including e-commerce, e-learning as well as other human/non-human agent systems in medicine, law, science and online interactions of all kinds. It represents an opportunity not only to share insights and experiments in multiagent systems composed of robot- and software agents, but to theorize hybridity formed at the junction of the human- and non-human. 

Multiagent systems, we submit, cross-disciplinary boundaries by focusing on society and culture as emerging from the interactions of autonomous agents. Poised at the intersection of AI, cybernetics, sociology, semiotics and anthropology, this strand of multiagent systems research enables a powerful perspective illuminating not only how we live and learn now, but also, through focusing on emergence, how we anticipate the future. 

Moreover, by convening this interdisciplinary symposium, we hope to form new network assemblages of variegated agents of researchers and their techniques out of which may arise new perspectives on heretofore parochial questions in our respective disciplines. From here, there are manifold policy implications: multiagent systems research, we believe, can be a powerful reagent, interrogating the teleological, emergentist assumptions underlying, for example, the adoption and institutionalization of IT in universities, businesses, hospitals and NGOs, and suggesting other, networked possibilities.  

Key questions: 
-Emergence of pre-linguistic concepts 
-Emergence of shared representations 
-Emergence of meaning and language 
-How can we characterize the fungible, shifting networks created by
human and non-human agents? 
-How do the environment and the society influence the individual agent
and vice versa? 
-What are the knowledges, translations or other hierarchies that emerge
in such settings? 
-What tools do we use in these explorations?

-Are they surprises to the agent? 
-How do these phenomena reflect on the off and on-line societies?

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $52,932. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2006 
LINGUIST List Cruise for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!

Meeting Description: 

Journée d'étude interdisciplinaire/Interdisciplinary Workshop 

LE SYLED-CEDISCOR
(EA 2290, Systèmes linguistiques, Enonciation, Discursivité/Centre de Recherche
sur les Discours Ordinaires et Spécialisés, Université Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle) 
ORGANISE UNE JOURNEE D'ETUDE INTERDISCIPLINAIRE

Le signalement d'enfant en danger, 
pratiques et discours

La loi fait obligation à tout citoyen ayant eu connaissance de mauvais
traitements infligés à un mineur d'en informer les autorités judiciaires ou
administratives. Ce 'signalement', qui a pour effet de déclencher l'intervention
de l'Etat (Parquet, Aide Sociale de l'Enfance) dans la sphère privée d'une
famille, constitue, au sens propre du terme, un acte de langage. Il s'élabore
dans des écrits qui visent à décrire une situation singulière et à l'évaluer à
l'aune du danger ou du risque de danger couru par l'enfant. 

Comment s'opèrent les processus de catégorisation et d'évaluation de la
situation ? Comment est représentée la parole de l'enfant et de ses proches ?
Comment s'élabore la mise en récit qui agence les faits vers la prise de
décision ? Comment les notions de signalement, de maltraitance ou de
'danger'sont-elles construites dans l'espace des discours juridiques,
médiatiques ou professionnels ? Telles sont les questions par lesquelles ces
textes ont été abordés par les chercheurs du Syled-Cediscor, spécialistes
d'analyse du discours, réunis dans le groupe 'Analyse d'une pratique discursive
: le signalement'. 

La journée sera organisée autour de deux thématiques : l'écriture du signalement
et la notion de signalement, qui seront introduites par une présentation des
travaux du groupe. L'objectif de la rencontre, à laquelle participent des
chercheurs d'autres disciplines, est d'établir un dialogue avec les
professionnels du champ concerné, qui seront invités à réagir aux analyses
proposées, et à susciter en retour de nouveaux questionnements.

Cette journée d'étude s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un projet qui a reçu le soutien
de l'Observatoire National de l'Enfance en Danger. Elle bénéficie du concours du
SYLED, du Conseil scientifique de l'Université Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle et de
l'Université de Chicago.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $52,932. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2006 
LINGUIST List Cruise for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!

Full Title: Resource-Scarce Language Engineering 

Date: 31-Jul-2006 - 04-Aug-2006
Location: Málaga, Spain 
Contact Person: Edward Garrett
Meeting Email: egarrett@emich.edu
Web Site: http://altiplano.emich.edu/resource_scarce/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Writing Systems 

Call Deadline: 07-Apr-2006 

Meeting Description:

This workshop will bring together scientists from academia and industry, as well as advanced PhD students, to present and discuss research on the theoretical and practical challenges of engineering resource-scarce languages. We intend to provide an inclusive forum for exchanging ideas on a broad range of topics in areas represented by ESSLLI, including basic text processing, speech analysis, and machine translation. 

FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS (24 March, 2006)
Resource-Scarce Language Engineering
http://altiplano.emich.edu/resource_scarce/
31 July - 4 August, 2006
  
Workshop Topics:
  Seen through one lens, ''resource-scarce languages'' are languages 
  for which few digital resources exist; and thus, languages whose 
  computerization poses unique challenges. Through another lens, 
  ''resource-scarce languages'' are languages with limited financial, 
  political, and legal resources, languages that lack the clout or 
  global importance of the world's major languages.

  In spite of these challenges, resource-scarce languages and 
  their speakers are not being ignored. Individuals, governments, 
  and companies alike are busy developing technologies and tools 
  to support such languages. They are driven by a variety of
  motivations - from the desire among academics and community 
  activists to preserve or revitalize endangered or threatened 
  languages - to the desire by governments to promote minority 
  languages - to the need by other governments to detect hostile 
  chatter in diverse tongues - to the strategy of some companies to 
  enhance their stature in emerging markets such as China and 
  South America.

  Recognizing the above trend, this workshop will serve as a forum 
  for the discussion of academic and industrial research on resource-
  scarce language engineering. Possible topics include but are not 
  limited to:

    - multilingual text processing and the Unicode Standard
    - machine translation and speech recognition with minimal 
      training data
    - rapid portability of existing language technologies to new languages
    - the use of multilingual resources for monolingual annotation
    - the annotation of new language data on the basis of knowledge 
      of related languages
    - coping with data of inconsistent or uneven quality or coverage

  In addition, there will be a shared task on a specific resource-
  scarce language - Tibetan (details to be announced separately).

Submission Details:
  Authors are invited to submit a paper describing completed work
  in the area of the workshop. Each submission will be read by at least
  two members of the program committee, and will be evaluated 
  according to its scientific merit, its relevance to the workshop, and
  the degree to which its ideas are expressed fully yet concisely.
  Submissions of any length will be accepted, but acceptable formats
  are limited to postscript and pdf. Papers sent in other formats will be
  subject to immediate disposal. Please send your submission electronically 
  to egarrett@emich.edu by the deadline listed below. Accepted
  papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI.
  
Workshop Format:
  This workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI 
  participants.  It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over 
  five consecutive days in the first week of ESSLLI.  There will be 
  at least 2-3 slots for paper presentation and discussion plus one 
  invited talk per session. On the first day the workshop organizer 
  will give a general introduction to the topic.

  Tom Emerson, Basis Technology Corporation
  John Goldsmith, University of Chicago
  Rada Mihalcea, University of North Texas
  Richard Sproat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Local Arrangements:
  All workshop participants including the presenters will be
  required to register for ESSLLI.  The registration fee for 
  authors presenting a paper will correspond to the early 
  student/workshop speaker registration fee.  Moreover, a number
  of additional fee waiver grants might be made available by 
  the local organizing committee on a competitive basis and 
  workshop participants are eligible to apply for those. 
  
  There will be no reimbursement for travel costs or accommodation.
  Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding 
  should contact the local organizing committee to ask for the 
  possibilities of a grant.

resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!

that employers do not discriminate on the grounds of race, ethnicity,
nationality, age, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. However, we
have no means of enforcing these standards.

Job seekers should pay special attention to language in ads regarding
employment requirements and are encouraged to consult our international
employment page http://linguistlist.org/jobs/jobnet.html. This page has been set 
up so that people can report on the employment standards of various countries.

================================================================  

We'd like to remind readers that the responses to queries are usually
best posted to the individual asking the question. That individual is
then strongly encouraged to post a summary to the list. This policy was
instituted to help control the huge volume of mail on LINGUIST; so we
would appreciate your cooperating with it whenever it seems appropriate.

In addition to posting a summary, we'd like to remind people that it
is usually a good idea to personally thank those individuals who have
taken the trouble to respond to the query.

Subject: Canonical Position of Time Adverbial in Russian 
 


Dear colleagues,

Recently, an article by Dongtao Yu in the Journal of Chinese Linguistics in
China posits an implicational universal:  the OV order implies the tV [time
adverbial + V] order. I have two questions here that I want to make sure.
1.  Do you know any counterexamples to this assumed implicational universal?
2.  In the article, the author lists Russian as a language with VO and Vt
orders. My impression is that in Russian, both tV and Vt orders are used,
perhaps tV is used more frequently than Vt.  Now,
   Which is the basic order in Russian: tV or Vt?
   BTW, Chinese has VO and tV as basic order. 

Hope some Russian linguists on the list will help.

Best

Our institution is in the midst of developing a community survey for an
Administration for Native Americans Endangered Language Preservation grant.
I was wondering of other members have developed such instruments and, if
so, if they would be willing to share them?  If I receive responses, I will
compile everything received and make it available.
Thank you for any and all help!

We would like to start this week with an update on the Fund Drive 2006. 

So far we have raised $15,768, and we are $37,164 away from our goal. This is a great start!
Dear Subscribers, you do love us! If you enjoy your time on our cruise ship, please make a 
donation to keep us afloat. To donate now, visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

This week we are featuring a new performance by Terry the Singing Lumberjack, who will be 
presenting another version of our Fund Drive song. We invite all of you to add to the
song, and next week we'll replace some of the current song lyrics with the best subscriber 
submissions! The deadline for these submissions is April 2nd.

If you donate $1000 or more, Terry will cut a special CD containing your own creative 
submissions, and LINGUIST List will mail it directly to you! So submit your donation and 
send us your version of the song by April 14th to receive this special CD from Terry. You can 
do all this on our cruise page:

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html

The terrific LEXICON: Game without Rules is on right now. See how far you can get. Winners 
receive fabulous prizes from our publishers and subscribers!

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html

As more of you donate, we will be able to show more Hometown Tours of other LINGUIST crew 
members. We will also have more linguists sharing their stories. For all this, visit:

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html

Have a wonderful week!

From:  linguist < linguist@linguistlist.org >
Subject: Editor Susan Hooyenga on E-MELD 

	

It was the opportunity to work on the E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered 
Languages Data) project that drew me to LINGUIST List.  Before coming here, I received an 
MS in Information at the University of Michigan, with a specialization in Archives and 
Records Management.  While I was in that program, I heard about E-MELD, which is concerned 
with the best ways to digitally preserve language documentation and support collaboration 
among linguistic archives.  This fit my interests so perfectly that I found myself signing 
up for two more years of school.  I still intend to be an archivist, but ideally I'd like 
to work with linguistic documents, whether it's a lexicon on paper, a narrative on a casette 
tape, or a database of interlinear glossed text.  Working here during the final two years 
of the E-MELD project has enabled me to gain a linguistics degreee while applying my archival 
background to a project that matters to me.  

However, I've done a lot more than just work on E-MELD.  For a year and a half I was the editor 
for Ask-a-Linguist, which gave me an opportunity to see exactly what the general public 
finds interesting about language, and how little they know about what we do!  I've gained 
experience with web design, XML, Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, digital audio, and organizing a 
conference.  One of the reasons I love my work here is that instead of using linguistics to 
make computers run better (a worthwhile goal, but not what I'm interested in), we're using 
computers to serve linguistics. 

I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work at LINGUIST List, and your generous contributions 
are what make it possible.  If you haven't donated yet, please do so soon, and remember that 
even the smallest amounts help!

Susan Hooyenga

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $52,932. This money will go to help keep the 
List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 2006 
LINGUIST List Cruise for some Fund Drive fun!

http://linguistlist.org/cruise.html 

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form.

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later.

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to donate by 
check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against

you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns

value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

TITLE: Reading Philosophy of Language
SUBTITLE: Selected Texts with Interactive Commentary
SERIES: Reading Philosophy
PUBLISHER: Blackwell Publishing
YEAR: 2005

Magda Dumitru, independent scholar

''Reading Philosophy of Language'' belongs to a successful series of 
introductory books to philosophy, offering a refreshing, hands-on 
approach to texts written by reputed scholars in the field. As editors 
Jennifer Hornsby and Guy Longworth mention in their ''Introduction'', 
the volume is intended for the use of students wishing to know what it 
means to do philosophy of language: ''Our aim has been to help you 
[...] pinpoint your agreements and disagreements with the texts, and 
to articulate your reason for agreeing or disagreeing.'' (p. 2). The texts 
alluded to belong to a different author each of them, and are 
distributed over six chapters. Every chapter includes three texts, each 
accompanied by an introduction (bio-bibliographic) and editors' 
commentary. The chapters are preceded by a ''Sources and 
Acknowledgments'' section and by an ''Introduction'', and are followed 
by ''Further Reading'' and an ''Index''.

The topics illustrated by the texts include the relationship between 
mind and reference, mind and action, and understanding and 
knowledge, as well as the mechanisms of non-literal meaning. The 
purpose of this review is not to offer a commentary on the original 
texts, but to discuss the job done by the editors in choosing and 
analyzing them. In the following, summaries will be given for the 
contents of each chapter, as well as a brief critical evaluation. 
The ''References'' section includes all the texts discussed in the book.

SUMMARY

Chapter 1 ''Reference and Meaning''
The excerpt from Book III of ''An Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding'' by John Locke introduces and discusses the 
implications of the thesis according to which words signify ideas that 
speaker and hearer share about real objects: ''Words being voluntary 
signs, they cannot be voluntary signs imposed by him [the speaker] on 
things he knows not.'' (p. 11). In his text ''Of Names'', John Stuart Mill 
employs 'names' to refer to both nouns and sentences. Mill proposes 
a threefold distinction of names: general vs. individual, concrete vs. 
abstract, and connotative vs. non-connotative. General names stand 
for ''an indefinite number of things'', while individual names 
are ''capable of being truly affirmed [...] of one thing'' (p. 19). A 
concrete name ''stands for a thing'', while an abstract name ''stands for 
an attribute of a thing'' (p. 20).The third distinction is the most 
important one, according to Mill: ''Whenever they [names] have 
properly any meaning, the meaning resides not in what they denote, 
but in what they connote. The only names of objects which connote 
nothing are proper names'' (p. 25). A connotative name ''denotes a 
subject, and implies a state'', while a non-connotative name ''signifies 
a subject only, or an attribute only'' (p. 22). The text from Gottlob 
Frege, ''On Sense and Reference'', discusses the famous 'identity 
puzzle'. According to Frege, identity may be either a relation between 
objects (e.g. 'Hesperus is Phosphorus'), or a relation between names 
(or signs) of objects (e.g. 'Hesperus is Hesperus'). The two example 
sentences have the same, unique reference, and yet only the first 
sentence is informative (has cognitive value), since to one reference 
are associated two different senses. The relation between sense and 
reference is the following: ''To the sign there corresponds a definite 
sense and to that in turn a definite reference, while to a given 
reference (an object) there does not belong only a single sign'' (p. 33).

Chapter 2 ''Speech and Action''
The central issue in this chapter is whether and how accounts of 
meaning may fit accounts of language use. The first author discussed 
is John Langshaw Austin, with a text on performativity. Although there 
are sometimes grammatical criteria that establish whether a verb is 
performative (e.g. 1st person singular present indicative active), the 
author considers that there may be other ways for evaluating 
utterances: felicity conditions. The second author discussed is William 
P. Alston, with a text on the relationship between 'meaning' 
and 'force': ''the meaning of a linguistic expression is to be elucidated 
in terms of the use of that expression'' (p. 64). Considerable 
discussion is also targeting the nature of language use and the 
distinction illocutionary/perlocutionary. The third text belongs to John 
R. Searle who acknowledges, with Austin and against Alston, that 
meaning and action ought to be separated. Searle discusses the 
notion of ''illocutionary effect'' on the hearer - reminiscent of Grice's 
notion of ''speaker meaning''.

Chapter 3 ''Meaning and Truth''
The chapter opens with a text from Donald Davidson where he 
introduces the notion of ''radical interpretation'' - which is to be 
discussed ''without essential use of such linguistic concepts as 
meaning, interpretation, synonymy, and the like'' (p. 96). A well-known 
adage of Davidson's is that ''meaning is truth-conditions'': ''[...] 
assuming translation, Tarski was able to define truth; the present idea 
is to take truth as basic and to extract an account of translation or 
interpretation'' (p. 101). The following text belongs to Scott Soames, 
who argues against a relation between meaning-facts and speakers' 
semantic competence: ''knowledge of truth conditions [...] is neither 
necessary nor sufficient for understanding a language'' (p. 118). The 
last text belongs to Crispin Wright, who maintains that there should be 
a closer connection between linguistic competence and Semantic 
theory: semantic properties of words and sentences ''must be 
grounded in speakers' intentions''. The chapter closes with an 
appendix offering an account of Tarski's theory of truth.

Chapter 4 ''Knowledge of Language''
The main issue discussed in this chapter is whether competence is a 
kind of knowledge or a practical ability. The excerpt from Noam 
Chomsky tackles this issue by establishing an innate, universal status 
of language knowledge: tacit knowledge, as part of the ''universal 
grammar''. Therefore language knowledge cannot be a practical 
ability; the use of knowledge belongs to ''performance'', while innate 
knowledge belongs to ''competence''. From Michael Dummett a text 
was chosen which qualifies knowledge of language as ''implicit'', 
intermediate between knowledge of facts and practical ability: ''There 
is no gap between knowing what it is to speak Spanish and knowing 
how to do so'' (p. 174). Welcome is also a discussion of two major 
views in philosophy of language: language viewed as a code (before 
Frege) and language as belonging to specific theories of meaning (in 
the analytical tradition). The last text is due to John Campbell, who 
embraces a ''robust view'' (which he calls ''cognitivism'') on language 
knowledge, considered to be ordinary knowledge. Understanding is 
not to be dissociated from structure perception: ''the knowledge 
constitutive of understanding relates primarily to words and their 
composition into sentences'' (p. 197).

Chapter 5 ''Meaning and Compositionality''
The main question put in this chapter is whether a compositional view 
on meaning is necessary for speakers' understanding of novel 
sentences. The first author discussed is Paul Horwich, who embraces 
a deflationary view on compositionality: ''Just as being water consists 
in being made of H2O, and just as redness consists in reflecting 
certain wavelengths of light, so the meaning property of 'dogs bark' 
consists in its construction property'' (p. 219). Semantic properties of 
words are not given in terms of truth-conditions, but by stating their 
meanings; again, compositionality is related to understanding. James 
Higginbotham's views in the text chosen are close to those expressed 
in the texts chosen from Chomsky and Davidson: semantic knowledge 
resides in tacit knowledge of a truth-theory by competent speakers. 
The text from Paul Pietroski argues against Horwich's account of 
meaning: ''[...] it doesn't follow that if you can associate each sentence 
of English with its meaning, you thereby understand English'' (p. 235). 
Pietroski maintains that a theory of meaning should be able to explain 
crosslinguistic generalizations, as well as the semantics of 
determiners, quantifiers and semantic relations.

Chapter 6 ''Non-literal Meaning''
Merrie Bergmann's text offers ''a theoretical account of the assertive 
use of metaphor'' (p. 252). She takes salience to be the landmark of 
metaphorical use: content is a ''direct function of salient characteristics 
[...] of the expression'' (p. 254). The metaphorical meaning of words 
and sentences is contained in their literal meaning, hence metaphor is 
context dependent. In his text, Martin Davies compares approaches to 
metaphor by Black and Davidson; he agrees with Black that ''we lack 
an adequate account of metaphorical thought'' (Black 1979, p. 192), 
but also with Davidson's view that ''what the metaphor prompts or 
inspires is not entirely, or even at all, recognition of some truth or fact'' 
(Davidson p. 253). The last author discussed, Kent Bach, supports a 
similar view of non-literality, namely that it must be a question of use. 
He further introduces the notion of ''impliciture'', present in sentences 
like ''Rich and Ann are engaged'' (impliciture: 'presumably to each 
other'). Bach thinks that sentence non-literality is a pervasive 
phenomenon, and defines implicitures as involving ''an unexpressed 
qualification on what is said'' (p. 291).

CRITICAL EVALUATION

''Reading Philosophy of Language'' is an excellent guide for students 
of Philosophy of Language of all levels, although some familiarity is 
assumed with certain concepts - 'truth', for instance, is used in the first 
chapter (the section on Frege), but discussed later, in the third. The 
texts are well-chosen, from a variety of sources (including radio 
performances), and are arranged both thematically and 
chronologically. The ''Reading Philosophy'' series has no pretense to 
exhaustivity, which may explain why landmark names such as Russel, 
Wittgenstein, and Quine are only briefly mentioned. Nevertheless, the 
goal of the book is served well by having a wide array of authors 
discussed, from 'sacred monsters' of Linguistic Semantics (Frege, 
Austin, Searle, Davidson, Chomsky) to famous philosophers (Locke, 
Mill, Dummett) and contemporary scholars (Alston, Soames, Wright, 
Higginbotham, Campbell, Horwich, Pietroski, Bergmann, Davies, 
Bach). Several authors make reference to other authors' texts, also 
included in the anthology (e.g. Davies refers to 
Bergmann); 'intertextuality' is also encouraged by some of the editors' 
comments, like those in the first chapter, for instance, where theses by 
Mill are compared to those by Frege and Locke. Interactivity is 
enhanced when editors give specific assignments in their commentary 
sections to the readers of the volume, asking them to form an opinion 
and argue for it. Commentary sections are well structured and 
detailed, although, at times, somewhat uneven - the commentary to 
Davidson, for example, is particularly clear, while the commentary to 
Chomsky is rather cursory, and the one to Dummett is essentially a 
summary.

Although people interested in either Philosophy or Linguistics may use 
the book, the main vocabulary used by editors is the one current in 
Philosophy of Language; only the averted reader will know, for 
instance, that 'meaning' and 'use' are studied by Semantics and 
Pragmatics, respectively. While a unification of the vocabularies 
proper to the two disciplines may not feasible, or even desirable, brief 
commentaries by editors on their interplay would have been a 
welcome addition.

Care was taken by editors to distinguish their notes from those 
provided by authors; for the sake of clarity, explanations are 
sometimes given in the very body of the commentary sections (e.g. the 
meaning of 'idiolect', p. 223). However, at other times, footnotes would 
be required, but are not offered (e.g. one may not know that 'ce' 
and 'être' are French words for 'this' and 'to be' respectively).

There are occasional style oversights, as in ''[...] it includes definite 
descriptions along with proper names proper.'' (p. 30), although typos 
seem to be a greater problem - ''his work in political and moral and 
philosophy'' instead of ''his work in political and moral philosophy'' (p. 
17); ''becalled'' instead of ''be called'' (p. 68); ''1'' instead of ''I'' (p. 
47); ''do do'' instead of ''do'' (p. 57); ''is distinct from he says'' instead 
of ''is distinct from what he says'' (p. 198); ''near x a t'' instead of ''near 
x at t'' (p. 304). Other typos are due exclusively to technical editing - 
misalignments like those on pp. 150, 206, 231, 270. All the 
shortcomings mentioned are however very small indeed; the great 
merit of the volume remains - that of inciting readers to make 
connections between the texts included, far beyond those offered in 
the commentaries, that may lead them to original and surprising 
conclusions.

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such can 
receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) Non Profit 
organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations can be offset against 
your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any gift 
you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting your human 
resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns 
to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the 
value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a moment 
to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
