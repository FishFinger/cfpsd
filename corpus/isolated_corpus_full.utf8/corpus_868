Submission information
----------------------

The presentations may be held in any Slavic language as well as in English. The
language for submitting your abstract and paper is English. Depending on the
number of presentations in  Slavic languages, we may split the programme into
two sessions, one will be held entirely in English while the other one will
gather Slavic language presentations. Therefore we kindly ask you to inform us
about the language of your presentation when submitting the abstract. All
abstracts will be reviewed by the members of the programme committee by May 7th
, 2007. Accepted abstracts will serve as the basis for the conference
programme.

If you intend to present a paper, please send an abstract in a plain text file
by March 12th , 2007. 

The deadline for camera-ready version of the paper is August 1st , 2007. No
further changes of papers will be possible.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in LaTeX format,
using the llncs2e document class. Please refer to the instructions found on
Springer website http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings

Alternatively, if you prefer to work in WYSIWIG environment, you can submit
your article in OpenOffice 2 format, with standard fonts. If you need to use
any special fonts, make sure they are TrueType fonts with correct unicode
table, otherwise the article will most probably NOT be formatted as you would
