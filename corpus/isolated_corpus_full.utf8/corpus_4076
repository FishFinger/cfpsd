              NAACL HLT 2009 Student Research Workshop

                      --- DEADLINE EXTENSION --- 
                 --- NEW DEADLINE IS JAN 04 2009 --- 

The Organizing Committee of the Student Research Workshop and Doctoral
Consortium at NAACL HLT 2009 in Boulder, Colorado would like to announce that
the deadline for submissions has been extended to Sunday January 4, 2009, 23:59
EST. 

The workshop is intended particularly as a venue for PhD students who have a
clear research plan and some preliminary results that indicate that their idea
might work. Unlike conference papers, we don't expect completely finished work
--- this is a place where you can present and get feedback on your research
plan while your PhD is still work in progress. Multi-authored papers are
allowed, but the first author of the paper must be a student, and the paper
must be presented by a student at the workshop.

The original CFP (with the changes mentioned above) is enclosed below.

New Deadline for NAACL HLT 2009 Student Research Workshop: Jan 4, 2009

May 31-June 5, 2009 in Boulder, CO

(the Student Research Workshop will be held during the NAACL HLT
2009 Conference)

CALL FOR PAPERS

Paper Submission Deadline: Sunday, January 4th, 2009

Unless otherwise stated, all submissions are due by 11:59 PM EST
on the specified day.

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their work and receive feedback from a general
audience as well as from panelists. The panelists are experienced
researchers who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in
advance of the presentation.

We would like to invite student researchers to submit their work to
the workshop. Since this workshop is an excellent opportunity to ask
for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to run your ideas by
an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the workshop
will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come
from any topic area within computational linguistics and is understood
to be applied to speech and/or text. A list of topic areas is provided
in the Call for Papers for the NAACL HLT 2009 Conference available at:

http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/call_for_papers.html

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is original and unpublished research.
The papers should describe original work in progress. Students who
have settled on their thesis direction but still have significant
research left to do are particularly encouraged to submit their
papers.

Since the main purpose of presenting at the workshop is to exchange ideas with
other researchers and to receive helpful feedback for further development of
the work, papers should clearly indicate directions for future research
wherever appropriate.  Multi-authored papers are acceptable if the first author
of the paper is a student, and the paper will be presented by a student author
at the workshop. Papers submitted for this workshop are eligible only if they
have not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Students who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL Student
Research Workshop may not submit to this workshop. They should submit their
papers to the main conference instead. It must be indicated if a paper has been
submitted to another conference or workshop.

3. Submission Procedure

Submission will be electronic using the paper submission web page
below:

https://www.softconf.com/naacl-hlt09/StudentResearch2009/

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style
files tailored for this year's conference. These files are available
at:

http://clear.colorado.edu/NAACLHLT2009/stylefiles.html

A description of the format is available there in case you are unable
to use these style files directly. All submissions must be electronic:
please use the submission website above to submit your paper.

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance
decision will be based on the results of the review. Note that
reviewing of papers will be double-blind; therefore, please make sure
your paper shows the title, but no author information. You should
likewise not have any self identifying references anywhere in the
paper submitted for review. For example, rather than this: ''We showed
previously (Smith, 2001), ...'', use citations such as: ''Smith (2001)
previously showed ...''.

5. Schedule

The papers must be submitted no later than 11:59 EST, January 4th,
2008. No papers received after this deadline will be accepted.
Acknowledgment will be emailed soon after receipt. Notification of
acceptance will be sent to authors (by email) on February 23rd,
2009. Detailed formatting guidelines for the preparation of the final
camera-ready copy will be provided to authors with their acceptance
notice.

Important Dates:

Papers due: Jan 4, 2008
Notification of acceptance: Feb 23, 2009
Camera ready papers due: Mar 31, 2009
Conference date: May 31-June 5, 2009
(The Student Research Workshop will be held during the NAACL HLT 2009
conference)
