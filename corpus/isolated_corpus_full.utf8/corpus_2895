Call for Papers

Special Issue on Biomedical Natural Language Processing: Journal of
Biomedical Informatics

Guest Editors:
Wendy W. Chapman, PhD
K. Bretonnel Cohen

Submission deadline: May 27, 2008

**********************************************************************
BioNLP is biomedical natural language processing, or the application of
natural language processing and text mining to the biomedical, clinical,
and genomic domains. The goal of this special issue of the Journal of
Biomedical Informatics (JBI) is to publish papers describing novel work at
the forefront of the new challenges and possibilities that face the BioNLP
community today.

The last decade saw rapid growth in the area of BioNLP. This body of work
has resulted in quantitative and qualitative differences in both the types
of tasks we can undertake and the levels of performance on those tasks.
There has been a recent resurgence of work in foundational, lower-level
linguistic analysis tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic
parsing, and semantic role labeling. There has also been a new emphasis on
higher-level application-oriented work such as automated ICD9-CM code
assignment, use of NLP in clinical decision support, and management of the
rapid growth in the primary biomedical literature. These recent advances in
foundational technologies and in application types and domains have created
the possibility of a new era in biomedical text mining.  The special issue
is intended to help define and provide insights into that future.

We solicit papers on new methodologies applied to text from biomedical,
clinical, or genomic domains. In addition to original research papers, as
is JBI's custom, we are soliciting one or more methodological review papers
on BioNLP methodologies. Possible topics for this special issue include,
but are not limited to, the following subjects as applied to biomedical text:

*        Morphological processing
*        Part-of-speech tagging
*        Syntactic parsing
*        Tokenization
*        Coordination and conjunction processing
*        Negation and uncertainty identification
*        Word sense disambiguation
*        Reference resolution
*        Temporal modeling from text
*        Information retrieval
*        Information extraction and encoding
*        Text classification
*        Text summarization
*        Question-answering
*        Development and evaluation of annotation schemas
*        Corpus and test set generation and evaluation
*        Software testing and engineering for natural language processing
applications

In accordance with JBI's editorial policies, we are soliciting full-length
article submissions that present and evaluate new methods rather than the
application or evaluation of existing approaches (see editorial guidelines
at http://www.elsevier.com/locate/yjbin).

Any questions regarding the special issue may be sent to the guest editors
at jbi-nlp@list.pitt.edu. We welcome advance notice of your intention to
submit a paper. Inquiries about suitability should include the subject line
'suitability inquiry' and a short paragraph describing the primary
objective of the manuscript, emphasizing how the objective matches the JBI
editorial guidelines cited above.

Submissions: Manuscripts should be submitted to the JBI authors' gateway
(http://ees.elsevier.com/jbi/) no later than May 27, 2008. Please be sure
that your manuscript follows the JBI instructions for authors available on
that web site. You will be offered an opportunity to specify the special
issue ('Biomedical NLP') as the preferred venue when you submit your
manuscript to the gateway.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
