                 Call for Papers
==================================================

       Lecture Notes on Artificial Intelligence

                 Special Issue on

     Recent Advances in Constraint Handling Rules

==================================================

EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 1, 2008

Editors:
      Thom Fruehwirth (Thom.Fruehwirth at uni-ulm.de)
      Tom Schrijvers (Tom.Schrijvers at cs.kuleuven.be)

The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language saw the light more than 15 years 
ago.  Since then, it has become a major declarative specification and 
implementation language for constraint-based algorithms and applications.  In 
recent years, the Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules have spurred the 
exchange of ideas within the CHR community, which has led to increased 
international collaboration, new theoretical results and optimized 
implementations.

The aim of this issue of Lecture Notes in Computer Science is to attract 
high-quality research papers on these recent advances in Constraint Handling 
Rules.

TOPICS

Topics of interest, on all aspects of CHR, include but are not limited
to:

      *  Semantics
      *  Logical Algorithms
      *  Constraint Solvers
      *  Expressivity and Complexity
      *  Program Analysis
      *  Programming tools
      *  Implementations and Optimization
      *  Program Transformation and Generation
      *  Language Extensions (Types, Modules)
      *  Retractable Constraints
      *  Programming Pearls
      *  Programming Environments (Debugging)
      *  Applications
      *  Critical Assessment
      *  Comparisons with Related Approaches

SUBMISSIONS

Revised and enhanced versions of papers published at the Workshops on 
Constraint Handling Rules and other occasions that have not appeared in 
archival journals are eligible for submission.  Papers describing important 
past research in this area which have not been published in archival journal 
papers are also solicited.  New work, surveys and comparison of state of the 
art techniques are also solicited. None of the submissions should have been 
published in any form prior to 2002.

When submitting already published papers with minor changes only, authors are 
responsible for ensuring copyright clearance with the previous publisher by 
obtaining a written permission to republish.

For any doubt regarding the appropriateness of the topic of a paper for this 
special issue please email one of the editors.

Papers should be written in English, and formatted using the LaTeX style files 
developed by Springer Verlag for LNCS. They can be downloaded from 
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html

To submit please send your paper in pdf format only to both editors. For 
further information, please look at:
