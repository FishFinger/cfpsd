                      The Blizzard Challenge 2007
      Evaluating corpus-based speech synthesis on common databases

======================================================================

In order to better understand and compare research techniques in
building corpus-based speech synthesizers on the same data, Blizzard
Challenge 2005 and 2006 were held.  We will now have the third
challenge as the Blizzard Challenge 2007.

The basic challenge is to take the released speech database, build
synthetic voices from the data and synthesize a prescribed set of test
sentences.  The sentences from each synthesizer will then be evaluated
through listening tests.

For the Blizzard Challenge 2007, ATR-SLC (http://www.slc.atr.jp/) will
release an eight-hour American English speech database.  We would ask
each participant to build three voices using a) the whole set of the
database, b) the ARCTIC subset of the database, and c) a
limited-amount of sentences chosen by each participant, respectively.
Unknown sentences from an independent source will be generated and
each participant will synthesize them with their system.  The speech
will then be put on the web for evaluation.

The results will be presented at a satellite event at ISCA Speech
Synthesis Workshop, in Bonn, Germany.  Participants will be expected
to submit 4 page papers describing their entries for review.  Accepted
papers will be presented at the workshop, and published on the
Blizzard website.

Call for participation: http://festvox.org/blizzard/

The Blizzard Challenge: Registration

Interested parties should register their intentions to participate by
mailing blizzard@festvox.org.  They should identify a contact person
in their team, as well as provide email and real mail addresses.

A registration fee of 500USD is due at time of submission (March 30)
to offset the costs of paying undergraduate listeners.  There is a
mailing list for discussion and announcements for the challenge:

   blizzard-discuss@festvox.org

To join the list send a message to majordomo@festvox.org with the
following line in the body of the message
