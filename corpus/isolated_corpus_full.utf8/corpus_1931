Location: Greenville, North Carolina, USA 
Contact Person: Stephen Hinman

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Language Acquisition; Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 09-Dec-2007 

Meeting Description:

TALGS (Teachers/Applied Linguistics Graduate Students) is a small, student-run
conference aimed at providing a relaxed but serious environment for graduate
students and professionals working in TESL/TEFL and a variety of applied
linguistic fields to present their work and receive feedback. The 5th annual
TALGS Conference will be held at East Carolina University on Saturday, February
16, 2008 in the Bate Building on main campus. The TALGS committee is currently
accepting call for papers/presentations and is proud to have keynote speaker
Walt Wolfram from North Carolina State University. Mr. Wolfram's discussion,
Southern-Bred ESL: Hispanic English in the Mid-Atlantic South, will explore how
dialects, particularly Southern dialects, affect the acquisition of English as a
second language. The presentation considers the emerging English of Hispanics in
the Mid-Atlantic South based on current sociolinguistic research in
representative urban and rural contexts of North Carolina. 

Research Meets Practice: We encourage submissions from graduate students and
teachers whose research and practice fall broadly under the umbrella of applied
linguistics and TESL/TEFL. We welcome cross-disciplinary proposals with
relevance to language learning and/or language teaching from a variety of
fields, including, for example, sociolinguistics, discourse studies, sociology,
education, foreign languages, and psychology. Presentations reporting on action
research (inside and outside the classroom), works in progress, and pilot
research, as well as proposals for discussion sessions and workshops are
welcome. For more information, please visit the TALGS website at
http://core.ecu.edu/engl/talgs.

Submit your proposal at http://core.ecu.edu/engl/talgs by December 9, 2007.

Meeting Description:

Conference Panel:

Theme:
Historical (Im)Politeness Research

Organisers: 
Jonathan Culpeper (Lancaster University) and Dániel Z. Kádár (Research Institute
for Linguistics, H.A.S.) 

Description of the Forthcoming Panel: 
In recent years much research has been undertaken on both linguistic politeness
and historical pragmatics. A regrettable fact is, however, that few forums have
been created where politeness theorists and experts in historical pragmatics can
exchange views on the possible application of politeness 'theories' to
historical data. Moreover, not only has historical data rarely been the focus of
politeness analyses and discussions, but its potential for shaping our
understanding of politeness has not been fully appreciated. The merging of
politeness research and historical pragmatics can benefit both sides: historical
pragmatic research can benefit from moving away from more 'traditional'
politeness theories when analysing historical data; politeness research can
benefit from a diachronic perspective. With this in mind, we are pleased to
announce our forthcoming panel Historical (Im)Politeness Research, which will be
organised in the frame of the 4th International Symposium on Politeness 'East
Meets West', Budapest, 2007. This groundbreaking panel will be an open forum
where experts can meet, form new acquaintances and interdisciplinary working
groups, and raise and discuss both methodological and theoretical issues. It
should be emphasised that ours is an open panel, that is, we cordially invite
and encourage every colleague who is interested in the topic of the panel to
submit her/his abstracts to us.

Abstract Submission:
The selection of abstracts will be made on the basis of quality and relatedness
to the topic and objectives of the panel. We ask for 'long' abstracts, that is,
the submitted abstracts should be up to 800 words long, and the authors of the
abstracts are expected to provide an overview of the goal, methodology, and data
of their research. Abstracts can be submitted to us from early September; the
deadline for abstract submission will be November 15, 2007. Notifications of
acceptance will be sent out by January 2008 or earlier. 
Abstracts should be sent to both of the organisers to the following e-mail
addresses:
Jonathan Culpeper - j.culpeper@lancaster.ac.uk 
Dániel Kádár - danielkadar@yahoo.co.uk 

Publication:
The organisers will publish a volume containing a selection of papers presented
at the panel. This edited collection of papers is going to be published in early
2009 at the Linguistic Insights Series of the Swiss publisher Peter Lang, Berne.
It should be emphasised that the volume will not be a proceedings: whilst every
panel participant will be invited to submit a paper version of her/his
presentation to us, the submitted papers will go through a blind peer-review
process and hence will be subject of acceptance/refusal. The deadline for
submitting ready papers is October 15, 2008. More information about the volume
will be circulated amongst the panel participants soon after the notification of
acceptance.

Inquiries:
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact with the
organisers at the aforementioned e-mail addresses. Please also check the
conference website www.nytud.hu/lprg for updates.
