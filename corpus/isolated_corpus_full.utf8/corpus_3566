Linguistic Field(s): Lexicography; Text/Corpus Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2009 

Meeting Description:

International Workshop on Terminology and Lexical Semantics (TLS'09)
Held in conjunction with
Fourth International Conference on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT'09)
June 16-18, 2009 

Call for Papers

Recent work on terminology processing (corpus-based or knowledge-based
terminology, computational terminology, terminography or specialized
lexicography, etc.) has shown the importance of taking into account the
linguistic aspects of terms as well as their conceptual aspects. Linguistic
aspects are often those that must be dealt with when processing or analyzing
corpora. Conceptual aspects, on the other hand, are those that terminologists
must take into account when building knowledge representations in specific
subject fields. The weight given to each aspect depends on the theoretical model
on which a terminology project relies, its objectives or the application for
which it is developed.
Although conceptual and linguistic aspects of terms are recognized as being
necessary, less work has been carried out on their linguistic properties and
their formal representation. Which linguistic properties should be represented?
Which theoretical model is better adapted to terminological needs? How can
linguistic properties of terms - especially lexico-semantic aspects - be
implemented in terminology applications? All these questions must be addressed
and resolved when processing specialized texts and representing knowledge.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in linguistic
approaches - especially lexico-semantic aspects - to the description of terms.
This workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss issues of a fundamental
nature (e.g., the modelling of meaning or the definition of sets of lexical
relationships) as well as applied work dealing with the acquisition of lexical
aspects of terms or their representation in formal structures.

Topics
- Use of lexical semantics models (e.g. Semantic Frames, Generative Lexicon,
Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology, Functional-Lexematic Model) in
terminological descriptions
- Combination of concept-based and lexico-semantic approaches in terminological
descriptions
- Modelling of lexical relationships (paradigmatic and syntagmatic), specialized
meaning, sense distinctions, argument structure, multilingual terminological data
- Implementation of lexical descriptions of terms in terminological databases,
dictionaries, ontologies and other formal knowledge representations
- Use of lexical descriptions of terms in computer applications
- Automatic or semi-automatic identification of lexical relationships,
collocations and other lexical aspects of terms in specialized corpora

Submissions
Submissions (in English or French) should take the format of a short paper of no
more than 10 pages in length. Format guidelines will be available shortly on the
workshop website (a submission web site will be set up soon).

Important Dates
Submission deadline: March 1, 2009
Notification of acceptance: April 1, 2009
Final version due: May 1, 2009
Workshop: June 19, 2009

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2008 

Meeting Description:

The focus of this meeting will be on how experience and variation shape
learning; how they shape the paths that children follow, the mechanisms they
rely on, and our understanding of what they need to learn to attain adult-like
skills in using language. We will focus on models and mechanisms of learning. We
welcome abstracts that look at any level of linguistic representation (e.g.
sounds, words, constructions, discourse). 

Call For Papers

Experience and Variation in Learning a First Language

(Child Language Research Forum 33, July 10-12, 2009, to be held during the
Linguistic Society of America's Summer Institute, UC Berkeley)

Recent developments in first language acquisition research have deepened our
knowledge about how learners approach the task of acquisition.  The focus of
this meeting will be on how experience and variation shape learning; how they
shape the paths that children follow, the mechanisms they rely on, and our
understanding of what they need to learn to attain adult-like skills in using
language. We welcome abstracts that look at any level of linguistic
representation (e.g. sounds, words, constructions, discourse).  

Invited Speakers:    
William Croft , University of New Mexico, and  Thomas Griffiths, UC Berkeley

We are soliciting papers in any of these areas:

Mechanisms of learning. 
- The role of variation in input (speaker-related, language-related,  
context-related)
- The role of frequency, familiarity, size of units
- Extracting statistical regularities from input
- Cue detection and integration 

Models of learning
- Capturing linguistic knowledge (exemplar models, connectionist networks,
Bayesian models, etc.) 

Different paths in learning
- Individual differences (Cognitive and input related)
- Cross-linguistic differences

Abstracts should be no more than 500 words, with up-to one additional page for
examples and references. We are only soliciting abstracts for oral presentation.
Abstracts should be sent to clrf09@gmail.com as a pdf file, using the name of
the first author as the file name (e.g. clark.pdf).  

Submission deadline: December 31st, 2008 

Contact information: Inbal Arnon, inbalar@stanford.edu

Website: Under construction, the url will be posted shortly under the conference
information at http://lsa2009.berkeley.edu/Events.html
