First International Workshop on=20
Conceptual Modelling for Life Sciences Applications (CMLSA 2007)
Auckland (New Zealand) -- November 5-9, 2007

Dear Colleague,

We are pleased to invite submission of your work to CMLSA 2007.=20
(http://er2007.massey.ac.nz/cmlsa07/)

Our workshop takes place in conjunction with the Twenty-Sixth =
International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2007).
CMLSA 2007 aims to bring together researchers with an interest in the =
interplay of conceptual modelling and life sciences, to discuss ideas =
and findings, to share research experiences, to promote collaboration =
and to identify directions for future research.

Please find the Call for Papers below. Submission of full papers is due =
on May 11, 2007.
We will be also grateful to you for advertising CMLSA 2007 and inviting =
your colleagues and/or research students to submit their work.

We hope to meet you in Auckland.
Best regards,

Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen and Sven Hartmann
CMLSA 2007 Programme Chairs

First International Workshop on=20
Conceptual Modelling for Life Sciences Applications (CMLSA 2007)
Auckland (New Zealand) -- November 5-9, 2007

Call for Papers
http://er2007.massey.ac.nz/cmlsa07/

Life Sciences applications typically involve large volumes of data of =
various kinds and a multiplicity of software tools for managing, =
analysing and interpreting them. There are many challenging problems in =
the processing of life sciences data that require effective support by =
novel theories, methods and technologies. Conceptual modelling is the =
key for developing high-performance information systems that put these =
theories, methods and technologies into practice. The fast growing =
interest in life sciences applications calls for special attention on =
resource integration and collaborative efforts in information systems =
development.=20

The primary objective of the workshop is to share research experiences =
in conceptual modelling for applications in life sciences and to =
identify new issues and directions for future research in relevant =
areas, including bioinformatics, health informatics, medical and =
veterinary informatics. The workshop invites authors to submit original =
papers exploring the usage of conceptual modelling ideas and techniques =
for developing and improving life sciences databases and information =
systems.=20

Topics of Interest=20
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to (as long as they are =
related to new research approaches in the intersection of conceptual =
modelling and life sciences):=20
  a.. Conceptual modelling for biological and laboratory information =
systems;=20
  b.. Conceptual modelling for analysis tools in bioinformatics;=20
  c.. Conceptual modelling for health information systems;=20
  d.. Conceptual modelling for medical and veterinary information =
systems;=20
  e.. Life sciences databases, data exchange and data distribution;=20
  f.. Data representation and visualisation;=20
  g.. Life sciences ontologies and taxonomies;=20
  h.. Data, process and application integration in life sciences;=20
  i.. Data warehousing and data mining;=20
  j.. Privacy and security in life sciences applications;=20
  k.. Electronic health records;=20
  l.. Reuse and reengineering of life sciences applications; and=20
  m.. Collaborative and open source software development in life =
sciences.=20
Paper Submission=20
Formatting Guidelines=20
CMLSA 2007 proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS =
series. Thus, authors must submit manuscripts using the Springer-Verlag =
LNCS style for Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The page limit for =
workshop papers in LNCS format is 10 pages.=20

Submission Guidelines=20
Submission to CMLSA 2007 will be electronically only. Authors are asked =
to create a submission system account first. Subsequently, this account =
can be used to submit one or more abstracts and upload corresponding =
papers.
