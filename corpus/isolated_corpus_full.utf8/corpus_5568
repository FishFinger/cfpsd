                   18th International Conference on
               Applications of Declarative Programming
                       and Knowledge Management

                         November 5-7, 2009
                          Evora, Portugal

                  http://www.di.uevora.pt/inap2009/
                    http://inap.dialogengines.com/
     ------------------------------------------------------------

  Organized by the Portuguese AI Society (APPIA), the INAP Committee
           and the Society of Logic Programming (GLP e.V.)

== Overview ==

  Declarative Programming is a family of advanced paradigms for the
  modeling and solving of complex problems.  These specification and
  implementation methods have attracted more and more attention over
  the past years, e.g. in the domains of databases and natural
  language processing, for modeling and the processing of
  combinatorial problems, and for establishing systems for the web.

== INAP 2009 ==

  INAP is a communicative and dense forum for intensive discussion of
  applications of important technologies related to Prolog, Logic and
  Constraint Programming as well as closely related advanced software.
  It comprehensively covers the impact of programmable logic solvers
  in the Internet Society, its underlying technologies, and leading
  edge applications in industry, commerce, government, and societal
  services.

  INAP 2009 continues a tradition of successful workshops cast around
  the applications of declarative programming, which were held in
  Kobe (1997), Tokyo (1995, 1996, 1998 - 2001), Potsdam (2004),
  Fukuoka (2005) and Wuerzburg (2007).

  We invite the submission of high quality papers on the described
  topics, especially, but not exclusively, on different aspects of
  Declarative Programming, Constraint Processing and Knowledge
  Management as well as their use for Distributed Systems and the Web:

- Knowledge Management,
  e.g. Data Mining, Decision Support, Deductive Databases
- Distributed Systems and the Web,
  e.g. Agents and Concurrent Engineering, Semantic Web
- Constraints,
  e.g. Constraint Systems, Extensions of Constraint (Logic) Programming
- Theoretical Foundations,
  e.g. Deductive Databases, Nonmonotonic Reasoning
- Systems and Tools for Academic and Industrial Use
- Knowledge-based Web Services - Logic Solvers and Applications

== Workshop Format ==

  The technical program of the workshop will include invited
  presentations (to be announced), regular technical sessions with
  presentations of the accepted papers, system demonstrations and a
  panel discussion.


== Conference Venue ==

  The conference will be held at the University of Evora, Portugal
  in November 5-7, 2009.

  Evora is a nice and quiet historical city located in the south of
  Portugal that can be reached from Lisbon by train or coach in under
  2 hours.  It is a small city of 60.000 inhabitants, 120 km inland
  from Lisbon and classified by Unesco as World Heritage.  The
  University of Evora was established in the 16th Century and is the
  2nd oldest Portuguese University.

  The social program is promising since the region is very rich in
  historical sites (Stone Age, Roman, Medieval and Renaissance
  remains) and also offers a very special gastronomy.  See
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vora for more information.

== Important Dates ==

  Paper Submission Deadline:       July 13, 2009 (EXTENDED!)
  Notifications to Authors:        August 17, 2009
  Camera-ready Version Deadline:   September 14, 2009
  INAP 2009 Workshop:              November 5-7, 2009

== Submission Guidelines ==

  Participants should submit a paper (maximum 15 pages, PDF format),
  describing their work in topics relevant to the workshop.  Accepted
  papers will be presented during the workshop.  At least one author
  of an accepted contribution is expected to register for the
  workshop, and present the paper.  All submissions should include the
  author's name(s), affiliation, complete mailing address, and email
  address.

  Authors are requested to prepare their submissions, following the
  LNCS/LNAI Springer format. Please see:
      http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
  for further details.

  The submission should be submitted through the electronic submission
  site:
        http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inap2009

  The deadline for receipt of submissions is July 13, 2009.  Papers
  received after this date will not be reviewed.  Eligible papers will
  be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.
  Authors will be notified via email of the results by August 17,
  2009.  Authors of accepted papers are expected to improve their
  paper based on reviewers' comments and to send a camera ready
  version of their manuscripts by September 14, 2009.

  Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which
  will be distributed to the participants.

  As in previous editions, we plan to publish selected papers in a
  proceedings volume in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial
  Intelligence (LNAI) series.
