              Second Call For Papers for the Workshop on

    Interfaces of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning
                            (IICALL 2006)

                      http://purl.org/net/iicall

        Preceded by Three Pre-Workshop Courses, December 14-16
         Department of Linguistics, The Ohio State University


                   SUBMISSION DEADLINE: NOVEMBER 20


Research  in  Intelligent  Computer-Aided  Language  Learning  (ICALL)
integrates natural language  processing into a computer-aided language
learning environment.  For such  research to be innovative, successful
and  sustainable, it  arguably needs  to combine  linguistic modeling,
second language acquisition  research (learner and activity modeling),
and pedagogical  insights from foreign  language teaching (instruction
modeling) with representations and computational linguistic algorithms
capable of integrating the information from these models.

The  current state of  the art  in the  various relevant  fields seems
favorable  for interdisciplinary  ICALL  research.  Complementing  the
focus on communication and  culture in foreign language teaching since
the  60s,  second language  acquisition  research  since  the 90s  has
clearly established  that awareness of language  categories, forms and
rules---and  thus linguistic  modeling  and the  processing needed  to
identify  those  properties---is important  for  an  adult learner  to
successfully  acquire a  foreign  language.  At  the  same time,  most
research  groups  currently  lack the  interdisciplinary  orientation,
background, or ties  needed to develop and combine  the linguistic and
learner/cognitive  modeling  with  computational  processing,  and  to
develop  and test intelligent  tutoring systems  as part  of real-life
language teaching.

The  IICALL workshop  and  the pre-workshop  courses  are intended  to
foster exchange and in-depth discussion of these interfaces of ICALL.


--- PRE-WORKSHOP COURSES ---

The courses on Dec 14-16 will  be held by three leading researchers in
the area of ICALL and its interfaces:

- Kathleen McCoy (U. Delaware), on NLP and Learner Modeling for ICALL

- Susan Bull (U. Birmingham), on Open Learner Models

- Eckhard Bick  (VISL, Southern  Denmark U.), on  ICALL in  support of
  Language Awareness


--- WORKSHOP ---

The  workshop on  Dec 17  will consist  of 20+8  minute presentations,
selected from the submitted abstracts.

You  are  invited to  submit  one-page  abstracts describing  research
related to ICALL. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

   . Learner and/or instruction models for ICALL
   . ICALL tools to promote language awareness
   . Activity design for ICALL systems
   . Transferability of SLA research results to an ICALL setting
   . ICALL to collect data for SLA research
   . Evaluation of ICALL tools in foreign language teaching settings
   . Integration of ICALL into foreign language teaching curricula
   . ICALL system architecture
   . Re-use of NLP resources for ICALL
   . NLP techniques for ICALL
   . Feedback generation in ICALL
  
Discussions of work  in progress are welcome -  PhD students and other
young researchers are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

- Format: one page abstract (plus references/figures)

- Submit the abstract in PDF format to both of the organizers: 
      Luiz Amaral <amaral.1@osu.edu>
      Detmar Meurers <meurers.1@osu.edu>

- Deadline for submissions:   Monday, November 20
- Notification of acceptance: Friday, November 24
- Workshop takes place on:    Sunday, December 17


The event will  be held at the Ohio  State University, Columbus, Ohio.
Participation in the workshop and the pre-workshop courses is free.

We  are grateful  to  the Ohio  State  College of  Humanities and  the
Department  of Linguistics  for financial  support under  the Targeted
Investment in  Excellence initiative for  the Cross-disciplinary study
of Language.
