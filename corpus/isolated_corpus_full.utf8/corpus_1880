Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2007 

Meeting Description:

Multidisciplinary Approaches to Discourse 2008 (MAD 08) is the seventh in a
series of small-scale, high-quality workshops that have been organised 
(approx.) every second year since 1995. Its aim is to bring together
researchers from different linguistic disciplines to exchange information
and learn from each other on a common topic of investigation. The theme of
MAD 08 is 'Linearisation and Segmentation in Discourse'. 

Call for Papers (2nd call)

Language as well as other forms of communication are inseparably tied to some
kind of linear-sequential form of presentation, due to the linear-sequential
nature of the media on which they operate. Linearisation in its turn presupposes
segmentation, i.e. decisions concerning the size and type of units to be brought
into a sequential order at various levels. In written and spoken language, for
example, it has to be decided whether a piece of information can and should be
realised as a word, a phrase, a clause, a (complex) sentence or even as a
sentence sequence or paragraph. And the relevant units have to be arranged in a
certain order that is determined - in part, at least - by the rules of grammar
but also - at higher levels of discourse - by other principles. We are
interested in identifying and defining such principles. What principles govern
the segmentation of the information to be (explicitly) conveyed? What do the
minimal discourse units look like, which kinds of complex structure do they
build and how are these structures separated from each other?

We invite contributions on topics and questions such as the following (the list
may be extended):

- Discourse units and segmentation:

-  Which are the (minimal) units of discourse, and how are they marked and
separated from each other? For example, which role does punctuation play in
written discourse, and pauses and intonation in spoken language?

- Linearisation and its relation to nonlinear linguistic and conceptual  structures:

-  How are linear sequences of discourse units mapped onto complex (potentially
hierarchical) conceptual structures? (Perception perspective)

-  How are complex (potentially hierarchical) conceptual structures mapped onto
linear sequences of discourse units? (Production perspective)

-  How do notions like salience, discourse prominence,
foreground(ing)/background(ing) etc. relate to linearity?

- Cohesion / coherence and linearity

- Perspective and linearisation:

-  Perspective and subjectivity in discourse: How is information presented and
what is the role of relations ''in the world'' relative to the order of
presentation by the speaker?

-  How do the linguistic notions of perspective relate to perspective in other
media?
 
 - Linearisation and segmentation across languages:

-  To what extend do (the grammars of) different languages impose different
constraints on linearisation and segmentation?

-  What are the implications for multilingual activities such as translation or
multilingual text generation?

- Linearisation and segmentation in different media:

- in electronic media such as e-mail and chat

- in media combining language and pictures, e.g., film, cartoons

- in music (with and without language)

Keynote speakers:

- Thomas Pechmann (Univ. of Leipzig) on ''Linearisation and segmentation  in
music (and language)'' (preliminary title)
- Russell S. Tomlin (Univ. of Oregon) on ''Attention and time: temporal  phasing
in event representations and language production'' (preliminary  title)
- Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen (Univ. of Oslo) on ''Segmentation and linearization
from a cross-linguistic perspective'' (preliminary title)

Workshop location:

The workshop and lodging will be at Lysebu, a conference center in the middle of
one of Oslo's major skiing areas (for cross-country as well as down-hill) which
is accessible by public transport.

Attendance:

Following the tradition of the earlier workshops, the total number of
participants will be limited to (approx.) 30 persons. Speakers of accepted
papers are automatically granted a place; the remaining ones are assigned on a
first-come-first-serve basis.

Abstract submission:

We invite extended abstracts in PDF, RTF or Word format. Papers must not be
longer than ten pages (including figures and references), using 12 pt font, 1.5
line spacing, with 2.5 cm margins on all sides. Please include your name,
affiliation and e-mail address at the top of the page, directly below the title.
All abstracts will be reviewed  by members of the program committee. For final
versions of accepted papers, precise formatting instructions (for Word) will be
issued.

Send your submission By October 1st to mad-08@ilos.uio.no

With previous workshops in the series, selected papers have later been published
in special issues of journals or as an edited volume in a relevant series (e.g.,
for the 2005 workshop: M. Grabski et al. (eds.) ''Salience. Multidisciplinary
perspectives on its function in discourse'', to appear in the Mouton-de Gruyter
series 'Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs' [TiLSM]). We are planning
on following this approach for MAD 08 as well.

Bergljot Behrens (University of Oslo, Norway)
Liesbeth Degand (Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium)
Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen (University of Oslo, Norway)
Alistair Knott (University of Otago)
