Full Title: Journal of Evolutionary Psychology 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Oct-2009 

Call for papers for a special issue of the Journal of Evolutionary
Psychology on the evolution of language 

In 1990 Pinker and Bloom published a now famous article in which they
argued the adaptationist case that language evolved for the purposes of
communication. Their paper triggered a resurgence of interest in the
origins and evolution of language that remains ongoing. To mark its 20th
anniversary, the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology will publish a special
issue in 2010 on the evolution of language. 

The aims of the special issue are to further explore what the adaptationist
approach can tell us about language, broadly conceived, and to identify key
research questions for the future. Substantive contributions from any
relevant discipline are welcome. Papers that present new empirical data or
formal (i.e. mathematical or computational) theoretical contributions,
and/or which relate findings in evolutionary psychology to issues within
linguistics, are particularly encouraged. Papers focused on speculative
discussion of selective scenarios are discouraged. 

Pinker, S. and Bloom, P. (1990) Natural language and natural selection.
Behavioral and Brain Sciences 13(4), p.707-784

Guest editor: Thom Scott-Phillips

The deadline for submissions is 31st October. This will not be extended.
Manuscripts should be submitted at the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology's
online submission page, where instructions for manuscript preparation can
also be found: http://www.editorialmanager.com/jep
