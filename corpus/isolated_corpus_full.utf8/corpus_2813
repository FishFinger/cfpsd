Meeting Description:

Sixth International Workshop on Writing Systems
Typology of Writing Systems
Braunschweig (Germany), September 18 - 19, 2008 

2nd Call for Participation 

German Department, University of Braunschweig (Germany), September 18 - September 19, 2008. 

This workshop offers a forum of discussion between researchers from different fields of research on writing (e.g. theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, applied linguistics, computational linguistics), from different countries and working on different languages. Its predecessors took place at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen (Netherlands) with a focus on 'What Spelling Changes' (1997), 'Writing Language' (2000), and 'Constraints on Spelling Changes' (2006), in Cologne (Germany) on the topic 'From Letter to Sound' (2002), and in Antwerp (Belgium) focusing on 'Mapping Graphemes onto Phonemes' (2004). See the website of the Association of Written Language and Literacy for further information: http://www2.ru.nl/WrittenLanguage. 

The aim of this series of workshops is to focus on various aspects of scientific research of written language. In particular, we welcome submissions addressing: 
- theoretical approaches that try to capture the systematic character of one specific writing system or of different writing systems in comparison. 
- psycholinguistic research on the influence of deep or more surface orthographies on pronunciation and morphological awareness, on learning to read and spell, and on dysfunctions in reading and spelling. 
- research evaluating alternative spelling methods, within one language, or across languages, taking not only the perspective of the writer, but also addressing the question how (different) writing systems take the reader's perspective into account when representing the sounds of a language. 
- computational models that shed light on the relation between sounds on the one hand, and letters, graphemes, diacritics and punctuation on the other hand. 

The topic of the present workshop, Typology of Writing Systems, is related to one of the central aims of the Association of Written Language and Literacy, namely to enhance our understanding of similarities and differences among the many writing systems that are used throughout the world. Therefore we are especially interested in typological approaches that may stem from different research backgrounds like theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, or computational linguistics. 

Submission deadline: May 2, 2008 
Notice of acceptance: June 2, 2008 

A selection of papers of the workshop will be published as special issue of the journal 'Written Language and Literacy'. 

Invited Speakers: William J. Poser (University of British Columbia and Yinka Dene Language Institute, Canada) and Rebecca Treiman (Washington University in St. Louis, USA) 

Scientific Committee: Susanne Borgwaldt and Martin Neef (German Department, University of Braunschweig), Anneke Neijt (Radboud University Nijmegen), Beatrice Primus (German Department, University of Cologne), and Dominiek Sandra (Centre for Psycholinguistics, University of Antwerp). 

Format of Submissions: Authors should submit abstracts of max. 1 page. Speakers will have 30 minutes for their presentation, and 15 minutes for discussion and questions. Please submit abstracts electronically (rtf, pdf or Word) to Susanne Borgwaldt at s.borgwaldt@tu-bs.de. 

Participation: Researchers who want to attend the workshop without presenting a paper are also invited. Such participants should register at the address above, s.borgwaldt@tu-bs.de. Information on lodging and travel directions, as well as a program with the abstracts of the accepted papers will be circulated electronically well before the workshop. 

Further Information: Martin Neef: Martin.Neef@tu-bs.de 

Local Organizing Committee: Susanne Borgwaldt, Torsten Fiebig, Iris Forster, Tobias Heinz and Martin Neef.

Linguistic Field(s): Neurolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 15-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

The SoA conferences are intended to bring together senior and junior scientists working in the multidisciplinary field of neurocognition of language and dealing with normal function as well as disorders. The size of the conference with a maximum of 100 participants ensures direct interaction between the participants. 

Call for Papers

SoA9 invites abstract submissions with a focus on the neurocognition of language. Abstracts for presentation must be in English, should not exceed 1000 words, and should contain information about the research question, the design of the study, the results including the data and a discussion of the results.

All abstracts will be refereed by members of the scientific organizing committee.

Contributed papers are planned in the form of short oral presentations (10+5 min) and poster sessions. Poster sessions start with brief oral presentations of the highlights of each poster (max. 5 min) and with ample time for discussion.

All abstracts must be submitted online via www.soa-online.com
