Call For Papers

   For: LANGUAGE  FORUM: A JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
   (Vol. 35, No. 2, July-Dec 2009)

   Special Number on CORPUS LINGUISTICS

   Within the last few decades we have experienced a global upsurge for 
generating language corpus of various types to be directly accessed in 
various domains of mainstream linguistics, applied linguistics, and 
language technology. This gives birth to Corpus Linguistics - a new area 
of linguistic research that can challenge our so-long-practiced 
traditional linguistics. However, generation and utilization of corpora 
are interfaced with several theoretical and practical problems that need 
to be addressed properly before linguistic data and information stored in 
corpora are utilized properly. Since most of the issues related to Corpus 
Linguistics are not yet addressed properly with equal emphasis to all the 
language types, an issue of Language Forum, a peer reviewed international 
Journal, has been planned on Corpus Linguistics thus.

   Hence, we invite original research papers related (not restricted) to the 
following broad areas:

   ·         Corpus generation (speech corpus, text corpus, multimodal corpus, 
special corpus, etc.)
   ·         Corpus classification and visualization
   ·         Statistical analysis of corpus data
   ·         Exploratory analysis corpus data
   ·         Text corpus encoding and annotation
   ·         Tool-based digital corpus editing
   ·         Part-of-speech and morpho-syntactic tagging
   ·         Lemmatisation
   ·         Text processing (concordance, key-word-in-context study, parsing, 
etc.)
   ·         Annotation (grammatical, semantic, anaphoric, discoursal)
   ·         Methodology and usage study for corpus data analysis
   ·         Corpus and mainstream linguistics
   ·         Corpus and natural language processing
   ·         Corpus and applied linguistics
   ·         Corpus and machine translation
   ·         Corpus and culture studies

   The papers pertaining to the areas mentioned above should be submitted 
electronically (both in PDF and DOC format) to the Guest Editor/Editors, at 
their contact addresses given below not later than 30th June 2008.

   Papers should not exceed 7500 words and should be preceded by an abstract of 
200-250 words. The title, the name(s) and full mailing address(es) of the 
author(s), including e-mail addresses, should appear on the first page of the 
manuscript

   The editors will select contributions for the special issue and notify 
authors of acceptance or otherwise once reports are received from the reviewers 
not later than 30th Sep 2008.

   All papers submitted to Language Forum - LF should be original, neither 
having been previously published nor being considered elsewhere at the time of 
submission

   Manuscripts should be in conformity with the Language Forum format, which can 
be made available on request.
