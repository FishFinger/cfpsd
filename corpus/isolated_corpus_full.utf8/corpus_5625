Meeting Description:

34th International LAUD Symposium Cognitive Sociolinguistics Language Varia=
tion
in Its Structural, Conceptual and Cultural Dimensions

Location:

University of Koblenz-Landau,
Landau/Pf., Germany

Date:
March 15-18, 2010

Confirmed Speakers:

Main Keynote Speaker:

William Labov (University of Pennsylvania)

Title:

The Community as the Focus of Social Cognition

Plenary Speakers:=20

Dirk Geeraerts (University of Leuven)
Stefan Gries (Santa Barbara, University of California)
Peter Harder (University of Copenhagen)
Gitte Kristiansen (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)
David Kronenfeld (Riverside, University of California)
Dennis R. Preston (Oklahoma State University)
Aim and Scope:

Within Cognitive Linguistics and other cognitively oriented approaches to
language there is a growing interest for language variation in all its
dimensions, as witnessed by several publications, most recently by the
landmark-fixing collective volume Cognitive Sociolinguistics (2008), edited=
 by
Gitte Kristiansen and Ren=E9 Dirven.

In the past decades, linguistic analyses within Cognitive Linguistics or ot=
her
cognitively oriented theories were all too often carried out at the level o=
f 'a
general, uniform language', disregarding the rich and complex patterns of
intralingual and communicative variation in that language. Such a shallow l=
evel
of granularity ultimately amounts to that of a homogeneous and thus idealiz=
ed
speech community, reminiscent of Chomsky's ideal speaker-hearer. To the ext=
ent
that Cognitive Linguistics takes its claim of being a usage-based approach =
to
language and cognition seriously, it cannot continue to work with an implic=
itly
assumed conception of language being situated taxonomically at an almost
Chomskyan level of abstraction.=20

Cognitive Sociolinguistic research fills this gap in an enriched manner, by
combining the CL theoretical framework with the empirical methods used in
sociolinguistics and social science at large.

The LAUD symposium is planning to explore the different facets of this emer=
ging
coalescence between cognitive, usage-based approaches to language and a
sociolinguistic interest in language-internal variation in 4 theme sessions=
,
each addressing one of the following questions:

1. How do social and cognitive perspectives fit together in a general,=20
overall model of language?=20
2. To what extent is usage-based language variation socially structured, an=
d how
is such language-internal variation represented in the individual language
user's (implicit or explicit) knowledge?
3. How does language-internal variation affect the conceptual aspects of
85language, i.e. linguistic meaning and linguistic categorization?5
4. How does language variation interact with cultural models in a linguisti=
c
community? Does language variation follow from cultural models, or just ref=
lect
them or, on the contrary, determine them?=20

Call for Papers:

Call Deadline:
July 15, 2009

Theme Session 1:=20

Social factors as foundational issues in a theory of language:

The first session examines the role of social factors in the conception of=
=20
language as such: to what extent should the social nature of language play =
a
role in the linguist's conception of the linguistic system - and in the
individual language user's acquisition and knowledge of the language? If we
abandon the simplification of an ideal speaker-hearer, what are the descrip=
tive
consequences: what models and methodologies should we use to get a grip on =
the
interaction between social usage and individual knowledge of the language? =
In
the context of this theme, we invite abstracts on topics like the following=
:

-The social status of linguistic facts
-Variability and the linguistic system
-Linguistic norms, rules and behavior
-The ideal and the real speaker-hearer
-Situated cognition and the distribution of (linguistic) knowledge
-Social and individual usage: models, methods and research questions
-The treatment of social factors and variation in the history of (cognitive=
)
linguistics

Theme Session 2:=20

Structural variation from a usage-based perspective:

How are lectal variation, linguistic change, and language acquisition affec=
ted
by taking a usage-based approach to language ? Usage-based and meaning-base=
d
models of grammar introduce more variation into the grammar than a rule-bas=
ed
approach tends to do: the language-internal or discourse-related factors th=
at
influence the use of a particular construction may be manifold, and the pre=
sence
or absence of a construction is not an all-or-none matter. In the analysis =
of
this type of variation, it often appears that the variation is co-determine=
d by
'external', sociostylistic factors: the variation that appears in actual us=
age
(e.g. as attested in corpora) may be determined simultaneously by grammatic=
al,
discursive, and socio-stylistic factors. Furthermore, awareness (of linguis=
tic
factors and social dimensions) also plays a role in successful=20
conceptualisation, together with structured patterns of subjective and obje=
ctive
perception. In the context of this theme, we invite abstracts on topics lik=
e the
following:

-Cognitive linguistics and sociolinguistics
-Cognitive linguistics and dialectology
-Cognitive linguistics and stylistics
-Cognitive linguistics and discourse analysis
-Linguistic variation and multidimensional research
-Usage-based mechanisms of language change
-Exemplar-based models of language variation
-Lectal and interactional factors in language acquisition
-Perceptual dialectology and production
-Subjective and objective linguistic distances
-Language attitude research and quantitative data
-Linguistic variation and varieties: expert analysis versus folk perception
-Folk perception of bilingualism and multilingualism

Theme Session 3:=20

Conceptual variation in language-internal and cross-linguistic categorizati=
on
preferences:

To what extent do the phenomena that we typically focus on in Cognitive
Linguistics and other meaning-related approaches - phenomena involving mean=
ing
and categorization - exhibit variation within the same linguistic community=
?
Both the concept of semantic flexibility (as in prototype theory and radial
networks) and the concept of cultural models played an important role in th=
e
emergence of Cognitive Linguistics, but this usage-based variation of meani=
ng
and categorization is not standardly analyzed from a socio-stylistic point =
of
view. In the context of this theme, we invite abstracts on topics like the
following:

-Lectal variation of cognitive models and metaphorical mappings
-Lectal variation within prototype-based structures and radial networks
-Prototypes, stereotypes, and the division of linguistic labour
-Intralinguistic semantic conflicts and their resolution
-The relation between language variation and cognition within a single lang=
uage
-Dialectal and sociolectal variation of meaning
-Styles and registers as categories of meaning
-The linguistic construal of identities as meaning creation
-Social cognition, social categorization and interactional sociolinguistics

Theme Session 4:=20

Cultural models and cultural variation of cognitive models:

Within Cognitive Linguistic research on cognitive models, there is a creati=
ve
tension between scholars emphasizing the universal aspects of cognitive mod=
els
and those pointing to the historical and cultural variability of such model=
s.
But the variability is often considered from a cross-cultural perspective o=
nly,
without specific attention for the language-internal or culture-internal
variability of cultural models. So, how does variability of cultural and
cognitive models work within a community, and how does it interact with
variability of language and language use? In particular, what are the cultu=
ral
models that people use to think about language variation and language-relat=
ed
social variation? In the context of this theme, we invite abstracts on topi=
cs
like the following:

-Cultural models and their interaction with Idealized Cognitive Models
-Universalism and (historical, cultural, anthropological) variability of
cognitive models
-Competition and conflict between cultural models
-Cultural models and ideology
-Critical-linguistic approaches such as Critical Cognitive Linguistics, and
cognitively inspired Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)
-Cultural models of social variation
-Cultural models of language variation, and their consequences for language
planning and language policy
-Language-based social stereotyping
