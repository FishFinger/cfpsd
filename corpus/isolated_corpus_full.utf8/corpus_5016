Workshop: Biomedical Information Extraction
http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009/biomedicalIE=20

In conjunction with the 7th International Conference
Recent Advances on Natural Language Processing RANLP-2009, 14-16
September 2009


Undoubtly, the availability of information for biomedicine in an
electronic format has been rapidly increasing. The Medical Literature
Analysis and Retrieval system (Medline) houses millions of biomedical
scientific literature publications. PubMed offers the power of a search
engine for accessing the Medline content. On the other hand, the
electronization of clinical data within the Electronic Medical Record
(EMR) provides another powerful source for information extraction.
Access to integrated information is critical for health care
improvement, research, and the overall science of healthcare delivery
and personalized medicine. Information extraction from the scientific
literature is distinct from information extraction from the clinical
narrative as these two types of genre have their own stylistic
characteristics and pose different methodological challenges. In
addition, biomedical information spans multiple languages thus
necessitating methods for multi-lingual information extraction.=20

In addition to the biomedical scientific literature and clinical data,
the large number of health-related web resources is increasing day by
day. The content of these resources is very variable and difficult to
assess. Furthermore, the number of people searching for health-related
information is also increasing. The development of tools to support the
process of describing the content of medical web resources with
meta-data that facilitate their retrieval, and with quality labels by
certified authorities, is crucial for the delivery of content of better
quality to health information consumers. Multi-lingual information
extraction has a significant role to play there also.=20

The focus of this workshop is natural language processing and
information extraction for biomedicine, including scientific and
clinical free-text as well as health-related web resources within one or
many languages. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
*	Natural language processing techniques for basic tasks, e.g.
sentence boundary detection, tokenization, part of speech tagging,
shallow parsing and deep parsing. Evaluation and comparison with the
general domain;
*	Efforts to create sharable biomedical lexical resources,
including the annotation of biomedical data for linguistic and domain
events;
*	Biomedical named entity recognition;
*	Methods for higher level biomedical language processing, e.g.
relation discovery, temporal relation discovery, anaphoric relation
discovery;
*	Terminology/ontology biomedical named entity mapping;
*	Integrated knowledge management of scientific and clinical
free-text data
*	Knowledge representation and management technologies (e.g. OWL,
RDF, Annotation Schemas, etc.) that enable the creation of
machine-processable descriptions of health-related web resources
*	Content collection and information extraction techniques that
allow the quality labeling of web resources and the continuous
monitoring of already labeled ones
*	Multi-lingual information extraction

Important dates:
*	Submission deadline: 6 June 2009
*	Notification of acceptance: 20 July 2009
*	Camera-ready copy due from authors: 24 August 2009
*	Workshop: 17 or 18 September 2009

Submission instructions:
Submissions should be A4, two-column format and should not exceed seven
pages including cover page, figures, tables and references. The workshop
papers should follow the RANLP format which is available at the RANLP
website http://www.lml.bas.bg/ranlp2009 in the Second Call for Papers.
Papers should be submitted electronically in *PDF* format using the
conference submission system START. Detailed instructions about the
workshop submission will be announced at the workshop website.

Review and multiple submission policy
The review process is anonymous. The paper text should not reveal the
authors identity. To maintain the submissions, all authors' names and
addresses should be registered in the START system when the paper is
submitted; this information will be open for the workshop organizers
only. Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Programme
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines regarding
how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers for inclusion in
the proceedings. The full workshop proceedings will be distributed at
the event. The workshop papers will be included in the ACL Anthology.=20

The workshop calls for articles describing original research. Authors
may submit the same paper at several events. In this case they must
notify the organizers in a separate mail to [savova dot guergana at mayo
dot edu], to inform them that the paper might be withdrawn depending on
the selections at some other event.=20

Organizing committee:
Guergana Savova, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota,
USA
Vangelis Karkaletsis, Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications,
Athens, Greece
Galia Angelova, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria

Programme committee (to be announced in the second Call for Papers)

Workshop venue:
The workshop will be held at the Samokov Hotel in the resort of Borovets
as a post-conference event of RANLP-09. The picturesque resort of
Borovets is located in the Rila mountains and is one of the best known
winter resorts in South-East Europe, a frequent venue for world skiing
events. The resort is 1350 m above sea level, at the foot of the highest
peak on the Balkan Peninsula - Moussala (2925 m). The resort of Borovets
is 73 km from Sofia and the International airport of Sofia can serve as
an arrival/departure point. In addition to regular public transport, the
organizers will provide daily shuttle buses from Sofia airport to the
Samokov hotel at an inexpensive rate. A taxi from Sofia to Borovets is
relatively cheap; it is also possible to take a taxi from the
International airport in Sofia to the workshop venue.
