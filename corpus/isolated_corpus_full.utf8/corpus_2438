Meeting Description
The workshop addresses naming strategies and word formation in a contrastive
perspective. 

It is widely assumed in morphological theory that word formation is a device for
creating names whereas the function of syntax is to describe entities.
Compounds, being part of word formation, are often thought to have a
classificatory meaning and therefore a naming function. However, it is by no
means the case that all entities that we might like to name are denoted by a
compound, because there are many syntactic constructions which obviously
function as names. The focus of this workshop is on compounds and corresponding
syntactic constructions with regard to the naming function.

Abstracts should not exceed 500 words of text (excluding references). Abstracts
should be submitted electronically to the following address:

Submission deadline: March 31st, 2008. Notification of acceptance: May 15th, 2008.
