Call for Papers

Semantics of Clause-Combining
http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/esslli08/
August 11-15, 2008

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and
Information ESSLLI 2008
(http://www.illc.uva.nl/ESSLLI2008/), 
4 - 15 August, 2008 in Hamburg, Germany

Workshop Organizers: Uli Sauerland, esslli08@zas.gwz-berlin.de

Workshop Purpose:
Clause combining is on the border between semantics and pragmatics. The
semantics of clause combining has progressed in several key areas in recent
years: the description of perspective shift in various languages, the discovery
of several semantic and syntactic constraints on shifts in subordinated and
otherwise dependent clauses; the development of formal models of inter-clausal
discourse relations like SDRT; and the innovation of new relations between
speech act operators and clause combining. Nevertheless, many questions still
remain, especially concerning the difference in expressibility between
coordination and subordination and indicated vs. un-indicated discourse
relations. This workshop seeks to make progress on the open questions by
connecting the so far unrelated lines of progress pointed out above.

Submission details: Authors are invited to submit an anonymous abstract.
Submissions should not exceed two pages. The following formats are accepted: PDF
and ASCII text. Please send your submission electronically to email address
esslli08@zas.gwz-berlin.de by the deadline listed below. The text of the email
message should contain the author's full name and affiliation. The submissions
will be reviewed anonymously by the workshop's programme committee. The accepted
papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI.

Workshop format:
The workshop is part of ESSLLI and is open to all ESSLLI participants. It will
consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second
week of ESSLLI. There will be 2 slots for paper presentation and discussion per

Meeting Description

'Perspectives on Slavistics 3' is the third international conference on Slavic
languages and literatures. It will take place in Hamburg, Germany, August 28-31,
2008. The deadline for abstract submission is March 31, 2008. 

First Call for Papers

The Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Hamburg and the Department
of Slavic Studies at the University of Tuebingen are pleased to announce the
Third International ''Perspectives on Slavistics'' Conference. The conference
will take place in Hamburg, Germany, on August 28-31, 2008. The goals of the
conference are to encourage the study of Slavic languages and literatures and to
establish connections among scholars working in these areas. 

So far the following keynote speakers have accepted the invitation to present at
the conference:

- Gerd Hentschel, University of Oldenburg (Germany)
- Mikhail Iampolski, New York University (USA)
- Marek Lazinski, University of Warsaw (Poland)
- Danko Sipka, Arizona State University (USA)
- Galin Tihanov, University of Manchester (UK)

Other keynote speakers are to be confirmed.

Submissions from any scholar working on Slavic languages or literatures are
welcomed, including those in Slavic departments, as well as in specialized
linguistics or literature departments. We particularly want to encourage
young scholars to participate in this conference. Papers will be considered
on topics relating to the diachronic or synchronic study of Slavic languages
and literatures from any theoretical perspective. Each paper will be allowed
thirty minutes (including 10 minutes for discussion). Presentations should be 
in English in order to open the conference up to researchers working on
non-Slavic languages and literatures. The deadline for submissions is March, 31,
2008 (submission information and abstract specifications see below). 

The participation fee will be 80 euros (40 euros for graduate students and
passive participants), to be paid in advance. Detailed information on payment
options and local arrangements will be provided by May 2008. The participation
fee covers the abstract booklet, other conference materials, refreshments and
snacks. 

Submission information and abstract specifications:

Abstracts for 20 minute talks (plus 10 minute discussion) should:

- be anonymous;
- not exceed 500 words (plus an additional page for tables, figures and   
references, if necessary);
- use one-column format, Times New Roman, 12pt, single-spacing;
- use the international transcription of Cyrillic characters into Latin characters;
- be in Adobe PDF format (please do include all fonts in PDF documents).

Your abstract should present a hypothesis and outline your plan for defending
that hypothesis, i.e., it should specify research question(s), an approach /
method to the data, and obtained results. Each abstract will be anonymously
reviewed by independent reviewers.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair Conference
Manager at:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pos3

You will be requested to enter a user name and password to enter the site. If
you do not have an EasyChair account, enter the following URL:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/account_apply.cgi

to obtain one. Your account access information will be emailed to you.

After having logged in to the system, you will be able to submit your abstract
by (1) providing an address for correspondence, (2) specifying the author(s),
(3) providing the title and a short abstract in plain text (the short abstract
should summarize the essentials of the proposal in maximally two short
sentences), (4) specifying at least two keywords, (5) selecting the topic
relevant to your paper (literature or linguistics), and, finally, (6) uploading
the PDF file with the full anonymous abstract including the title and the
abstract body.

The contact author of the paper will receive an auto-generated notification of
receipt via email.

The abstracts must be submitted no later than March 31, 2008. Notifications of
the Organizing Committee's decisions will be sent out by May 5, 2008.
