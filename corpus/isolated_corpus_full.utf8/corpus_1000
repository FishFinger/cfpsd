CALL  FOR  PAPERS
------------------

Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing 2007 (BSNLP 2007)
with Special Theme: Information Extraction and Enabling Technologies

June 29, 2007=20
Prague, Czech Republic

http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007=20

BSNLP will be held in conjunction with the ACL 2007 conference
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/) and is co-organised by the
European Commission's Joint Research Centre

TOPIC AND MOTIVATION:

The recent political and economic changes in Central and
Eastern Europe and the related on-going enlargement of the
European Union brings into focus new cultures and languages.=20
Among them, the languages from the Balto-Slavonic group have=20
an outstanding role because of their rich cultural heritage=20
and the widespread use - over 400 million speakers.

The topic of the workshop addresses Natural Language=20
Processing (NLP) for the Balto-Slavonic languages, with the=20
focus on Information Extraction (IE) and enabling technologies=20
for this language family. The task of IE is to identify a=20
predefined set of concepts from natural language text. The=20
spectrum of IE tasks ranges from named-entity recognition,=20
through relation extraction and co-reference resolution to the=20
identification of complex events and cross-document entity=20
profile extraction. Although a considerable amount of=20
IE-related work exists, most of the studies are concentrated=20
on a few major languages. Research on this topic, as well as=20
on general-purpose NLP tools in the context of Balto-Slavonic=20
languages, is still in its early stage and is progressing=20
relatively slowly. Due to some specific  phenomena like the
highly inflectional character and relatively free word order,=20
a construction of IE systems and other language processing=20
tools (question-answering, text summarization, machine=20
translation) for these languages is an intriguing and=20
challenging task.

This workshop can be seen as the follow-up to the successful=20
workshop on Information Extraction for Slavonic and Other=20
Central and Eastern European Languages
(http://lml.bas.bg/IESL2003) held in conjunction with the=20
RANLP 2003 conference. It is also related to the EACL 2003=20
workshop on Morphological Processing of Slavic Languages=20
(http://nl.ijs.si/mpsl03). In particular, we would strongly=20
encourage submissions describing systems, resources or=20
solutions that are made available to the wider public, as=20
these would help to promote computational linguistics=20
applications for these languages.

AREAS OF INTEREST include, but are not limited to:

A. Specific challenges for Balto-Slavonic NLP, in particular=20
in the context of IE and enabling technologies

- text segmentation
- morphological analysis
- morphology models
- morpho-syntactic disambiguation
- named-entity recognition=20
- named-entity disambiguation (e.g., geo-referencing)
- named-entity lemmatisation
- term and keyword extraction
- name variant recognition and merging
- syntactic parsing and chunking
- co-reference resolution
- word sense disambiguation
- corpus-based knowledge acquisition

B. Multilingual IE frameworks and techniques applied to these languages

- tools and resources (freely available for research purposes will be =
preferred)
- experience with, and evaluation of, linguistic data and processing =
resources
- comparative evaluation between languages

C. IE solutions for these languages:

- scenario template filling / event extraction
- relation extraction
- automatic pattern learning
- corpus studies and statistical techniques for IE
- IE from Web sources
- IE-based ontology population
- IE evaluation
- IE techniques for Question/Answering and Answer Extraction
- Utilisation of IE-based techniques in other NLP applications

INTENDED AUDIENCE

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and=20
practitioners working on NLP for Balto-Slavonic languages, in=20
particular on IE and core technologies supporting IE for these=20
languages. The workshop will give an opportunity to exchange=20
ideas and experience, to discuss hard-to-tackle problems in=20
this field of research, and to make available resources more=20
widely known.

SUBMISSION

Papers should describe original work and should indicate the=20
state of completion of the reported results. In particular, an=20
overlap with previously published work should be clearly=20
mentioned. Submissions will be judged on correctness, novelty,=20
technical strength, clarity of presentation, usability, and=20
significance/relevance to the workshop.=20

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL=20
2007 main-conference proceedings and should not exceed eight=20
(8) pages, including references. We recommend to use either=20
the LaTeX style file or the Microsoft-Word style file, which=20
can be found at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/acl2007/styles.

The reviewing will be blind. Therefore, the paper should not
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,=20
self-citations and other references that could reveal the=20
author's identity should be avoided.=20

Submission will be electronic. The only accepted format for=20
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. Papers must be submitted no=20
later than April 1, 2006 using the submission webpage=20
http://langtech.jrc.it/BSNLP2007/submission.=20

Submissions will be reviewed by 3 members of the Program=20
Committee. Authors of accepted papers will receive guidelines=20
regarding how to produce camera-ready versions of their papers=20
for inclusion in the ACL workshop proceedings.

IMPORTANT DATES

Workshop Paper Submission deadline: April 1
Notification of Acceptance: April 25
Camera-ready Version: May 9
Workshop: June 29, 2007.

LOCATION

Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is located in the=20
centre of Europe. It is one of the most valuable historical=20
city reserves in Europe. The historical core of the city is=20
listed in the UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage=20
Register. The workshop itself will take place in the TOP HOTEL=20
Praha, located in the quiet neighbourhood of the Prague 4=20
district, only 15-20 minutes from the historic centre of Prague.=20

Prague is easily reachable by car, bus or train from central=20
Europe (only 3-hour drive from Vienna or Budapest or 4 hours=20
from Berlin or Munich), by cheap flights from the rest of=20
Europe, and by several direct flights from overseas.=20
