=09FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

The Program Committee of the 17th Nordic Conference of Computational
Linguistics (NODALIDA 2009) invites papers on substantial, original,
and unpublished research on all aspects of language technology, =20
including, but not limited to:

- phonetics, phonology and morphology;
- speech recognition and speech synthesis;
- word segmentation, tagging and chunking;
- syntax, semantics and grammars;
- pragmatics, discourse and dialogue;
- the lexicon and ontologies;
- parsing and grammatical formalisms;
- generation, text planning and summarization;
- language modelling, spoken language recognition and synthesis;
- linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of language;
- information retrieval, text categorization, question answering and
   information extraction;
- paraphrasing and textual entailment;
- machine learning for natural language;
- multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;
- multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
- language-oriented applications, tools and resources;
- evaluation methodology.

REQUIREMENTS

Regular papers should describe original work; they should emphasize complete=
d
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of
completion of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluatio=
n
results should be included. Papers reporting on-going work or system
demonstrations should be submitted as short papers. All submissions will be
judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

Submissions presented at NODALIDA should mostly contain new material that ha=
s
not been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.
Papers that are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshop=
s
must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain significan=
t
overlap with previously published work.

REVIEWING

Reviewing will be managed by the Program Committee and associated reviewers.
The reviewing process will be blind and each submission will receive three
independent reviews.

CATEGORIES OF PAPERS

Papers can be submitted to one of three categories: REGULAR PAPER, SHORT
PAPER, and STUDENT PAPER. Authors must designate one of these categories
at submission time. The three categories have different requirements on
authors, submission format and publication format:

REGULAR PAPERS are submitted as full papers (max 8 pages). If accepted, a
regular paper can be presented either as a single talk during one of the
parallel paper sessions at the conference or as a poster in one of the
poster sessions. The authors can state their preference at submission
time. In both cases, the paper is published as a full paper (max 8 pages)
in the conference proceedings.

SHORT PAPERS are submitted as extended abstracts (max 4 pages). They can
describe work in progress or system demonstrations. If accepted, a short
paper is presented at one of the poster or demo sessions at the conference
and is published as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) in the conference
proceedings.

STUDENT PAPERS can be submitted as full papers (max 8 pages) or as short
papers (extended abstracts, max 4 pages). All authors of a student paper
must be students (undergraduate or graduate). If accepted, a full student
paper can be presented as a single talk or as a poster in one of the
parallel student paper sessions at the conference, and a short paper as a
poster. Student papers are published either as a full paper (max 8 pages)
or as an extended abstract (max 4 pages) in the conference proceedings
according to the authors' own choice.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions should follow the two-column format of EACL proceedings and
must use either the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template
that will be made available on the conference web site, courtesy of the
Association for Computational Linguistics. Regular paper submissions
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references; student paper
and short paper submissions should not exceed four (4) pages. We reserve
the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles,
including font size restrictions. As reviewing will be blind, the paper
should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations
such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not
conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission will be electronic and must be made through the conference
website. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF.
Regular and student papers must be submitted no later than January 12,
2009; short papers must be submitted no later than February 18, 2009.
Papers submitted after the deadlines will not be reviewed.
