Meeting Description:

Text Mining and Applications (TeMA'09) Track of EPIA09

TeMA-2009 will be held at the 14th Portuguese Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (EPIA 2009), in University of Aveiro, Portugal, 12-15 October
2009. This track  is organized under the auspices of the Portuguese
Association for Artificial Intelligence (APPIA).
EPIA 2009 URL: http://epia2009.appia.pt/ 

Call for Papers

Track Description:
Pure symbolic methods for Language Processing alone are unable to address
human languages complexity. Text Mining and Machine Learning techniques
applied to text, raw or annotated, brought up new insights and completely
shifted the approaches to Human Language Technologies. Both approaches,
symbolic and statistical based, when duly integrated, bridge the gap between
language theories and effective use of languages, and enable important
applications. Our aim, with this track, is to bring together innovative
contributions to fill in this gap.

The track of Text Mining and Applications is a forum for researchers working in
natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL), Machine
Learning (ML) and related areas. Authors are invited to submit their papers on
any of the issues identified below. Papers will be blindly reviewed by three
members of the Programme Committee. Best papers will be published at Springer,
in LNAI series. If there are additional papers whose quality is sufficiently
high for deserving to be presented at TeMA'09, those other accepted papers will
be published in a conference proceedings book.

Topics of Interest

- Language Models.
- Multi-word Units.
- Lexical Knowledge Acquisition.
