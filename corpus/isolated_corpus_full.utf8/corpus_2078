CUNY Phonology Forum Conference on the Syllable in Phonology

Second Call for Papers

CUNY Phonology Forum Conference on the Syllable

We invite papers from any subdivision of cognitive science such as formal
linguistics, language acquisition, neurolinguistics, philosophy, psychology,
etc. We also encourage diversity in methods so we welcome both formal and
experimental approaches to the topic of syllables.

The following list of questions is meant to be suggestive and provocative. In
fact the organizers wish to throw the field of discussion to all matters related
to the syllable in phonology or phonetics.

Do syllables exist?

Are syllables derived? Is syllable structure ever lexically distinctive?

What is the internal structure of the syllable?

Are syllables hierarchically dominated by other prosodic categories?

What principles guide the syllabification of a string of phonemes?

What aspects of syllables are referred to by morphological and phonological
rules/constraints?

How do phonetic syllables relate to phonological syllables (and vice versa)?

What is the role of sonority for syllables?

Invited Speakers:
Harry van der Hulst, University of Connecticut
Paul Kiparsky, Stanford University
Stefanie Shattuck-Hufnagel, MIT
Donca Steriade, MIT
Bert Vaux, University of Cambridge

Submission Guidelines:
Abstracts should consist of a one page description of the paper (12pt font) with
a second page for references, data and/or illustrations. Talks will be 20
minutes with 10 minutes for discussion. Abstracts should be emailed as an
attachment (PDF format) to syllable@cunyphonologyforum.net no later than
midnight, November 10, 2007. Authors should include title of the paper, name of
the author(s) and affiliation in the body of the email.

Important Dates and Information:
November 10, 2007 deadline for abstracts submission
December 1, 2007 notification of acceptance
January 17-18, 2008 Conference on the syllable in phonology

Meeting Description

Thirteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference
July 4-6, 2008
University of Sydney, Australia

Conference website:
http://escholarship.library.usyd.edu.au/conferences/index.php/LingFest2008/LFG/
Conference e-mail (not for abstract submission): lfg08 'at' arts.usyd.edu.au

Abstract submission receipt deadline: 15 February 2008
Submissions should be submitted using the online submission system at
http://www.easychair.org/LFG08/

The 13th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be hosted by
the University of Sydney from July 4th to 6th 2008. This LFG conference is one
in a series of linguistics conferences, and will be followed by the Australian
Linguistics Institute (http://www.lingfest.arts.usyd.edu.au/).

LFG 2008 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical-Functional
Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the
'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel,
constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and
collaboration among researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to
grammar, where grammar is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable)
constraints from multiple levels of structuring, including those of syntactic
categories, grammatical relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the
following sites:
- http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/

Thirteenth International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference
July 4-6, 2008
University of Sydney, Australia

Submissions: Talks and Posters

The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15 min.
discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions can focus on results
from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel
approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical,
formal or computational. Presentations should describe original, unpublished work.

Dissertation Session

As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will give
students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other student
research dissertations).  The dissertations must be completed by the time of the
conference, and they should be made publicly accessible (e.g., on the World Wide
Web).  The talks in this session should provide an overview of the main original
points of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes, followed by a
10-minute discussion period.  The International LFG Association (ILFGA) will pay
the conference fees for the students presenting at the student session.

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to student
submissions.

Timetable

Deadline for abstracts: 15 February 2008
Acceptances sent out: 31 March 2008
Conference: July 4-6 2008

Submission Specifications

Abstracts for talks, posters/demonstrations and the dissertation session must be
received by February 15, 2008. All abstracts should be submitted using the
online submission system. Submissions should be in the form of abstracts only. 
Abstracts can be up to two A4 pages in 10pt or larger type and should include a
title. Omit name and affiliation, and obvious self-reference.  Note: we no
longer ask for a separate page for data and figures (c-/f- and related
structures). They can be included in the text of the abstract, obeying the
overall two-page limit. Please submit your abstract in .pdf or .doc format. If
you have any trouble converting your file into any of these formats, please
contact the Program Committee at the address below.

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people. Papers will appear in
the proceedings, which will be published online by CSLI Publications.  Selected
papers may also appear in a printed volume published by CSLI Publications.
