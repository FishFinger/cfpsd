Meeting Description:

The ERIAC research group of the University of Rouen will be organizing an
International Conference on Prosody and Iconicity on 23-24 October
2008. 

Call for Papers 

Iconicity has been the focus of considerable attention since the beginning of
the twentieth century. It has been demonstrated that every aspect of language
can be affected by the principles of iconicity. 

The University of Rouen will be organizing an International Conference on
Prosody and Iconicity on 23-24 October 2008. 

Plenary Speakers: 
- Antoine Auchlin, University of Geneva
- John Ohala, University of Berkeley; 
- Anne Wichmann, University of Central Lancashire. 

The purpose of the conference is to shed new light on the interrelation between
prosody and iconicity by enlarging the number of parameters traditionally
considered and by confronting various theoretical backgrounds. 
The parameters taken into account may include but are not limited to the following: 
- socio-linguistics and socio-phonetics
- speech situation and context; 
- attitudes and emotions; 
- gestures and multimodality;
- domains interaction (prosody, syntax, pragmatics, etc.)

A special interest will be given to the presentation and the comparison of
different theoretical perspectives such as Information Structure theory, Grice's
theory, Relevance theory, grammaticalization theory, Gussenhoven's biological
codes, prosodic modelling, etc. 

Time for Papers: 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for questions. 

Conference Languages: English and French

Submission Procedure: 
Abstracts should be anonymous and no more than one side of A4. They should be
sent to the following address in PDF format: prosico2008@hotmail.com
