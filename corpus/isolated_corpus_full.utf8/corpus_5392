Meeting Description:

Call for Special Tracks Proposals

Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an
integral part of the FLAIRS conference. They provide researchers in focused
areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum for
interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence
researchers. Their papers are required to meet the same standards and are
published in the conference proceedings. Topics of interest are in all
areas of artificial intelligence and linguistics as they relate to AI.

The 23rd Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference
(FLAIRS-23) will be held May 19-21, 2010 in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA.
FLAIRS-23 continues a tradition of presenting and discussing artificial
intelligence research in a convivial atmosphere within a beautiful setting.
Events will include invited speakers, special tracks, discussion panels,
and presentations of papers and posters. FLAIRS encourages student authors
to submit papers. In addition to a Best Paper award, there will be a Best
Student Paper award for the best paper written primarily by students. 

Call for Papers

Submission of proposals for special tracks are now invited. Proposals must
be submitted to the EasyChair conference system, which can be accessed
through the main conference web site (http://www.FLAIRS-23.info). Special
track chairs may submit to their own tracks. Those papers will be reviewed
by two members of the special track's program committee and two members of
the general conference program committee, and acceptance decisions will be
made by the conference program co-chairs. 

Proposals must include the following information: 

-Title of the special track.
-Anticipated numbers of submissions and accepted papers. A track may have
up to 4 sessions, with 3 papers per session. Special tracks that fail to
attract sufficient papers will be merged into the general conference. 
-Names and contact information for the special track chair(s) and those who
have agreed to serve on the special track's program committee. The program
committee should be large enough for each paper to be reviewed by 4 reviewers. 
-Promotional plans and materials, including a draft call for papers,
specific plans for publicizing the special track, and the names of any
speakers you are considering inviting. (FLAIRS cannot guarantee any form of
financial support for special track invited speakers at this stage.)

Proposals for special tracks:  June 22, 2009  
Acceptance of special tracks:  July 17, 2009
