Meeting Description:

This ACL workshop deals with software engineering, testing, and quality assurance for natural language processing. 

Call for Papers

Software engineering, testing, and quality assurance for natural language processing
An ACL 2008 workshop
Columbus, OH 
June 19 or 20, 2008 (awaiting determination by ACL organizers)
http://alias-i.com/acl-08-software-workshop/

Natural language, as an input type, has unique characteristics that present special problems for software testing, quality assurance, and even requirements specification. This workshop is intended to stimulate research in all areas of software engineering for natural language processing. The goals of the workshop include raising awareness of the need for good software engineering practices in NLP, stimulating research on same, and disseminating the results of current work in this area. The target audience is researchers interested in natural language processing software, including testing and standardization.

Submissions of full papers and poster abstracts are solicited in all areas of software engineering, testing and quality assurance as they relate to natural language processing. Some suggested areas are:

- Patterns for design, coding, refactoring, and unit testing of language processing systems
- Test suite design and generation
- Special issues in metrology for natural language processing
- Grammar/rule engineering
- Usability
- Standardization of tools and/or resources
- Design for and evaluation of reliability and robustness
- Scalability issues in training and deployment
- Reusability and toolkit design
- Concurrency and multithreading for NLP
- Theoretical issues in software engineering for NLP

Important Dates
Submissions due: Friday, March 21, 2008, 11:59 PM East Coast time
Notification of acceptance: Sunday, April 20, 2008
Camera-ready copy due: Saturday, April 26, 2008

Submission Instructions
Full papers: Full papers should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. These are intended to be reports of original and mature research.

Poster abstracts: Poster abstracts should not exceed two (2) pages.  Accepted abstracts will be published in a separate section of the workshop proceedings. Appropriate poster topics include preliminary results, application notes, descriptions of work in progress, etc.

Submission format: Submissions must be in PDF and should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings. Ensure that you are not in A4 format. Please see the conference website for detailed typesetting specifications. Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style files available on the ACL meeting website at http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/acl08/stylefiles.html.

Submit your paper or abstract via the workshop web site at https://www.softconf.com/acl08/ACL08-WS04/ by 11:59 PM on Friday, March 21, East Coast time. Submissions need not be anonymous. Authors who cannot submit a PDF file electronically should contact the workshop organizers well in advance of the submission deadline.

Papers may not be submitted to the software engineering, testing, and quality assurance workshop if they are or will be concurrently submitted to another meeting or publication and that other meeting or publication prohibits dual submissions.  If your paper is or will be concurrently under consideration by another meeting or publication, please notify us of that fact in a footnote on the first page.

Call Deadline: 31-May-2008 

Meeting Description:

1st International Conference on Languages and Dialects in Iran 

Call for Papers

Iran is an extremely rich field when it comes to linguistic research. During centuries languages and dialects of different families (Iranian, Semitic, Turkic etc.) have been spoken side by side and have influence and been influenced by each other. Written and spoken variants have developed. Persian as the official language and the language of education plays the important role of lingua franca, but there are also other languages of wider communication, which play this role in different regions of the country. A considerable amount of research has been carried out on the phonological and morphosyntactic structure of languages in Iran, but there is still much to be done in this field. As for the study of sociolinguistic issues, such as bilingualism, language maintenance, second and third language acquisition, it is a relatively new field of research in Iran.

The purpose of the conference is to stimulate linguistic research in Iran by creating a network of field linguists interested in the study of languages and dialects in Iran in their sociolinguistic milieu. 

Papers in Persian or English will be accepted on the following subjects:
- Phonetics and phonology
- Morphology and syntax
- Sociolinguistics
- Semantics
- Historical linguistics
- Typology
- Contact linguistics
- Bilingualism
- Second language acquisition

Accepted papers in Persian should have a summary in English.
