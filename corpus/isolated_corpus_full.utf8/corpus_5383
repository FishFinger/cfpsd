======================================================================
Machine Learning for NLP

The revue TAL (http://www.atala.org/-Revue-TAL) proposes a call for
papers on the subject of "Machine Learning for NLP". Machine Learning
is the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to
automatically improve through experience (definition proposed by Tom
Mitchell in his "Machine Learning" book). This domain has drastically
increased in the last few years, and its interactions with NLP are
more and more tight and frequent.

 From a linguistic point of view, the interests for this evolution are
numerous. As a matter of fact, manually built resources are
time-consuming and expensive, and the process must be started again
for each distinct language and each distinct sub-domain of a language.
Machine Learning offers an attractive alternative, allowing to obtain
or improve at a lower cost such a resource, with better guaranties of
robustness and coverage. The inductive approach, used for a long time
in the "corpus linguistic" community, can now be operationalized at a
large scale, and its results be rigorously tested. And formal theories
of learning also contribute to the long-standing debate about natural
language acquisition.

 From a Machine Learning point of view, NLP is a rich application
domain where problems are numerous and difficult, and for which many
data are usually available. But the interpretability of the obtained
results is often problematic. More and more subtle specialist-reserved
mathematical device are used : in this context, is linguistics still
useful ? What confidence can a linguist have on the result of a
Machine Learning system ?

A number of the electronic review TAL will be dedicated to this theme.
Beyond reports about yet another experiment applying a special Machine
Learning method on a special linguistic task, more general theoretical
and methodological reflexions are encouraged. For each contribution
and each method used, a special effort should be made to clarify what
are the linguistic as well as computational underlying hypotheses.

The Machine Learning approach considered can be : - either
theoretical, concerning learnability/non learnability results for
classes of objects, with respect to formal criteria - either
empirical, based on an experimental protocol exploiting annotated (in
the case of supervised learning) or not annotated (in the case of non
supervised learning) data

The methods used can be :
- symbolic (grammatical inference, ILP...)
- based on probabilistic (either generative or discriminative) models
- based on similarities (neighboring, analogy, memory-based
  learning...)

Application domains can be :

- acquisition or improving of resources (including automata, grammars,
  sub-categorisation frames, concept-based ontologies...)

- speech analysis

- corpus labeling (either lexical, syntactic, functional, thematic,
  semantic...)

- clustering and classification of texts (according to various
  possible criteria : author, content, opinion...)

- information extraction (including : extraction and typing of named
  entities)

- question/answering systems

- automatic summary

- automatic translation
