Sign Language Modelling and Processing
TAL Special IssueP

Guest Editors: Christian Cuxac and Patrice Dalle

Sign language studies are now emerging from their specific and confidential
territory to meet up with ongoing research on natural language both from a
linguistic and computer science viewpoints. The number of specific
colloquia is quickly increasing, and research on sign language being
presented in non specialised colloquia. The study of sign language is
providing insight on language phenomena and is therefore of interest to
more than specialised linguists. The fields of computer vision and avatar
synthesis are now entering research on sign languages. Will Natural
Language Processing also participate?

With Internet, tools for Natural Language Processing are now part of the
life and development of a language. Sign languages should be usable on
Internet to communicate, to get informed, and even for sign language
learning. This requires robust and efficient applications respectful of the
specificities of sign languages. These requirements will only be met if
these applications rely on elaborate models and precise formalization of
sign languages.

From a linguistic point of view, formalization and computerization of sign
languages are especially appealing: the study of a different medium should
highlight the universal aspects of human languages but also the aspects
specific to sign languages, by for instance providing corpora, and more or
less automatic annotation and analysis tools.

Submission to this special issue should address the automated processing of
sign languages as well as formal models which lead to processing tools.
