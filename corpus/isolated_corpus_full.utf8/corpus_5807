Meeting Description:

Conference Website: http://uk-clc3.org

The third UK Cognitive Linguistics conference (UK-CLC3) will take place at the University of Hertfordshire, over three days: 6-8th inclusive, July 2010.  The conference theme is 'Meaning, Mind and (Social) Reality'. 

The following distinguished scholars will be giving keynote lectures relating to aspects of the conference theme: 

Professor William Croft (University of New Mexico, USA)
Professor Ewa Dabrowska (University of Sheffield, UK)
Professor John Lucy (University of Chicago, USA)
Professor Peter Stockwell (University of Nottingham, UK)
Professor Gabriella Vigliocco (University College London, UK) 

Call for Papers:

We invite the submission of abstracts (for paper or poster presentations) addressing all aspects of cognitive linguistics.  These include but are by no means limited to:

-Domains and frame semantics
-Categorisation, prototypes and polysemy
-Metaphor and metonymy 
-Mental spaces and conceptual blending
-Cognitive and construction grammar
-Embodiment and language acquisition
-Language evolution and language change
-Language use and linguistic relativity

Cognitive linguistics is an inherently interdisciplinary enterprise which is broadly concerned with the connection between language and cognition in relation to body, culture and contexts of use.  We are therefore especially interested in interdisciplinary research - theoretical, empirical, applied - that combines theories and methods from across the cognitive, biological and social sciences.

These include but are not limited to:

-Linguistics
-Anthropology
-Evolution
-Paleoanthropology
-Primatology
-Neuroscience
-Cognitive and developmental psychology
-(Critical) Discourse and Communication studies

Papers will be allocated 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for question.  Posters will stay up for a day and be allocated to dedicated, timetabled sessions.  The language of the conference is English.

Abstracts of no more than 300 words (excluding references) should be sent by email as a Word attachment to c.j.hart@herts.ac.uk by 15 December 2009.  The document should contain presentation title, the abstract and preference for paper or poster presentation.  Please DO NOT include information identifying the author(s) in the email attachment.  Author(s) information including name, affiliation and email address(es) should be detailed in the body of the email. 

All abstracts will be subject to peer review by an international Scientific Committee.  Notification of acceptance decisions will be communicated by February 15th 2010.

Presenters will be invited to submit papers based on the conference theme for an edited volume to be published by Equinox Publishing Co. in the Advances in Cognitive Linguistics series.  Accepted papers will be subject to peer-review. Keep up-to-date by bookmarking and checking the conference website regularly: http://uk-clc3.org

The conference is organised by Chris Hart (Chair of local organising committee), and Vyv Evans (on behalf of the UK-CLA).  For details of the UK-CLA see: www.uk-cla.org.uk.
