Dear Jean-Philippe Prost,

The deadline for submitting a paper to the International Conference on Software and Data Technologies is approaching. The deadline for regular papers submission is March 17. 
ICSOFT 2009 is the yearly meeting place of researchers and practitioners from all over the world who are interested in Software Engineering and the topics indicated below. ICSOFT has regularly included delegates from more than 40 countries in previous editions of this conference. Further details can be found at http://www.icsoft.org
The conference proceedings will be indexed by Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Thomson Reuters, INSPEC and DBLP. EI is evaluating the proceedings of the previous ICSOFT for possible inclusion in the index. 
The conference has a double-blind review process and after a strict selection procedure all accepted papers will be published in the proceedings (paperback and CD-ROM) under an ISBN. Extended versions of the best papers of the conference will be published in a book, by Springer-Verlag.

Kind regards,
Monica Saramago
