t or
postdoctoral researcher are especially welcome. Poster and demo submissions
addressing any of the areas identified in the conference topics are also
invited. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate work in progress and
late-breaking research results. Papers that demonstrate a high level of res=
earch
adventure or which break out of the traditional IR paradigms are particular=
ly
welcome.
