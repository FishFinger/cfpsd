Meeting Description:

The 82nd Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America will take place at
the Chicago Palmer House Hilton, 3-6 January 2008. The American Dialect Society,
the American Name Society, the North American Association for the History of the
Language Sciences, the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, and the
Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas will meet
concurrently with the LSA. 

The deadline for submission of abstracts for the 2008 Annual Meeting of the LSA
is one month earlier than in previous years. 

The new deadline is Wednesday, 1 August 2007, 5:00 pm EDT. All abstracts for
papers and posters, and all proposals for organized sessions must be submitted
electronically; see the LSA Annual Meeting website
(http://lsadc.org/info/meet-index.cfm) for details. For the 2008 Annual Meeting,
members may submit up to two abstracts: one single-authored and one
multi-authored, or two abstracts with multiple authors. Organized session
abstracts are considered multi- authored papers. All abstracts will be reviewed
by the Program Committee and by a panel of 70+ external expert reviewers. It is
because of this expanded review process, along with a steady increase in
abstract submissions, that the submission deadline has been moved forward one
month to August 1. 

Please direct any questions to the LSA at lsa@lsadc.org.
