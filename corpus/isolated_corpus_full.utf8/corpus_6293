Meeting Description:

Every year the An=E9la (Dutch Society for Applied Linguistics) organizes th=

organized in collaboration wit the VIOT, the Dutch and Flemish Interunivers=
ity
Association for Speech Communication. The Junior day offers PhD students an=
d

sent

a-VIOT
Scriptieprijs will be awarded to the best BA- or MA-thesis in the area of
applied linguistics.

On Friday, January 29th, 2010 the 20st Junior day will be held at Leiden
University. The Junior day starts with a lecture by a plenary speaker, foll=
owed

t
their work. There will also be poster-presentations in the afternoon. The d=
ay
will end with drinks and a ceremony for the An=E9la-VIOT scriptieprijs. Mor=
eover,
there will also be a special surprise event to celebrate the fact that the
Junior day is organized for the 20th time this year.=20
