Psychocomputational Models of Human Language =

Acquisition (PsychoCompLA-2009)

July 28th & 29th at CogSci 2009 - Amsterdam, =

Netherlands

Submission Deadline: May 15, 2009

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated =

computational models of
language acquisition. That is, models which are =

compatible with research in
psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and =

linguistics.

Invited Speakers:

* Tom Griffiths, University of California, Berkeley
* Amy Weinberg, University of Maryland (to be =

confirmed)

Workshop History: =

This is the fifth meeting of the Psychocomputational =

Models of Human Language
Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, =

held in Geneva, Switzerland as
part of the 20th International Conference on =

Computational Linguistics (COLING-
2004), PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual =

Meeting of the Association
for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in Ann =

Arbor, Michigan where the
workshop shared a joint session with the Ninth =

Conference on Computational
Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), =

PsychoCompLA-2007 held in Nashville,
Tennessee as part of the 29th meeting of the Cognitive =

Science Society (CogSci-
2007), and PsychoCompLA-2008 held in Washington =

D.C., as part of the 30th meeting
of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci-2008). Given =

the increasing interest,
this year the workshop will be spread over two days =

directly before the main
conference of the 31st meeting of the Cognitive Science =

Society (CogSci-2009)
which begins on July 30th, 2009.


Workshop Description:

The workshop will present research and foster discussion =

centered around
psychologically-motivated computational models of =

language acquisition, with an
emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades =

there has been a
thriving research agenda that applies computational =

learning techniques to
emerging natural language technologies and many =

meetings, conferences and
workshops in which to present such research. However, =

there have been only a few
(but growing number of) venues in which =

psychocomputational models of how humans
acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus.
Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are =

of particular interest in
light of recent results in developmental psychology that =

suggest that very young
infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an =

audible input stream.
Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical =

'machinery' to the task
of grammar acquisition, with or without an innate =

language component, remains an
open and important question. One effective line of =

investigation is to
computationally model the acquisition process and =

determine interrelationships
between a model and linguistic or psycholinguistic =

theory, and/or correlations
between a model's performance and data from linguistic =

environments that
children are exposed to.


Topics and Goals:

Short papers that present research on (but not =

necessarily limited
to) the following topics are welcome:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction =

models that
incorporate psychologically plausible constraints;
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported
studies;
* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual =

perspective;
* Models that address learning bias in terms of innate
linguistic knowledge versus statistical regularity in the
input;
* Models that employ language modeling techniques =

from corpus
linguistics;
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
* Models of language change and its effect on language
acquisition or vice versa;
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate =

existing
linguistic or developmental theories (e.g., principles &
parameters, optimality theory, construction grammar, =

etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed =

corpora such
as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers =

from cognitive psychology,
computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical =

sciences, linguistics and
psycholinguistics working on all areas of language =

acquisition. Diversity and
cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal.


Workshop Organizers:
Rens Bod, University of Amsterdam (rens.bod at uva.nl)
William Gregory Sakas, City University of New York  =

(sakas at hunter.cuny.edu) =

Workshop Co-Organizer:
Taylor Cassidy, City University of New York =

(Pyshco.Comp@hunter.cuny.edu)

Submission details:

Authors are invited to submit short papers of =

(maximally) 2 pages of narrative
plus 2 pages for data, references and other =

supplementary materials. Papers
should be anonymous, clearly titled and the narrative =

section should be no more
than 1400 words in length. Either PDF, or MS Word =

formats are acceptable. Please
include a cover sheet (as a separate attachment) =

containing the title of your
submission, your name, contact details and affiliation. =

Send your submission
electronically to

Email: Psycho.Comp@hunter.cuny.edu.
     with  PsychoCompLA-2009 Submission  somewhere =

in the subject line.

Publication:

The accepted papers will appear in the online workshop =

proceedings. Full papers
of accepted short papers will be considered in Fall 2009 =

for inclusion in an
issue of the new Cognitive Science Society Journal - =

topiCS - whose focus will
be psychocomputational modeling of human language =

acquisition.

Submission deadline: May 15, 2009

subject line.
