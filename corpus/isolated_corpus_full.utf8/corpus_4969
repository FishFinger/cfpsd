Dear all,

Below is a reminder of the call for papers for AVSP 2009, the deadline  
for which (1st May 2009) is fast approaching. The submission system is  
now open.

Cheers
Barry

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates: 10-13 September 2009
Location: University of East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, UK
Website: http://www.avsp2009.co.uk

The eighth International Conference on Auditory-Visual Speech  
Processing (AVSP) 2009 will be held at the University of East Anglia,  
Norwich, UK.  As with previous meetings, AVSP will run as a satellite  
conference to Interspeech (2009), which will be held in Brighton, UK.   
The conference is also convenient for those delegates attending BMVC  
2009 in London.  For those wishing to combine attendance at AVSP and  
Interspeech, we expect to organise transport between Brighton and  
Norwich.

Since the inception of AVSP in Bonas in 1995, AVSP workshops have  
attracted an interdisciplinary audience of psychologists, engineers,  
scientists and linguists. This conference will consist of a mixture of  
regular presentations (both posters and oral), and lectures by invited  
speakers.

Topics include but are not limited to:

   - Machine recognition of audiovisual speech
   - Human and machine models of integration
   - Multimodal processing of spoken events
   - Cross-linguistic studies
   - Developmental studies
   - Role of gestures accompanying speech
   - Modelling, synthesis and recognition of facial gestures
   - Speech synthesis
   - Prosody
   - Neurophysiology and neuro-psychology of audition and vision
   - Scene analysis

Important dates:
Paper submission: 1st May 2009
Notification of acceptance: 1st July 2009 (at the latest)
Camera ready papers: 1st August 2009

Chairs:
Barry-John Theobald
Richard Harvey
