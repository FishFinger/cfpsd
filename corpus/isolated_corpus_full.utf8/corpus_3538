Second Call for Papers

GENERATION CHALLENGES 2009
--------------------------

To be held in conjunction with ENLG 2009.

Following the NSF/SIGGEN Workshop on Shared Tasks and Comparative Evaluatio=
n in NLG in April 2007 (http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/nlgeval07/),=
 and the INLG'06 Special Session on Sharing Data and Comparative Evaluation=
 (http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Anja.Belz/inlg06-specsess.html),
there has recently been a lot of activity in connection with shared tasks i=
n Natural Language Generation (NLG).  The Pilot Attribute Selection for Gen=
erating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge took place between May and =
September 2007; the Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenge
2008 has just been completed; the GIVE Challenge is currently underway; and=
 other challenges are being prepared.  More information about all of these =
activities can be found via the links on the Generation Challenges
homepage: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09

To provide a common forum for these activities, we are organising Generatio=
n Challenges 2009, an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety o=
f shared-task evaluation efforts that involve the generation of natural lan=
guage.  Evaluation results and participating systems will be presented at t=
he Generation Challenges 2009 Special Session at the 12th European Workshop=
 on Natural Language Generation (ENLG'09).


1. Shared Tasks:
- - - - - - - - -

There will be three shared tasks at Generation Challenges 2009 which will b=
e organised independently (for details, please refer to the Call for Partic=
ipation for each task):

1. The GIVE Challenge (Koller, Byron, Moore, Oberlander & Striegnitz):
Generation of natural-language instructions to aid human task-solving in a =
virtual environment. This task has started, for more information go to:

http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/v1akolle/proj/give

2. GREC Tasks (Belz, Gatt, Kow & Viethen): Generation of references to name=
d entities in discourse; (i) GREC-MSR Task: selection of referring expressi=
ons for references to the main subject of the text; (ii) GREC-NEG
Task: generation of referring expressions for all mentions of people in a t=
ext. For more information go to:

http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/grec

3. TUNA Progress Test (Gatt, Belz & Kow): An opportunity to improve on
REG'08 Task 3, i.e. mapping from TUNA domain representations to referring e=
xpressions. For more information go to:

http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/research/genchal09/tuna


2. Special Track - Proposals for Future Tasks:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in=
 the general area of language generation.  Proposed tasks can be in the are=
a of core NLG, or straddle more than one research area in which language is=
 generated, e.g. core NLG and MT, or core NLG and text summarisation.  Subm=
issions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including informat=
ion regarding organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest=
 and/or application context, size and state of completion of data to be use=
d, and evaluation plans.


3. Open Track:
- - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers reporting any language generation method an=
d results obtained using the training and development data from any of the =
shared task tracks.  The task definition should differ from that in the cor=
responding shared task track, and submissions will be reviewed according to=
 standard workshop reviewing criteria.


4. Evaluation Methods Track:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

We invite submissions of papers describing any evaluation method that can b=
e used to evaluate systems submitted to any of the shared tasks. Papers sho=
uld report results for applying the evaluation method to one or more system=
s implementing a solution to one of the shared tasks (although different da=
ta may be used).  Submissions will be reviewed according to standard worksh=
op reviewing criteria.


5. Instructions for Paper Submissions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Submissions in the Special Track, Open Track and Evaluation Methods Track s=
hould be no more than 4 (four) pages long, and should follow the ACL'09 gui=

apers should be sent in PDF format by email to nlg-stec@itri.brighton.ac.uk=
.  Special Track papers should be submitted no later than 30 November 2008.=
  Papers in the Open Track and the Evaluation Methods Track should be submi=
tted no later than 12 January 2009.

age limit for camera-ready versions has not yet been finalised (the final l=
imit will depend on how many submissions there are).
