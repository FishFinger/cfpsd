MLMI 2008 first call for papers (apologies for multiple postings):


                 5th Joint Workshop on Machine Learning
                 and Multimodal Interaction (MLMI 2008)

                         8-10 September 2008
                       Utrecht, The Netherlands

                        http://www.mlmi.info


The fifth MLMI workshop will be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands,
following successful workshops in Martigny (2004), Edinburgh (2005),
Washington (2006) and Brno (2007).  MLMI brings together researchers
from the different communities working on the common theme of advanced
machine learning algorithms applied to multimodal human-human and
human-computer interaction.  The motivation for creating this joint
multi-disciplinary workshop arose from the actual needs of several large
collaborative projects, in Europe and the United States.


* Important dates

Submission of papers/posters: Monday, 31 March 2008
Acceptance notifications: Monday, 12 May 2008
Camera-ready versions of papers: Monday, 16 June 2008
Workshop: 8-10 September 2008


* Workshop topics

MLMI 2008 will feature talks (including a number of invited speakers),
posters and demonstrations.  Prospective authors are invited to submit
proposals in the following areas of interest, related to machine
learning and multimodal interaction:
  - human-human communication modeling
  - audio-visual perception of humans
  - human-computer interaction modeling
  - speech processing
  - image and video processing
  - multimodal processing, fusion and fission
  - multimodal discourse and dialogue modeling
  - multimodal indexing, structuring and summarization
  - annotation and browsing of multimodal data
  - machine learning algorithms and their applications to the topics above


* Satellite events

MLMI'08 will feature special sessions and satellite events, as during
the previous editions of MLMI (see www.mlmi.info for examples).  To
propose special sessions or satellite events, please contact the special
session chair.

MLMI 2008 is broadly colocated with a number of events in related
domains: Mobile HCI 2008, 2-5 September, in Amsterdam; FG 2008, 17-19
September, in Amsterdam; and ECML 2008, 15-19 September, in Antwerp.


* Guidelines for submission

The workshop proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series (pending approval).  The first four editions
of MLMI were published as LNCS 3361, 3869, 4299, and 4892.  However,
unlike previous MLMIs, the proceedings of MLMI 2008 will be printed
before the workshop and will be already available onsite to MLMI 2008
participants.

Submissions are invited either as long papers (12 pages) or as short
papers (6 pages), and may include a demonstration proposal.  Upon
acceptance of a paper, the Program Committee will also assign to it a
presentation format, oral or poster, taking into account: (a) the most
suitable format given the content of the paper; (b) the length of the
paper (long papers are more likely to be presented orally); (c) the
preferences expressed by the authors.

Please submit PDF files using the submission website at
http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlmi08/, following the Springer LNCS format
for proceedings and other multiauthor volumes
(http://www.springer.com/east/home/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D5-164-7-72376-0).
  Camera-ready versions of accepted papers, both long and short, are
required to follow these guidelines and to take into account the
reviewers' comments.  Authors of accepted short papers are encouraged to
turn them into long papers for the proceedings.


* Venue

Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands, with historic
roots back to the Roman Empire.  Utrecht hosts one of the bigger
universities in the country, and with its historic centre and the many
students it provides and excellent atmosphere for social activities in-
or outside the workshop community.  Utrecht is centrally located in the
Netherlands, and has direct train connections to the major cities and
Schiphol International Airport.

TNO, organizer of MLMI 2008, is a not-for-profit research organization.
  TNO speech technological research is carried out in Soesterberg, at
TNO Human Factors, and has research areas in ASR, speaker and language
recognition, and word and event spotting.

The workshop will be held in "Ottone", a beautiful old building near the
"Singel", the canal which encircles the city center.  The conference
hall combines a spacious setting with a warm an friendly ambiance.

David van Leeuwen, TNO (Organization Chair)
Anton Nijholt, University of Twente (Special Sessions Chair)
Andrei Popescu-Belis, IDIAP Research Institute (Programme Co-chair)
