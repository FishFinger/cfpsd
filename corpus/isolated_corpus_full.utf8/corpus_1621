One theme that unites all those involved with language awareness, as researchers
and/or practitioners, is engagement with language. The 9th International
Conference of the Association for Language Awareness aims to bring together
researchers and practitioners to discuss and share research, theory and best
practice relating to different aspects of engaging with language. The Conference
will address language awareness in the learning and teaching of languages; in
literature; and in broader educational, social, professional, and cultural
dimensions. A particular aim of the 2008 ALA is to promote language awareness
research and practice within the region. 

Main Areas
- Language Awareness in language learning
- Language Awareness in language teaching
- Language Awareness and language use

The Conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss
and share research, theory and best practice relating to different aspects of
engaging with language. It will address language awareness in the learning and

Full Title: Gestures: A Comparison of Signed and Spoken Languages 

Date: 27-Feb-2008 - 29-Feb-2008
Location: Bamberg, Germany 
Contact Person: Ulrike Wrobel
Meeting Email: wrobel@daf.uni-muenchen.de

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 05-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description
Movements of the hands are an important part of natural communication. Since the
scholarly interest in issues of social interaction and spoken language began to
grow in the 1960s, spoken language linguists and psychologists have described
these parts of language as "gestures". Yet their function appeared to be limited
to accompanying speech: Gestures were analysed as secondary articulation
movements for a long time. 
From the beginning of sign language linguistics, however, it was clear that
these ideas would not hold for the movements of the hand used to speak there:
Articulating language by visible movements of the hands is of course elementary
to all signed languages.
In the 80s it was discovered that the communicative potential of manual
movements in spoken language goes further beyond accompanying language: Gestures
were no longer regarded as carrying additive information, but were recognized as
forming a core part of the shared communication process, even as forming part of
language itself. The spreading interest into these properties of gesture
provided grounds for the foundation of the International Gesture Society and the
launching of an interdisciplinary journal called "Gesture". 

The workshop intends to focus on the consequences the two modalities afford for
the concept of gestures: How are gestures analysed in signed and spoken
languages? The following topics might be addressed:
- Transcription systems for movements of the hands
- Differences and similarities in movements of the hands in gestures and signs
- The nature of gestures and signs 
- Semantic constitution of gestures and signs
- Lexical problems concerning movements of the hands
- Morphophonological and syntactical uses of gestures and signs
- Gestures and signs as cognitive units
- Origo and deixis in signed and spoken languages
- Visual qualities of (narrative) perspectives, positions, viewpoints and
communicative roles.
Other topics are also welcome: The purpose of the workshop is to review the
concept of gesture for spoken and signed language by contrasting them. The
desirable aim of the workshop is a concerted appreciation of common notions,
terms, concepts, approaches and theories. 

Abstract Submission Guide
Participants intending to give a talk are kindly requested to send a word
document to the following address: wrobel@daf.uni-muenchen.de . Presentation

acceptance will be sent by November 1, 2008.
