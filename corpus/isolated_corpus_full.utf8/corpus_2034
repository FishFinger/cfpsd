Meeting Description

DYSKOLOS (Dubrovnik Young Scholars' Workshop on Comparative Linguistics) is the
first in a series of conferences to take place in Dubrovnik (Croatia) as a part
of project encouraging young scholars to present papers, thoughts and ideas in
front of their peers. It's an international motion opened to scientists from all
over the world. Its goal is to promote international cooperation and excellence
in the field of linguistics.

Applicants are invited to submit papers discussing issues in comparative and
historical linguistics, including typology, onomastics, dialectology and
accentology of various languages and language families. Papers dealing with
descriptive linguistics and empirical research are also welcomed. 

All applicants wishing to present a paper are kindly requested to submit the
registration form electronically to dyskolos2008@gmail.com to arrive no later
than 1 January 2008. Notification will follow. As this is a conference reserved
for young scholars, we are forced to set an age limit. Only those scholars
younger than 35 can offer a paper. The Workshop is also opened for students and
scholars who are interested in attendance without presenting a paper.

DYSKOLOS will be held in the end of August 2008 (Exact date t.b.a.). Working
language is primarily English, but participants can lecture in French, German
and Russian in agreement with the organizers. A small registration fee will be
charged to provide all participants with refreshments during the Workshop and a
book of abstracts.

Dubrovnik is famed for being one of the most beautiful World Heritage sites.
Formerly the capital of Ragusan Republic, the city achieved a remarkable level
of development, particularly during 15th and 16th century. Home to many notable
poets, artists, mathematicians, physicists and scholars, it soon became cradle
of the development of Croatian language and literature. It is equally famous for
its role in the development of Latin and Italian literature. Today it's a
historical city on the picturesque shores of the Adriatic Sea.

We are hoping that the participants can avoid staying in costly hotels by
arranging a more cheaper accommodation in a dormitory. More exact information
will follow.
