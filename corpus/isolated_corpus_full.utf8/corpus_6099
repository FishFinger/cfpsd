   HCSNet Workshop on Building the Australian National Corpus: Data
			  Sources and Tools

		      Thursday 3rd December 2009
	      University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW

	    http://sf09.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest09/ausnc09


	   Submission Deadline: Monday 28th September 2009

Following on from the successful Designing the Australian National
Corpus workshop held during SummerFest 2008, HCSNet (the ARC Research
Network in Human Communication) is organising a workshop on Building
the Australian National Corpus to be held as part of SummerFest 2009.

This workshop focuses on current developments and emerging
possibilities in language data gathering and tools that might
complement existing collections of language data in building the
Australian National Corpus.

While sources like the World Wide Web have enormous potential there
are numerous challenges facing those wishing to draw out
linguistically relevant data from the Web. In constructing the
Australian National Corpus, then, a wider range of data sources needs
to be drawn upon. The aim of the workshop is thus to bring together
researchers with expertise in corpus and web linguistics along with
corpus building and annotation in a single forum in order to work
towards strategies to capitalize on the potential for language data in
existing as well as new collections to be incorporated into the
Australian National Corpus in a principled manner.

Topics include but are not limited to:

    * Using the web as a source of corpus data
    * Bringing existing data collections into the AusNC
    * Making existing data useful in other fields of research
    * Proposed models for collecting new data
    * Legal issues for data collection and sharing
    * Technical infrastructure and requirements
    * Long term curation of the AusNC

There will be a keynote presentation by Prof. Gerhard Leitner from
Frieie Universitat Berlin. Prof. Leitner is the author of the two
volume book "Australia's Many Voices" (2004, Mouton de Gruyter),
co-editor of "The habitat of Australia's Aboriginal Languages" (2007,
Mouton de Gruyter) and "Language in Australia and New Zealand. A
Bibliography and Research Database, 1788-present" (2006, 2008), and
was also involved in the construction of the Indian English component
of the International Corpus of English.
