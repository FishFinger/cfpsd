International Conference

MACHINE TRANSLATION TWENTY-FIVE YEARS ON

21-22 November 2009

Organised by: The Natural Language Translation Specialist Group of The =

British Computer Society (BCS-NLTSG)

CALL FOR PAPERS

The Conference

The first Cranfield International Conference on Machine Translation,
jointly organised by the BCS-NLTSG and Cranfield University, was held in
1984. A second Cranfield conference was held in 1994.

Machine Translation is now some 60 years old and in view of the success
of the previous Cranfield conferences, we are marking the twenty-fifth =

anniversary of the first conference at Cranfield by holding another this
November.


The title for the Conference is:

Machine Translation: Twenty-Five Years On

Papers are invited which centre on any aspect of translation by machine
or aided by machine.

We are particularly interested in what has been achieved in Machine
Translation (MT) and Machine Assisted Translation (MAT) in the
twenty-five years from 1984, and also what is expected to happen in R &
D in MT and MAT in the next twenty-five years.

Other aspects of translation are welcome too - for it is by the =

interchanging of ideas that progress is made.

We invite papers reporting on recent advances in  all aspects of Machine
Translation, Computer-aided translation and Multilingual Natural
Language Processing in general, including (but not limited to):
terminology extraction and terminology  management; electronic
dictionaries; corpus-based language processing; word-sense
disambiguation; machine translation;  machine-aided translation;
translation memory systems; translation aids and tools; cross-lingual
information retrieval; text alignment; CALL; language resources;
evaluation.

Emphasis at the Conference will be given to the latest research in MT
and MAT, illustrated wherever possible by computer demonstrations of
working systems. Since the last conference, the influence of the Web
cannot be ignored.

It is expected that the Conference will help to give an impetus for
further research and development in MT and MAT in the coming years.

We think everyone agreed how successful and enjoyable both the '84 and
'94 Cranfield Conferences were. We are expecting the 2009 Cranfield
Conference to be even better.
