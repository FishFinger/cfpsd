2nd and final call for papers for OntoLex07 - From Text to Knowledge:=20
The Lexicon/Ontology Interface

http://olp.dfki.de/OntoLex07/

Workshop at ISWC07, the 6th International Semantic Web Conference=20
(http://iswc2007.semanticweb.org/)
November 11th , 2007
Busan, South-Korea

Endorsed by SIGSEM (Association of Computational Linguistics SIG on=20
Computational Semantics http://www.aclweb.org/sigsem) and the NEON=20
project (http://www.neon-project.org/)
And in coordination with the ISO Working Group on Language Resource=20
Management (http://www.tc37sc4.org/)

The OntoLex workshop series is concerned with the interface between=20
knowledge representation in ontologies and the representation and use of =

linguistic knowledge as encoded in (multilingual) lexicons. Previous=20
OntoLex workshops were held in Sozopol (2000), Las Palmas (2002), Lisboa =

(2004), Jeju (2005), Genoa (2006). The extraction of ontology elements=20
from textual data is a pre-requisite for many Semantic Web applications. =

Hence the interface between ontologies (describing objects in a domain)=20
and the lexicon (describing the linguistic features of terms that refer=20
to such objects) is becoming increasingly important. We invite=20
submission of papers on the following topics in this interdisciplinary=20
research area:

The lexicon/ontology interface
* Design principles for the integrated representation of lexical and=20
ontological knowledge
* The lexicon/ontology interface in multilingual and cross-cultural=20
aspects of ontologies

The lexicon in Semantic Web applications
* The role of (multilingual) lexicons in knowledge markup and ontology=20
population, i.e. in ontology-based information extraction from text
* Lexical aspects in ontology learning from text, i.e. in (multilingual) =

term extraction, relation extraction, etc.
* Lexical approaches to ontology matching, i.e. in the extraction,=20
representation and use of synonyms for mapping between class/property=20
labels
* Reengineering lexicons as ontologies, e.g. porting wordnets and=20
framenets to the Semantic Web

Ontologies in knowledge-based Natural Language Processing
* Ontological constraints on lexicon development for knowledge-based NLP
* Ontologies as resources for NLP-based tasks (question answering,=20
document classification, text mining, expert search, etc.)
