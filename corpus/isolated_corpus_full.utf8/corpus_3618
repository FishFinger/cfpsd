Full Title: Language Contact in Times of Globalization 2 (2009) 
Short Title: LCTG2 

Date: 04-Jun-2009 - 06-Jun-2009
Location: Groningen, Netherlands 
Contact Person: Remco van Pareren
Meeting Email: lctg2@rug.nl
Web Site: http://www.rug.nl/let/lctg2 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Text/Corpus Linguistics; Typology 

Call Deadline: 15-Nov-2008 

Meeting Description:

The Second International Conference on Language Contact in Times of
Globalization will focus on the effects of language contacts as a result of the
on-going globalization process. 

Call for Papers 

This is the Final Call for Papers for the Second International Conference on
Language Contact in Times of Globalization (LCGT2 2009)

The deadline has been extended to 15 November 2008. Confirmation of attendance
will be sent out before 15 December 2008.

Almost two decades ago a tradition of organizing international conferences with
a focus on language contacts was established at the University of Groningen. It
started in November 1991 with a conference on Finno-Ugric languages amidst
Slavic and Germanic language communities. Since then similar international
conferences have been held in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2006. 

As a follow-up to the successful first International Conference on Language
Contact in Times of Globalization in 2006 (of which the proceedings will be
published in 2008), the University of Groningen is organizing a second
conference on June 4-6, 2009. This conference is one of the cultural and
scholarly activities planned for this year, which has been proclaimed Year of
the Hanseatic League by the Cultural Forum of Groningen. The festivities for
this occasion include an exhibition in the Groningen Museum, an international
congress of historians, and numerous other activities. Although the League was
mainly an economic organization, it was also a major instigator of prolonged
linguistic contacts in medieval times. 

This second conference will largely focus on the same theme as the previous one,
i.e. the effects of language contacts as a result of the on-going globalization
process. The organizers, however, feel that language contact should not only be
seen as a recent development, but much more as a process of all ages happening
at all locations where cultures come into contact with each other. 

The Hanseatic League is but one example of early language contact, there are of
course many more. We therefore welcome papers related to all issues on language
contact and language change from a synchronic and diachronic perspective. We are
pleased to announce that Prof. George van Driem (University of Leiden), Prof.
Johanna Nichols (University of California, Berkeley), Prof. Pekka Sammallahti
(University of Oulu) and Prof. Peter Schrijver (University of Utrecht) have
agreed to give plenary lectures. 

We invite speakers from around the world to send in papers (30 minutes) on this
particular theme. Abstracts must not exceed 500 words and should be sent by
email attachment (word or rtf file) to lctg2@rug.nl by 15 November 2008.
Notification on acceptance will be sent out by 15 December 2008. The
registration fee will be 100 euros until 1 April 2009, after which it will be
120 euros. A peer-reviewed selection of the contributions is planned to appear
after the conference.
