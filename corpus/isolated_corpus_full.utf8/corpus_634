quality and significance within the disciplines of cognitive science,
including, but not limited to, philosophy, psychology, linguistics,
artificial intelligence, neuroscience, aesthetics, anthropology, and
education, insofar as it is deemed to be of interest to those who pursue
the study of mind. In particular, we would like to encourage submissions
that cross the traditional disciplinary boundaries in themes and methods.

The JCS showcases quality research, improves the exchange of ideas, and
illustrates the interdisciplinary work that is the hallmark of the
cognitive science field. Contributions may be in the form of articles,
brief reports, reviews, or squibs.
