Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2009=20

Meeting Description:

Under the impact of ICTs in general and portable technologies in particular=
, mLearning (mobile learning) is becoming a vibrant variety of e-learning. =
In close connection with its disciplinary neighbours like CALL, CMC or Dist=
ance Learning, mLearning is challenging conventional teaching-and-learning =
practices, thereby becoming a fundamental area for future developments of a=
utonomy and independence in second language acquisition.

In this context, the EU-funded Lingua Projects EUROPODIANS (Language Course=
s for Mobile Technologies) and AMICITIAS (Ambient Intelligence as a Compell=
ing Instructional Tool for Interlinguistic and Intercultural Skills) will b=
e hosting a conference in the city of Toledo (Spain) on 18-20 September 200=
9. This conference invites 20-minute sessions addressing the connections be=
tween mLearning devices (iPods, PDAs, mobile phones, portable computers, et=
c.) and self-directed learning. The symposium will become a forum to share =
developments and experiences about theories, approaches, principles and app=
lications of mLearning, with a especial emphasis on the application of mLea=
rning for second language acquisition in general and learner autonomy in pa=
rticular.

The City of Toledo:

The conference will take place in the magnificent city of Toledo, World Her=
itage Site. The former capital of the Spanish Empire, and the place of co-e=
xistence of Christian, Jewish and Moorish cultures in the medieval period, =
is today a most culturally and monumentally rich tourist destination in Spa=
in, attracting millions of visitors every year. Toledo is conveniently loca=
ted, only 35 minutes from Madrid on the frequent high-speed trains servicin=
g the city. The conference venue will be the Palace of Padilla in Toledo, l=
ocated in the historic centre of Toledo.

 with, but not being limited to, issues such as the following:=20

1. Theorizing mobile learning within second-language acquisition.
2. Mobile learning and its disciplinary neighbours: ICT-based Learning, CAL=
