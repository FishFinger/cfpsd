Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics; Cognitive Science; General Linguistics; Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: 21-Apr-2008 

Meeting Description:

In this workshop we aim to further the study of bi- and multilingual processing by bringing together researchers working on various aspects of language processing in bi- and multilingual subjects. 

Call for Papers

The last 15 years or so brought extensive research on the representation and processing of language in bilingual subjects. Numerous models of the bilingual mental lexicon have been constructed (e.g. Kroll & Stewart 1994). There is agreement among researchers that the two languages of a bilingual person must be somehow integrated. With the advent of yet another language into the mind of the speaker, his/her linguistic processing changes not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, which makes multilinguals a new and particularly interesting research group. In recent years there have been a number of studies attempting to extend the scope of bilingualism research to include the processing of multiple languages (e.g. van Hell & Dijkstra 2002, Hall & Ecke 2003) and the processing of figurative language (e.g. Matlock & Heredia 2002). 

We invite contributions on topics related to the following:

- bi/multilingual research methods 
- on-line experimentation with multilinguals as a window into multiple language processing and storage
- contributions of theoretical insights from general linguistics to research into the multilingual lexicon 
- cross-linguistic factors in multilingual processing 
- figurative language (idioms, metaphor, simile, proverbs, irony)processing in bi/multilinguals 
- differences between figurative language processing in L1 and L2 

Deadline for submissions is April 21st, 2008. Please do not submit your proposal via the PLM website but send an abstract (no longer than 500 words, excluding references) directly to the session organizers.

This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to help keep 
the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for the coming year.

See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our Fund Drive 
2008 LINGUIST List Circus and join us on our many shows!

http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2008/

There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at  
https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go to:
https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how to 
donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit:

The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and as such 
can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a registered 501(c) 
Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 38-6005986. These donations 
can be offset against your federal and sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax 
payers only). For more information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your 
financial advisor.

Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will match any 
gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this entails your contacting 
your human resources department and sending us a form that the EMU Foundation fills 
in and returns to your employer. This is generally a simple administrative procedure 
that doubles the value of your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. 
Please take a moment to check if your company operates such a program.

Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
