             TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES  TLT-2006
                  5th International Workshop

           Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                    http://www.tlt2006.org


Workshop motivation and aims
----------------------------

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase
level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important
for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language
processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and
linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going projects
on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack
them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a
number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific
purposes for languages that already have them (English). In addition,
there are projects that go beyond syntactic analysis to include
different kinds of semantic and pragmatic annotation. We specifically
encourage submissions that discuss the relations and links between, and
possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and contents/pragmatic annotation; also, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation
schemas, theories and applications are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved
that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other
dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the
Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG
Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank, etc.).
Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories
need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary
information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of
co-located events surrounding it (for more information see
www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol, Bulgaria
in September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the
second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December 2005
(http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html).

Topics of interest
------------------

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and
linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development;
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research;
- semantically annotated treebanks;
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks;
- tools for creation and management of treebanks;
- standards for treebanks.

Important dates
---------------

(Always midnight, UTC, ignoring DST)

Deadline for paper submission:                    September 8, 2006
Notification of acceptance:                       October 8, 2006
Final version of paper for workshop proceedings:  October 29, 2006
Workshop:                                         December 1-2, 2006

Submission
----------

Please note that this time, we require full papers (max. length: 12
pages A4) be submitted, describing existing research connected to the
topics of the workshop. Please note that as reviewing will be blind, the
submissions should not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead,
use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...".
Electronic submission (ps or pdf) is strongly encouraged.  Each
submission should additionally include in the accompanying email: title;
author(s); affiliation(s); and contact author's e-mail address, adn
their postal address.

Submissions should be sent to submit@tlt2006.org (or directly to
tlt06@ufal.mff.cuni.cz) clearly indicating in the subject line "TLT06
submission".

The presentation at the workshop will be 25 minutes long (20 minutes for
presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion). The final
version of the accepted papers may not exceed 12 A4 pages (please take
into consideration that the final proceeding format will be A5, i.e.
final camera-ready papers will be reduced in size by a factor of 0,71).
