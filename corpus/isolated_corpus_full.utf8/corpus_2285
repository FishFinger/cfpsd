Meeting Description

HPSG-2008 will take place in July, 2008 near the historic cities of Nara and
Kyoto in Japan. 

The 15th International Conference on
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar
28-30 July, 2008


Invited Speakers

Mutsumi Imai (Keio University)
Tibor Kiss (Ruhr-Universit''at Bochum)
(more to be announced)

Abstracts are solicited for presentations which address linguistic,
foundational, or computational issues relating to the framework of Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar. Each presentation will be allotted 40 minutes, but the
talk itself must be at most 30 minutes long, leaving at least 10 minutes for
discussion.

The last day of the conference will be devoted to a workshop on ''Grammar at the
Interfaces'', whose purpose is to explore not just various problems regarding
grammar-internal interfaces (such as the syntax-semantics
interface and the morphology-syntax interface) but also issues surrounding the
interface between competence grammar and extragrammatical factors.


Submissions

We will use an online submission system. All abstracts should be submitted via
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpsg2008 Abstracts should be in PDF
format and should not be more than 5 (five) pages long.

Please direct any questions to the Program Committee Chair:
hpsg2008@easychair.org

Abstracts for the main conference should mention 'HPSG-08' and abstracts for the
workshop should mention 'Workshop-08' in the title.  All abstracts will be
reviewed anonymously by at least two reviewers.  Abstracts should not include
the authors' names and authors are asked to avoid self-references.  The Program
Committee reserves the right to reassign accepted papers from the main
conference to the workshop, and vice versa.


Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: March 1, 2008
Notification of acceptance: April 15, 2008
Conference: July 28-30, 2008
