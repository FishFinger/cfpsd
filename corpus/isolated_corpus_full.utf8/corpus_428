Spoken language translation technologies attempt to cross the language
barriers between people having different native languages who each
want
to engage in conversation by using their mother-tongue.
Spoken language translation has to deal with problems of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT).

In this workshop, we focus on the translation of spontaneous speech
which
includes ill-formed utterances due to grammatical incorrectness,
incomplete
sentences, and redundant expressions. The impact of spontaneity
aspects
on the ASR and MT systems performance as well as the robustness of
state-of-the-art MT engines towards speech recognition errors will be
investigated in detail.

=== Technical Paper

The workshop invites technical papers related to spoken language
translation.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Spontaneous speech translation
  * Domain and language portability
  * MT using comparable and non-parallel corpora
  * Phrase alignment algorithms
  * MT decoding algorithms
  * MT evaluation measures

  + Important Dates:

    September 15, 2006 -- Paper Submission Due [23:59 JST]
      October 17, 2006 -- Notification of Acceptance 
      October 27, 2006 -- Camera-ready Submission Due

=== Evaluation Campaign

The workshop invites any type of machine translation system, whereby
the translation directions are Arabic/Chinese/Italian/Japanese into
English
using various input conditions like 1-BEST or N-BEST-lists extracted
from provided recognizer outputs.
Each Participant in the evaluation campaign is requested to submit a
paper
describing the utilized MT system and to report results using the
provided test data.
Details on the evaluation campaign can be found on the workshop
homepage:

                 http://www.slc.atr.jp/IWSLT2006
