Full Title: Journal of Logic, Language and Information 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: 01-Mar-2008 

Special Issue on Hybrid Logic

        Important Dates
        Paper submission: March 1, 2008
        Notification of acceptance: June 1, 2008
        Publication: by the end of 2008

        General Information

        Hybrid logic is a branch of modal logic in which it is possible to
        directly refer  to worlds/times/states or whatever the elements of the
        (Kripke) model are meant  to represent. Although they date back to the
        late 1960s, and have been  sporadically investigated ever since, it is
        only in the 1990s that work on them  really got into its stride.

        It is easy to justify interest in hybrid logic on applied grounds,
        because of the  usefulness of the additional expressive power. For
        example, when reasoning about time one often wants to build up a series
        of assertions about what happens at a  particular instant, and standard
        modal formalisms do not allow this. What is less  obvious is that the
        route hybrid logic takes to overcome this problem often  actually
        improves the behaviour of the underlying modal formalism. For example,
        it becomes far simpler to formulate modal tableau, resolution, and
        natural  deduction in hybrid logic, and completeness and interpolation
        results can be  proved of a generality that is not available in
orthodox
        modal logic.

        This special issue has its origin in the International Workshop on
        Hybrid Logic  (HyLo 2007), which was held 6-10 August in Dublin,
Ireland
        as part of the  European Summer School in Logic, Language, and
        Information (ESSLLI 2007).  The HyLo 2007 workshop continued a
series of
        previous workshops on hybrid logic.

        Topics

        Topics of interest include not only standard hybrid-logical machinery
        like  nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, but
        generally  extensions of modal logic that increase its expressive
power.

        Submissions

        This special issue welcomes original high-quality contributions that
        have been  neither published in nor submitted to any journals or
        refereed conferences.  All submissions will be refereed to usual
journal
        standards.

        Submissions should not exceed 30 pages and preferably be formatted
        according to  the guidelines for Journal of Logic, Language and
        Information  (see 'Instructions for Authors' at the web-page of the
        journal).   Submissions should be sent to Torben Braüner (as PDF file):
        torben@ruc.dk.  Please put 'JoLLI submission' in the subject field and
        include the following  information in the body of the email: paper
        title, author names, email  address of the contact author, and a short
        abstract.
