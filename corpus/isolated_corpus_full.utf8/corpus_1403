Advances in Human-Computer Interaction

Aims and Scope & Call for Papers

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction is an interdisciplinary
journal that publishes theoretical and applied papers covering the
broad spectrum of interactive systems. The journal is inherently
interdisciplinary, publishing original research in the fields of
computing, engineering, artificial intelligence, psychology,
linguistics, and social and system organization, as applied to the
design, implementation, application, analysis, and evaluation of
interactive systems.

Subject areas covered by the journal include (but are not limited to):

o Human-computer interaction
o Interface design and universal design/access
o Predictive models and theories of interaction
o Adaptive and intelligent systems
o Speech, graphic, haptic, and multimodal interaction
o Natural language systems and methods
o Mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous computing systems
o Computer mediated communication methods and systems
o Virtual, mixed, and augmented reality interfaces and systems
o Agent-based interfaces and systems
o System and user evaluation studies

As an open access journal, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction
enables immediate, world-wide, barrier-free, online access to the
full text of its research articles. The main advantage of open access
journals is that their readership is not limited to subscribing
institutes, leading to higher rates of downloads and citations than
comparable subscription-based journals. Additionally the journal has
a distinguished International Editorial Board with extensive academic
qualifications, ensuring that the journal maintains high scientific
standards and have a broad international coverage.

Furthermore, the articles of the journal are electronically published
on an accelerated article-by-article basis as soon as they are
accepted for publication in order to rapidly disseminate the published
content to the readership of the journal.

Manuscripts are invited and should be submitted by one of the authors
of the manuscript through the electronic Manuscript Tracking System
(MTS) at http://www.hindawi.com/mts/. All manuscripts are subject to
peer review and are expected to meet standards of academic excellence.
Submissions will be considered by an associate editor and independant
peer-reviewers, whose identities will remain anonymous to the authors.

We would like to take this opportunity to invite you to submit
your next paper for publication in the journal and maximize the
readership and impact of your research articles.

With many thanks and best regards,
