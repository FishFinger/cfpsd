  NASSLLI 2010
  North American Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 2010
  June 21-26, Indiana University

  CALL for COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The fourth NASSLLI (after previous editions at Stanford University,  =

Indiana University, and UCLA) will return to  Bloomington, Indiana,  =

June 21 - 25, 2010. The summer school, loosely modeled on the long- =

running ESSLLI series in Europe, will consist of a number of courses  =

and workshops, selected on the basis of the proposals. By default,  =

courses and workshops meet for 90 minutes on each of five days.

Proposals are invited that present interdisciplinary work between the  =

areas of logic, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science,  =

philosophy and artificial intelligence, though work in just one area  =

is within the scope of the summer school if it can be applied in  =

other fields. Examples of possible topics (adapting from previous  =

NASSLLI courses) would include e.g. logics for communication,  =

computational semantics, game theory (for logic, language and/or  =

computation), dynamic semantics, modal logics, linear logic, machine  =

learning techniques, statistical language models, and automated  =

theorem proving. We encourage potential course or workshop  =

contributors to check out previous programs at:
  http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/nasslli04/program.html
  http://www.stanford.edu/group/nasslli/
  http://www.indiana.edu/~nasslli/2003/program.html

Courses and workshops should aim to be accessible to an  =

interdisciplinary, graduate level audience.  Courses may certainly  =

focus on a single area, but lecturers should then include  =

introductory background, try to avoid specialized notation that  =

cannot be applied more widely, and spend time on the question of how  =

the topic is relevant to other fields.  A workshop can be more  =

accessible if its program is bracketed by broader-audience talks that  =

introduce and summarize the week's presentations.

  Associated Workshops/Conferences:
In addition to courses and workshops taking place during the main  =

NASSLLI five day session, Indiana University welcomes proposals for  =

1-3 day workshops or conferences hosted on campus immediately before  =

or after the summer school, thus on the weekends of June 18-20 and  =

June 27-29 2010. Previous such associated meetings have included a  =

Mathematics of Language conference and Theoretical Aspects of  =

Reasoning About Knowledge (TARK).

  Submission Details:
Submissions should be by email, and should indicate
1) person(s) and affiliation
2) type of event (one week course or workshop, 2 hours a day)
3) an outline of the course up to 500 words
4) an indication of whether special equipment is needed to teach that
	course (beamer, computer ...)
5) a statement about the instructor's experience in teaching in
	interdisciplinary settings
6) expected costs (whether you want to be paid hotel and/or travel, and
	descriptions of funding in hand or for which you will apply)

  Financial Details:
A course may be taught by one or two persons. Conference fees are  =

waived for all instructors. However, we are only able to pay for the  =

full travel and expenses of one instructor per course. If two persons  =

are lecturing, they may share a lump sum paid for both. We must also  =

stress that while proposals from all over the world are welcomed, the  =

Summer School can in general guarantee only toreimburse travel costs  =

for travel from destinations within North America to Bloomington,  =

although exceptions can be made depending on the financial situation.  =

Furthermore, we encourage all lecturers to fund their own travel if  =

this is feasible, since this will allow us to use our available  =

funding for student scholarships.

Workshops are more complicated financially than courses, and a  =

proposal for a workshop should include a plan to obtain some outside  =

funding for the speakers.

  Notifications of Interest:
To give us an idea about the number of submissions, we would like you  =

to email us, ideally within two weeks, in case you are interested in  =

submitting a proposal. This will not commit you to actually submit  =

one (and not emailing in advance does not preclude you from  =

submitting a full proposal).

  Schedule:
Jun 18 on, 2009 - unofficial notifications of intention to submit;
Sep 15,    2009 - Deadline for submissions;
Nov 1,     2009 - Course/workshop proposers notified of p.c. decisions;
Nov 15,    2009 - Official announcement of program;
May 15,    2009 - Material for courses available for printing;
Jun 21,    2010 - Start of NASSLLI 2010 courses.
