Meeting Description:

Special Theme: Language data, corpora, and computational pragmatics

The conference is open to all other pragmatics-related topics as well  (where pragmatics is conceived broadly as a cognitive, social, and  cultural perspective on language and communication).

Panels on a wide range of topics are already being prepared.  A  tentative list (with provisional titles) includes: Arguing from large  corpora (Igor ?agar), Comparative studies of professional and  institutional activities (Per Linell), Computational pragmatics (Robin  Cooper), Contrastive pragmatics (Karin Aijmer), Conversation analysis  (John Heritage), Corpus-based multilingual approach to youngspeak  (Anna-Brita Stenström), Corpus-based pragmatics (Jens Allwood), Corpus orales del español/Spanish oral corpora (Antonio Briz), Corpus  work on argumentation (Jean Goodwin), Gender and discourse analysis  (Susan Ehrlich, Ruth Wodak), Intention, common ground, and the  egocentric speaker-hearer (István Kecskés, Jacob Mey), Language and  gender in  Japan (Miyako Inoue), Methods in pragmatics (Jan-Ola  Östman), Multimodality (Theo van Leeuwen),  Multimodal text  analysis - a corpus-based approach (Yueguo Gu), Pragmatics and  communication disorders (Elisabeth Ahlsén), Pragmatic!
 s of English  lingua franca (Juliane House, István Kecskés), Reference (Thorstein  Fretheim), Speech acts and/or dynamic semantics (Mitchell Green),  Text mining (Walter Daelemans).

Plenary lecturers will include (with tentative indication of topic area):
- Douglas Biber (Flagstaff, Arizona; pragmatics and corpora)
- Bill Hanks (Berkeley; Maya discourse genres and missionization)
- Susan HEerring (Bloomington; computer-mediated communication)
- Jan-Ola Östman (Helsinki; addressing Nordic language issues)
- Udaya Sing (Mysore; endangered languages)
- Yorick Wilks (Sheffield; computational pragmatics) 

The pragmatics of news production processes:

Convenors:
Tom Van Hout (UGent)
Lut Lams (KU Brussel)
Geert Jacobs (UGent)

By and large, media language research has traditionally applied a product view to the study of the news, focusing for example on textual analyses of print media or on transcript-based analyses of broadcast media. Conversely, while research into news making processes features prominently within communication and journalism studies, the focus here is usually on macro-level issues such as the asymmetry of information flows, rather than on language use. 

The panel we are proposing merges both interests in that it intends to examine the discursive practices that lie at the heart of the news production process, including, but not limited to, editorial norms and journalistic writing routines.  In addition, this panel also welcomes contributions addressing theoretical and/or methodological aspects of the news production process.  

We welcome other participants to join this panel with their contributions on related research and look forward to pooling our interests and insights with the aim to publish the papers presented during the panel.  Participants are free to present work in progress, completed research or position papers (20 min. presentation slots plus discussion time).  For the purpose of this panel, the term news media comprises print media (newspapers, magazines), broadcast media (television, radio) and online media (e-zines, blogs, podcasts). 

Abstracts of up to 350 words (excluding references) should be sent to tom.vanhout@ugent.be. Proposals should contain: title of proposed paper, author name and affiliation, contact details and an abstract.  The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 8 September 2006.
