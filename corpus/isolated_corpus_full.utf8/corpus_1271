Meeting Description:

Greek and Latin from an Indo-European Perspective 2 is a conference for young
researchers with an interest in diachronic linguistics and the Classical Languages. 

Greek and Latin from an Indo-European Perspective 2 

The Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Arts and Ideas at the
University of Oslo will host the conference: Greek and Latin from an
Indo-European Perspective, July 5-6 (and, depending on the number of
contributions, also July 7), 2007. The conference is a sequel to the very
successful 2005 conference in Cambridge, UK.

Call for Papers 

Submissions are invited for papers that demonstrate how linguistic comparison
can cast new light on all aspects of the Greek and Latin languages and,
conversely, how the study of Greek and Latin continues to play a key role in the
refinement of the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European and in diachronic
linguistics in general. We also welcome papers that discuss aspects of the PIE
inheritance in Greek and Latin from the viewpoint of general linguistics. 

Those wishing to offer a paper are kindly requested to submit a one-page
abstract to gliep-oslo@ifikk.uio.no. The talk should last 20 minutes and will be
followed by 10 minutes of discussion. Abstracts should arrive no later than the
15th of April. Notification of acceptance will be given within the 1st of May.
The conference is aimed at graduate students, PhDs and other researchers in the
early stages of their academic career, and preference will be given to such
speakers. There is no registration fee. 


Keynote Speakers:

Pierluigi Cuzzolin (University of Bergamo) 

Andrew Garrett (University of California at Berkeley)

Call Deadline: 31-May-2007 

Meeting Description:

Parallel Session on 'Tense, Aspect, and Modality' at the 18th International
Congress of Linguists, Seoul, July 2008 

Parallel Session at the 
18th International Congress of Linguists (CIL 18)
July 21-26 2008, Seoul, Republic of Korea

Tense, Aspect and Modality

Organizer: Johan van der Auwera (University of Antwerp, Belgium)

The study of tense, aspect and modality (and mood) remains an important field of
linguistics, not least also because of our increased knowledge of the variety
found in the world's languages (see e.g. the World Atlas of Language Structures,
ed. by M. Haspelmath et al, Oxford University Press, 2005). 

Submissions are invited for twenty minute talks (15 minutes for presentation
plus 5 minutes for questions), in either English or French, on any topic
relating to the general domain of tense, aspect, modality, and mood. Of
particular interest will be research that takes one or more of the following
perspectives:

- the synchronic relation between the three (or four) domains: e.g., do choices
in one domain (e.g. modality) restrict the choices in another one (e.g. aspect)?
what is the relation between modality (minimally understood as the study of
necessity and possibility and maximally also including volition and
evidentially) and mood (distinctions such as indicative vs. subjunctive)? what
is the relation between the concept of irrealis and those of mood and modality?

- the diachronic relations between the domains: e.g., how do aspect systems
develop into tense systems? how does a tense acquire a modal meaning? 

- the cross-linguistic study of tense of tense, aspect, modality and mood,
either from a global point of view or a more restricted one (language family or
linguistic area)

Preference is given to presentations that will achieve a cross-theoretical
understanding.

Important Dates:

Deadline for Abstract Submission: May 31, 2007
Notification of Acceptance/Rejection: August 31, 2007

Submission of Abstracts:

A two-page abstract including everything should be sent electronically to both
cil18@cil18.org and johan.vanderauwera@ua.ac.be. Special characters should be in
Unicode. An MS Word and/or PDF file is strongly preferred.
