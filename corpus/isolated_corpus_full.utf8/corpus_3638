Full Title: Language Policy and Planning in the Mediterranean 
Short Title: LPLPM 

Date: 17-Oct-2009 - 19-Oct-2009
Location: Nicosia, Cyprus 
Contact Person: Pavlos Pavlou
Meeting Email: ppavlou@ucy.ac.cy

Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2009 

Meeting Description:

First International Conference on Language Policy and Language Planning in the
Mediterranean (1st MedLPLP)
University of Cyprus, Nicosia
17-19 October, 2009

The conference will focus on language policy and language planning issues in the
countries of the Mediterranean basin. 

Call for Papers 

The Mediterranean has traditionally been considered a unitary space on
historical, social and cultural grounds. More recent research suggests, on the
other hand, that the idea of Mediterranean as a unitary cultural, sociological
or historical space is rather a scientific construct, the "Mediterranist
construct", and point to important dissimilarities between the various
Mediterranean lands and cultures. Irrespective, however, of their similarities
and differences, or rather because of them, the Mediterranean Basin offers the
image of a "dialogic space" where influences travel north and south, east and
west of the waters. By bringing together specialists from various parts of the
Mediterranean world this conference aims to explore how unity and singularity
are witnessed in the area of LPLP and promote a fruitful dialogue among scholars
working on the languages spoken in the Mediterranean Basin. Special emphasis
will be given to: 
(a) the dynamics of the relation between macro- and micro- perspectives in LPLP
and the way these perspectives interact to transform the Mediterranean into a
common "dialogic space";
(b) the interaction between national and local objectives of LPLP, especially as
regards minority or lesser used languages, oral varieties or small language
communities; 
(c) new developments or insights that the study of and comparative work on LPLP
in the Mediterranean societies bring about;
The conference particularly welcomes contributions from the Euro-Mediterranean
countries. Scholars in any area of language policy or language planning, from
both synchronic and diachronic perspectives, are invited to submit their proposals.

Keynote speakers who have already confirmed participation
-Louis-Jean Calvet, University of Aix en Provence, France
-Bernard Spolsky, University of Bar Ilan, Israel

Proposals for individual papers

file: [MedLPLP[surname of major author]], e.g. MedLPLPSmith]. Authors are
