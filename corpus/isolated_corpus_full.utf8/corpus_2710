Call Deadline: 01-Jun-2008 

Call for Abstracts
Special issue of IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication
to focus on
Assessment in Professional Communication
 
Deadline for Proposals:  June 1, 2008
Guest Editor: Thomas Orr, Center for Language Research, University of Aizu

Assessment is a crucial activity for effective decision-making in every
profession.  
 
Determining how to make useful and reliable assessments, however, is not
easy. What kind of information is needed?  What are the best tools and
procedures for obtaining it?  What criteria should be used to make
judgments?  These are just a few of the questions that designers of tests,
questionnaires, interviews, needs analysis, and other means of assessment
must consider before they proceed with a plan.  

This special issue invites researchers and experienced practitioners to
share the results of their research and experience via research papers,
tutorials, and teaching cases, as well as book reviews of recent
publications on assessment relative to assessing communication in the
professions. Of particular interest is assessment of professional
communication skills in the fields of science, engineering, or technology
in university or workplace contexts, as well as training programs for skill
development in those fields. Assessment research and practice related to
communication and communication training in other professions, of course,
is welcome too.       
Possible topic areas for this special issue include but are not limited to
the following:
-	Assessment of communication skills for program admission or graduation
decisions in science, engineering, computing, etc.  
-	Needs assessment for the design of communication training programs for
professional development in particular professions 
-	Assessment of professional communication skills for hiring, promotion, or
placement decisions
-	Development or evaluation of pre- and post-assessment tools to measure
progress in profession-related communication skills
-	Development of new technologies to measure professional communication skills
-	Development of new methods or procedures for measuring professional
communication skills 
-	Development of goals, standards, benchmarks, evaluation criteria, etc.
for the assessment of professional communication skills
-	Studies of communication needs in various professions to ground
curriculum planning and assessment development 
-	Research-based critiques of current assessment problems and shortcomings
-	Evaluative surveys of existing assessment tools, programs, and methodologies
-	Research-grounded discussions of issues in assessment theory related to
professional communication skills or programs
-	Case studies of effective use of assessment tools or procedures
-	Research on any aspect of an assessment process, such as assessment
design, implementation, data collection, data interpretation, data use, etc.
