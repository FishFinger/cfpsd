LOCATION

Plzeò (Pilsen) is located in Western Bohemia on the confluence of four
rivers. With 170 thousand inhabitants it is the fourth largest city in
the Czech Republic and an important industrial, commercial, cultural,
and administrative center.

Plzeò is well known for its brewing tradition. The trademark
Pilsner-Urquell penetrated all over the world thanks to the
traditional recipe, high quality hops and good wells. Beer lovers will
also appreciate a visit to the Brewery museum or the Brewery itself.

Apart from its famous beer, Plzeò has a lot of hidden treasures in its
core.  Plzeò can pride itself on the second largest synagogue in
Europe. The old city center is dominated by a 13th-century Gothic
church which features the highest tower in Bohemia (102.34 m). It is
possible to go up the stairs and admire the panorama. Not far from the
church is a splendid Renaissance Town Hall from 1558 and plenty of
pleasant cafes and pubs.

Plzeò has also a beautiful historical underground under the city
center there are 25 km of tunnels. Visitors can pass through the most
beautiful part of thislabyrinth.

It is also recommended to visit the zoo having the second largest
space for bears in Europe and keeping the Komodo dragons - large
lizards existing in only a few zoos in the world.

In the neighborhood of the city there are castle Radynì and
hunting-seat Kozel. St. Peter's Rotunda in Starý Plzenec was built in
the 10th century.

The University of West Bohemia in Plzeò provides a variety of courses
for both Czech and international students. It is the only institution
of higher education in this part of the country which prepares
students for careers in engineering (electrical and mechanical),
science (computer science, applied mathematics, physics, and
mechanics), education (both primary and secondary), economics,
philosophy, politology, archaeology, anthropology, foreign languages,
law and public administration, art and design.


GETTING THERE

The city has an access from the D5 highway connecting Prague (Praha)
with Germany. Plzeò has a very good bus and train connections with the
capital Prague (takes about 1 - 1.5 hour). From the international
airport Prague - Ruzynì you can reach Plzeò by frequent public
transport in 1.5 - 2 hours.


SOCIAL EVENTS

The international conference will also include social events and trips
i.e.  visit of brewery and city sightseeing.
