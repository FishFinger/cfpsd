Meeting Description:

The conference is the first open conference arranged by the CALPIU network for the study of cultural and linguistic practices in international universities. The network focuses on the function of language in social and cultural practice at the international university, especially the significance of language proficiency and language choice within a context marked by the development of power relations and hierarchies of influence. It also considers the significance of these power relations and hierarchies of influence vis-à-vis the organisation, didactics, learning processes and academic content of educational programmes in the humanities and social and natural sciences. 

Call for Papers

Cultural and Linguistic Practices in International Universities.

Conference 2008

International conference hosted by Roskilde University Monday, December 15, 2008 - Wednesday, December 17, 2008

The CALPIU Network:
The aim of the CALPIU network is to prepare an international Centre for Cultural and Linguistic Practices in the International University, and thereby to coordinate Danish, Nordic and international research into a new theoretical understanding of internationalization processes currently underway in universities and other institutions of higher education. 

The CALPIU Network was initiated by a group of researchers within sociolinguistics, conversation analysis, discourse, and communication analysis at Roskilde University, Denmark. It now links more than 40 senior and junior researchers from 21 univer­sities and research centres in Denmark, other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway and Sweden), and beyond (Australia, Japan, India, China, UK, and Spain). The Network is funded by the Danish Research Council for Culture and Communication. 

The Conference: 
The purpose of the conference is to discuss various aspects of the consequences of student mobility. Transnational student mobility makes adaptation and learning both necessary and possible; and involves cultural as well as linguistic accommodation and learning processes. In order to further theoretical understanding of these processes, we need to understand the consequences of  the huge increase in the use of English as a lingua franca by academic teachers and students, the equally huge increase in learning and use of other languages, as well as the development of active and passive multilingualism and language alternation in interaction. 

There will be three keynote lectures by: 
Masako K. Hiraga, Graduate School of Intercultural Communication of Rikkyo University, Tokyo 
Jennifer Jenkins, Department of Modern Languages at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom 
Johannes Wagner, University of Southern Denmark, Kolding and Maurice Nevile, School of Languages and International Studies, University of Canberra, Australia 

Papers will be organized in panels of three types: 
Featured panels (prearranged by the organizers, participation on invitation) 
Proposed Panels (proposed and arranged by participants) 
Organized panels (put together from individual paper proposals) 
Each panel will consist of one or more 'slots' of 80 minutes each. A panel has a chairperson and (optional) discussant. 

Topics for Panels and Papers: 
Topics will include, but not be restricted to, the following: 
English as a lingua franca in international university programs 
Other lingue franche in international university programs 
'Bilingual' and 'monolingual' media in learning and teaching 
The cultural role of the transnational students' mother tongue (or language of primary literalization) in learning in a foreign language context 
Teaching in another language 
Learning in another language 
Teacher roles and authenticity 
Language hierarchies in the international university 
Relevant study skills in an international context 
Academic literacy and 'Widening Participation' in Higher Education 
Interactional aspects and group dynamics 
Communication, interaction and identity construction among different groups of students and teachers (nationality, ethnicity, class, gender, race, age, discipline etc.) 

Proposal Format: 
Please send proposals for papers and panels by May 1, 2008. Contact address is calpiu08@ruc.dk. 

Proposals for Individual Papers: 
Length of abstract: 200 to 400 words 
Note that individual papers will be bundled into 'organized panels' (see above) when they are accepted. 

Panels Proposed by Participants: 
Please send a description of the proposed panel (about 200 to 600 words) and abstracts of individual papers (200 to 400 words). 

Panels will typically consist of 3-4 closely connected papers. Each panel will have a chair (organizer) and optionally a discussant. 

Venue and Registration: 
The conference is hosted by Roskilde University (www.ruc.dk). 
The venue is Comwell Conference Hotel in Roskilde, Denmark 
Registration will start on Sunday, December 14, 2008. Lectures and panels will start Monday morning, December 15. The conference ends Wednesday, December 17, after lunch. 

Roskilde is situated about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The nearest international Airport is Copenhagen, connected to Roskilde by frequent trains (travel time about 40 minutes). 

Deadline for final registration is September 1, 2008. Details about conference fee, accommodation, refunds in case of cancellation etc. will be published soon on CALPIU's web site, calpiu.dk

Why ILINTEC?
 
The core idea of ILINTEC'08 is to bring together researchers who explore different paradigms of language and speech processing; special emphasis is laid on interaction of stochastic techniques and logical methods. ILINTEC'08 is a unique opportunity to discuss the problems of natural language processing in immediate contact with the leading research and development teams from universities and industry engaged in information technology projects and various fields of Computer Science.
 
The Scope of the Workshop:
The workshop is centered around but not limited to the topics given below:
- Machine translation;
- Text retrieval;
- Information extraction;
- Applications of machine learning to speech and language processing;
- Neural networks for speech and language structures recognition;
- Algorithms of morphological and syntactic analysis of natural languages;
- Word class and part-of speech tagging for text corpora;
- Parsing with context-free grammars, unification grammars, etc.;
- Lexicalized and probabilistic parsing;
- Meaning representation, semantic analysis;
- Word sense disambiguation and information retrieval;
- Reference resolution;
- Natural language generation
