Submissions are refereed and selected on the basis of quality and relevance to psychologists, philosophers and linguists. All submissions  must include an abstract of  250 words maximum, in addition to a 750 word summary (psychology and linguistics) or a short paper (philosophy). Potential convenors of symposium submissions should email the description and list of speakers directly to one of the programme chairs by 1 February 2008. 

We particularly welcome POSTER submissions.  Posters will be displayed throughout the conference as well as at designated poster sessions.  The first author of each accepted poster (and who does not also present a paper) will get free ESPP membership for 2008.

Meeting Description:

We invite papers reporting on biomedical resources specifically used to facilitate biomedical text mining and the process of designing, building, updating, delivering, evaluating and disseminating them.

Another focus is on design guidelines, standards for building resources, storage and exchange format, interoperability of resources and last, on exploring new directions for their dissemination.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Building biomedical resources: controlled vocabularies, terminologies, ontologies, corpora
- Guidelines and annotation schemas, challenges, interoperability
- Building task-specific resources
- Reengineering existing biomedical or general language resources 
- Augmentation of resources with biomedical features 
- Update and evolution of resources
- Lightly annotated and noisy resources
- Tools for exploration of resources
- Data exchange formats
- Standards for building resources
- Documenting and disseminating resources
- Evaluation of resources
