Principles of Evaluation in Natural Language Processing.

Special Issue of the Journal 'Traitement Automatique des Langues' (TAL)

Deadline for submission: 20th November 2006

First Call

For this special issue of TAL, we invite papers about the fundamental
principles that underlie the use of evaluation methods in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). We wish to adopt a higher point of view which goes beyond
the horizon of a single evaluation campaign and have a more global approach
about the problems raised by the deployment of evaluation in NLP. Without any
prejudice, we do not wish to offer with this special issue yet another
tribune to articles relating the participation of a system in a given
evaluation campaign, or articles comparing the pros and cons of two metrics
for assessing performance in a particular task. Our intent is to address
more fundamental issues about the use of evaluation in NLP.

Topics

Specific topics include (but are not limited to):

1) Corpora in the evaluation process, their use, the development life
cycle, the synergy around the pair corpus - evaluation campaign. 

2) Evaluation as a source of creation of linguistic resources. What help
does it bring in maintaining existing resources?

3) The question of re-using 'found corpora' for evaluation, i.e. corpora
that exist, with some level of annotation that can be adapted to provide
rich 'real world' corpora with somewhat noisy or incomplete annotations.

4) To evaluate implies to have a reference against which to gauge a
performance, but how is defined the reference in NLP? How should we deal
with the problem that often the reference is not unique (e.g. in machine
translation)?

5) Which formalisms for evaluation in NLP?

6) Which characteristics should evaluation have in NLP? Comparative,
quantitative, qualitative... evaluation?

7) Technology evaluation and user/application oriented evaluation.  How are
these two different kinds of evaluation perceived by the NLP community?

8) Evaluation and scientific progress, e.g. large scale evaluation programs
in NLP.

9) Which role does evaluation play in the NLP scientific process?

10) Some domains of NLP are reputed easier for evaluation than others
(parsing, semantics, translation).  Myth or reality?
