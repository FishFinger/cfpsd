Introduction
HCSNet (www.hcsnet.edu.au) and HxI (www.hxi.org.au) are organising a
joint workshop on Collaboration and Communicative Tools for
Distributed Communities. This workshop will bring together researchers
interested in a range of current issues at the intersection of
collaboration in online communities and design & development of tools
to facilitate this. The aim is to identify shared interests,
understand different perspectives around online human-human
collaboration and communicative tools, and to take first steps towards
developing future collaborations. HCSNet will fund travel for a number
of Australian participants from outside the Sydney area.


Participation and Format
We welcome participation from a range of interests and perspectives
within the topic of understanding different perspectives around
human-human online collaboration and communicative tools, from both
academia and industry, and we would like to involve as many as
possible in discussion.

Please submit a short abstract of about 100-200 words to Kym Buckley
ky.buckley@uws.edu.au, by the date indicated below.

The format of the workshop will promote interaction and
collaboration. In particular, there will be working sessions in
collaboration with targeted industry and community end-user groups on
problems of specific interest to them.


Invited Speakers
There will be keynote presentations by two international invited
speakers, identities yet to be confirmed. One presentation will focus
on issues in design and development of tools for effective online
collaboration and community building. The other will focus on human
issues in online collaboration.
Update: We are thrilled to announce Tom Ericksonn of IBM's Social Computing Lab as one of the invited speakers!!
