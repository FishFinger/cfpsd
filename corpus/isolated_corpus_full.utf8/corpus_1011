Doctoral Consortium at the 8th EUROLAN Summer School - Semantics,
Opinion and Sentiment in Text

http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2007/DC/

July 23 - August 3, 2007, Iasi, Romania

Doctoral Consortium - Call for Papers

Submission Deadline: May 7, 2007

1. General Information

The Doctoral Consortium at EUROLAN-2007 will provide an opportunity
for graduate students (PhD and MSc heading towards PhD studies)
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing to present their current work and receive constructive
feedback and guidance on future research, both from the general
audience and the invited lecturers at the Summer School.

The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a workshop during 3 or 4
consecutive evenings (1.5 hour slots) in one of the two weeks of the
EUROLAN 2007 Summer School. The final version of the accepted papers
will be published in the Proceedings of the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral
Consortium. During the Summer School the students will present their
work, will receive constructive comments wrt. to current and future
research directions from a panel of established researchers, and will
benefit from the collaborative climate established among all
participants, thus enhancing future joint work among them. Students
will also prepare a poster which will be on display throughout the
Summer School.

We invite all interested graduate students to submit their work to the
Consortium. As the main goal of the Consortium is for the authors to
receive feedback, the emphasis is on work in progress.

The research being presented can be from any topic area within
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, however
students working in the areas related with the theme of this year's
Summer School like:

- computational semantics, 

- ontology enriched NLP applications

- opinion and sentiment analysis, 

- role of  sentiment analysis in multimodal human computer interaction 

are particularly encouraged to submit their work.

Well-known researchers from these areas will be invited lectures of
the school and therefore available for interesting discussions.

2. Submission Requirements

The submissions should describe original work, still in progress. The
submissions may have more than one author; however, all of them MUST
be students. 

The paper should include: 

- the problem(s) that the proposed research is addressing;

- the main contribution(s) of the research to the CL & NLP field; 

- the proposed solution(s), including a brief description of the
  methodology adopted;

- the future research plan. 


3. Submission Procedure

Submission must be electronic. The following formats are acceptable:
PDF (.pdf), PostScript (.ps), Rich Text Format (.rtf), Microsoft Word
(.doc). Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including references
and annexes and should follow the Springer format, soon available as a
.dot template on the web page of the event. The papers will be
uploaded on a special page, to be announced on the web page of the
Doctoral Consortium.

4. Important Dates

Paper submissions deadline: *May 7, 2007*
Notification of acceptance: May 28, 2007
Camera ready papers due: June 18, 2007
Summer School dates: July 23 - August 3, 2007

5. Registration

Authors of accepted papers must register for the Summer School and
present their work at the EUROLAN 2007 Doctoral Consortium. No
supplementary fee will be required above the EUROLAN fee. The authors
will benefit of early registration fee regardless of the date they
register. Participation in the Doctoral Consortium is open to all
EUROLAN 2007 attendants.
 
6. Travel Grants

A limited number of registration and accommodation discounts/waivers
will be available. The authors of accepted papers with reduced
possibilities to support their participation to the Doctoral
Consortium and the Summer School will have to send a motivation
letter, a CV and a recommendation letter from their Ph.D./research
advisor to the organizers. More details will be posted at the
appropriate time on the webpage of the event.
