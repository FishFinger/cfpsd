CFP: Text Perspectives in Media and Academic Discourse
Date: 23-February-2007 
From: pastalex@orel.ru 
Subject: Text Perspectives in Media and Academic Discourse - 5
Full Title: Text Perspectives in Media and Academic Discourse - 5
Short Title: TPMAD - 5
Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics, Discourse Analysis, Text Theory,
Pragmatics and Sociolinguistics
Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2007 

Text Perspectives in Media and Academic Discourse (TPMAD) is soliciting
traditional research and theory-based articles for the upcoming Vol. 5
(2007) issue. The papers from graduate students and scholars from the
humanities and social sciences are welcome. 
TPMAD is a scholarly publication that is an intellectual canvas where the
cultural and linguistic spaces and experiences of new media and scientific
discourse are theorized and rigorously explored within global and local
contingencies of the present and past. 
In particular, we encourage submission of cross-disciplinary research of
new media and academic texts, users and technologies. Works that
incorporate humanities and social science approaches to scholarship are
welcome.

The Media Discourse has taken place mainly through the channel of writing,
this definition includes a large number of functions, and the variety of
forms that this means of communication can take only parallels the
diversity of its production and reception. Relatively little research has
been carried in the area of Text perspectives in media, their social and
cultural aspects. These are important areas, but research should also
consider more language-related aspects (while also taking into account
their social and cultural contexts). If we want to gain a better
understanding of the pragmatics of natural languages, we need to understand
the nature, roles and functions of the various genres and types of Media
text and the forms of language and textuality of each type of Text. 

The notion of Academic Discourse has been under debate for a considerable
length of time. Some scholars suggest academic discourse is a genre of its
own while others maintain that it is a domain-based / discipline-bound
phenomenon.

Furthermore, relatively few researchers have been interested in comparing
academic discourse practices and traditions across disciplines and
languages. A further issue largely debated in the European context is the
impact of the emergent European research area and the relevance it bears to
the structuring of argumentation in the academic discourse. 

The aim of the publication is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for
discussing theoretical issues and innovative methodological approaches in
order to stimulate the on-going debate in this field. 

We invite papers that interpret the book theme broadly, including but not
limited to the following areas:
-	Multidisciplinary Approaches to Discourse (typology, structure, forms for
Media and Academic Texts and their purposes). 
-	Cross-cultural and Cross-linguistic Perspectives on Media and Academic
Discourse (e.g. the question of (cultural) identity, rhetorical traditions
and argumentation) 
-	Genre-related linguistic issues 
-	Communication & culture in language usage, typology, and universality 
-	Popularization and Translation of Media and Academic discourse
-	Impact of new technologies on media and academic discourse 
	Applications of the computer-based text-research

The editors encourage the submission of papers on proposed themes as well
as on other topics relevant to the interest of the Book. The language of
publication is English, German, French and Russian. 

Format: 
1. The length of a manuscript should not exceed 12 pages. 
2. A 50-word abstract and keywords should be given at the beginning of each
manuscript. 
3. Manuscripts should be submitted on A4 paper, with the margins at least 3
cm on all four sides of each sheet. They may be single-spaced.
