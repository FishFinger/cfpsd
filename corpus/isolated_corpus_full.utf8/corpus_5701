Meeting Description:

The 2nd Workshop on the Languages of Papua
Melanesian Languages on the Edge of Asia: Past, Present and Future

8-12 February 2010
Manokwari, Indonesia

This workshop will focus on the most linguistically diverse part of the world - Melanesia - which straddles countries of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Melanesia contains around a fifth of the world's 6,000 languages in less than 3% of its land area and less than 0.2% of its population. The scope of the workshop includes all languages known as 'Papuan', plus the Austronesian languages that are spoken in the vicinity of Papuan languages in New Guinea plus parts of Indonesia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands.

These languages are astonishingly diverse, barely known to science, and face the threat of extinction without trace in the coming century unless concerted international efforts are made to meet the huge challenge of documenting them. This conference addresses the scientific issues raised by these languages. The scientific part of the program will cover the whole gamut of linguistic questions from phonology to syntax to typology to historical linguistics, as well as topics bordering musicology, anthropology and prehistory, plus papers on digital archiving, documentary linguistics, scientific infrastructure and the training of linguists from minority language groups.

Besides the scientific questions, the theoretical recognition of cultural and linguistic rights of minority groups in Indonesia, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea faces enormous practical difficulties if it is to be realised, as national governments have indicated they wish, as education programs that allow children to receive part of their schooling in their mother-tongue. 

The conference will run from Monday the 8th to Friday the 12th of February 2010, and will include a free day for an excursion and informal discussions on Wednesday the 10th. The conference will be followed by a one-day master class on Field Methods and Language Resources on Saturday the 13th of February.

Invited speakers include Linda Barwick, Steven Bird, Mark Donohue, Michael Dunn, Nikolaus Himmelmann, Steve Levinson, and Ger Reesink.
