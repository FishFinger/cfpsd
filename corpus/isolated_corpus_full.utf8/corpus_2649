         Uses and usage of language resource-related standards

                          Marrakech, Morocco
                         Tuesday, 27 May 2008

************************************************************************

Uses and usage of language resource-related standards


In recent years more and more standards related to the representation
and processing of language resources (LRs) have been issued by
different organizations (e.g., ISO, Oasis, LISA, W3C, TEI etc.). While
some of these have been designed explicitly for the purpose of
modeling language (e.g., LAF, OLAC, IMDI, etc), other standards in use
in the community are originally geared to the representation of
properties of texts (e.g., TEI). Still others have been defined with
broader, not inherently language or text-related purposes in
mind. Apart from standards for representation and linguistic
description, recently standards for resource management are also
emerging.

The formal standardisation process is only one aspect of the evolution
of a standard. The application and the real use seem to be even more
important. A standard is useful for the community only if it is actually
applied. The workshop will concentrate on standards which are in use,
experiences with standards as well as tools
to enhance the use of standards. In particular we will encourage
contributions in the following areas:

(a) experiences with different types of standards:

- research contexts inviting/impeding the use of standards
- standards and exploitation of LRs
- use of language vs. text encoding standards
- use of standards for representation vs. linguistic description
- standards for different types of LRs (corpora, archives,
  dictionaries, spoken vs. written language etc)
- standards used in the localization process
- competing standards (comparison of competing standards,
  motivations for preferring one standard over another)


(b) use of standards from different vantage points:

- data providers (support for standards, e.g., data category
  registry)
- data users (e.g., standards supporting resource exploitation)
- tool developers (e.g., corpus annotation tools supporting
  standards, standards aware localization tools)


(c) new horizons in standardization

- standardization for resource management (e.g., resource
  validation) and best practices
- efforts to make language resource-related standards communicate
  with each other (e.g., mappings, upper structures)
- interaction of language resource-related standards with
  non-language data standards
- special requirements for multilingual resources
- special requirements for multimodal resources
- methodologies for the evaluation of standards
