studies. Its content varies from year to year, but typically includes: 

-General non technical introductions to contemporary linguistic research
-Intensive introductory courses to some core areas of linguistic theory or
relevant domains
-Seminars and talks on current research
-Interaction between research in grammar and some related domains e.g. 
Psycholinguistics of Acquisition or of processing, Neurolinguistics,
Experimental Pragmatics, Philosophy of Language/Mind etc... 

A poster session in which school participants can present their work will be
organized. A call for abstracts detailing submissions guidelines will be issued
shortly.
