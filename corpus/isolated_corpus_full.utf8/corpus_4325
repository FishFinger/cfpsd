Call Deadline: 15-Apr-2009 

Meeting Description:

In 2009, the Conference of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and
Language Technology is hosted by the Applied Computational Linguistics group in
the Dept. of Linguistics at Potsdam University. The Meeting will consist of a
main conference track as well as a series of workshops. 

Call for Papers

Main Conference Theme: Steps Toward Text Meaning - Aspects of Automatic Processing

Contributions to any topic related to Computational Linguistics and Language
Technology are invited, but we especially encourage submissions that are related
to the main theme. "Steps toward text meaning" are research efforts that move
beyond sentence processing and touch upon text meaning, on different levels of
description. This includes
- Deriving logical document structure
- Coreference: resolution of pronouns, definite NPs, etc.
- Thematic development
- Illocutions, discourse purposes, and their role in text structure
- Event structure and its temporal progression
- Coherence relations and rhetorical structure
- Text tiling,e.g. based on lexical cohesion.
- Methods of semantic indexing of corpora
- Named-entity recognition
- Word-sense disambiguation
- Textual entailment
- Text generation: document planning, choice of referring expressions, etc.
- Further applications operating with text meaning:
-- Classification of text type and genre
-- Information retrieval
-- Question-answering
-- Summarization
-- etc.

Invited Speakers:
Invited talks will be given by
- Johan Bos (Universit√† di Roma "La Sapienza")
- Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto)

Call for Paper

Call for Abstracts: FEL XIII
Endangered languages are often the remnants of old nations and civilizations.
Many of these languages have been widely used in vast territories for centuries
before giving way to more powerful and influential languages over a period of
time for various social, economic, literary, political, and natural reasons. It
is often precisely in the endangered languages of minorities and indigenous
peoples that scholars seek answers to the historical developments of nations,
their values and ethics, agricultural activities, habitat, way of life,
migration patterns, arts and crafts,  religious traditions, archaeological
findings, etc. Endangered languages can serve to legitimise the sovereignty of
the dominant nations, or to reaffirm their identity and authority over the
territory, often at the expense of other languages. In the process, the
endangered languages themselves may be strengthened or weakened as the past of
the nation becomes a bone of contention. History also has value in the life of a
community and can foster and promote a sense of identity among its members, thus
perhaps playing a crucial role in the preservation or revitalisation of the
endangered languages.

The conference will discuss the complex interaction of Endangered Languages and
History and how the study of history can encourage the preservation and promote
the revitalisation of endangered languages. The following are some of the
aspects of this interface which could be discussed at the conference, certainly
not an exclusive list:

- The role of endangered languages in the writing of history. Endangered
languages as a medium for history writing, a source of historical data, and a
basis for the buttressing of the historiography of a nation, region, empire, etc.
- Methods and tools used to relate history to endangered languages, including
the effects of imperialism and nationalism on their perceived status. The impact
of conquest, political annexation, economic ascendency or cultural dominance on
languages and their resulting endangerment; conversely, the contributions of
endangered languages to the evolution of the language of empire.
- Use of endangered languages in the study of literary sources and
archaeological findings. Oral history, myth and oral literature as instruments
of decipherment of sources. 
-  The use of endangered languages in strengthening historic community
identities, at any level from family to nation.   Endangered languages as a
symbol of homogeneity, an instrument of unity and a vehicle of identity.
- What history tells us about the causes and trends of language attrition,
including the role of language contact as a result of trade, war, conquest and
missionary religion. 
- How historical studies can contribute to the revitalisation of endangered
languages.
- A historical perspective on the developing study of language endangerment and
endangered languages. Historiography and epistemology of language endangerment.

The languages of the conference: English, Russian and Tajik. 
Abstract and papers will be accepted in any of these languages.

Abstract Submission:
An abstract of no more than 500 words should be submitted before 1st of March,
2009. After this deadline, abstracts will not be accepted.

It is possible to submit an abstract in English for a Russian or Tajik  papaer.
