SUBMISSION INFORMATION
The papers may be presented in any Slavic language as well as in
English. The language for submitting a paper is English.
If you intend to present a paper, please send an abstract in a plain
text file by June 30, 2005. The deadline for camera-ready version
of the paper is September 12, 2005.
The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in LaTeX
format, using the llncs2e document class. Please refer to the
instructions found on Springer website
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings
Alternatively, if you prefer to work in WYSIWIG environment,
you can submit your article in OpenOffice 1.1 format, with standard
fonts. If you need to use any special fonts, make sure they are
Truetype fonts with correct unicode table, and include the font with
your article. As a last resort, authors can submit their articles
using MS WORD (at least version 97), but they must use the LNCS
template for WORD, and be aware that the article will be converted
into OpenOffice, with any eventual loss of formatting being a sole
responsibility of the author. A PDF or PostScript version with all
