Meeting Description:

The 38th Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society 

Invited Speakers:

Gennaro Chierchia (Harvard University) 

Rose-Marie Déchaine (University of British Columbia)

Bruce Hayes (University of California, Los Angeles) 

Irene Heim (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)

The October 2007 meeting will include a main session, a poster session, and two
special sessions, one on phonology and one on semantics. The invited speakers
for the main session are Gennaro Chierchia (Harvard) and Rose-Marie Déchaine (UBC). 

The phonology special session is entitled 'Abstractness without innateness?' The
invited speaker is Bruce Hayes from UCLA. Some of the founding assumptions of
Generative Phonology involve abstract units such as distinctive features, timing
units, syllables, and constraints. The innateness of these units has been seen
as an important part of their nature. Recent work has sought to undermine the
claim that innate primitives are necessary for phonological theory, often
drawing more directly upon more concrete factors such phonetics and language
change as sources of explanation. However, a reduction in the explanatory role
of innateness does not entail a reduction in the role of abstractness in
phonology. We are soliciting abstracts for talks addressing the role of
abstractness in phonology at a time when innateness is under attack, e.g.: (i)
Evidence for the existence of abstract units in phonology, independent of
assumptions about innate abstract units, e.g. in acquisition, variation, change,
production, perception, processing, etc.; (ii) Evidence for sources of abstract
units other than Universal Grammar; (iii) Evidence that abstract units must be
innate. 

The semantics session will be on pronouns and binding. The invited speaker is
Irene Heim from MIT. This workshop aims to bring together research on pronouns
and binding from a semantic perspective. We hope the workshop will result in a
snapshot of current research, providing an overview of where things are, as well
as indications of where they might be going. We have conceived the topic rather
broadly. Possibilities include the interpretation of (specialized) pronouns,
features, the semantics of binding, reciprocity, cross-linguistic perspectives,
etc. In terms of framework, we hope to bring together papers in the tradition of
formal semantics and work in its interfaces. Papers presented in this workshop
may be included in the general NELS Proceedings to be published by the GLSA. The
Journal of Semantics has agreed to publish a special issue with a selection of
papers, and all papers presented at the workshop will be eligible for submission
(with publication depending on the outcome of standard reviewing procedures). We
would like to dedicate this workshop to the memory of Tanya Reinhart, and add it
to the series of events that honor her. She was to have been our invited
speaker. Irene Heim will address aspects of her work in her presentation. 

Submission Guidelines

Abstracts are invited for 20-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion), and a
poster session, on any aspect of theoretical linguistics. Submissions are
