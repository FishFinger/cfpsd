The 11th Persistent Conversation Minitrack

Call for Papers

The Persistent Conversation minitrack at HICSS is a yearly gathering of people
who design and study systems that support computer-mediated communication.
Persistent conversation is not limited to asynchronous textual communication: 

It includes instant messaging, voice chat, and other 'ephemeral' media. Nor do
we limit our focus to systems explicitly designed to support conversation: 

We are interested in conversational exchanges as manifested in applications (for
instance, blogs, annotation systems, distance education) and in sites oriented
around the use of photos, video and other media. If you're interested in
presenting a paper in the minitrack, the first step is to submit an abstract by
March 30. A 10-page paper would be due June 15th.

About the Minitrack
This interdisciplinary minitrack and workshop brings designers and researchers
together to explore persistent conversation, the transposition of ordinarily
ephemeral conversation into the potentially persistent digital medium.
Persistent conversations occur via instant messaging, text and voice chat,
email, blogs, web  
boards, MOOs, graphical and 3D virtual environments, gaming systems, video
sharing sites, document annotation systems, mobile phone texting, etc. Such
communication is persistent in that it leaves a digital trace, and the trace in
turn affords new uses. It permits conversations to be saved, visualized,
browsed, searched, replayed, and restructured. Persistence also means that
conversations need not be synchronous: They can be asynchronous (stretching out
over hours  
or days) or supersynchronous (with multiple parties 'talking' at the same time).
Finally, the creation of persistent and potentially permanent records from what
was once an ephemeral process raises a variety of social and ethical issues.

About Paper Topics
We are seeking papers that address one or both of the following two general areas:
- Understanding Practice. The burgeoning popularity of the internet (and
intranets) provides an opportunity to study and characterize new forms of
conversational practice. Questions of interest range from how various features
of conversations (e.g., turn-taking, topic organization, expression of
paralinguistic information) have adapted in response to the digital medium, to
new roles played by persistent conversation in domains such as education,
business, and entertainment.
- Design. Digital systems do not currently support conversation well: It is
difficult to converse with grace, clarity, depth and coherence over networks.
But this need not remain the case. Toward this end, we welcome analyses of
existing systems as well as designs for new systems which better support
conversation. Also of interest are inquiries into how participants design their
own conversations within the digital medium -- that is, how they make use of
system features to create structure, and regulate their discourse.

Examples of appropriate topics include, but are not limited to:
- Turn-taking, threading and other structural features of CMC
- The dynamics of large scale conversation systems (e.g. blog networks)
- Methods for summarizing or visualizing conversation archives
- Studies of virtual communities or other sites of digital conversation
- The roles of mediated conversation in knowledge management
- Studies of the use of instant messaging in large organizations
- Novel designs for computer-mediated conversation systems
- Analyses of or designs for distance learning systems

Next Steps
Submit a 300 word abstract of your proposed paper via email to the chairs: Tom
Erickson (snowfall at acm dot org), Susan Herring (herring at indiana dot edu)
by the deadline noted above. We will send you feedback on the suitability of
your abstract by the deadline noted above.
