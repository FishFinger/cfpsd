Meeting Description:

Language, Conflict and Security in the Middle East
10-11 April, 2010, University of Cambridge 

Call for Papers

The Department of Middle Eastern Studies, and the Centre for Middle Eastern
Studies, University of Cambridge, invite papers to be presented at an
international conference on Middle Eastern Studies. The focus will be on
Language, Conflict and Security in the Middle East. Papers can range from early
modern period to contemporary times and are encouraged to be in - but not
limited to - the fields of:  

1. Language and Security - Linkages, Contradictions, and Influences: The
conference would seek to highlight these subjects by bringing together academic
researchers, policy makers and field officers to debate concepts such as
'military intelligence', 'terrorism', 'security', 'language policies', 'foreign
language acquisition' and the seam-lines they share. We will try to understand
why do we learn foreign languages? What is the influence of security
considerations on language policies? Who are our language teachers? What are the
difficulties in studying the 'language of the enemy'? 

2. Language and Conflict: Political conflicts influence over our most basic
needs: life, land, movement, and liberty. However, they have also crucial
influence over our languages: The idioms in which we speak, the terminology we
use, the languages we choose to ignore, and the linguistic capabilities that our
governments encourage. We will strive to comprehend how do conflicts change our
perceptions of studying foreign languages? When can language be a bridge? And
how does it turn into an instrument?   

3. Security and Beyond: Security is not only connected to military intelligence,
secret services, and armies. This conference would attempt to broaden the
conceptual definitions of the field of security studies by highlighting the role
of language in this field of research. We would strive to discuss this triangle
- of language, security and conflict - in a broader sense than usual,
challenging the way we usually perceive them. In which way security
considerations are actually present in the very fabric of society? What is the
impact of 'security' in journalism, religion, translation or language
acquisition? Who prevent our access to knowledge and information, and is it
relate to 'security'?

Abstracts should be sent by email to Yonatan Mendel (yym20@cam.ac.uk) latest by
30th November, 2009. Submissions should be no more than 300 words in MS Word or
PDF format, and should include your name, affiliation and academic institution.
Applicants will be notified by December 10th 2009 regarding the outcome of their
applications. Each speaker will be allotted 20 minutes for the presentation
followed by 10 minutes for questions. Graduate students are encouraged to apply.

Two nights accommodation in Cambridge, including all meals, will be provided for
speakers. Graduate students are encouraged to apply.

Sincerely,

Yonatan Mendel (co-organiser) 
On behalf of Prof. Yasir Suleiman, Head of Department and Centre of Middle
Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge.
