Meeting Description

In April 2008, the 17th edition of the Sociolinguistics Symposium will be
held in Amsterdam. De Taalstudio is planning to organize a thematic panel
on sociolinguistic issues in language analysis in refugee cases. 

Language analysis is currently used by governments of various countries all over
the world as a tool to determine the origin of asylum seekers. Following from
critical comments and observations by many professional linguists (e.g. Eades et
al. 2003, Arends 2003) on the use of language analysis, the Guidelines for the
Use of Language Analysis in Relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee
Cases were published in 2004 by an international group of linguists (see
www.iafl.org, the home page of the International Association for Forensic
Linguistics). These guidelines provide a useful framework for research in this
relatively new field, and have inspired various linguists to contribute to our
understanding of the (im)possibilities of language analysis as a tool to
determine the origin of asylum seekers (e.g. Singler 2006, De Graaf & Van den
Hazelkamp 2006, Ten Thije to appear). Many issues in this specific field of
research are related to sociolinguistic topics such as multilingualism,
code-switching, language mixing, language contact, speech accommodation,
language and identity, the observer's paradox, the role of the interpreter, etc. 

In April 2008, the 17th edition of the Sociolinguistics Symposium will be held
in Amsterdam. De Taalstudio is planning to organize a thematic panel on
sociolinguistic issues in language analysis in refugee cases. During this
session, several independent papers around this theme are presented and
discussed. Authors are expected to give a 20 minute presentation of their paper.
To guarantee a focused and in-depth discussion, papers will be circulated in
advance to all panel members.

We hereby invite the submission of proposals for a paper on any sociolinguistic
issue related to language analysis as it is used in the determination of origin
in asylum cases. 

If you are interested in participating, please send an abstract (max. 300 words)
of your paper to adegraaf@taalstudio.nl by August 1st. We will put together a
panel proposal to the SS17 organizing committee with a selection of the
abstracts we receive. By the beginning of October, we will inform all submitters
as to whether the panel proposal was accepted and which papers are included.
Full papers should be submitted by February 1st 2008.  

In your abstract, please include the following information:
Title of the presentation
Name(s) of the presenter(s)
Affiliation of the presenter(s)
Both e-mail and postal addresses

Meeting Description

Movements of the hands are an important part of natural communication.
Since the scholarly interest in issues of social interaction and spoken
language began to grow in the 1960s, spoken language linguists and
psychologists have described these parts of language as 'gestures'. Yet
their function appeared to be limited to accompanying speech: Gestures were
analysed as secondary articulation movements for a long time. 
From the beginning of sign language linguistics, however, it was clear that
these ideas would not hold for the movements of the hand used to speak
there: Articulating language by visible movements of the hands is of course
elementary to all signed languages.
In the 80s it was discovered that the communicative potential of manual
movements in spoken language goes further beyond accompanying language:
Gestures were no longer regarded as carrying additive information, but were
recognized as forming a core part of the shared communication process, even
as forming part of language itself. The spreading interest into these
properties of gesture provided grounds for the foundation of the
International Gesture Society and the launching of an interdisciplinary
journal called "Gesture". 

The workshop intends to focus on the consequences the two modalities afford
for the concept of gestures: How are gestures analysed in signed and spoken
languages? The following topics might be addressed:
- Transcription systems for movements of the hands
- Differences and similarities in movements of the hands in gestures and signs
- The nature of gestures and signs 
- Semantic constitution of gestures and signs
- Lexical problems concerning movements of the hands
- Morphophonological and syntactical uses of gestures and signs
- Gestures and signs as cognitive units
- Origo and deixis in signed and spoken languages
- Visual qualities of (narrative) perspectives, positions, viewpoints and
communicative roles.
Other topics are also welcome: The purpose of the workshop is to review the
concept of gesture for spoken and signed language by contrasting them. The
desirable aim of the workshop is a concerted appreciation of common
notions, terms, concepts, approaches and theories.
