	Subject: Help Wanted!

	Dear Subscribers:

	Fund-drives are never something we enjoy, and the current
	economic climate doesn't help a bit.  But the fact is that
	they are essential to our existence, for without them,
	LINGUIST could not continue.  This is LINGUIST List's
	eighteenth year of operation, and those of you who are
	familiar with the United States know that non-profit
	organizations like Public TV, Public Radio, and, yes,
	LINGUIST List, have to depend on subscriber donations for
	a large portion of their operating expenses: government
	does not typically fund such organizations, no matter
	the benefits they might bring.

	LINGUIST List gets a little support from Eastern Michigan
	University in the form of office space and web-access,
	and the English department generously funds two graduate
	assistants, who each work 20 hours a week. But this is
	nowhere near enough to fund what LINGUIST does.

	Just think of what LINGUIST does.  We post jobs postings,
	conference and call postings, book postings, book reviews...
	and each of these require at least two students. The Jobs
	category alone has had well over 90 postings this year,
	and a large proportion of these 'routine' postings require
	email correspondence with the submitters. All of these
	postings have to be classified by linguistic subfield and
	subject language, for if they are going to be useful to
	you they need to be searchable in a way that makes sense
	to a linguist. Because the material we distribute needs
	to be made available quickly, we have a 48-hour turnaround
	time on all postings.  But this means that some students
	have to be available on weekends and holidays. And LINGUIST
	is a year-round operation. For the year 2008, we posted
	almost 4,000 issues for you. All our postings are archived
	so that you can easily search for them and find them.

	We do much more than posting, however. Our website has
	thousands of pages which have to be maintained and updated
	for errors or bad links. These pages contain a great
	quantity of data.  Information on 20,853 linguists is listed,
	and our publications include 7,594 book notices, 1,702
	dissertation abstracts, 2,198 book reviews, 2,567 academic
	papers, and 590 journals. We list the websites of 553
	publishers, 196 professional societies, and maintain a
	database of 156 linguistics mailing lists and their
	discussions. Finally, there are our searchable databases
	of information on more than 7,000 unique languages, their
	alternate names, and the families to which they belong.

	This past year, we have built a number of new services.
	The most prominent is a free abstract submission and review
	service designed especially for organizers of small
	conferences. This allows organizers to customize an
	abstract submission template to fit their needs, and link
	it to their conference website. You can have your submitters
	upload abstracts, and review them online.  All this we host
	for free, providing them with a service that normally only
	the bigger conferences can afford.

	Another new service we have worked on this past year is our
	"Student Portal." This is designed to give students
	interested in linguistics a place where they can find out
	information on the field. It provides them with a broad
	range of information on the discipline and shows them how
	to pursue it as a career: how to find appropriate programs,
	how to pay for one's education, how to improve one's
	academic writing and presentation, how to find the right
	research tools and resources and good career counseling.
	It even gives information on the best ways to find a job.
	This area will be available in the next few weeks!

	A third service made live this year is a facility for
	advertising linguistic internships. This provides a page
	that gives you the ability to see the field in which the
	internship is offered, its location, what it provides,
	and means of contacting the organization which is offering
	it. This service features an upload function for students
	who wish to provide resumes, giving both employers and
	potential interns an easy place to exchange information.

	You might wonder why we need so many graduate students to
	run LINGUIST. There's a really good reason:  we do so much!
	The external grants we've received have been very gratifying:
	but they are all provided to us to accomplish research goals.
	None can be used to fund the normal running of the list, nor
	can they be used to support the students who do the hard
	work. And it certainly cannot be used for the training the
	students must receive to reach their full potential. In
	some ways, it makes matters worse:  our grants often build
	facilities which we must then support all by ourselves.

	For eighteen years, LINGUIST has been dedicated to providing
	our email and website services to linguists across the world
	without cost to the users. We have a commitment to free
	services, for we believe this will enable our work to be
	used by anyone who needs it. We are also determined to make
	these services the very best we can.  But these services
	cost money, and the better they are, the more it costs to
	support them.

	Remember:  our discipline is only as good as the next
	generation of linguists.  And it is your support that is
	helping to produce them.  And the linguists that the
	LINGUIST organization produces not only have a good grounding
	in linguistics, but are also especially sophisticated in the
	use of language technologies and tools that will ultimately
	contribute to preserving knowledge of the world's languages
	and linguistic structures.  One of our proudest achievements
	is the number of LINGUIST assistants who go on to enroll in
	Ph.D. programs at some of the world's best graduate schools.
	And it is your money that is giving them the support they need.

	So, once again, we are asking those of you with the means to
	do so to contribute to the LINGUIST List 2009 Fund Drive.
	Every penny goes to the graduate students who run the list
	and website, for it is they who need it most, and it is they
	who are the future of our discipline. Please donate at:
	http://linguistlist.org/donation/donate1.cfm

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	This Year the LINGUIST List hopes to raise $60,000. This money will go to 
	help keep the List running by supporting all of our Student Editors for 
	the coming year.

	See below for donation instructions, and don't forget to check out our 
	Fund Drive 2009 LINGUIST List Restaurant and join us for a delightful 
	treat!
	http://linguistlist.org/fund-drive/2009/

	There are many ways to donate to LINGUIST!

	You can donate right now using our secure credit card form at
	https://linguistlist.org/donation/donate/donate1.cfm

	Alternatively you can also pledge right now and pay later. To do so, go 
	to: https://linguistlist.org/donation/pledge/pledge1.cfm

	For all information on donating and pledging, including information on how 
	to donate by check, money order, or wire transfer, please visit: 
	http://linguistlist.org/donate.html

	The LINGUIST List is under the umbrella of Eastern Michigan University and 
	as such can receive donations through the EMU Foundation, which is a 
	registered 501(c) Non Profit organization. Our Federal Tax number is 
	38-6005986. These donations can be offset against your federal and 
	sometimes your state tax return (U.S. tax payers only). For more 
	information visit the IRS Web-Site, or contact your financial advisor.

	Many companies also offer a gift matching program, such that they will 
	match any gift you make to a non-profit organization. Normally this 
	entails your contacting your human resources department and sending us a 
	form that the EMU Foundation fills in and returns to your employer. This 
	is generally a simple administrative procedure that doubles the value of 
	your gift to LINGUIST, without costing you an extra penny. Please take a 
	moment to check if your company operates such a program.

	Thank you very much for your support of LINGUIST!
