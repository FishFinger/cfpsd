Meeting Description:

A Germanic Sandwich 2010: Dutch between English and German 
A comparative linguistic conference 

Where? University of Oldenburg (Germany)
When? 17-18 September 2010 

First Call for Papers

A Germanic Sandwich 2010 will be the third in a series of conferences in which
Dutch is compared with its closest Germanic neighbours, English and German. Four
years ago the first one took place in Berlin to commemorate the appearance of
Nederlands tussen Duits en Engels ('Dutch between German and English)', a study
by the renowned Dutch linguist C.B. van Haeringen. In 2006 (the 50th anniversary
of Van Haeringen's book) the conference papers were published under the same
title. In 2008 the conference took place in Sheffield (a report on that meeting
as well as presentations that were given there can be found here:
http://dutchcentre.group.shef.ac.uk/sandwich.htm ).

This third two-day conference will be hosted by the Department of Dutch, and the
faculty of arts of the Carl von Ossietzky university in Oldenburg. The
conference organising committee consists of Esther Ruigendijk (Oldenburg), Roel
Vismans (Sheffield) and Freek van de Velde (Leuven). The conference languages
will be Dutch, English and German. 

We invite you to submit abstracts in which Dutch is compared to German and/or
English (other Germanic languages may of course be included as well). We welcome
studies with a typological perspective, with questions about structural aspects
of the languages, their history or their status. Comparative studies from a
language acquisition or psycholinguistic perspective will find their place as well.

There will be the option to either present a plenary talk, or a poster
presentation. Please indicate your preference. Talks will be 20 minutes with 10
minutes discussion time. 

Abstracts (ca. 300 words) can be sent to Esther Ruigendijk: 
Esther.Ruigendijk@uni-oldenburg.de. 
Deadline for submission: 9th January 2010.
Notification of acceptance will by the end by the end of February 2010.
