Location: Hong Kong, Hong Kong 
Contact Person: Joey Wong

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 25-Aug-2007 

Meeting Description:
The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of Language Studies of the City
University of Hong Kong will organize a Conference on 'Becoming a World
Language: the growth of Chinese, English and Spanish' - the first of a series of
annual conferences - to be held from 5 to 7 December 2007 in Hong Kong. The
Conference will be preceded by a Pre-Conference Institute on 3 and 4 December 2007. 

Officially launched in March 2006, The Halliday Centre has the distinct honour
of being named after the world-renowned linguist, Professor M.A.K. Halliday. The
Halliday Centre aims to expand opportunities for collaboration with global
partners in China and the Asia-Pacific Region, Europe, North America and
elsewhere, concentrating on research relating to corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and comparative language studies. 

The Conference will provide an international forum for scholars, researchers,
and other professionals to discuss the phenomenon of becoming a world language
of Chinese, English and Spanish, and how an applicable linguistics might
contribute to an understanding of the short and long term effects of the
phenomenon both on speakers and on speech systems. Keynote speakers include
Professor Cecilia Colombi, Professor Fang Yan, Professor M.A.K. Halliday,
Professor Yamuna Kachru, Professor Christian Matthiessen, and Professor Larry
Smith. 

Dear Colleagues,

I write on behalf of The Halliday Centre for Intelligent Applications of
Language Studies to invite you to participate in an International Conference on 

''Becoming a World Language: the growth of Chinese, English and Spanish''
City University of Hong Kong, 5 - 7 December 2007
http://www.hallidaycentre.cityu.edu.hk/HCLS-C1-2007

Plenary Speakers:
Cecilia Colombi (University of California, Davis)
Fang Yan (Tsinghua University)
M.A.K. Halliday (University of Sydney)
Yamuna Kachru (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)
Christian Matthiessen (Macquarie University)
Larry Smith (Christopher, Smith & Associates LLC; and Japan-America Institute of
Management Science, Honolulu)

The objective of the conference is to explore from a multiple perspective the
significance of a language becoming a world language. English is already
acknowledged as a world language, but both Chinese and Spanish appear to be
moving in the same direction. This raises some interesting issues. For example:
is the pattern of emergence to this status the same in all three cases, or do
they have different trajectories? Does the system of language change in this
process, and if so, how? What kind of resources, if any, does the language have
to develop along the way, and what are the consequences of its growth for those
who speak it? What relevance do modes of language education have to this
process? What are its effects on the formation of speaker identity, for both the
native speakers of the world language and the foreign learners?

The field is thus excitingly open to, and in need of, interpretation. We invite
you to participate in this venture by presenting your thoughts on any aspect
relevant to becoming a world language. Papers could be of (i) 30 minutes or (ii)
50 minutes duration. Please send your abstracts to HCLS@cityu.edu.hk no later
than 25 August 2007. The length of the abstract should be 150 - 250 words
(Microsoft Word format preferred). Please show name, institution and country of
residence at top of page and indicate whether your paper is intended for
category (i) or (ii).

There will be a Pre-Conference Institute on 3 and 4 December 2007. The
instructors and titles of the courses are as follows:

M.A.K. Halliday: Theoretical Foundations of Systemic Functional Linguistics
Ruqaiya Hasan: Analysing Text: Meaning in Context
Paul Thibault: Image and Language in Pedagogic Discourse: An Application of
Systemic Functional Linguistics

Participants will be offered a certificate of attendance. For details of course
design and fee and online registration, please visit
http://www.hallidaycentre.cityu.edu.hk/HCLS-C1-2007/institute.htm.

Advance registration (with concession) for the Conference will be available
until 29 September 2007.  

We look forward to receiving your abstracts and hope you will be able to join us
in Hong Kong in December 2007.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Jonathan Webster & Emeritus Professor Ruqaiya Hasan
Convenors, International Conference on ''Becoming a World Language: the growth
of Chinese, English and Spanish''

Subject: Space and Time in Language and Literature 2007 

	

Full Title: Space and Time in Language and Literature 2007 
Short Title: STLL 2007 

Date: 21-Sep-2007 - 22-Sep-2007
Location: Rijeka, Croatia 
Contact Person: Marija Brala
Meeting Email: mbrala@ffri.hr

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 20-Jun-2007 

Meeting Description:

STLL 2007 is aimed at providing a setting for presentations of innovative
work, both theoretical and empirical, relative to the expression of time
and space within natural languages. The aim is to compare and contrast the
structure of spatiality and temporality both at the conceptual and at the
lexical levels, and try to do so from an interdisciplinary perspective. 
STLL 2007 will also address the many diverse chronologies and topologies
that have shaped or may one day shape our experience, identities, and
(linguistic/literary) representations, both individual and collective. 

Some of the themes that will be discussed are: 
-- tense, aspect and event structure; spatial/temporal structure and discourse 
-- language change in the community and across the individual lifespan 
-- language acquisition and the timing of input; processing/acquiring
spatial/temporal reference.
-- cultural geographies; frontiers and borders; homeland and exile;
globalization and geopolitics
-- the center and its margins; canons and 'the other'; virtual worlds of
utopia, SF, or hypertext 
-- digital and electronic media intertwining with the 'old' medium of
literature; interactions between language and code, print and electronic
text, and the dialectic between representations
-- history and its periods; memory and repetition; narrativizations of
time; the 'eternal return' 
-- simultaneity and instantaneity; temporalities of technology
-- emergence, urgence, 'presentness' and becoming; temporality and philosophy
-- the space-time of cultures, languages and aesthetic forms (including
literary chronotopes)
-- topographies and histories of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, race 
-- 'real space-time' and media time; music/image/cinema/hypertext:
literature and other media

Papers will be 20 minutes in length, followed by a 10-minute discussion.
Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words, and should be submitted to
mbrala@ffri.hr (linguistics) or lovorka@ucla.edu (literature) no later than
June 20, 2007. Please, state your name, affiliation and contact details in
the body of the message. A decision about the acceptance of papers will be
made by July 1, 2007.
