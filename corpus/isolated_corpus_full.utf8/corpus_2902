FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

REFERRING EXPRESSION GENERATION CHALLENGE 2008
----------------------------------------------

To be held in conjunction with the 5th International Natural Language
Generation Conference (INLG 2008), June 12-14, 2008 Salt Fork, Ohio,
USA

Following the success of the Pilot NLG Challenge on Attribute
Selection for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) in September
2007, we are organising a second NLG Challenge, the Referring
Expression Generation Challenge (REG 2008), to be presented and
discussed during a special session at INLG 2008.  While the ASGRE
Challenge focused on attribute selection for definite references, the
REG Challenge expands the scope of the original to include both
attribute selection and realisation, while introducing a new task
involving references to named entities in context.

The REG Challenge has eight submission tracks and two different data
sets.  It maintains the ASGRE Challenge's emphasis on openness to
alternative task definitions and evaluation methods, and will involve
both automatic and task-based evaluation.

The REG Challenge 2008 meeting will be part of INLG'08.  There will be
a special session in the conference programme for an overview of the
participating systems, presentation of evaluation results and open
discussion.  The participating systems will additionally be presented
in the form of 2-page papers in the conference proceedings, and
posters during the INLG'08 poster session.

For all further information, please refer to the full version of the
REG'08 Call for Participation on the REG'08 website:
