Hi =


I am a Corpus Linguistics student/researcher. Experience with: Shell, PHP,
ASP, VB6, VB.NET, and learning C#. I also have some applications built with
VB.net:
http://www.corpuslg.org/software/temp/kwicg1.1.exe
http://www.corpuslg.org/software/developer/?postid=3D17 =

 =

I think you don't need to clean text to take word frequency with C# or
VB.NET. =


The 'Split' or 'Replace' process are slow compared to what you can do using
'StringBuilder', 'RegularExpressions', and 'Dictionaries'.

Take a look at the simple vb.net code below. It 'cleans' (actually extracts)
text without using 'replace' or 'Split' functions.   =

The same approach is possible for a C# function.

VB.NET CODE:
'+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imports System.Text
Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions
Imports System.Collections.Generic
'+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

'--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private function  Get_Words (strText as string ) as String =

    Dim strbText As New StringBuilder =

    Dim strbResult As New StringBuilder =

    Dim WordIndex As MatchCollection
    Dim regexpWord As String =3D "\b\w+-\w+\b|\b\w+\'\w+\b|\b\w+\'\b|\b\w+\=
b"
    Dim i As Integer =

    =

		=

    strbText.Append (strText)
    WordIndex =3D Regex.Matches(strbText.ToString, regexpWord)

     =

    For i =3D 0 To WordIndex.Count - 1
     	strbresult.AppendLine (wordindex(i).Value )
    Next

    Get_Words =3D strbresult.ToString =


    strbresult =3D nothing
    strbText =3DNothing
    WordIndex =3D Nothing
    regexpword =3D Nothing
    i =3D Nothing
End function
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------



In order to count words, you can use a 'Dictionary(Of String, Long)' object.
Instead of passing the words to a Stringbuilder object (as in the code
above), you pass the extracted words to a Dictionary of String, Long.

I hope this can shed some light on the issue. =


Regards,
    Jos=E9. =

That is possible. In fact doesn't surprise me at all.

I'm neither a perl wizard or a C# tune-smith (I still use Snobol4) but I'd
suspect a major difference in the way the two language process text. For
my money I'd believe perl is giving you a more accurate result because the
language itself was designed to process text. I'd further believer that C#
(as Microsoft's attempt to have their own Java) doesn't deal with
character and/or textual data in the same way. What perl accepts as text
C# may well be ditching. You may be right by citing the System.split()
function; check very carefully what that function is intended to do and
then compare it with how the similar, but not necessarily identical,
function in perl works. Assume absolutely nothing about the functionality
of either language or of functions with the same name. If in doubt blame
C# for the discrepancy.

Regards, Trevor

The way I would have approached this is by finding which words
generate count discrepancies and also exist in one, but not another
version of the result. Then, I would look for those words in the text
and see what context they are in.

What I suspect you will find is that your partial reimplementation of
perl's :punct: class is causing problems. I would either do a complete
reimplementation of that (see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression ) or look into C#'s
regular expressions, which I am sure will contain the same definition
of the :punct: class.

Finally, if you are working with languages other than English, you
most certainly should look into regular expression libraries. They
take into account Unicode's rules as well, something you really don't
want to have to duplicate in your own code.

Regards,
    Alex.

Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition (PsychoCompLA-2008)

July 23rd at CogSci 2008  - Washington, D.C.

Submission Deadline: June 15, 2008

http://www.colag.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/psychocomp/

Workshop Topic:

The workshop is devoted to psychologically-motivated computational models of
language acquisition. That is, models that are compatible with research in
psycholinguistics, developmental psychology and linguistics.

Invited Speakers:

* Rens Bod, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of
Amsterdam, Netherlands
* Damir Cavar, University of Indiana, USA and Zadar University, Croatia
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Jeffery Lidz, University of Maryland, USA
* Gary Marcus, New York University, USA
* Josh Tenenbaum, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA

Workshop History:

This is the fourth meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human
Language Acquisition workshop following PsychoCompLA-2004, held in Geneva,
Switzerland as part of the 20th International Conference on Computational
Linguistics (COLING-2004), PsychoCompLA-2005 as part of the 43rd Annual
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005) held in
Ann Arbor, Michigan where the workshop shared a joint session with the Ninth
Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), and
PsychoCompLA-2007 held in Nashville, Tennessee as part of the 29th meeting
of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci-2007).


Workshop Description:

The workshop will present research and foster discussion centered around
psychologically-motivated computational models of language acquisition, with
an emphasis on the acquisition of syntax. In recent decades there has been a
thriving research agenda that applies computational learning techniques to
emerging natural language technologies and many meetings, conferences and
workshops in which to present such research. However, there have been only a
few (but growing number of) venues in which psychocomputational models of
how humans acquire their native language(s) are the primary focus.

Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular
interest in light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest
that very young infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an
audible input stream. Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical
'machinery' to the task of grammar acquisition, with or without an innate
language component, remains an open and important question. One effective
line of investigation is to computationally model the acquisition process
and determine interrelationships between a model and linguistic or
psycholinguistic theory, and/or correlations between a model's performance
and data from linguistic environments that children are exposed to.

Special Theme:

Although the workshop program speaks to many facets of psychocomputational
language acquisition modeling, the theme of the workshop this year is:

* Computational resources: How much is just right, and does it matter?

The computational resources (e.g., number of calculations per input datum,
size of memory store, etc.) employed by current psychocomputational modeling
efforts vary tremendously from model to model. However, two important
questions have rarely been addressed. How well do a particular acquisition
model's resources parallel the resources employed by a human language
learner? And, how relevant (or not) is it to establish such a relationship?

Topics and Goals:

Abstracts that present research on (but not necessarily limited to) the
following topics are welcome:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning;
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that incorporate
psychologically plausible constraints;
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported
studies;
* Models that have a cross-linguistic or bilingual perspective;
* Models that address learning bias in terms of innate
linguistic knowledge versus statistical regularity in the
input;
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics;
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning;
* Models of language change and its effect on language
acquisition or vice versa;
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars;
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or
developmental theories (e.g., principles & parameters, optimality theory,
construction grammar, etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such as CHILDES.

This workshop intends to bring together researchers from cognitive
psychology, computational linguistics, other computer/mathematical sciences,
linguistics and psycholinguistics working on all areas of language
acquisition. Diversity and cross-fertilization of ideas is the central goal.
