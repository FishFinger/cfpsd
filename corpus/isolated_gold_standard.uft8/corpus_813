Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2010

http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/

June 1 - June 6, 2010, Los Angeles, California

Important Dates:
* Deadline for BOTH Full and Short paper submission: Tuesday, December 1,  
2009
* NEW: Author Response period: January 12-14, 2010
* Notification to Authors: Monday, January 25, 2010
* Final, camera-ready papers due: Mar 31, 2010

NAACL is pleased to announce the North American Chapter of the Association  
for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT)  
2010 conference.  The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines  
working towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using  
natural language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through  
services such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information  
retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction. This year, we  
are especially interested in papers discussing research with noisy data,  
including data from informal communications (such as, Twitter, Blogs,  
Email, SMS) and processed data (such as, Speech, OCR, Historical Data, and  
Machine Translation).  NAACL HLT 2010 will feature full papers, short  
papers, demonstrations, and a doctoral consortium, as well as  
pre-conference tutorials and post-conference workshops.  The conference  
invites the submission of full and short papers on substantial, original,  
and unpublished research in disciplines that could impact human language  
processing systems. We also encourage the submission of short papers that  
can be characterized as a small, focused contribution, a work in progress,  
a negative result, an opinion piece or an interesting application note.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are  
understood to be applied to speech and/or text:
* Phonology
* Morphology (including word segmentation)
* Part of speech tagging
* Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
* Grammar Engineering
* Word sense disambiguation
* Lexical semantics
* Formal semantics and logic
* Mathematical Linguistics
* Textual entailment and paraphrasing
* Discourse and pragmatics
* Knowledge acquisition and representation
* Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
* Multilingual processing
* Noisy data analysis
* Large-scale language processing
* Machine translation
* Language generation
* Summarization
* Question answering
* Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
* Information extraction
* Topic classification and information filtering
* Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/ genre analysis)
* Topic clustering
* Text and speech mining
* Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
* Speech indexing and retrieval
* Speech analysis and recognition
* Speech synthesis
* Speech understanding
* Dialog(ue) systems
* Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human- robot  
interaction, education and  learning systems, assistive technologies,  
digital entertainment)
* Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
* Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, annotated  
corpora)
* Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information  structure and  
sources in speech)
* Multimodal representations and processing, including speech, gaze,  
gesture, and other sensory inputs

SUBMISSIONS

Full papers: NAACL HLT 2010 submissions must describe substantial,  
original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete  
evaluation and analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged on  
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, replicability,  
contributions to research resources, relevance to the conference, and  
interest to the attendees. Each submission will be reviewed by at least  
three program committee members.
Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus one extra  
page for references, and will be presented orally or as a poster  
presentation as determined by the program committee.  The decisions as to  
which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations  
will be based on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. There  
will be no distinction in the proceedings between full papers presented  
orally and those presented as poster presentations.

Short papers: NAACL HLT 2010 also solicits short papers. Short paper  
submissions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper  
deadline this year is also December 1, 2010 by 11:59PM Eastern Standard  
Time (GMT-8).  Characteristics of past short papers include:
* A small, focused contribution
* Work in progress
* A negative result
* An opinion piece
* An interesting application nugget

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and  
will be given four (4) pages including references in the proceedings. While  
short papers will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings,  
there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers  
presented orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short  
paper submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.

Submission Deadline: The deadline for both full and short papers is  
December 1, 2010 by 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time (GMT+8).

Electronic Submission: Submission is electronic using paper submission  
software at: https://www.softconf.com/naaclhlt2010/HLT2010/

Format: Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL  
HLT 2010 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one  
extra page for references.  Short paper submissions should also follow the  
two-column format of NAACL HLT 2010 proceedings, and should not exceed four  
(4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX  
style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's  
conference, which will be available soon on the conference website under  
http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html.  Submissions must conform to the  
official style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they  
must be electronic in PDF. As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must  
not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,  
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously  
showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such  
as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."  Papers that do not conform  
to these requirements will be rejected without review.  In addition, please  
do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is  
complete.
Multiple-submission policy: Papers that have been or will be submitted to  
other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time.   
Authors submitting multiple papers to NAACL HLT may not submit papers that  
overlap significantly (&gt; 50%) with each other in content or results.   
Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2010 must notify  
the program chairs by February 15, 2010 as to whether the paper will be  
presented.  All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to  
appear in the proceedings.  We will not accept for publication or  
presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with  
papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.
