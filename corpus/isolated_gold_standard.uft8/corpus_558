               **** NAACL HLT 2007 Preliminary Call for Papers ****

                      Human Language Technologies: 
             The Conference of the North American Chapter of 
             the Association for Computational Linguistics 

                 April 22-28, 2007, Rochester, New York 

             http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07

General Conference Chair:  Candace Sidner (Mitsubishi Electric
Research Laboratories) 
Program Co-Chairs: 
	Tanja Schultz (Carnegie Mellon University)  
        Matthew Stone (Rutgers University) 
        ChengXiang Zhai  (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) 
Local Arrangements:  James Allen, Len Schubert, and Dan Gildea
(University of Rochester) 

NAACL HLT 2007 continues the tradition of the combined Human Language
Technology Conferences (HLT) and North American Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) Annual Meetings
begun in 2003. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines
working towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans
using natural language, and towards enhancing human-human
communication through services such as speech recognition, automatic
translation, information retrieval, text summarization, and
information extraction. NAACL HLT 2007 will feature full papers,
late-breaking (short) papers, demonstrations, and a doctoral
consortium, as well as pre- and post-conference tutorials and
workshops. The conference is organized by the North American Chapter
of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), who is
advised by a board representing the IR and speech communities and
North American HLT funding agencies.

Topics of Interest:

The conference invites the submission of papers on substantial,
original, and unpublished 
research in disciplines that could impact human language processing
systems, with a 
special focus on theories and methods that enable compelling
combinations of human 
language technologies (e.g., Speech with Information Retrieval,
Machine Translation 
with Speech, Question Answering with Natural Language Processing,
etc.). Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
 
- Computational analysis of language
     Phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, dialogue,
     discourse, style 
- Speech processing, including:
    Speech recognition and speech generation 
    Rich transcription: automatic annotation of information structure
     and sources in speech 
- Information retrieval, text classification, and information
     filtering/recommendation 
    Text data mining, information extraction, text summarization, and
     question answering 
- Multimodal representations and processing 
- Statistical and learning techniques for language, including 
    Corpus-based language modeling 
    Lexical and knowledge acquisition 
- Development of language resources, including 
    Lexicons and ontologies 
    Treebanks, proposition banks, and frame banks 
- Language generation and text planning 
- Multilingual processing, including 
    Machine translation of speech and text 
    Cross-language information retrieval 
    Multi-lingual speech recognition and language identification 
- Intelligent systems for natural language interaction, including 
    Conversational systems for collaboration, tutoring and behavioral
     intervention
    Embodied conversational agents, virtual humans and human-robot
     conversation
    Language-enhanced platforms for interactive narrative and digital
     entertainment
- Evaluation, including 
    Glass-box evaluation of HLT systems and system components 
    Black-box evaluation of HLT systems in application settings 

Submission information:

Full papers: Submissions must describe original, completed,
unpublished work and 
should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without
exceeding eight pages, including references. Each submission will be
judged chiefly on the strength of 
the argument it provides in support of its contribution, through
e.g. experimental 
evaluation, theoretical analysis, or critical engagement with HLT.
Reviewing will 
be double-blind; each submission will be reviewed by at least three
program 
committee members. 

Late-breaking (short) papers: Submissions describing original,
unpublished work 
can be submitted as short papers with a later deadline.  The
submissions should 
follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without exceeding four
pages, 
including references.  Reviewing will be double-blind; each submission
will be 
reviewed by at least two program committee members.  Short paper
submissions 
may be accepted for oral presentation in plenary OR for presentation
in a poster session. 

Demonstration, doctoral consortium, tutorial, and workshop proposals:
Submission 
instructions will be available later. 

Multiple-submission policy:  Papers that have been or will be
submitted to other 
meetings or publications must provide this information at submission
time. In the 
event of multiple acceptances, authors must notify the program chairs
by 
January 5, 2007, indicating which meeting they choose for presentation
of their work.  
HLT-NAACL 2007 cannot accept for publication work that will be (or has
been) 
published elsewhere.
