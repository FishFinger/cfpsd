The 1st Information Retrieval Facility Conference provides a
multi-disciplinary, scientific forum for researchers and aims at
bringing young researchers into contact with industry at an early stage.
The IRF is a unique organisation based around a supercomputing
facility in Vienna and a growing community of IR scientists.

The 1st IRF Conference tackles 4 complementary research areas:
   * Information retrieval
   * Semantic web technologies for IR
   * Natural language processing for IR
   * Large-scale or distributed computing for the above areas

*The conference proceedings will be published in Springer LNCS.*
