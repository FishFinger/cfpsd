                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                           HCSNet Workshop on
                    Effective Interactive Interfaces

                                Sydney
                       September 27--28 (1.5 days)


Introduction

What makes interaction "effective", in the sense of enhancing user task performance and task efficiency? What interaction strategies can be deployed within human-machine interfaces, particularly dialogue and Multimodal interfaces, to make them more effective? What aspects of human-human interaction lead to successful collaborative task performance, and how can these be leveraged in the design of interactive interfaces? What techniques can be used to make interaction more robust? Do "natural" styles of interaction lead to more effective interfaces? What role do emotions and embodiedness play?

This workshop is designed to be a low-barrier-to-entry forum to bring together researchers interested in these issues from across the HCSNet community to share knowledge and explore possible interactions. Our aim is to identify shared interests, understand different perspectives, and to take first steps towards developing future collaborations. HCSNet will fund travel for a number of participants from outside the Sydney area (see below).

We invite participants from HCI, Language Technology, Psychology, Communication Science, Auditory Interfaces, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Linguistics and Speech Science, Sociology, and other related fields. Possible themes of interest include:

- Multimodal interfaces
- Robust spoken-language interaction
- Intelligent user interfaces
- User modelling
- Human-human interaction strategies
- Gesture and embodied interaction
- Conversational agents
- Emotion and its role in interaction
- Task and activity modelling 
- Environment-specific issues

Proposed Outcomes

Effective Interfaces is a designated Priority Area for HCSNet. The main purpose of this workshop is to identify specific issues of interest to a diverse collection of the HCSNet research community. A concrete outcome would be to define a series of multi-disciplinary topic themes that have the potential to lead to specific projects.

Participation and Format

We welcome participation from a range of disciplines and perspectives, as outlined above, from both academia and industry. We want to involve as many as possible in discussion, so the effort required for attendance is deliberately small: interested parties are asked to submit a short abstract of two paragraphs of 100-150 words each, describing:

- research interests pertinent to the workshop theme;
- thoughts on issues deemed to be important and potential points of
  interaction with other disciplines.

Please submit abstracts to Lawrence Cavedon, lcavedon@cs.rmit.edu.au, by the date indicated below.

The format of the workshop will be designed to promote interaction and collaboration. Participants will be invited to prepare a short presentation (5-10 minutes) describing their specific interests, similar in fashion to the Speed Papers session at last year's HCSNet SummerFest. Panels and break-out sessions will provide opportunities for group
discussion and planning.

Funding

HCSNet is able to provide funding support (covering travel and accommodation) for a number of participants travelling from utside Sydney. Submission of the abstract described above is a prerequisite for being considered for travel funding. If not all
participants can be covered, funding grants may be allocated based on specific interests as described in the abstract.

Dates

Fri Sept 1:                         Due date for abstracts
Wed Sept 6:                         Awards of travel funding notified
1pm Wed Sept 27--6pm Thur Sept 28:  Workshop

An adjacent event of potential interest is the kick-off of the Thinking Head project at University of Western Sydney, a venture funded under the ARC and NHMRC Thinking Systems initiative.

Venue

The workshop will be held in Sydney, at the NICTA building in the Australian Technology Park.
