1. The Special Issue

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of
computational research on prepositions. Due to their importance in
computational tasks prepositions, and related constructions have received a
considerable amount of attention and occupied a central position in
research in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Language Technology (LT),
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as
Computational Psycholinguistics (CP).

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP
tasks, very little progress has been made in systematically describing
preposition semantics. 
The only account of the lexical semantics of prepositions in resources such
as WordNet is indirect, in that they feature in significant numbers within
multiword 
expressions or as frame elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated
into such resources as first-order entities, a large number of issues must
be resolved. Our 
expectation is that such questions will be guided by careful analysis of
what semantic distinctions and representational granularity are required in
a range of 
applications, which will in turn be guided by such research as the
representation of prepositions within implemented grammars, crosslingual
preposition semantics, 
machine perception and visualisation of preposition semantics, and
computational models of the human processing of prepositions.


2. Topics of Interest

We invite submissions that bring a theoretical basis to research on
prepositions in lexical resources and NLP tasks of the sort described
above. We focus on the syntactic and semantic treatment of productive and
collocational uses of prepositional phrases and markers in resources such
as WordNet and FrameNet, and theutilization of such resources in NLP tasks,
such as Machine Translation.

* Extraction of Prepositions:

Extraction of prepositions and related constructions including their
subcategorisation frames and alternation patterns, as are necessary for the
semi-automatic extension of lexical resources.


* Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources:

The challenges of providing adequate representation of prepositions and
related constructions such as would be generally applicable in NLP
applications.


* Prepositions in Applications:

The role of prepositions in NLP tasks, focusing specifically on what
insights various applications offer for lexical resource building, what
particular needs different application areas have, necessary extensions to
existing resources, and how prepositional lexical resources of various
types could enhance performance over a given task like MT and QA.
