<img src=3D"http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/files2/pictures/picture-249.jpg" />
<h4>Research area: Psychology - Psycholinguistics</h4>
<p>My research interests are in the areas of Cross-Language Speech Percep=
tion, Spoken Word Recognition/Segmentation,       =20
Statistical Language Learning, and Research Methodology. I am currently w=
orking as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Prof. Catherine Best on her=
 NIH-funded cross-language speech perception research. We recently comple=
ted a chapter extending her Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) to accoun=
t for Second Language Speech Learning (PAM-L2), and we continue to use th=
e natural variation present in different English dialects as a tool to pr=
obe phonetic vs. phonological aspects of language development. I also inv=
estigate how infants and adults segment words from continuous speech (usi=
ng artificial languages), and how school-aged children accommodate to pho=
netic variation (perceptual learning). As part of my doctoral work I desi=
gned and tested a new device for detecting the onset of speech in psychol=
inguistic experiments (The Delayed Trigger Voice Key). This design has no=
w been implemented in the new button box being developed for Psyscope X e=
xperiment presentation software.</p>

Engineering and Medicine (STEM) sector.  If you have been involved in
cross-sector collaboration, would like to have data input to a report to
DEST, and have 15 mins to spare, please complete the survey on-line by
visiting  <a href=3D"http://www.chass.org.au/"> http://www.chass.org.au</=
