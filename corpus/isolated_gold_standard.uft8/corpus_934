Overview
The University of Minnesota's President's Interdisciplinary Conference
Initiative supports inquiry that fosters collaboration between scholars in
divergent fields and across institutions. This interdisciplinary conference
addresses the question: What are the epistemological and ethical considerations
in research with immigrant populations? The purpose of this conference is to
engage university and community colleagues and students from a variety of
disciplines and interests in consideration of this and other questions about
ethics and epistemology in their research.

Participants in this conference will include individuals from diverse
methodological and disciplinary areas, such as education, social work,
anthropology, urban studies, the humanities, and the health professions. The
conference will emphasize the implications of practices in research design, data
collection, analysis and writing of research that involves immigrant
populations. These conversations will include concerns related to Institutional
Review Boards, as well as those that move beyond IRB, including presentation and
dissemination of findings, sharing of research design, and advocacy issues.

We  invite proposals that address researchers' dilemmas as they move into,
through, and beyond their work with immigrant communities.

To sustain and extend the work and conversations of this conference, we will
select a small number of conference presentations for revision and publication
in a peer-reviewed edited book.

Submissions
We encourage the following types of submissions:

- Individual presentations, such as research reports or academic papers,
artistic expressions or performances, and structured dialogs between researchers
and community partners about negotiating research dilemmas and processes.
- Symposia of three or four related research reports or academic papers.

For more information about themes addressed by the conference and to submit a
proposal, please visit www.cehd.umn.edu/Immigrant-Research.
