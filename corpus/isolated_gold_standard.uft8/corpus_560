DGfS Workshop: Anaphoric Uses of Demonstrative Expressions

Final Call for Papers 

Call Deadline: 08-Sep-2006
Anaphoric Uses of Demonstrative Expressions

Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the
Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¯Â¿Â½r Sprachwissenschaft(DGfS)
28 February - 2 March, 2007, Siegen

In many languages, demonstrative expressions such as German 'der', 'dieser',
'jener' and English 'this' and 'that' have - in addition to their familiar
deictic uses - anaphoric uses, on which they refer to objects introduced not in
the utterance situation, but rather in the preceding discourse. In recent years
increasing attention has been paid to these ''anaphoric demonstratives'' by
formal, functional, computational and corpus linguistic researchers.

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric
demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting, comparing
them with other more prototypically anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns,
reflexives, definite noun phrases and logophoric expressions and cataloguing
their unique properties. We expect that a focused study of anaphoric
demonstratives will shed significant light on general processes of anaphoric
reference, anaphora resolution, and the cross-linguistic variation in these
processes.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Syntactic properties of anaphoric demonstratives;
- Relations of anaphoric demonstratives to deictic demonstratives;
- Studies of patterns of use of anaphoric demonstratives;
- Contrasts with pronominal expressions;
- Psycholinguistic studies of anaphoric demonstratives;
- Cross-linguistic investigation of anaphoric demonstratives.

Note that in addition to traditional syntactic and semantic investigation we
welcome studies of usage and of processing.
