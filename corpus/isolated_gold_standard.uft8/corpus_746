FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

OPEN SOURCE TOOLS FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION

The Fourth Machine Translation Marathon, which will take place 25=9630 =
January 2010 in Dublin, Ireland, is hosting an Open Source Convention to =

submit a paper of up to 10 pages that (a) describes the underlying =
methodology and (b) includes instructions how to use the tools.

We are looking for stand-alone tools and extensions of existing tools, =
such as the Moses open source systems. Accepted papers will be presented =
during the MT Marathon and published as a special issue of the Prague =
Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml).

Possible Topics:
=95 training of machine translation models
=95 machine translation decoders
=95 tuning of machine translation systems
=95 evaluation of machine translation
=95 visualization, annotation or debugging tools
=95 tools for human translators
=95 interfaces for web-based services or APIs
=95 extensions of existing tools
=95 other tools for machine translation

This is the second time that the MT Marathon will host the Open Source =
Convention. The papers from last year are available online: =
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml-91-100.html

Papers will be reviewed by two reviewers appointed by the program =
committee.

Marathon website: http://MTMarathon2010.info
Please note, that the camera-ready versions will only be accepted in the =
Xe(La)TeX format described on the website (i.e. MS Word and other =
formats or a PDF without source files will not be accepted).


We also invite all interested parties to submit short descriptions of =
open-source projects that fit within the format of the MT Marathon and =
can be accomplished within five days. For submission, please visit =
http://MTMarathon2010.info/web/Projects.html

tools to the modification or extension of existing open-source tools. =

the participants.
