CALL FOR CHAPTERS 

Call for Chapters for the
Handbook of Research on Computer-Enhanced Language Acquisition and Learning 
Editors: Felicia Zhang, PhD, Beth Barber, M.A. 
University of Canberra, Australia
Felicia.zhang@canberra.edu.au
Proposal submission deadline: 15th of July, 2006

Introduction

Language learning is one of the most rapidly changing disciplines.  Along
with changing perspectives in learning in the field of Second Language
Acquisition, information communication technology (ICT) has also created
many learning paths to assist the process of learning a second language
(L2).  In such an ever-evolving environment, teachers, researchers and
professionals of a diverse number of disciplines need access to the most
current information about research on the field of Computer-Enhanced
Language acquisition and learning. 

The Handbook of Research on Computer-Enhanced Language Acquisition and
Learning will be most helpful as it will provide a comprehensive coverage
of successful translation of language learning designs utilizing ICT in
practical learning contexts. This important new publication will be
distributed worldwide among academic and professional institutions and will
be instrumental in providing researchers, scholars, students and
professionals' access to the latest knowledge related to research on
Computer-Enhanced Language acquisition and learning. Contributions to this
important publication will be made by scholars throughout the world with
notable research portfolios and expertise. 

Coverage

The Handbook of Research on Computer-Enhanced Language Acquisition and
Learning will provide research on successfully implemented learning designs
in a variety of contexts. Hence, empirically grounded evaluation of
learning designs are most welcome. This volume will feature chapters
(5,000-7,500 words) authored by leading experts offering an in-depth review
of key language learning related issues and trends in language learning and
information communication technologies in modern organizations worldwide.

Submissions with the following characteristics are most welcome:

-Studies which are longitudinal in nature involving a large number of
subjects are particularly welcome. 
-Studies with more rigorous evaluation including surveys and questionnaires. 
-Studies that involve both novices to CALL and non-novice subjects. 
-Studies that involve participants who have received adequate training
before the experiments. In other words, studies which consider the use of
ICT as part of the overall design of the methodology used for the learning
process. 
-Studies that involve activities or tasks through the use of ICT as a part
of the normal "traditional" tasks and be part of the usual learning
methodology. 
-Studies that redefine the role of teachers and students in the learning
process. 
-Studies that report students learning English as a second or foreign
language or any other European languages such as French or language of
another script such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic or Thai. 
-Studies that are concerned with new contexts: that is, moving away from
classroom bound contexts to informal, self study, non-institutionalized
contexts. 
-Studies that emphasize the need to equip students with skills that
facilitate the transition from institutionalized contexts to
non-institutionalized contexts. 
 
Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) Language learning and the internet Web-based learning;
Chat rooms;
CMC, Moo, Virtual Language Communities; Webquests
(b) Speech Technology
Voice Recognition
Presentation skill training
Conversation dialogue systems
(c)Use of Multimedia in language learning contexts
Multimedia software
Streaming technology
Database design
(d) Emergent technology in language learning
Podcasting, mobile technology
(e) Corpus Linguistics such as the use of concordance in language learning .

Invited Submissions:

Individuals interested in submitting chapters (5,000-7,500 words) on the
above suggested topics or other related topics in their area of interest
should submit a proposal of the chapter by 15th of July, 2006. The paper
should be at least 2-5 pages long clearly outlining the concerns of the
proposal. The proposal should be on previously unpublished work. We
strongly encourage other topics that have not been listed in our suggested
list, particularly if the topic is related to the research area in which
you have expertise.  Upon acceptance of your proposal, you will have two
months to prepare your chapter of 5,000-7,500 words.  Guidelines for
preparing your paper will be sent to you upon acceptance of your proposal.
Full chapters are due by 30th  of September, 2006.  

Please forward your e-mail of interest including your name, affiliation and
your proposal for the chapter you are interested no later than 15th of
July, 2006. You will be notified about the status of your proposed chapter
by 31st of July, 2006. The book is scheduled to be published by Idea Group,
Inc., www.idea-group.com, publisher of the Idea Group Publishing,
Information Science Publishing, IRM Press, CyberTech Publishing and Idea
Group Reference imprints in 2007.

Important Deadlines:
 
15th of July, 2006 for Proposals.
Full paper due on the 30th of September, 2006.
