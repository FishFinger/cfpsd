            5th SALTMIL Workshop on Minority Languages
                 on Tuesday May 23rd 2006 (morning)
            Magazzini del Cotone Conference Centre, Genoa, Italy

Organised in conjunction with LREC 2006: Fifth International Conference o=
n
    Language Resources and Evaluation, Genoa, Italy, 24-26 May 2006


Background
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This workshop continues the series of LREC workshops organized by SALTMIL=
=20
(SALTMIL is the ISCA Special Interest Group for Speech And Language=20
Technology for Minority Languages:  http://isl.ntf.uni-lj.si/SALTMIL/ ):

The minority or "less resourced" languages of the world are under increas=
ing=20
pressure from the major languages (especially English), and many of them =
lack=20
full political recognition.  Some minority languages have been well=20
researched linguistically, but most have not, and the vast majority do no=
t=20
yet possess basic speech and language resources (such as text and speech =

corpora, lexicons, POS taggers, etc) which would enable the commercial=20
development of products.

The workshop aims to share information on tools and best practice, so tha=
t=20
isolated researchers will not need to start from nothing.  An important=20
aspect will be the forming of personal contacts, which can minimise=20
duplication of effort.  There will be a balance between presentations of =

existing language resources, and more general presentations designed to g=
ive=20
background information needed by all researchers present.


Format
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The workshop will begin with the following talks from invited speakers:

  * Lori Levin (Carnegie Mellon University, USA):  "Omnivorous MT: Using =

whatever resources are available."
  * Anna S=E5gvall Hein (University of Uppsala, Sweden):  "Approaching ne=
w=20
languages in machine translation."
  * Hermann Ney (Rheinisch-Westf=E4lische Technische Hochschule, Aachen, =

Germany):  "Statistical Machine Translation with and without a bilingual =

training corpus"
  * Delyth Prys (University of Wales, Bangor):  "The BLARK matrix and its=
=20
relation to the language resources situation for the Celtic languages."
  * Daniel Yacob (Ge'ez Frontier Foundation) "Unicode Development for=20
Under-Resourced Languages".
  * Mikel Forcada (Universitat d=92Alacant, Spain):  "Open source machine=
=20
translation: an opportunity for minor languages"

These talks will  be followed by a poster session with contributed papers=
=2E


Papers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Papers are invited that describe research and development in the followin=
g areas:

  * The BLARK (Basic Language Resource Kit) matrix at ELDA, and how it=20
relates to minority languages.
  * The advantages and disadvantages of different corpus-based strategies=
 for=20
developing MT, with reference to a) speed of development, and b) level of=
=20
researcher expertise required.
  * What open-source or free language resources are available for develop=
ing MT?
  * Existing resources for minority languages, with particular emphasis o=
n=20
software tools that have been found useful.

All contributed papers will be presented in poster format. All contributi=
ons=20
will be included in the workshop proceedings (CD). They will also be=20
published on the SALTMIL website.
