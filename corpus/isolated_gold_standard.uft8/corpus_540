Location: Siegen, Germany 
Contact Person: Petra, Ulrike Burkhardt, Janssen
Meeting Email: petra.burkhardt@staff.uni-marburg.de

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Neurolinguistics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2006 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of the workshop is to present and discuss evidence for minimal structure from current psycho- and neurolinguistic research. The workshop will take place as part of the Annual Conference of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS): http://www.dgfs.de/cgi-bin/dgfs.pl/tagung 

Second Call for Workshop: Experimental evidence for minimal structure

In the past decade, the notion of minimality has received a lot of attention in various linguistic domains. For instance, minimal structure plays a prominent role in syntactic theory where a crucial assumption is that phrase structure building processes follow principles of minimality. In analogy, recent morphological approaches have proposed that inflectional systems can be captured by a minimal set of morphosyntactic categories and features. In phonology, but also in other linguistic domains, optimality-theoretic analyses have been adopted to account for the occurrence of the optimal (unmarked) surface form.

It has further been proposed that principles of minimal structure are reflected in language processing and our workshop therefore aims at linking theoretical claims with experimental findings. We invite presentations from all linguistic domains (including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) that provide psycho- and neurolinguistic evidence for the validity of minimal structures. In this respect, we also invite presentations that address conflict resolution strategies that are required in cases where minimal structures from two (or more) domains clash and where as a result, the output has to violate the minimality priniciple of one of the subdomains.

Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion. Workshop language will be English.

Date: 16-Nov-2006 - 17-Nov-2006
Location: Taipei, Taiwan 
Contact Person: Shu-Chuan Tseng
Meeting Email: tsengsc@gate.sinica.edu.tw
Web Site: http://www.lpss.sinica.edu.tw 

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Pragmatics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2006 

Meeting Description:

This symposium will focus on research results on the processing, analysis and understanding of the linguistic characteristics of spontaneous speech.  And it will also provide an excellent opportunity for linguists, speech engineers, and practitioners of natural language processing and system developers to share with each other the latest thinking and results on spontaneous speech. With no restriction on the languages under investigation, we are interested in contributions concerned with phenomena in all languages. Invited speakers of the symposium are Dafydd Gibbon, Kikuo Maekawa and Elizabeth Shriberg. 

For further details about this symposium, please visit our website at http://www.lpss.sinica.edu.tw. 

We are looking for papers on the following topics: 
- Corpora of spontaneous speech 
- Linguistic analyses on spontaneous speech 
- Characteristics of disfluency in spontaneous speech 
- Understanding spontaneous speech in dialogue systems 
- Automatic speech recognition of spontaneous speech 
- Automatic or manual labelling of spontaneous speech data and 
- Any other topics related to spontaneous speech 

Important dates: 
Deadline for full-paper submission July 31, 2006 
Acceptance notification to authors September 15, 2006 
Deadline for camera-ready paper October 15, 2006 
Symposium dates November 17-18, 2006
