We are pleased to announce that the dates for RANLP'07 have been

(see above). Building on both the successful international summer
schools
organised for more than 17 years, and previous conferences held in
1995,
1997, 2001, 2003 and 2005, RANLP has become one of the most
influential,
competitive and far-reaching conferences, with wide international
participation from all over the world. Featuring leading lights in the
area as keynote speakers or tutorial speakers, RANLP has now grown
into a
larger-scale meeting with accompanying workshops and other events. In
addition to the 6 keynote speeches and tutorials on hot NLP topics,
RANLP07 will be accompanied by workshops and shared task competitions.

Volumes of selected papers are traditionally published by John
Benjamins
Publishers and previous conferences have enjoyed support from the
European
Commission.

Time-table:
Conference 1st Call for Papers: October 2006;
Call for Workshop proposals: November 2006,
                         deadline of proposals end of January 2007;
Workshop selection: early March 2007;
Conference Submission deadline: March 2007 with notification 30 May
2007;
Workshop Submission deadline: 15 June 2007 with notification in July
2007;
RANLP-07 tutorials, workshops and conference: 23-30 September 2007

The conference will be held in the picturesque resort of Borovets. It
is
located in the Rila mountains and is one of the best known ski and
tourist
resorts in South-East Europe. The conference venue Samokov hotel
offers
excellent working and leisure facilities. Borovets is only 1 hour away
from Sofia international airport.
