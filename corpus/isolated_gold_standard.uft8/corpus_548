Location: Siegen, Germany 
Contact Person: Wilhelm Geuder
Meeting Email: wilhelm.geuder@uni-konstanz.de

Linguistic Field(s): Lexicography; Linguistic Theories; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 08-Sep-2006 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is held as a section of the annual meeting of the DGfS (German
Linguistic Society). 

Workshop abstract:

Polysemy poses a challenge for theories on the representation of lexical meaning
because it apparently involves conflicting requirements: on the one hand, we are
dealing with separable semantic variants of a word; on the other hand, the
variants have to be represented as exhibiting systematic connections. In this
way, the phenomenon of polysemy not only straddles the divide between ambiguity
vs. unified word meanings, but also the divide between lexical idiosyncrasy vs.
rule-governed aspects of language  for the term polysemy may be used for cases
with fully productive links between variants, as well as for cases that merely
constitute recurrent patterns whose occurrence is not predictable. 

While undoubtedly polysemy necessitates some amount of lexical listing (and in
this way would seem to discourage large-scale theorising), it is an important
question how models of meaning representation can be designed so as to handle
the connectedness of distinct senses. In this workshop, we will discuss
approaches for dealing with this problem especially by focusing on ways of
providing more fine-grained representations than are usually needed in lexical
semantics. Possible topics, therefore, include (but are not limited to):

- the relationship between lexical representations and representations of
conceptual structure
- models for representing unifying features of polysemic complexes at a
conceptual level, e.g. via conditions on similarity relations.
- methods for determining whether different readings have to constitute lexical
variants or not (e.g. by investigating how pragmatic inferences may supplement
information in lexical representations).
- integration of 'cognitive' and 'formal' approaches to the representation of
word meaning, 
- integration of methods from the cognitive sciences into research on polysemy.
- putting existing semantic and conceptual representation formats to the test
with new (especially cross-linguistic) data.

Invited speakers:

Johannes Dölling (Universität Leipzig)
Liina Pylkkänen (New York University)
Joost Zwarts (Universiteit Utrecht) 

Contributions can take two forms: comprehensive papers for a 60-minute slot, or
short papers for a 30-minute slot (always including discussion). Please indicate
the type of contribution in your submission.

You may submit a detailed abstract of roughly 2 pages. However, submission of
complete short papers is also welcome.

Please send your submission as an e-mail attachment in .pdf or .doc format to 
wilhelm.geuder@uni-konstanz.de.

Languages of the workshop will be English and German (for presentations in
German, handouts / slides should be provided in English).
