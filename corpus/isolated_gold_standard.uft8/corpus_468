Call for Papers

RIAO2007 will be held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, USA from May 30 through June 1, 2007. The RIAO 
conferences, organized by the "Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationales 
d'Informatique Documentaire - C.I.D., treat robust and large-scale 
scientific and industrial solutions to information processing. This is 
the 8th RIAO after conferences in Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988), Barcelona 
(1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997), Paris (2000), 
and Avignon (2004).
The conferences are composed of peer-reviewed scientific sessions and 
demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and advanced 
research prototypes.


Scope of the Conference

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished 
research that has been validated to the level of the creation of a 
functioning prototype. We are interested in large-scale solutions to the 
problem of accessing the semantic content found in unstructured text, 
images, video and audio. Submissions should describe solutions to these 
problems from the following perspectives:
* Automatic indexing of video, images, and speech
* Improved indexing of text, image, video and sound
* Ontologies and unstructured data
* Semantic Web and Ontologies for Full-Scale Information Retrieval
* Automatically producing textual descriptions of images
* Automatically adding metadata to video and sound
* Indexing and retrieval of mixed-media documents
* Indexing interactive documents
* Natural interface dialogue
* Multimedia question answering systems
* Competitive Intelligence
* Intelligent Search Agents
* Multimodal search
* Architectures for semantic treatment of very large databases
* Algorithms for semantic treatment of very large databases
* Comprehension-based question answering and summarization
* Cooperative indexing between media
* Semantics for less studied languages
* Semantic representations and standards
* Collaborative construction of semantic resources
* Indexing multilingual collections
* Automatic extraction of ontologies from unstructured data
* Aligning multilingual ontologies
* Language resources for multimedia indexing
* Extracting semantic resources from raw data
* Semantic annotation of blogs and videoblogs
* Exploiting large-scale resources for e-learning
* Structuring cultural heritage
* Technological, commercial, industrial watch systems
* Semantic access to large and open archives


Program Chair

* David A. Evans (Americas)
* Chantal Soulé-Dupuy (Europe)
* Sadaoki Furui (Asia)


Paper Submission

We welcome submissions both from the research community and industry 
concerning the main conference theme of treating the semantic content of 
large quantities of text, images, videos, and sound.
Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed or 
well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of completion 
of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where appropriate, 
results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of statistical 
significance for quantitative results is encouraged.
Submissions should contain original material that has not been 
previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel submission 
for other publication or a significant overlap in contents with 
previously published work should be clearly indicated to the program 
committee.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee 
members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance, 
technical quality, and presentation.
Papers must be submitted on the conference's web site: www.riao.org
Papers can be submitted in two categories: long papers or short papers. 
Full papers are appropriate for describing substantial research with 
well-evaluated results and short papers will typically describe ongoing 
research and preliminary results. All accepted papers in both categories 
will be published in the conference proceedings. At the conference, full 
papers will be presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as 
a poster.
Long papers must not be more than 20 pages (on one column, 
single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an abstract. 
Short papers must not be more than 6 pages (on one column, 
single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an abstract. 
Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.
The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees and 
through the CID after the conference.
Call for Applications

The RIAO conferences are meeting places for scientific and industrial 
specialists in information retrieval. There are sites for presentations 
of both high-level peer-reviewed scientific research and prototypes and 
of innovative products, selected by a special call for products. A 
global call for products is sent at the same time that the call for 
papers. The products presented are chosen uniquely on the basis of their 
innovativeness.
The "Centre de Hautes Études Internationales d'Informatique 
Documentaire" (C.I.D.) organizes the RIAO conferences every three years 
since 1985. RIAO stands for "Recherche d'Information Assistée par 
Ordinateur".
RIAO conferences have two selection committees: a Program Committee for 
scientific papers, and an Applications Committee which seeks out and 
selects those innovative products for the conference.
The RIAO conferences are not trade shows since the teams presenting 
innovative products are selected and do not pay for the place and time 
that they are given during the conference.
Companies whose product fulfills the criteria of novelty and of 
innovativeness can fill in a dossier designed by the conference 
organizers that describes their submitted product.
In addition to the dossier, product submitters will have to provide 
access to an online or CD version of the product that demonstrates the 
claimed innovative functionalities of the product. Applications 
Committee members will verify the functionalities of the product.
After examination of the dossier and the demonstration of each product, 
the Application Committee members select the best products.
Each chosen company will be provided with a demonstration space 
(including table and chair) free of charge. The space is near the 
amphitheatre in which the scientific papers are presented.
Each company may also be given a special time slot (15 minutes) to give 
a short presentation about the product.
In addition, innovative products chosen for RIAO 2007 will be able to 
present their financial prospects to technology financing specialists 
(venture capital, private equity) that will be specifically invited for 
these presentations.
The general topic of the Call for Applications is:
INNOVATIVE TOOLS PROVIDING ACCESS TO VERY LARGE VOLUMES OF MULTIMEDIA 
AND/OR MULTILINGUAL DATA

* Automatic indexing of video, images, and speech
