ACL/SIGPARSE    will host the  9th    International Workshop  on Parsing
Technologies (IWPT'03) on October 9 and 10, 2005 in conjunction with the
2005 Human Language Technology   Conference and Conference  on Empirical
Methods in Natural Language Processing (HLT/EMNLP; see
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/HLT-EMNLP05/home.html).

IWPT'05  continues  the  tradition  of  biennial  workshops  on  parsing
technology organized by SIGPARSE,  the Special Interest Group on Parsing
of the  Association for Computational Linguistics  (ACL).  This workshop
series was initiated  by Masaru Tomita in 1989.   The first workshop, in
Pittsburgh  and  Hidden Valley,  was  followed  by  workshops in  Cancun
(Mexico) in  1991; Tilburg (Netherlands)  and Durbuy (Belgium)  in 1993;
Prague  and  Karlovy Vary  (Czech  Republic)  in 1995;  Boston/Cambridge
(Massachusetts) in 1997; Trento (Italy) in 2000;  Beijing (China) in 2001;
and Nancy (France) in 2003.


Topics of interest for IWPT'05
---------------------------------------
Topics of   interest  for IWPT'05  include,  but  are not   limited  to:
theoretical and practical   studies  of parsing algorithms  for  natural
language sentences, texts,  fragments, dialogues,  ill-formed sentences,
speech input,    multi-dimensional  (pictorial)  or   signed  languages,
multimedia (web)  documents, and parsing  issues arising or  viewed in a
multimodal context.  Both knowledge-based and statistical approaches are
welcome.


Submitting Papers
-------------------------
Two types of submissions are invited:
- full papers, to be  presented as such  during  the workshop and to  be
  published in  the workshop proceedings  (maximally 12 pages); 
- short papers, to be presented at  the workshop in the form of a poster
  plus a  summary oral presentation  in a short-paper  session; two-page
  summaries will be published in the workshop proceedings.

Prospective authors are invited to send their submissions electronically
through  the   website   http://bulba.sdsu.edu/iwpt05  (see   below  for
formatting and submission instructions).

Full papers should not exceed 12 pages; short papers should not exceed 8
pages.  Submission is electronically,   in postscript or pdf  form. Send
electronic submssions to:

             iwpt05@bulba.sdsu.edu 
Only in  case electronic submission  is impossible, four (4) hard copies
of the the paper should be sent. Hardcopy  submissions should be sent to
the program chair:
