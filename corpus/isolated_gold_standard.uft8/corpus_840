Call for Papers

Special Issue of Dialogue & Discourse on Incremental Processing in Dialogue

This is the 2nd call for papers. There is only one addendum compared =20
to the first call: if you are thinking of submitting an article, we =20
would appreciate if you could let us know by email so that we can =20
organise the review panel in a timely manner.

Background
----------

The topic of the special issue is "incremental processing in =20
dialogue", by which we mean, very broadly, the successive processing =20
of input (or generation of output) in increments smaller than whole =20
utterances.

This is a topic that has been of interest in many different =20
communities, with different foci. In conversation analysis, the main =20
interest has been on larger increments and their regular =20
distributions, for example on the allocation of turns or the placing =20
of repairs (e.g., Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974 and 1977). At =20
about the same time, researchers working on the psychology of language =20
processing considered small increments such as phonemes and clusters =20
of them in words (Marslen-Wilson 1973, Grosjean 1986, Bard et al. =20
1988). Work in psycholinguistics continued with Herb Clark's research =20
program that covered inter alia incrementality in syntax production =20
and reference resolution (Clark and Marshall 1981, Clark and =20
Wilkes-Gibbs 1990), and the fine-grained structure of speakers' =20
successive contributions in dialogue (Clark and Schaefer 1989). =20
Eye-trackers and ERPs later gave researchers access to fine-grained =20
data about the time course of interpretation (e.g., Tanenhaus et al. =20
1995, van Berkum et al. 1999). In linguistic theory, the development =20
of Dynamic Syntax (Kempson, Meyer-Viol, Gabbay 2001, Cann, Kempson, =20
Marten 2005) triggered new interest in questions of how =20
representations can be built up incrementally (after some earlier work =20
e.g. by Neumann (1994, 1998) and Wiren (1994) at the DFKI =20
Saarbr=FCcken). In dialogue theory, PTT explored how =20
"micro-conversational events" (Poesio 1995, Poesio and Traum 1997) can =20
be linked up with dialogue theory, an idea also taken up in Ginzburg's =20
KoS (Ginzburg, in press). More recently, some computational work has =20
looked at how incremental processing can be realised in dialogue =20
systems (Skantze and Schlangen 2009, Sagae et al. 2009, Edlund et al =20
2008).

The purpose of this special issue is to bring together work from =20
researchers from the different fields where incrementality of language =20
processing, in particular in relation to dialogue, is an issue. Our =20
aim is to take stock of the current state of the art as well as to =20
represent current, cutting edge research. We are seeking contributions =20
from people from a range of disciplines including, but not limited to =20
psycholinguistics, computational dialogue modelling and more =20
traditional linguistics.


Topics of Interest
------------------

We seek submission on topics including, but not limited to, the following:


Incrementality and Dialogue Structure:

Consideration of incrementality changes one's assessment of dialogue =20
structure. Papers in this section may e.g. deal with sub-turn =20
activities of contributors to dialogue such as forms of =20
acknowledgement, repair and other means of "help by other" and which =20
type of structures these contributions will generate.


The Time-Course of Interpretation Processes:

Here prototypical papers could deal with the problem of which type of =20
information gets priority in the interpretation process, for example =20
syntax or prosody, and can hence serve as a sort of integration =20
instance.


Accounts of Incremental Information from Different Strata of Dialogue:

Papers in this field are related to the fact that increments may carry =20
information on, say, prosody, rhetorical relations, continuations with =20
respect to semantics, anaphora and valence information which all have
to be filed into different places of some temporal dialogue structure =20
and which will generate different structural expectations.

Computational Models of Incremental Processing:

Papers in this area will inter alia deal with the coordination of =20
planning, production and parsing-processes with respect to =20
sub-propositional units.

Theoretical Models of Incrementality:

Papers in this area will focus on preconditions for or layers of =20
dialogue theory and their interfaces.

Repercussions of the Incrementality Concept on Traditional Topics of =20
Dialogue Theory:

Looking at proposals concerning dialogue structure one sees that these =20
basically rest on a propositional or on a speech act foundation. The =20
foundation then provides the preconditions for various sorts of
explanations. If one works with increments, the solution concepts for =20
time-honoured problems of dialogue description like systematic =20
up-dating, rhetorical relations, grounding or the resolution of =20
anaphora will have to change.


About the Journal
-----------------

"Dialogue and Discourse" (http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org) is =20
the first international journal dedicated exclusively to work that =20
deals with language "beyond the single sentence", in discourse (i.e., =20
text, monologue) and dialogue, from a theoretical as well as an =20
experimental and technical perspective.


Practical Information
---------------------

Submission deadline is December 31st, 2009. Manuscripts need to be =20
formatted according to "Dialogue and Discourse" author guidelines, and =20
submitted using the journal's online manuscript submission system (see =20
http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org/). As a guideline, full articles =20
should be around 30 pages, but if justified, significantly shorter or =20
longer papers will be considered as well. Publication of this special =20
issue will be in 2010.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if your have any practical =20
questions or are unsure about whether a possible topic you would like =20
to write about would fall under this call.
