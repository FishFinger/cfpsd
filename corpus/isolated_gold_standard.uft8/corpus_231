Linguistic Field(s): Historical Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 14-Dec-2009

Meeting Description:

Language, Text & History
Linguistics and Philology in the 21st Century 

Call for Papers

For much of the 20th century it was common to figure Linguistics and Philology
as rivals or even antagonists in the field of language-study. More recently, the
border barriers have started to come down as researchers on both sides have
increasingly recognised the complex interdependencies between code and context,
synchrony and diachrony. 

The aim of our symposium is to celebrate this new spirit of partnership and to
showcase some of the new research and researchers it will bring to the fore in
the 21st century. We therefore invite offers of papers from doctoral students
and early career researchers working on topics which link language-structure to
language history or textual practice. 

The two-day event will also feature a hands-on workshop exploring ways in which
philological and linguistic approaches can enrich each other and a panel
discussion and Q&A session led by members of the Society representing work
across a range of language-families. The workshop will be led by Professor
Andrew Garrett of the University of California at Berkeley, who will also give
the concluding paper of the symposium on Saturday 20th March.  

Offers of papers, accompanied by an abstract of not more than 150 words, should
be sent to Professor Sylvia Adamson at president@philsoc.org.uk by Monday 14
December 2009.
