Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories 

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2010 

Meeting Description:

The Center for Linguistic Theory, Beijing Language and Culture University, is
proud to announce that it will host the 8th Conference of the Generative
Linguistics in the Old World (Asia), on August 12-16, 2010 in Beijing, China. We
are honored that Professor Noam Chomsky will be the keynote speaker of the
conference. We cordially invite submission of abstracts representing original
research dealing with current issues in all areas of generative theoretical
linguistics. 

Call for Papers

We cordially invite submission of abstracts representing original research
dealing with current issues in all areas of generative theoretical linguistics.
Each accepted paper will be allotted 30 minutes for presentation and 10-15
minutes for discussion. It is expected that funds will be available to provide
presenters of accepted papers with some form of travel subsidy and/or coverage
of lodging expenses. Please follow these guidelines to submit your abstracts:

All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two (2)
single-spaced pages, complete with examples and a (selected) bibliography.
(Please have examples interspersed with the text, but list the references at the
end.) All texts should fit within three A4 pages, with 1-inch margin all around.
Use font size 12 throughout, preferably in Times or Times New Roman. Romanize
all Asian texts, and avoid Asian character fonts unless absolutely necessary. 

Each abstract should start with the title (centered) at top, followed by 4
single-spaced blank lines, above the main text. To facilitate anonymous review,
please be sure that your abstract is anonymous, with no indication of author
identity throughout. (Author information should be provided in your email when
submitting your abstract.)

Each author is limited to the submission of one abstract for review, either as
sole author or as co-author. Please note that although the GLOW conference will
be held in coordination with TEAL-6 Workshop and the Zhu-Lu Symposium, these 
are independently organized and run. Each author is therefore welcome to submit 
abstracts to more than one event, as long as the abstracts are substantially
different in content. We strongly discourage the submission of one identical
abstract to two events.
