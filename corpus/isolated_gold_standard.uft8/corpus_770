  23rd International Workshop on Description Logics (DL 2010)
                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
                   Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

          http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/conferences/dl2010/

The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic
research community. The workshop is the premier forum to meet, discuss
and exchange experiences among all those, both in the academia and
industry, who are interested in description logics and their
applications.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline:             January 26th, 2010
Acceptance notification:	       March 9th, 2010
Camera ready copies:		       March 30th, 2010
Early registration:		       March 30th, 2010
Workshop:			       May 4 to May 7th

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WORKSHOP SCOPE

We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics,
such as

* foundations of description logics, including expressive power,
  decidability and complexity of reasoning, novel inference problems,
  and reasoning techniques for solving these problems;

* extensions of description logics, including, but not limited to,
  closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning, defaults, epistemic
  reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, and
  query languages;

* integration of description logics with other formalisms, such as
  object-oriented representation languages, database query languages,
  constraint-based programming, logic programming, and rule-based
  systems;

* use of description logics in applications or areas such as ontology
  engineering, ontology languages, databases, semi-structured data,
  document management, natural language, learning, planning, semantic
  web, and grid computing;

* building systems based on description logics, with special emphasis
  on optimization and implementation techniques; and

* tools that exploit description logic reasoning, such as ontology
  editors, database schema design, query optimization, and data
  integration tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSION DETAILS

We invite submissions of papers in Springer LNCS style, see

    http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html
