Dear Sara,
There was a paper on call for papers (:]) at the IPrA 
conference last year in Riva del Garda. It was held in 
a panel on CMC, but I don't remember the title, nor 
the name of the panelist. It should be easy, though, 
to find it in the IPrA site.

If you don't find it I should have the abstracts 
somewhere.

Good search,
MES
