3rd International Conference of the Belgian Association of Anglicists in Higher

Final Call for Papers

Varieties of Voice - 3rd international BAAHE conference
7-9 December 2006, University of Leuven, Belgium
http://www.kuleuven.be/ilt/baahe_2006conference/

Extended Deadline:20 August 2006

The Belgian Association of Anglicists in Higher Education (BAAHE) will organize
its 3rd International Conference from 7 to 9 December 2006 at the University of
Leuven, Belgium.

This interdisciplinary conference will explore the role played by 'Voice' in
various fields of English studies. It will consider:
-the synchronic and diachronic ways in which the (subjective) voice of the
language user manifests itself linguistically, i.e. in the constructional
properties of syntagms used;
-those aspects of academic English that are relevant to helping learners find an
appropriate academic voice in speaking and writing;
-the literary status of 'voice': we will inquire into the impact of recent
theoretical and/or technological developments on how the concept is handled in
literary studies.

Paper proposals (20 minutes + 10 minutes discussion) are invited on the
following questions and issues:

Linguistics:
-(inter-)subjective motivations of voice such as
-choice of active vs. passive voice for optimal negotiation of information
between speaker/hearer;
-evaluative and other subjective effects of middle constructions;
-subjective vs. more objective constructions (e.g. subjective vs. objective
modality);
-speech and thought representation: representational vs. subjective uses, their
impact on point of view;
-the diachronic shift from representational to interpersonal import of
constructions;
-other aspects of interpersonal varieties of voice.

ELT-Academic English:
-author stance in academic writing: differences between disciplines and cultures
(e.g. hedging)
-register varieties: formality in academic genres; diachronic developments
-citation strategies: how and why do writers incorporate other voices in their
own writing?
-presentation and seminar skills: tone and register; strategies to voice
comments and objections
Exploring the differences between native and non-native speakers, or between
learners and experienced speakers, should yield insights into how EAP materials
can help learners construct an appropriate academic voice.

Literature:
-Is voice still part of 'what is at stake in modernity', as Barthes once argued?
-After deconstruction, does voice exist hors texte? How does it relate to écriture?
-What is the relation between voice and (point of) view? How does a textual
voice acquire authority?
-To what extent is voice a gendered concept?
-Can a literary voice travel across cultures, periods and languages? Is it bound
to cultural identity?
-Do different voices always imply Bakhtinian polyphony? Does the single, lyrical
voice survive in poetry? How crucial is voice in drama and film?

Plenary speakers:
Suzanne Kemmer (Rice University): ''Intransitive Structures and Functions''
Ken Hyland (University of London): ''Disciplinary voices: interactions in
research writing''
Anne Fogarty (University College Dublin): '''I was a Voice': Orality and Silence
in Contemporary Irish Women's Poetry''

Selected proceedings will be published in the 2007 issue of the international
journal BELL.

Abstracts (up to 500 words) should be sent before 20 August 2006 to Linguistics:
