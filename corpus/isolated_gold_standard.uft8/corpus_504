Meeting Description:

International Conference on Adjectives
University of Lille 3
September 13-15 2007

As opposed to verbs and nouns, adjectives have often been somewhat neglected in
linguistic research. However adjectives and their properties represent a broad
ranging research topic raising many major issues, both from a typological point
of view, with respect to the definition of the category, and from the point of
view of their syntax and semantics, which combine verbal and nominal properties.
Investigations of the adjective can raise major theoretical challenges for
linguistic theories, which tend to be centered on the verb and the noun, raising
numerous theoretical questions. Abstracts for the conference we are organizing
at the University of Lille 3, in September 2007, are invited on all questions
pertaining to adjectives.

Important dates:
-Dead line for abstract submission: 15 February 2007
-Notification of acceptance to authors: 1 May 2007
-Preliminary program: June 15 2007
-Conference: September 13-15 2007

pertaining to adjectives, including:

-	The derivational morphology of adjectives
-	The inflexion of adjectives

-	The argument structure of adjectives
-	The syntax of adjectives and their behaviour both within and 
                outside of the noun phrase
-	Predicative uses of adjectives
-	The ordering of adjectives
-	Relationships between adjectives and participles and other 
                intermediate forms between the adjective and verb
-	Relations between adjectives and nouns
-	The typological status of adjectives

Important dates:

Colloque international sur les adjectifs
Université Lille 3, France
13-15 septembre 2007

1e Appel à communications
(version française)

Conférenciers invités : Guglielmo Cinque (Università di Venezia), Greville
Corbett (University of Surrey), Chris Kennedy (University of Chicago), Louise
McNally (Universitat Pompeu Fabra), Ora Matushansky (Université de Paris 8)

Par rapport aux verbes et aux noms, les adjectifs constituent les parents
pauvres en linguistique. Pourtant, les adjectifs et leurs propriétés
représentent un vaste domaine de recherche et posent souvent de nombreux défis à
la théorie linguistique, à la fois au niveau typologique, pour ce qui est de la
définition de la classe, et par leur statut syntaxico-sémantique, qui combine
des propriétés verbales et nominales. Leur étude permet cependant d'éprouver les
différentes théories linguistiques centrées sur les verbes et les noms et
soulève des questions multiples qui rendent intéressante toute investigation
portant sur les membres de cette catégorie aux contours encore flous.
Les soumissions que nous sollicitons pour le colloque que nous tiendrons à
l'université de Lille 3 en septembre 2007 pourront porter sur toute question en
rapport avec la problématique de l'adjectif. A titre indicatif, l'approche
pourra être:

-	La morphologie dérivationnelle des adjectifs
-	La flexion adjectivale
-	La sémantique lexicale des adjectifs
-	Leur structure argumentale
-	La syntaxe des adjectifs et leur comportement à l'intérieur et 
                à l'extérieur du syntagme nominal
-	L'emploi épithète et prédicatif des adjectifs
-	L'ordre des adjectifs
-	Les relations entre adjectifs et participes et autres formes 
                intermédiaires entre verbe et adjectif
-	Les relations entre adjectifs et noms
-	Le statut typologique des adjectifs

Calendrier:

-	Date limite de soumission : 15 février 2007
-	Notification des acceptations aux auteurs : 1e mai 2007
-	Programme préliminaire : 15 juin 2007
-	Colloque : 13-15 septembre 2007


Modalités de soumission:

1) Un résumé anonyme (en français ou en anglais) ne dépassant pas 1000 mots,
bibliographie non comprise, l'ensemble (résumé + bibliographie) ne dépassant pas
2 pages format A4 corps Times 12. Le résumé devra spécifier clairement le sujet
traité et les conclusions principales établies en faisant référence aux travaux
antérieurs sur la question. Les données les plus centrales, qui permettent
d'étayer vos conclusions, devront être citées. 
2) Une page séparée mentionnant vos nom et prénom, votre appartenance
administrative, votre adresse postale, votre statut, votre courriel et le titre
de votre contribution.
Les soumissions seront envoyées par courrier électronique à
colloque.adjectifs@univ-lille3.fr de préférence au format .pdf, et à défaut aux
formats .rtf ou .doc (veillez à envoyer le résumé et la page où figurent les
renseignements personnels sous des fichiers attachés distincts, le premier étant
nommé nom.abstract.pdf et le second nom.perso.pdf, où ''nom'' est le nom de
l'auteur de l'article ou de l'auteur qui sert de contact en cas d'auteurs
multiples). Délai de rigueur : 15 février 2007. (On acceptera un seul résumé à
titre de seul auteur et un en collaboration.)
S'il vous est impossible de faire une soumission électronique, vous pouvez
envoyer 2 copies papier du résumé et de la page comportant les renseignements
personnels à l'adresse suivante avant le 15 février 2004 (date limite de
réception) :

BACKGROUND
----------
The general problem of interpreting text involves the determination of
the semantic relations among the entities and the events they
participate in. Given a sentence, one formulation of the task consists
of detecting basic event structures such as "who" did "what" to
"whom", "when" and "where". From a linguistic point of view, a key
component of the task corresponds to identifying the semantic
arguments filling the roles of the sentence predicates. These
predicates are mainly lexicalized by verbs but also by some verb
nominalizations and adjectives. Typical predicate semantic arguments
include Agent, Patient, and Instrument; semantic roles may also be
found as adjuncts (e.g., Locative, Temporal, Manner, and Cause). The
related tasks of determining the semantic relations among nouns and
their modifiers, as well as prepositions and their arguments, are
clearly important for text interpretation as well, and indeed often
draw on similar role labels.

As with many areas in computational linguistcs (CL) and Natural
Language Processing (NLP), work has proceeded for decades on manually
created semantic grammars and other resources for supporting text
interpretation (e.g., [Hirst 1987], [Pustejovsky 1995], [Copestake and
Flickinger 2000]). This body of research has supported deep semantic
analysis of language input, but has the drawbacks typical of such
approaches in requiring intensive manual labor, often restricted to
narrow domains. The growth of statistical machine learning methods,
addressing these issues of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, were
for many years limited in this area to related problems of learning
subcategorization frames [Briscoe and Carroll 1997] or classifying
verbs according to argument structure properties [Merlo and Stevenson
2001] [Schulte im Walde 2000], due to the lack of appropriate
resources to support such methods in labeling semantic roles of
arguments.

Recently, however, the compilation and manual annotation with semantic
roles of medium-large corpora - the PropBank, NomBank, and FrameNet
initiatives - has enabled the development of statistical approaches
specifically for the task of semantic role labeling (SRL). SRL,
especially focused on the labeling of verbal arguments and adjuncts,
has become a well-defined task with a substantial body of work and
comparative evaluation (e.g., see [Gildea and Jurafsky 2002],
[Surdeanu et al. 2003], [Xue and Palmer 2004], [Pradhan et al. 2005],
CoNLL Shared Task in 2004 and 2005, Senseval-3). The identification of
such event frames holds potential for significant impact in many NLP
applications, as suggested by the following works on Information
Extraction [Surdeanu et al. 2003], Question Answering [Narayanan and
Harabagiu 2004], Summarization [Melli et al. 2005], and Machine
Translation [Boas 2002]; as well, work on noun modifier relations has
been encouraging for related NLP tasks (e.g., [Moldovan and Badulescu
2005], [Rosario and Hearst 2004]). Although the use of SRL systems in
real-world applications has so far been limited, the outlook is
promising over the next several years for a spread of this type of
analysis to a range of applications requiring some level of semantic
interpretation. Moreover, the problem represents an excellent
framework to perform research on CL and NLP techniques for acquiring
and exploiting semantic relations among the different components of
the structured output to be constructed.

TOPICS
------
The call for papers of this special issue invites submissions of
articles describing novel and challenging work and results in Semantic
Role Labeling (SRL) and its applications, with emphasis on the
evaluation of qualitative and quantitative aspects that give a deep
insight on the SRL task and, in general, on the syntactico-semantic
processing of natural language. The range of topics to be covered
includes, but is not limited to:

     * Novel statistical and machine learning approaches and
       architectures for SRL
     * Study of the relevant information/knowledge for the task
     * Learning from small training sets
     * Unsupervised models for SRL
     * Scalability of the state-of-the-art systems
     * How to make systems robust against annotation errors
     * Inclusion of deep semantic information and relations
     * Generalization to new corpora and to new unseen frames
     * Knowledge-based approaches to SRL and comparison to the
       statistical approach
     * Combination of systems and approaches, specially addressing the
       integration of knowledge-based and statistical views
     * Study of the relation between the syntactic and semantic layers
       for SRL characterization and system development
     * Applications of SRL (e.g., in domains such as Q&A, MT,
       Summarization, etc.)
     * Evaluation: new metrics for direct evaluation and indirect
       evaluations through applications
     * Development of copora and resources for the task
     * SRL for languages other than English

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 05-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

Human language is the product of evolved mechanisms that develop in supportive environments.  To understand language, we need to improve present understandings of evolutionary and developmental processes responsible for its emergence.  This conference proposes to bring together leading scholars in the broad area of language and communication, with a focus on developmental and evolutionary issues.  Abstracts are welcome in such areas as: language acquisition in children, computational modeling, evolution of language, comparative studies, gesture and sign language, biology of language and cognition.  While papers on the main topic are particularly welcome, individuals are encouraged to submit abstracts on any subject in theoretical and applied linguistics. 

Abstracts should be anonymous, titled, single-spaced and not more than 425 words in length.  Please send abstracts as an attachment (in a Microsoft file, if possible) via email to the conference coordinator.  Within the email, indicate your name, affiliation, address, email address, title of paper, and audio-visual equipment needed.  Simultaneously, send to the coordinator via snail mail one hardcopy of the abstract, for editing and verification purposes.

Those wishing to propose panels or special sessions should contact the conference chair.  Time allotted will be 20 minutes for delivery of the paper plus 5 minutes discussion.  Deadline for receipt of abstracts is January 5, 2007.

E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: call for submissions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and 
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to 
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and 
Information. Submissions are invited for 2005. The prize will be awarded 
to the best dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. in the year 2005. The 
dissertations will be judged on technical depth and strength, 
originality, and impact made in at least two of the three fields of 
Logic, Language, and Computation.

Who qualifies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree 
in the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st, 
2005 and December 31st, 2005. There is no restriction on the nationality 
of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was granted. After a 
careful consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only dissertations 
written in English. Dissertations produced in 2005 but not written in 
English or not translated will be allowed for submission, after 
translation, also with the call next year (for 2006).

Prize
~~~~~
The prize consists of

* a certificate
* a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
* an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to the 
new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be published 
by Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further information on 
this series is available on the FoLLI site)

How to submit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are 
required:

    1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
    2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
    3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. 
Self-nominations are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by 
the thesis supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely 
describe the scope and significance of the dissertation and state when 
the degree was officially awarded;
    4. two additional letters of support, including at least one letter 
from a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that awarded 
the Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to

                 beth_award@dimi.uniud.it

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.

In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack of 
notification within three working days after submission, nominators 
should write to policriti@dimi.uniud.it or areces@loria.fr

E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: call for submissions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
Information. Submissions are invited for 2005. The prize will be awarded
to the best dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. in the year 2005. The
dissertations will be judged on technical depth and strength,
originality, and impact made in at least two of the three fields of
Logic, Language, and Computation.

Who qualifies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree
in the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st,
2005 and December 31st, 2005. There is no restriction on the nationality
of the candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was granted. After a
careful consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only dissertations
written in English. Dissertations produced in 2005 but not written in
English or not translated will be allowed for submission, after
translation, also with the call next year (for 2006).

Prize
~~~~~
The prize consists of

* a certificate
* a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
* an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to the
new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be published
by Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further information on
this series is available on the FoLLI site)

How to submit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are
required:

    1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
    2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
    3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor.
Self-nominations are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by
the thesis supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely
describe the scope and significance of the dissertation and state when
the degree was officially awarded;
    4. two additional letters of support, including at least one letter
from a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that awarded
the Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to

                 beth_award@dimi.uniud.it

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.

In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack of
notification within three working days after submission, nominators
should write to policriti@dimi.uniud.it or areces@loria.fr

Important dates

Meeting Description:

This workshop, co-organized by Janet Grijzenhout and Baris Kabak
(University of Konstanz), will investigate the nature of
morphosyntax-phonology mapping and the principles that govern the
prosodization of morphological elements, with special attention to
cross-linguistic variation. It will take place at the University of Siegen,
Germany as part of the 29th Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics
Society (DGfS).

Workshop description:

Systematic phonological alternations often seem to be bound to a particular
phonological domain. The theory of Prosodic Phonology (e.g. Selkirk 1980,
1986; Nespor & Vogel 1986; Hayes 1989) holds that speech is hierarchically
organized into constituents that are not necessarily isomorphic to
syntactic constituents. Previous literature has largely dealt with how
morphological elements can be organized into the prosodic structure. It has
been reported that within individual languages as well as
cross-linguistically, there can be systematic differences in the
prosodization of function words. For instance, Selkirk (1984) states that
the principles of syntax-phonology mapping are blind to the presence of
functional categories. Closer examination reveals that not only function
words, but also various other morphological elements - e.g. suffixes and
clitics - may vary with respect to the way they are prosodized. Moreover,
within one syntactic category, elements may belong to different prosodic
categories (e.g. the German preposition statt 'instead of' seems to
function as a prosodic word, whereas in 'in' does not form a prosodic word
of its own). Furthermore, morphological elements may behave as part of a
prosodic domain x with respect to a (set of) phonological process(es) while
they may seem to belong to another domain in the context of other processes
(e.g., Turkish instrumental suffix -lA, which undergoes vowel harmony but
fails to receive word-level right-most default stress). Also, the rules
posited for morphology-phonology mapping seem to be based on circular
logic: a syntactic category may determine the onset of a particular
prosodic domain in which, for example, stress assignment takes place, but
at the same time presence or absence of primary stress suggests the
inclusion or exclusion of a particular element from that very same domain.
Apart from various issues concerning phrasing algorithms and
syntax-phonology mapping, the precise nature of the prosodic hierarchy and
its various components have also been controversial. While, for instance,
several researchers questioned the necessity of the Clitic Group (e.g., Zec
1988; Booij 1988; Peperkamp 1997), others argue that the theory predicts
even less structure than is attested across the languages of the world
(e.g., recent work by Balthasar Bickel and colleagues at the University of
Leipzig). 

In this workshop, we are specifically interested in the nature of the
morphosyntax-phonology mapping and the principles that govern the
prosodization of morphological elements, with special attention to
cross-linguistic variation. In this respect, the following issues will be
addressed: (i) how much of mapping rules is given by universal grammar
versus language-specific principles?, (ii) do morphological elements bear
any (lexical) information with respect to their morphophonological
categorization (cf. Inkelas 1989) and how should that information be
represented?, (iii) is there a set of universal prosodic domains and are
all of the domains suggested in the literature necessary?

We invite linguists who work on prosodic phonology and
phonology-morphosyntax interface from all perspectives and methodologies
including those working in the fields of typology, historical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and language modeling. General theoretical discussions
and analyses of language-specific issues are equally welcome.

Talks will be 20 minutes each, with 10 minutes of discussion.
 
Abstract submission procedure: 
Please send an anonymous abstract of max. 500 words, as a text file or Word
file, to prosodicdomains@uni-konstanz.de (or to any of the e-mail addresses
given below).

CALL FOR PAPERS
The Australasian Ontology Workshop (AOW 2006)
Held in Conjunction with the 19th Australian Joint Conference on =
Artificial Intelligence (AI'06)

Advances in Ontologies:

The use of formal ontologies in knowledge systems has many advantages. =
It allows for an unambiguous specification of the structure of knowledge =
in a domain, enables knowledge sharing and, as a result, makes it =
possible to perform automated reasoning about ontologies. In recent =
years there has been a worldwide increase in the use of ontologies, both =
in industry and in research laboratories. There is a growing community =
of researchers in Australia and New Zealand, working on various aspects =
of ontologies. The primary aim of this workshop is to bring together =
ontology researchers in the region.=20

E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize: call for submissions.

Since 2002, FoLLI (the European Association for Logic, Language, and
Information, www.folli.org) awards the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize to
outstanding dissertations in the fields of Logic, Language, and
Information. Submissions are invited for 2005. The prize will be awarded to
the best dissertation which resulted in a Ph.D. in the year 2005. The
dissertations will be judged on technical depth and strength, originality,
and impact made in at least two of the three fields of Logic, Language, and
Computation.

Who qualifies

Nominations of candidates are admitted who were awarded a Ph.D. degree in
the areas of Logic, Language, or Information between January 1st, 2005 and
December 31st, 2005. There is no restriction on the nationality of the
candidate or the university where the Ph.D. was granted. After a careful
consideration, FoLLI has decided to accept only dissertations written in
English. Dissertations produced in 2005 but not written in English or not
translated will be allowed for submission, after translation, also with the
call next year (for 2006).

Prize

The prize consists of

- a certificate
- a donation of 2500 euros provided by the E. W. Beth Foundation.
- an invitation to submit the thesis (or a revised version of it) to the
new series of books in Logic, Language and Information to be published by
Springer-Verlag as part of LNCS or LNCS/LNAI. (Further information on this
series is available on the FoLLI site)

How to submit

Only electronic submissions are accepted. The following documents are required:

   1. the thesis in pdf or ps format (doc/rtf not accepted);
   2. a ten page abstract of the dissertation in ascii or pdf format;
   3. a letter of nomination from the thesis supervisor. Self-nominations
are not admitted: each nomination must be sponsored by the thesis
supervisor. The letter of nomination should concisely describe the scope
and significance of the dissertation and state when the degree was
officially awarded;
   4. two additional letters of support, including at least one letter from
a referee not affiliated with the academic institution that awarded the
Ph.D. degree.

All documents must be submitted electronically to

                beth_award@dimi.uniud.it

Hard copy submissions are not admitted.

In case of any problems with the email submission or a lack of notification
within three working days after submission, nominators should write to
policriti@dimi.uniud.it or areces@loria.fr

Domain-Specific Modeling raises the level of abstraction beyon
programmin
by specifying the solution directly using domain concepts. In many cases
final products can be generated automatically from these high-leve
specifications. This automation is possible because both the language an
generators need fit the requirements of only one company and domain

Object-Oriented programming languages, such as Java, use objects as th
fundamental building blocks for representing the world.  While thi
approach enables rich representation of the properties and behaviou
of objects, it provides surprisingly limited support for representin

URL: http://www.ro.mq.edu.au/HDRU/forms_scholar/ICSAPAIATO.pd

The Computing Department, Macquarie University are offering one Australia
Postgraduate Awards (Industry) Scholarship (APAI). The Australia
Taxation Office (ATO) and Macquarie University have gained funding unde
the ARC Linkage Projects (LP0561985) to support a research program fo
the optimisation of tax collections by improving the prediction an
classification of taxpayer debt payment risk

Predictive models for financial distress and insolvency risk will b
developed in this project. These models will be used to contribute to th
understanding taxpayers; circumstances and the choice of appropriat
collection actions. The successful applicant (PhD student) will conduc
research in Macquarie's Intelligent Systems Group and collaborate wit

of objects, it provides surprisingly limited support for representin
relationships in ad-hoc ways, which results in needless errors, cod .....=

[Apologies for multiple copies]

                   Ontologies in Text Technology:
Approaches to Extract Semantic Knowledge from Syntactic Information
                   28 September - 29 September 2006
                     University of Osnabrueck

                  CALL FOR EXTENDED ABSTRACTS

                   Deadline:  July 31st, 2006
Notification of acceptance:  August 31st, 2006

Organizing committee:
        Uwe Moennich (University of Tuebingen)
        Kai-Uwe Kuehnberger (University of Osnabrueck)

Invited speakers:
        Klaus Schulz (CIS Munich)
        Guus Schreiber (Free University Amsterdam)

Ontologies play an important role in a variety of text technological
applications. Due to the fact that hand-crafted ontologies are tedious
to develop, automatic generation, dynamic adaptations, and learning of
ontologies are desirable. The type of knowledge that is available for
solving these tasks is often restricted to syntactic information. The
workshop addresses and focuses on the question of how it is possible
to
extract semantic knowledge for ontology design by structurally given
information. Examples of applications are (but are not limited to)
knowledge acquisition from the semantic web, aspects of hypertexts,
expert systems, document management, and discourse processing.

Submission procedure:
Extended Abstracts should be between 3 and max. 6 pages of length
(including figures, tables, and references), single-spaced Springer
LNCS
style pages. Only electronic submissions will be considered (formats:
PostScript, PDF) sent to kkuehnbe@uos.de. Based on accepted extended
abstracts authors will be asked to submit full papers (after the
conference took place) that will be published as a special issue in
"GLDV-Journal for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology".

                FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

Tilburg University will host the Seventh International Workshop on
Computational Semantics (IWCS-7), which will take place on 10-12
January 2007. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
researchers interested in any aspects of the computation, annotation,
extraction, and representation of meaning in natural language, 
in multimedia objects, and in multimodal messages.


                          TOPICS OF INTEREST

Areas of special interest for the workshop will be computational
aspects of semantic theories; theoretical aspects of the design of
language understanding systems and systems for multimodal
communication; and semantic annotation of natural language and
multimodal utterances. Papers are invited that are concerned with
topics in these and closely related areas, including, but not 
limited to, the following:

  * construction of representations of meaning in natural language
  * methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
  * modelling and using context in semantic interpretation
  * machine learning of semantic structures
  * formal and computational methods in lexical semantics

  * computing meaning in multimodal interaction
  * construction and use of underspecified semantic representations 
  * semantic concepts and ontologies
  * approaches to textual entailment
  * the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts

  * the semantic web and natural language processing
  * semantic aspects of language generation
  * the semantics-pragmatics interface in computational perspective
  * semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
  * shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning


                   ISO/SIGSEM JOINT WORKING GROUP MEETING

Immediately preceding IWCS-7, on 8-9 January 2007, a joint meeting 
will be held of the ISO TC 37/SC 4 Thematic Domain Group on Semantic 
Content, and the ACL SIGSEM Working Group on the Representation of 
Multimodal Semantic Information. This meeting will be open to (a 
limited number of) IWCS-7 participants. For more information see

                        Call For Papers
          AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTW)

                   November 30-December 1, 2006
                        Sydney, Australia
             http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2006/

               to be held in conjunction with the
                       HCSNet SummerFest
                     http://hcsnet.edu.au


Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event
will be the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

ALTW will be held in conjunction with the HCSNet SummerFest, a
multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of workshops, invited
courses and presentations around the theme of Human Communication
Science. The courses, offered at both introductory and more advanced
levels, will include topic areas aimed specifically at Language
Technology students and researchers.

The goals of the workshop are:

 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; 
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community
   and with the wider international LT community; 
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing
   research and projects; 
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
   community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally, 
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand
   and overseas. 

As with the 2005 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in
addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive
discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the
same status in the proceedings.


Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:

 * speech understanding and generation;
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and
 * discourse;
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
 * summarisation;
 * machine translation and translation aids;
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
 * natural language and multimodal systems;
 * message and narrative understanding systems;
 * evaluations of language systems;
 * computational lexicography. 

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.  


Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and
example documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve
the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles
including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems,
please contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the
workshop website. Contact the organisers (workshop@alta.asn.au) for
any questions regarding this process.


Important dates

 * Paper submission: September 1, 2006
 * Notification of acceptance: September 29, 2006
 * Camera-ready copy: October 30, 2006
 * Workshop: Nov 30--Dec 1, 2006


Workshop Co-Chairs
 * Lawrence Cavedon (National ICT Australia and RMIT University)
 * Ingrid Zukerman  (Monash University)
Workshop Local Organiser
 * Rolf Schwitter   (Macquarie University)

Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1152311559.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>


            TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES 2006
                  5th International Workshop

           Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                    http://www.tlt2006.org


Workshop motivation and aims 
----------------------------

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the
phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important
for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language
processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and
linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going
projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that
still lack them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish,
Turkish) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks
for specific purposes for languages that already have them
(English). In addition, there are projects that go beyond syntactic
analysis to include different kinds of semantic and pragmatic
annotation. We specifically encourage submissions that discuss the
relations and links between, and possibly merging of, various aspects
of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contents/pragmatic
annotation; also, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks
and/or cross-language annotation schemas, theories and applications
are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved
that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other
dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the
Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil
HPSG Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank,
etc.). Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic
theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the
necessary information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of
co-located events surrounding it (for more information see
www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol,
Bulgaria in
September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the
second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December
2005 (http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html).

Topics of interest 
------------------

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and
linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;

Subject: Special Issue of the Journal of Logic and Computation, on Natural
        Language and Knowledge Representation -- 2nd Call for Papers
Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1152311964.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>


2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

We cordially invite submissions of articles for a special issue of the
journal of logic and computation <http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/>
on natural language and knowledge representation. 


Submission deadline: July 31st, 2006.

TOPICS

We believe that the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the
Knowledge Representation (KR) communities have common goals. They are
both concerned with representing knowledge and with reasoning, since
the best test for the semantic capability of an NLP system is
performing reasoning tasks. Having these two essential common grounds,
the two communities ought to have been collaborating, to provide a
well-suited representation language that covers these
grounds. However, the two communities also have difficult-to-meet
concerns. Mainly, the semantic representation (SR) should be
expressive enough and take the information in context into account,
while the KR should be equipped with a fast reasoning process.

The main objection against using an SR or a KR is that they need
experts to be understood. Non-experts communicate (usually) via a
natural language (NL), and more or less they understand each other
while performing a lot of reasoning. An essential practical value of
representations is their attempt to be transparent. This will
particularly be useful when/if the system provides a justification for
a user or a knowledge engineer on its line of reasoning using the
underlying KR (i.e. without generating back to NL).

We all seem to believe that, compared to Natural Language, the
existing Knowledge Representation and reasoning systems are
poor. Nevertheless, for a long time, the KR community has dismissed
the idea that NL can be a KR.
That's because NL can be very ambiguous and there are syntactic and
semantic processing complexities associated with it. However,
researchers in both communities have started looking at this issue
again. Possibly, it has to do with the NLP community making some
progress in terms of processing and handling ambiguity, the KR
community realising that a lot of knowledge is already 'coded' in NL
and that one should reconsider the way they handle expressivity and
ambiguity.

For this special journal issue of logic and computation, we invite the
submission of original high quality articles.   Topics for this
special
issue include but not limited to:

+ A novel NL-like KR or building on an existing one

+ Reasoning systems that benefit from properties of NL to reason with
NL

+ Semantic representation used as a KR : compromise between
expressivity and
efficiency? 

+ More Expressive KR for NL understanding (Any compromise?)

+ Any work exploring how existing representations fall short of
addressing some problems involved in modelling, manipulating or
reasoning (whether reasoning as used to get an interpretation for a
certain utterance, exchange of utterances or what utterances follow
from other utterances) with NL documents

+ Representations that show how classical logics are not as efficient,
transparent, expressive or where a one-step application of an
inference rule require more (complex) steps in a classical environment
and vice-versa; i.e.
how classical logics are more powerful, etc. 

+ Building a reasoning test collection for natural language
understanding
systems: any kind of reasoning (deductive, abductive, etc); for a
deductive test suite see for e.g. deliverable 16 of the FraCas
project. Also, look at textual entailment challenges 1 and 2. 

+ Comparative results (on a common test suite or a common task) of
different representations or systems that reason with NL (again any
kind of reasoning). The comparison could be either for efficiency,
transparency or expressivity

+ Knowledge acquisition systems or techniques that benefit from
properties of NL to acquire knowledge already "coded" in NL

+ Automated Reasoning, Theorem Proving and KR communities views on all
this

+ Challenges in Natural Language and Reasoning

+ Where is the NLP or KR community going wrong/right in meeting the
challenges?

Spoken language translation technologies attempt to cross the language
barriers between people having different native languages who each
want
to engage in conversation by using their mother-tongue.
Spoken language translation has to deal with problems of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT).

In this workshop, we focus on the translation of spontaneous speech
which
includes ill-formed utterances due to grammatical incorrectness,
incomplete
sentences, and redundant expressions. The impact of spontaneity
aspects
on the ASR and MT systems performance as well as the robustness of
state-of-the-art MT engines towards speech recognition errors will be
investigated in detail.

=== Technical Paper

The workshop invites technical papers related to spoken language
translation.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Spontaneous speech translation
  * Domain and language portability
  * MT using comparable and non-parallel corpora
  * Phrase alignment algorithms
  * MT decoding algorithms
  * MT evaluation measures

  + Important Dates:

    September 15, 2006 -- Paper Submission Due [23:59 JST]
      October 17, 2006 -- Notification of Acceptance 
      October 27, 2006 -- Camera-ready Submission Due

=== Evaluation Campaign

The workshop invites any type of machine translation system, whereby
the translation directions are Arabic/Chinese/Italian/Japanese into
English
using various input conditions like 1-BEST or N-BEST-lists extracted
from provided recognizer outputs.
Each Participant in the evaluation campaign is requested to submit a
paper
describing the utilized MT system and to report results using the
provided test data.
Details on the evaluation campaign can be found on the workshop
homepage:

First Call For Papers
Australasian Language Technology Workshop (ALTW)
November 30-December 1, 2006 Sydney, Australia http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2006

to be held in conjunction with the HCSNet SummerFest http://hcsnet.edu.au
Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event will be the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

ALTW will be held as part of the HCSNet SummerFest, a multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of workshops, invited courses and presentations around the theme of Human Communication Science. The courses, offered at both introductory and more advanced levels, will include topic areas aimed specifically at Language Technology students and researchers.

The goals of the workshop are:

- to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;
    
- to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community and with the wider international LT community;
    
- to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;
    
- to encourage dissemination of research results;
    
- to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research and projects;
    
- to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally,
    
- to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. 

As with the 2005 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage submissions from students describing their thesis work and any preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the same status in the proceedings.
Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

    - speech understanding and generation;
    - phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
    - interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
    - linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
    - language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
    - corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
    - summarisation;
    - machine translation and translation aids;
    - natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
    - natural language and multimodal systems;
    - message and narrative understanding systems;
    - evaluations of language systems;
    - computational lexicography. 

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT applications and through multi-disciplinary research.
Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and example documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems, please contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send an early version with the typographical complexity of your final intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that this diverges from the ''blind'' submission guidelines adopted for ACL conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the workshop website. Contact the organisers (workshop@alta.asn.au) for any questions regarding this process.
Important dates

    - Paper submission: September 1, 2006
    - Notification of acceptance: September 29, 2006
    - Camera-ready copy: October 30, 2006
    - Workshop: Nov 30 - Dec 1, 2006 

Workshop Co-Chairs

    - Lawrence Cavedon (NICTA and RMIT University)
    - Ingrid Zukerman (Monash University)

Meeting Description:

Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as online chat, SMS, emails, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, wikis and web pages. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech, printed text, handwritten text contains processing noise. Text produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing spelling errors, abbreviations, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing punctuations, missing case information, pause filling words such as "um" and "uh." Such text can be seen in large amounts in contact centers, on-line chat rooms, OCRed text documents, SMS corpus etc. The theme of the IJCAI 2007 Conference is 'AI and its benefits to society.' In keeping with this theme, this workshop proposes to look at text analytics of highly noisy text that is produced in such everyday applications in society. 

IJCAI 2007 Workshop

Workshop on Analytics for Noisy Unstructured Text Data
8 January, 2007, Hyderabad, India

http://research.ihost.com/and2007
 
Call for Papers
 
Workshop Description and Objectives
Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as online chat, SMS, emails, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, wikis and web pages. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech, printed text, handwritten text contains processing noise. Text produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing spelling errors, abbreviations, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing punctuations, missing case information, pause filling words such as ''um'' and ''uh.'' Such text can be seen in large amounts in contact centers, on-line chat rooms, OCRed text documents, SMS corpus etc. The theme of the IJCAI 2007 Conference is ''AI and its benefits to society.'' In keeping with this theme, this workshop proposes to look at text analytics of highly noisy text that is produced in such everyday applications in society.
The goal of the workshop is to focus on the problems encountered in analyzing such noisy documents coming from various sources. The nature of the text warrants moving beyond traditional text analytics techniques. We hope that the workshop will allow researchers to present current research and development in addressing this challenge. We also believe that as a result of this workshop there will be sharing of real life noisy data sets and will result in their becoming available to a wider research community.
 
Topics
We welcome original research papers that identify key problems related to noisy text analytics and offer solutions. We particularly encourage contributions that look at solving real life problems in the different settings where such data is produced in huge amounts. Potential topics include (but not limited to):

- NLP techniques for handling noisy unstructured data
- Characterization of the types of noise in documents
- Genre recognition based on the type of noise
- Robust parsing
- Characterizing, modeling and accounting for historical language change
- Methods for detecting and correcting spelling and grammatical errors in noisy text
- Information Extraction and Retrieval from noisy text
- Automatic classification and clustering of imprecise documents 
- Noise-invariant document summarization techniques
- Issues in keyword search in presence of noise in unstructured data
- Machine Translation for noisy text
- Text analysis techniques for analysis and mining of call-logs, transcribed calls, web logs, chat logs, email exchanges 
- Business Intelligence(BI) applications for contact centers that deal with noisy data
- Surveys on aspects of text analytics for noisy unstructured data
 
Participation
We hope that the workshop will allow researchers working in areas related to unstructured data analytics, Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, etc., to focus on the needs of users extracting useful information from noisy text. The target audience is a mixture of academia and industry researchers working with noisy text. We believe this work is of direct relevance to domains such as call centers, the world-wide web, and government organizations that need to analyze huge amounts of noisy data.

Call Deadline: 01-Oct-2002 

Meeting Description:

The theme of this workshop is the intelligibility of closely related languages. Focus will be on the relevance of different linguistic factors. The workshop takes place at the launch of the research program Linguistic determinants of mutual intelligibility in Scandinavia, which is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). The workshop intends to bring together researchers studying intelligibility from the perspective of second language acquisition, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, phonetics and dialectometry to get an overview of the experience acquired with different methods and to exchange ideas on fruitful avenues for future research. Questions to be addressed are the following:

How can intelligibility between closely related languages be measured?

Which linguistic factors determine intelligibility? 

How can these linguistic factors be measured quantitatively? 

Background

Most individuals have to invest considerable time and effort to master a language other than their mother tongue. However, some genetically related languages are so similar in terms of grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation that speakers of one language can to a certain extent understand the other language without prior instructions. Speakers of such languages are able to communicate without a lingua franca or without one speaker using the language of the other. This type of interaction, which is referred to with terms such as 'semicommunication' (Haugen 1966) or 'receptive multilingualism' (Braunmüller and Zeevaert 2001), has many advantages, in any case on the production side. People usually find it easier to express themselves in their mother tongue than in a later acquired second or foreign language. Research into receptive multilingualism has a long tradition and different methods have been applied for measuring the degree of intelligibility. However, the study of lingui!
 stic factors that determine the level of understanding has received little attention. What, for example, is the relative contribution of consonantal differences versus vocalic differences? Are insertions of consonants more disruptive than deletions? Do lay people have clear intuition of the plausibility of various sound correspondences? What is the effect on intelligibility of prosodic differences?

Workshop format

The workshop will begin on Monday before lunch and end in the late afternoon on Tuesday. The number of papers will be limited in order to leave plenty of time for discussion. On Monday evening there will be a conference dinner.

Call Deadline: 28-Feb-2007 

Meeting Description:

The 2nd Graz Conference on Reduplication aims to discuss reduplication with a
special focus on diachrony and productivity within a typological perspective. 

Due to the developments of phonological and morphological theories, the
discussion of reduplication has attracted the attention of scholars, and the
number of publications on the topic has increased considerably. However, the
majority of these studies had approached the issue from a theory-centric point
of view, and substantial problems had been subordinated to theoretical issues.
Thus, the First Graz Conference on Reduplication, which was held in November
2002, was dedicated to discuss the issue in various aspects with a focus on
empirical evidence, and the papers were published in Studies on Reduplication
(Hurch ed., 2005). 

What still needs clarification is historical and comparative aspects of
reduplication. Moreover, we are deeply convinced that any synchronic theory on
reduplication, as on any other phenomena, is valid only if it includes or
conveys an explanation of diachronic change. Therefore, the Second Graz
Conference on Reduplication aims to further discuss reduplication with a special
focus on diachrony and productivity within a typological perspective. 

Invited speakers are: 
   Henning Andersen (University of California Los Angeles, USA)
   Hans den Besten (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
   Nick Evans (University of Melbourne, Australia)
   Larry Hyman (University of California Berkeley, USA)
   Laurie Reid (University of Hawaii, USA)

Please submit an abstract in the following format: 
1.	maximum of 3 pages 
2.	in English 
3.	with the title of the paper 
4.	anonymous 

Please email the abstract in plain text or PDF to reduplication@ling.uni-graz.at. 

In the body of email text, please include: 
1.	title of the paper 
2.	author's name 
3.	author's affiliation 
4.	email address and other contact information 

The submission deadline is February 28, 2007. Notification of acceptance will be
emailed by March 31, 2007. The length of each presentation is 40 minutes (time
for discussion included). The conference language is English.

Second CALL FOR PAPERS

We cordially invite submissions of articles for a special issue of the
journal of logic and computation <http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/>
on natural language and knowledge representation.


Submission deadline: July 31st, 2006.

TOPICS

We believe that the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the
Knowledge Representation (KR) communities have common goals. They are
both concerned with representing knowledge and with reasoning, since
the best test for the semantic capability of an NLP system is
performing reasoning tasks. Having these two essential common grounds,
the two communities ought to have been collaborating, to provide a
well-suited representation language that covers these grounds.
However, the two communities also have difficult-to-meet concerns.
Mainly, the semantic representation (SR) should be expressive enough
and take the information in context into account, while the KR should
be equipped with a fast reasoning process.

The main objection against using an SR or a KR is that they need
experts to be understood. Non-experts communicate (usually) via a
natural language (NL), and more or less they understand each other
while performing a lot of reasoning. An essential practical value of
representations is their attempt to be transparent. This will
particularly be useful when/if the system provides a justification for
a user or a knowledge engineer on its line of reasoning using the
underlying KR (i.e. without generating back to NL).

We all seem to believe that, compared to Natural Language, the
existing Knowledge Representation and reasoning systems are poor.
Nevertheless, for a long time, the KR community has dismissed the idea
that NL can be a KR.
That's because NL can be very ambiguous and there are syntactic and
semantic processing complexities associated with it. However,
researchers in both communities have started looking at this issue
again. Possibly, it has to do with the NLP community making some
progress in terms of processing and handling ambiguity, the KR
community realising that a lot of knowledge is already 'coded' in NL
and that one should reconsider the way they handle expressivity and
ambiguity.

For this special journal issue of logic and computation, we invite the
submission of original high quality articles.   Topics for this special
issue include but not limited to:

+ A novel NL-like KR or building on an existing one

+ Reasoning systems that benefit from properties of NL to reason with NL

+ Semantic representation used as a KR : compromise between expressivity
   and efficiency?

+ More Expressive KR for NL understanding (Any compromise?)

+ Any work exploring how existing representations fall short of
   addressing some problems involved in modelling, manipulating or
   reasoning (whether reasoning as used to get an interpretation for a
   certain utterance, exchange of utterances or what utterances follow
   from other utterances) with NL documents

+ Representations that show how classical logics are not as efficient,
    transparent, expressive or where a one-step application of an
    inference rule require more (complex) steps in a classical environment
    and vice-versa; i.e. how classical logics are more powerful, etc.

+ Building a reasoning test collection for natural language understanding
   systems: any kind of reasoning (deductive, abductive, etc); for a
   deductive test suite see for e.g. deliverable 16 of the FraCas
   project. Also, look at textual entailment challenges 1 and 2.

+ Comparative results (on a common test suite or a common task) of
   different representations or systems that reason with NL (again any
   kind of reasoning). The comparison could be either for efficiency,
   transparency or expressivity

+ Knowledge acquisition systems or techniques that benefit from
   properties of NL to acquire knowledge already "coded" in NL

+ Automated Reasoning, Theorem Proving and KR communities
   views on all this

+ Challenges in Natural Language and Reasoning

+ Where is the NLP or KR community going wrong/right in meeting
   the challenges?

                        Call For Papers
          AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTW)

                   November 30-December 1, 2006
                        Sydney, Australia
             http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2006/

               to be held in conjunction with the
                       HCSNet SummerFest
                     http://hcsnet.edu.au


Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event
will be the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

ALTW will be held in conjunction with the HCSNet SummerFest, a
multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of workshops, invited
courses and presentations around the theme of Human Communication
Science. The courses, offered at both introductory and more advanced
levels, will include topic areas aimed specifically at Language
Technology students and researchers.

The goals of the workshop are:

 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; 
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community
   and with the wider international LT community; 
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing
   research and projects; 
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
   community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally, 
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand
   and overseas. 

As with the 2005 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in
addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive
discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the
same status in the proceedings.


Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:

 * speech understanding and generation;
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
 * summarisation;
 * machine translation and translation aids;
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
 * natural language and multimodal systems;
 * message and narrative understanding systems;
 * evaluations of language systems;
 * computational lexicography. 

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.  


Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and
example documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve
the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles
including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems,
please contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the
workshop website. Contact the organisers (workshop@alta.asn.au) for
any questions regarding this process.

             TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES  TLT-2006
                  5th International Workshop

           Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                    http://www.tlt2006.org


Workshop motivation and aims
----------------------------

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase
level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important
for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language
processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and
linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going projects
on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack
them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a
number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific
purposes for languages that already have them (English). In addition,
there are projects that go beyond syntactic analysis to include
different kinds of semantic and pragmatic annotation. We specifically
encourage submissions that discuss the relations and links between, and
possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and contents/pragmatic annotation; also, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation
schemas, theories and applications are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved
that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other
dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the
Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG
Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank, etc.).
Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories
need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary
information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of
co-located events surrounding it (for more information see
www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol, Bulgaria
in September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the
second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December 2005
(http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html).

Topics of interest
------------------

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and
linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development;
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research;
- semantically annotated treebanks;
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks;
- tools for creation and management of treebanks;
- standards for treebanks.

Important dates
---------------

(Always midnight, UTC, ignoring DST)

Deadline for paper submission:                    September 8, 2006
Notification of acceptance:                       October 8, 2006

Submission
----------

Please note that this time, we require full papers (max. length: 12
pages A4) be submitted, describing existing research connected to the
topics of the workshop. Please note that as reviewing will be blind, the
submissions should not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead,
use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...".
Electronic submission (ps or pdf) is strongly encouraged.  Each
submission should additionally include in the accompanying email: title;
author(s); affiliation(s); and contact author's e-mail address, adn

Meeting Description:

Special Theme: Language data, corpora, and computational pragmatics

The conference is open to all other pragmatics-related topics as well  (where pragmatics is conceived broadly as a cognitive, social, and  cultural perspective on language and communication).

Panels on a wide range of topics are already being prepared.  A  tentative list (with provisional titles) includes: Arguing from large  corpora (Igor ?agar), Comparative studies of professional and  institutional activities (Per Linell), Computational pragmatics (Robin  Cooper), Contrastive pragmatics (Karin Aijmer), Conversation analysis  (John Heritage), Corpus-based multilingual approach to youngspeak  (Anna-Brita Stenström), Corpus-based pragmatics (Jens Allwood), Corpus orales del español/Spanish oral corpora (Antonio Briz), Corpus  work on argumentation (Jean Goodwin), Gender and discourse analysis  (Susan Ehrlich, Ruth Wodak), Intention, common ground, and the  egocentric speaker-hearer (István Kecskés, Jacob Mey), Language and  gender in  Japan (Miyako Inoue), Methods in pragmatics (Jan-Ola  Östman), Multimodality (Theo van Leeuwen),  Multimodal text  analysis - a corpus-based approach (Yueguo Gu), Pragmatics and  communication disorders (Elisabeth Ahlsén), Pragmatic!
 s of English  lingua franca (Juliane House, István Kecskés), Reference (Thorstein  Fretheim), Speech acts and/or dynamic semantics (Mitchell Green),  Text mining (Walter Daelemans).

Plenary lecturers will include (with tentative indication of topic area):
- Douglas Biber (Flagstaff, Arizona; pragmatics and corpora)
- Bill Hanks (Berkeley; Maya discourse genres and missionization)
- Susan HEerring (Bloomington; computer-mediated communication)
- Jan-Ola Östman (Helsinki; addressing Nordic language issues)
- Udaya Sing (Mysore; endangered languages)
- Yorick Wilks (Sheffield; computational pragmatics) 

The pragmatics of news production processes:

Convenors:
Tom Van Hout (UGent)
Lut Lams (KU Brussel)
Geert Jacobs (UGent)

By and large, media language research has traditionally applied a product view to the study of the news, focusing for example on textual analyses of print media or on transcript-based analyses of broadcast media. Conversely, while research into news making processes features prominently within communication and journalism studies, the focus here is usually on macro-level issues such as the asymmetry of information flows, rather than on language use. 

The panel we are proposing merges both interests in that it intends to examine the discursive practices that lie at the heart of the news production process, including, but not limited to, editorial norms and journalistic writing routines.  In addition, this panel also welcomes contributions addressing theoretical and/or methodological aspects of the news production process.  

We welcome other participants to join this panel with their contributions on related research and look forward to pooling our interests and insights with the aim to publish the papers presented during the panel.  Participants are free to present work in progress, completed research or position papers (20 min. presentation slots plus discussion time).  For the purpose of this panel, the term news media comprises print media (newspapers, magazines), broadcast media (television, radio) and online media (e-zines, blogs, podcasts). 

Abstracts of up to 350 words (excluding references) should be sent to tom.vanhout@ugent.be. Proposals should contain: title of proposed paper, author name and affiliation, contact details and an abstract.  The deadline for receipt of abstracts is 8 September 2006.

Meeting Description:

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting. 

Anaphoric Uses of Demonstrative Expressions

Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft(DGfS)
28 February - 2 March, 2007, Siegen

Second call for papers

In many languages, demonstrative expressions such as German  'der', 'dieser', 'jener' and English 'this' and 'that' have - in addition to their familiar deictic uses - anaphoric uses, on which they refer to objects introduced not in the utterance situation, but rather in the preceding discourse. In recent years increasing attention has been paid to these ''anaphoric demonstratives'' by formal, functional, computational and corpus linguistic researchers.

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting, comparing them with other more prototypically anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns, reflexives, definite noun phrases and logophoric expressions and cataloguing their unique properties. We expect that a focussed study of anaphoric demonstratives will shed significant light on general processes of anaphoric reference, anaphora resolution, and the cross-linguistic variation in these processes.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Syntactic properties of anaphoric demonstratives
- Relations of anaphoric demonstratives to deictic
demonstratives
- Studies of patterns of use of anaphoric demonstratives
- Contrasts with pronominal expressions
- Psycholinguistic studies of anaphoric demonstratives
- Cross-linguistic investigation of anaphoric demonstratives

Note that in addition to traditional syntactic and semantic investigation we welcome studies of usage and of processing.

Invited speakers:
Konrad Ehlich (Institut für Deutsch als Fremdsprache,Transnationale Germanistik, Universität München)

Elsi Kaiser (Department of Linguistics, University of Southern California) 

Massimo Poesio (University of Essex,University of Trento)

CALL FOR PAPERS 

9th International Columbia School Conference 
on the Interaction of 
Linguistic Form and Meaning with Human Behavior 

February 18-19, 2007 
The City College of New York
New York, New York  

Invited speakers:

Yishai Tobin (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev)
Elizabeth Traugott (Stanford University)

Special session:  
Functional linguistics in language education 

Papers are invited on any aspect of linguistic analysis in which the postulation and testing of hypotheses about meaningful signals plays a central role in explaining the distribution of linguistic forms.  A special session will be devoted to functional linguistics in language education. 

The Columbia School is a group of linguists developing the theoretical framework originally established by the late William Diver.  Language is seen as a symbolic tool whose structure is shaped both by its communicative function and by the characteristics of its users.  Grammatical analyses account for the distribution of linguistic forms as an interaction between hypothesized linguistic meanings and contextual, pragmatic and functional factors such as inference, ease of processing, and iconicity.  Phonological analyses explain the syntagmatic and paradigmatic distribution of phonological units within signals, also drawing on both communicative function and human physiological and psychological characteristics. 

Abstracts should be sent as an email attachment to nstern@ccny.cuny.edu, following these guidelines:

-In the body of the email, please include:  (1) Author name(s) and affiliation(s); (2) Title of the paper; (3) Email addresses and telephone numbers of all authors.

-The abstract, containing only the title of the paper and the text of the abstract, should be sent as an attachment (RTF or Word) format.  The abstract should be no more than 300 words, although references and/or data may be added to that limit.   

Deadlinge for receipt of abstracts: 30 September 2006 

The language of the conference is English.  Papers delivered in languages other than English will be considered.

<h4>Research area: Speech Science and Technology - Speech Technology</h4>
<p>One of the major challenges facing cochlear implant users is to understand speech in noisy environments. Over 80,000 children and adults now use cochlear implants, yet many do not achieve very good speech perception, especially in the presence of noise. My research interests are in developing models of the auditory system and developing signal processing techniques to improve the representation of sound by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve and auditory brain. My interests also include automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noise using models of the auditory system to develop improved feature extraction and speech recognition algorithms. In particular, the use of spiking neuron networks and models of the cochlear nucleus for improving the front-end of ASR systems.</p>

<h3>HCSNet Website Update</h3>
 
<p>It shouldn't make any difference to you, but Brett Powley, HCSNet
Webmaster, has just updated our content management software from Drupal
4.5 to 4.6.8 because the earlier version is no longer supported. We're
telling you this because we'd very much appreciate being alerted if you
spot anything odd about the website; this was quite a major change to the
stuff that's under the covers, so please send any observations of strange
behaviour to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcsnet.edu.au">webmaster@hcsnet.edu.au.</a></p>

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Neurolinguistics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Jul-2006 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of the workshop is to present and discuss evidence for minimal structure from current psycho- and neurolinguistic research. The workshop will take place as part of the Annual Conference of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS): http://www.dgfs.de/cgi-bin/dgfs.pl/tagung 

Second Call for Workshop: Experimental evidence for minimal structure

In the past decade, the notion of minimality has received a lot of attention in various linguistic domains. For instance, minimal structure plays a prominent role in syntactic theory where a crucial assumption is that phrase structure building processes follow principles of minimality. In analogy, recent morphological approaches have proposed that inflectional systems can be captured by a minimal set of morphosyntactic categories and features. In phonology, but also in other linguistic domains, optimality-theoretic analyses have been adopted to account for the occurrence of the optimal (unmarked) surface form.

It has further been proposed that principles of minimal structure are reflected in language processing and our workshop therefore aims at linking theoretical claims with experimental findings. We invite presentations from all linguistic domains (including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) that provide psycho- and neurolinguistic evidence for the validity of minimal structures. In this respect, we also invite presentations that address conflict resolution strategies that are required in cases where minimal structures from two (or more) domains clash and where as a result, the output has to violate the minimality priniciple of one of the subdomains.

Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion. Workshop language will be English.

Petra Burkhardt, Department of Germanic Linguistics, University of Marburg

Full Title: Journal of Universal Language 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Jul-2006 

The Final Call for the Journal of Universal Language (7:2) 

Honorarium: 
As a token of our gratitude, the contributors will be awarded the $500
honorarium (which is subject to taxation). 


The Journal of Universal Language provides a forum for discussions of
theoretical or practical research that pays close attention to language
usage, so as to provide a channel of communication between researchers of
various viewpoints. The primary aim of the journal is to encourage work
that makes people recognize the importance of the better communication tool
to those unfamiliar with the linguistic knowledge, as well as work that
makes the complex nature of language more accessible to those working
outside the linguistic framework under review. 

The journal is structured to include:
- work on artificial language, communication & culture in language usage,
typology, and universality in language;
- interdisciplinary contributions written with applied linguists in mind;
- brief notes, comments or observation concerning official languages;
- reaction/replies to recent papers;
- book reviews of important linguistic titles;
- letters to the editors.

Notes to Contributors

Format: 
1. The length of a manuscript should not exceed 40 pages.

Meeting Description:

Why Translation Studies Matters - 5th Congress of the European Society for
Translation Studies 

European Society for Translation Studies

5th EST Congress - Ljubljana 2007

Announcement and Call for Papers

Why Translation Studies matters

3rd - 5th September 2007

Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia

Translation Studies in its modern form as a distinct inter-discipline has been
in existence for several decades. We now have a number of specialized journals,
hundreds of scholars who meet often for conferences, many theses, dissertations
and academic positions. Clearly, Translation Studies matters to those who are
engaged in it, be it because they find it fascinating as a scholarly activity,
because it is part of their academic career, or for other reasons. But does it
matter to others? Does it, for example, add value to practitioners of
translation, by teaching them something useful and allowing them to enhance
their translation skills, or perhaps by enhancing their status in society? Does
it contribute to translator training by offering useful training methods,
assessment criteria or other elements? Does it matter to other academic
communities by contributing new knowledge and new methods from the realm of
translation? Does it matter to society at large, for instance by showing what
impact translation-related phenomena have had on various communities? Are some
effects of Translation Studies still to come? Which, how and when?

Contributions could address these important questions from many angles, for
example by discussing the relations between Translation Studies and the
practice of translation and/or between Translation Studies and translator
training, by performing sociological analysis of the groups involved, by
examining the relationship between Translation Studies and immigration policies,
or the links between Translation Studies and new forms of electronic literacy.
In addition, questions can be raised about the 'interdisciplinary' nature of
Translation Studies and its shifting and often problematic relationship with
neighbouring fields. 

Sessions and Pre-congress workshops:

The congress programme is scheduled to start on the morning of 3rd September and
end by lunch time on 5th September. It will include plenary sessions, panels,
parallel sessions and posters. 

Pre-congress workshops will take place on 2nd September - two in the morning and
two in the afternoon. They require a minimum of 20 participants. The provisional
issues and moderators are: 

Critical reading for learning and self-improvement (Moderator: Daniel Gile) 

Democratization of knowledge through Specialized Translation (Moderators:
Susanne Göpferich and Peter Kastberg)  

The challenge of using a plurality of methods in empirical translation research
(Moderator: Gyde Hansen)

Terminological issues in TS (Moderator: Gerhard Budin)

(Estimated workshop fee: Euros 70)

Paper proposals:

Abstracts of minimum 500 words with five keywords for 20 min. papers and for
posters should be submitted online via this website: www.est2007.si  

Panel proposals should be submitted by the moderator as a single abstract with
the list of panellists (names and affiliation). Panels, made up of 4-5
panellists, should be structured around a precise topic and consist of 90 min.
debates on a pre-determined set of questions formulated by the moderator. 

The Congress languages will be English, French, German and Spanish.
Contributions may be given, and abstracts should be submitted, in any of these
languages. Contributions in other languages than English should be announced
with an abstract and a title in the relevant language. The title should also be
translated into English for the benefit of colleagues who do not understand it.
As there will be no interpreting into English, presentations given in the other
languages may have a limited number of listeners. 

Key Dates: 

The deadline for submission of abstracts and panel proposals is 1st November 2006. 

The scientific committee will return its decision around 15th March 2007. 

Scientific committee:

Gyde Hansen (chair, Denmark), Birgitta Englund Dimitrova (Sweden), Dirk

Natasa Hirci, Mojca Schlamberger Brezar, Martina Ozbot (Faculty of Arts,
University of Ljubljana).

Publication:

A selection of contributions will be published as a volume of proceedings. 

Further information: 

A second circular including further information will be issued in March 2007.

A third circular including the congress programme will be sent shortly before
the congress dates.

Meeting Description:

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general. This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these areas. 

TREEBANKS AND LINGUISTIC THEORIES  TLT-2006
                  5th International Workshop

   Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                     http://www.tlt2006.org


Workshop motivation and aims: 

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for languages that already have them (English). In addition, there are projects that go beyond syntactic analysis to include different kinds of semantic and  pragmatic annotation. We specifically encourage submissions that discuss the relations and links between, and possibly merging of, va!
 rious aspects of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contents/pragmatic annotation; also, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation schemas, theories and applications are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank, etc.). Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of co-located events surrounding it (for more information see www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT  workshop was held in Sozopol, Bulgaria in September 2002; see  http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003 (http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and 
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December 2005 (http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html). 

Topics of interest: 

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks; 
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development; 
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research; 
- semantically annotated treebanks; 
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks; 
- tools for creation and management of treebanks; 
- standards for treebanks.  

Important dates: 

(Always midnight, UTC, ignoring DST)

Deadline for paper submission:                                 September 8, 2006
Notification of acceptance:                                         October 8, 2006
Final version of paper for workshop proceedings:  October 29, 2006
Workshop:                                                                     December 1-2, 2006

Submission:

Please note that this time, we require full papers (max. length: 12 pages A4) be submitted, describing existing research connected to the topics of the workshop. Please note that as reviewing will be blind, the submissions should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'', should be
avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...''. Electronic submission (ps or pdf) is strongly encouraged.  Each submission should additionally include in the accompanying email: title; author(s); affiliation(s); and contact author's e-mail address, and their postal address.

Submissions should be sent to submit@tlt2006.org (or directly to tlt06@ufal.mff.cuni.cz) clearly indicating in the subject line ''TLT06 submission''.

The presentation at the workshop will be 25 minutes long (20 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion). The final version of the accepted papers may not exceed 12 A4 pages (please take into consideration that the final proceeding format will be A5, i.e. final camera-ready papers will be reduced in size by a factor of 0,71).

Subject: Survey Participants Needed 
 


I am conducting a survey on women's surnames and on the use of courtesy
titles such as Miss, Mrs., and Ms.  This survey follows from my two
previous surveys, conducted 10 and 20 years ago, and the results will form
part of a retrospective of patterns of women's naming over the past 40 years.

Who can participate?  Males and females from 16 to 116 years of age.  The
more people who answer the better.  I welcome responses from fellow
academics, but I also particularly urge you to circulate this call to your
friends, neighbours, colleagues, and relatives, and to post it on any blogs
or website you may think appropriate.

Please complete the survey at the link below.

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=817532183164

Since many people do not have internet access and/or prefer to answer
surveys on paper, I would ask for volunteers to circulate paper copies to
as many individuals as possible.  If you are willing to circulate one or
more paper copies of the survey, or if you wish any further information
about this study, please contact me at the email address below.

Meeting Description:

Workshop on Negation and Polarity
University of Tuebingen, Germany
March 8-10, 2007 

Call:

The study of negation and polarity phenomena occupied a central position in syntactic, semantic and pragmatic research. New insights have been obtained regarding the syntax of sentential negation, the nature of negative concord, the licensing of (negative) polarity items, and the semantics and pragmatics of negative and positive polarity items.

To discuss recent developments of this quickly expanding research area, scholars working on negation and polarity are invited to share their results in a 3-day workshop and discuss the current state of affairs in this field. This meeting is to be held at the University of Tübingen, Germany from March 8-10. 

We welcome submission of 2-5 page abstracts (anonymous, PDF-format, 12pt font, one column, references and examples included) on any topic that relates to negation and polarity, for instance:

- the syntax of negative markers
- negative concord
- the interaction between negation and other functional categories (such as tense and modality)
- the interaction between negation and information structure
- the licensing of negative and positive polarity items
- the distribution and classification of polarity items
- the semantics of negative indefinites
- polarity and free-choice items

We welcome not only theoretical contributions, but also papers concerning any kind of linguistic evidence regarding negation and polarity.

There are 15 slots of 45 minutes for selected talks. We will also hold a round table discussion at the end of each day. The workshop will also feature three invited speakers:

- Theresa Biberauer (Cambridge)
- Cleo Condoravdi (PARC/Stanford)
- Jack Hoeksema (Groningen)

The deadline for abstract submission is November 15. Notification will follow early January.

Organisers: Doris Penka, Frank Richter, Jan-Philipp Söhn, Arnim von Stechow, Hedde Zeijlstra

Linguistic Field(s): Lexicography; Linguistic Theories; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 08-Sep-2006 

Meeting Description:

The workshop is held as a section of the annual meeting of the DGfS (German
Linguistic Society). 

Workshop abstract:

Polysemy poses a challenge for theories on the representation of lexical meaning
because it apparently involves conflicting requirements: on the one hand, we are
dealing with separable semantic variants of a word; on the other hand, the
variants have to be represented as exhibiting systematic connections. In this
way, the phenomenon of polysemy not only straddles the divide between ambiguity
vs. unified word meanings, but also the divide between lexical idiosyncrasy vs.
rule-governed aspects of language  for the term polysemy may be used for cases
with fully productive links between variants, as well as for cases that merely
constitute recurrent patterns whose occurrence is not predictable. 

While undoubtedly polysemy necessitates some amount of lexical listing (and in
this way would seem to discourage large-scale theorising), it is an important
question how models of meaning representation can be designed so as to handle
the connectedness of distinct senses. In this workshop, we will discuss
approaches for dealing with this problem especially by focusing on ways of
providing more fine-grained representations than are usually needed in lexical
semantics. Possible topics, therefore, include (but are not limited to):

- the relationship between lexical representations and representations of
conceptual structure
- models for representing unifying features of polysemic complexes at a
conceptual level, e.g. via conditions on similarity relations.
- methods for determining whether different readings have to constitute lexical
variants or not (e.g. by investigating how pragmatic inferences may supplement
information in lexical representations).
- integration of 'cognitive' and 'formal' approaches to the representation of
word meaning, 
- integration of methods from the cognitive sciences into research on polysemy.
- putting existing semantic and conceptual representation formats to the test
with new (especially cross-linguistic) data.

Invited speakers:

Johannes Dölling (Universität Leipzig)
Liina Pylkkänen (New York University)
Joost Zwarts (Universiteit Utrecht) 

Contributions can take two forms: comprehensive papers for a 60-minute slot, or
short papers for a 30-minute slot (always including discussion). Please indicate
the type of contribution in your submission.

You may submit a detailed abstract of roughly 2 pages. However, submission of
complete short papers is also welcome.

Please send your submission as an e-mail attachment in .pdf or .doc format to 
wilhelm.geuder@uni-konstanz.de.

Languages of the workshop will be English and German (for presentations in
German, handouts / slides should be provided in English).

                         Call For Papers
          AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTW)

                   November 30-December 1, 2006
                        Sydney, Australia
             http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2006/

               to be held in conjunction with the
                       HCSNet SummerFest
                     http://hcsnet.edu.au


Overview

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by
the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA). This event
will be the fourth annual installment of the workshop in its
most-recent incarnation, and the continuation of an annual workshop
series that has existed under various guises since the early 90s.

ALTW will be held in conjunction with the HCSNet SummerFest, a
multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of workshops, invited
courses and presentations around the theme of Human Communication
Science. The courses, offered at both introductory and more advanced
levels, will include topic areas aimed specifically at Language
Technology students and researchers.

The goals of the workshop are:

 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT) community
   in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions; 
 * to encourage interactions and collaboration within this community
   and with the wider international LT community; 
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial researchers;
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing
   research and projects; 
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
   community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally, 
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand
   and overseas. 

As with the 2005 Workshop, there will be poster presentations in
addition to the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive
discussion of research-in-progress. In this vein, we encourage
submissions from students describing their thesis work and any
preliminary results. Note that both publication types will have the
same status in the proceedings.


Topics

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished
research on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but
not limited to:

 * speech understanding and generation;
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;
 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
 * summarisation;
 * machine translation and translation aids;
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
 * natural language and multimodal systems;
 * message and narrative understanding systems;
 * evaluations of language systems;
 * computational lexicography. 

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.  


Submission Format

Submissions should follow the two-column format of the ACL proceedings
and should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We
strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word
Style files tailored for this year's conference. The style files and
example documents are available from the workshop website. We reserve
the right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles
including font and page size restrictions.

The preferred submission format is PDF. If this introduces problems,
please contact the organisers beforehand.

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be
rejected without being reviewed. Therefore you are encouraged to send
an early version with the typographical complexity of your final
intended version so that we can check it is printable. All papers
should include the full authors' names and affiliations. (Note that
this diverges from the "blind" submission guidelines adopted for ACL
conferences.)

Detailed directions for submission will be made available at the
workshop website. Contact the organisers (workshop@alta.asn.au) for
any questions regarding this process.


Important dates

 * Paper submission: September 1, 2006
 * Notification of acceptance: September 29, 2006
 * Camera-ready copy: October 30, 2006
 * Workshop: Nov 30--Dec 1, 2006


Workshop Co-Chairs
 * Lawrence Cavedon (National ICT Australia and RMIT University)
 * Ingrid Zukerman  (Monash University)
Workshop Local Organiser
 * Rolf Schwitter   (Macquarie University)

CALL FOR PAPERS

We cordially invite submissions of articles for a special issue of the =
journal of logic and computation <http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/> on =
natural language and knowledge representation.


Submission deadline: July 31st, 2006.

TOPICS

We believe that the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Knowledge =
Representation (KR) communities have common goals. They are both =
concerned with representing knowledge and with reasoning, since the best =
test for the semantic capability of an NLP system is performing =
reasoning tasks. Having these two essential common grounds, the two =
communities ought to have been collaborating, to provide a well-suited =
representation language that covers these grounds. However, the two =
communities also have difficult-to-meet concerns.
Mainly, the semantic representation (SR) should be expressive enough and =
take the information in context into account, while the KR should be =
equipped with a fast reasoning process.

The main objection against using an SR or a KR is that they need experts =
to be understood. Non-experts communicate (usually) via a natural =
language (NL), and more or less they understand each other while =
performing a lot of reasoning. An essential practical value of =
representations is their attempt to be transparent. This will =
particularly be useful when/if the system provides a justification for a =
user or a knowledge engineer on its line of reasoning using the =
underlying KR (i.e. without generating back to NL).

We all seem to believe that, compared to Natural Language, the existing =
Knowledge Representation and reasoning systems are poor. Nevertheless, =
for a long time, the KR community has dismissed the idea that NL can be =
a KR. That's because NL can be very ambiguous and there are syntactic =
and semantic processing complexities associated with it. However, =
researchers in both communities have started looking at this issue =
again. Possibly, it has to do with the NLP community making some =
progress in terms of processing and handling ambiguity, the KR community =
realising that a lot of knowledge is already 'coded' in NL and that one =
should reconsider the way they handle expressivity and ambiguity.

For this special journal issue of logic and computation, we invite the
submission of original high quality articles. Topics for this special
issue include but not limited to:

+ A novel NL-like KR or building on an existing one

+ Reasoning systems that benefit from properties of NL to reason with NL

+ Semantic representation used as a KR : compromise between expressivity =
and efficiency?

+ More Expressive KR for NL understanding (Any compromise?)

+ Any work exploring how existing representations fall short of =
addressing some problems involved in modelling, manipulating or =
reasoning (whether reasoning as used to get an interpretation for a =
certain utterance, exchange of utterances or what utterances follow=20
from other utterances) with NL documents

+ Representations that show how classical logics are not as efficient,
transparent, expressive or where a one-step application of an inference =
rule require more (complex) steps in a classical environment and =
vice-versa; i.e.
how classical logics are more powerful, etc.

+ Building a reasoning test collection for natural language =
understanding
systems: any kind of reasoning (deductive, abductive, etc); for a =
deductive test suite see for e.g. deliverable 16 of the FraCas project. =
Also, look at textual entailment challenges 1 and 2.

+ Comparative results (on a common test suite or a common task) of =
different representations or systems that reason with NL (again any kind =
of reasoning). The comparison could be either for efficiency, =
transparency or expressivity

+ Knowledge acquisition systems or techniques that benefit from =
properties of NL to acquire knowledge already "coded" in NL

+ Automated Reasoning, Theorem Proving and KR communities views on all =
this

+ Challenges in Natural Language and Reasoning

+ Where is the NLP or KR community going wrong/right in meeting the

3. SUBMISSION INFORMATION

---------------
1. THE SPECIAL ISSUE

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of
computational research on prepositions. Due to their importance
in computational tasks prepositions, as well as prepositional
phrases and markers of various sorts, have received a considerable
amount of attention and occupied a central position in research
in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Language Technology
(LT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing
(NLP), as well as Computational Psycholinguistics (CP).
Researchers from these backgrounds and CL-related disciplines
have looked at the role of prepositions in shallow and deep
language processing.

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP tasks,
very little progress has been made in systematically describing preposition
semantics. Notably, the only account of the lexical semantics of preposition=
s
in resources such as WordNet, FrameNet and PropBank is indirect, in that the=
y
feature in significant numbers within multiword expressions or as frame
elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated into such resources as
first-order entities, a large number of issues must be resolved such as how =
to
taxonomically deconstruct the spatial semantics of prepositions, how to
delineate preposition senses, and how to tease apart preposition and verb
semantics in phrasal verbs. Our expectation is that such questions will be
guided by careful analysis of what semantic distinctions and representationa=
l
granularity are required in a range of applications, which will in turn be
guided by such research as the representation of prepositions within
implemented grammars, crosslingual preposition semantics, machine perception
and visualisation of preposition semantics, and computational models of the
human processing of prepositions.

---------------
2. TOPICS OF INTEREST

For the proposed special issue we specifically invite submissions that bring=
 a
theoretical basis to research on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP
tasks of the sort described above. In particular, we focus on the syntactic
and semantic treatment of productive and collocational uses of prepositional
phrases and markers in resources such as WordNet and FrameNet, and the
utilization of such resources in NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation,
IE/IR and QA.

* Extraction of Prepositions:

   There has been considerable research into extraction of prepositions and
   related constructions (e.g. phrasal verbs). Papers which describe the
   extraction of these constructions, including their subcategorisation fram=
es
   and alternation patterns, as are necessary for the semi-automatic extensi=
on
   of lexical resources are particularly welcome.


* Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources:

   We encourage papers describing the challenges of providing adequate
   representation of prepositions and related constructions such as would be
   generally applicable in NLP applications.


* Prepositions in Applications:

   We invite papers that discuss the role of prepositions in NLP tasks,
   focusing specifically on what insights various applications offer for
   lexical resource building, what particular needs different application ar=
eas
   have (e.g. what an ideal prepositional lexical resource would be like),
   necessary extensions to existing resources, and how prepositional lexical
   resources of various types could enhance performance over a given task li=
ke
   MT, IR, QA and multi-modal systems.

Workshop on Presupposition Accommodation: Poster Session

At: The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio USA
Workshop dates:  October 13 - 15, 2006
website:  http://www.pragmatics.osu.edu

Deadline for Poster submissions:  Submit an abstract by July 31, 2006.
Acceptance will be notified by August 21, 2006.

Workshop
========

Presupposition accommodation is at the intersection of central issues in 
semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and philosophy
of language.  When an utterance presupposes information which the addressee
doesn't already know (e.g. "I'm on my way to my daughter's graduation"
presupposes that the speaker has a daughter), the addressee may sometimes
cooperatively accommodate that information, behaving as though he already knew
it to be true, and go on to respond to the assertion ("Congratulations!").
Accommodation has broad implications for the theory of linguistic interpretation
because it involves many of the same processes and constraints as in the
recognition of contextual effects generally.  In addition to its ramifications
for theories of meaning in linguistics and for philosophical discussions of the
nature of meaning, presupposition accommodation bears on psycholinguistic
theories of human linguistic competence, illustrating the interaction between
linguistic and non-linguistic (general cognitive) processes.  And an
appreciation of how it functions is important for the creation of software that
aims to systematically interpret or produce language in context.

With support from the Ohio State University Colleges of the Arts and Humanities
and the National Science Foundation, we are offering a workshop on

---------------
1. THE SPECIAL ISSUE

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of
computational research on prepositions. Due to their importance
in computational tasks prepositions, as well as prepositional
phrases and markers of various sorts, have received a considerable
amount of attention and occupied a central position in research
in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Language Technology
(LT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing
(NLP), as well as Computational Psycholinguistics (CP).
Researchers from these backgrounds and CL-related disciplines
have looked at the role of prepositions in shallow and deep
language processing.

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP tasks,
very little progress has been made in systematically describing preposition
semantics. Notably, the only account of the lexical semantics of prepositions
in resources such as WordNet, FrameNet and PropBank is indirect, in that they
feature in significant numbers within multiword expressions or as frame
elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated into such resources as
first-order entities, a large number of issues must be resolved such as how to
taxonomically deconstruct the spatial semantics of prepositions, how to
delineate preposition senses, and how to tease apart preposition and verb
semantics in phrasal verbs. Our expectation is that such questions will be
guided by careful analysis of what semantic distinctions and representational
granularity are required in a range of applications, which will in turn be
guided by such research as the representation of prepositions within
implemented grammars, crosslingual preposition semantics, machine perception
and visualisation of preposition semantics, and computational models of the
human processing of prepositions.

---------------
2. TOPICS OF INTEREST

For the proposed special issue we specifically invite submissions that bring a
theoretical basis to research on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP
tasks of the sort described above. In particular, we focus on the syntactic
and semantic treatment of productive and collocational uses of prepositional
phrases and markers in resources such as WordNet and FrameNet, and the
utilization of such resources in NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation,
IE/IR and QA.

* Extraction of Prepositions:

   There has been considerable research into extraction of prepositions and
   related constructions (e.g. phrasal verbs). Papers which describe the
   extraction of these constructions, including their subcategorisation frames
   and alternation patterns, as are necessary for the semi-automatic extension
   of lexical resources are particularly welcome.


* Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources:

   We encourage papers describing the challenges of providing adequate
   representation of prepositions and related constructions such as would be
   generally applicable in NLP applications.


* Prepositions in Applications:

   We invite papers that discuss the role of prepositions in NLP tasks,
   focusing specifically on what insights various applications offer for
   lexical resource building, what particular needs different application areas
   have (e.g. what an ideal prepositional lexical resource would be like),
   necessary extensions to existing resources, and how prepositional lexical
   resources of various types could enhance performance over a given task like
   MT, IR, QA and multi-modal systems.

<img src="http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/files2/pictures/picture-585.jpg" />
<h4>Research area: Psychology - Psycholinguistics</h4>
<p>My own language learning experiences - in particular, struggling to keep multiple languages separate! - inspired my doctoral research on control in bilingual speech production. The research also examined mechanisms of cognitive control more generally, using methodologies such as task switching. Currently I am working with Professor Sally Andrews on a number of projects relating to reading. Key interests are how readers integrate the information from a series of words to generate a conceptual structure for the whole sentence; the locus of repetition blindness and its relationship to conceptual short-term memory; and identifying the defining characteristics of lexical expertise and how they support effective reading comprehension. We also conduct studies of individual word recognition (e.g., Andrews,  Woollams, & Bond, 2005. Spelling-sound typicality only affects words with digraphs: Further qualifications to the generality of the regularity effect on word naming. Journal o!
 f Memory and Language, 53, 567-593).</p>

<h3>Post-doctoral Fellowship Position in the Center for Technology and Social
Behavior, Northwestern University</h3>

<p>The new Center for Technology and Social Behavior at
Northwestern University, under the direction of Professor Justine
Cassell, invites applications for a one-year (renewable) post-doctoral fellowship position, commencing in
September 2006.  The successful candidate will come from one, or the
intersection of several, of the fields of Computational
Linguistics (in particular natural language generation), Cognitive
Science, Computer Graphics, HCI, Artificial Intelligence and  Learning
Science.</p>

<p>Research in the center involves theory development, behavioral studies,
and technology design, meaning that all researchers are expected to (1)
study human-human behavior, (2) implement systems, (3) study
human-computer interaction, (4) write.  To this end, prior experience
with conducting empirical research is strongly desired, while strong
computational skills (C/C++/Java/Perl) are required.  Machine learning experience is a plus.  Salary commensurate with experience.</p>

<p>For more information about the research of the relevant faculty members,
see <a href="http://www.soc.northwestern.edu/justine">www.soc.northwestern.edu/justine</a>  and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dgergle/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dgergle/</a>.
To apply, please send a CV and the names of 3 referees to Justine
Cassell <a href="mailto:justine@northwestern.edu">justine@northwestern.edu</a></p>
