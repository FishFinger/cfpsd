Linguistic Field(s): Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 14-Dec-2009 

Meeting Description:

Stated broadly, the Lavender Languages and Linguistics Conference examines
language use in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer life.
Linguistic inquiry is broadly defined here, to include studies of:
pronunciation, vocabulary and meaning, conversational structures and styles,
life stories and other narratives, fiction, and poetry, the "language" of
scientific and historic documents and print media, meanings encoded in spatial
practices, sign language, non-verbal communication, and communication through
photography, cinema and other visual arts. While presentations usually focus on
local linguistic practices, they do not neglect the global spread of North
Atlantic 'gayspeak' and the growing tensions between (homo)sexuality and
citizenship worldwide, and they acknowledge the need to position site-specific
practices within broader contexts of social, cultural and linguistic theory. 

Call for Papers

The language of conference presentation is English, but the languages explored
in presentations have been as varied as Navajo and Japanese, Ukrainian and
Hindi, Nicaraguan vernacular Spanish or Kechuan. 

Presentations from established scholars and from those just beginning to explore
lavender language issues are welcomed. 

Presentation formats may include individual papers, reports on
research-in-progress, round-table discussions, topic-centered workshops, or a
format more appropriate to your own work. Please indicate your presentation
format in your proposal, and please make sure that your proposal identifies the
language-related concerns that the presentation intends to address.

Please send a 250 word proposal to:
Program Committee,
Lav Lgs XVII
c/o Department of Anthropology
American University
4400 Massachusetts Ave NW
Washington DC 20016 	
E-mail: wlm@american.edu

(For general info, please call AU Anthropology Dept at 202-885-1830)

Deadline for submissions is December 14, 2009. A preliminary agenda will be
posted to the conference web site in late December.
