Following up on the higly successful events at Stanford (1984) and
Montreal (1998), the International Committee on Computational
Linguistics and the Association for Computational Linguistics will be
hosting their third joint conference in Sydney, July 17th-21st,
2006. 

Papers are invited on substantial, original, and unpublished research
on all aspects of computational linguistics, including, but not
limited to: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon;
phonetics, phonology and morphology; lexical semantics and ontologies;
word segmentation, tagging and chunking; parsing, generation and
summarization; language modeling, spoken language recognition and
understanding; linguistic, psychological and mathematical models of
language; information retrieval, question answering, information
extraction and text mining; machine learning for natural language;
corpus-based modeling of language, discourse and dialogue;
multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids;
multi-modal and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
applications, tools and language resources such as annotated
corpora; and system evaluation.

We are particularly interested in bridging the gap to other related
communities, and so we especially welcome papers on speech technology
and information retrieval.  Also, for this first joint COLING/ACL
conference to be held in Asia we especially encourage papers that
address issues specific to the processing of Asian languages.

Requirements

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation results should be included. Submissions will be judged on
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

Submissions presented at the joint COLING/ACL conference should mostly
contain new material that has not been, and will not be, presented at
any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.  Papers that
are being submitted in parallel to other conferences or workshops must
indicate this on the title page, as must papers that contain
significant overlap with previously published work.

Reviewing

Reviewing will be managed by an international Conference Program
Committee consisting of Area Chairs and associated Program Committee
Members. The names of the Area Chairs will be communicated within the
next few weeks. The reviewing process will be blind and each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members.

Categories of Papers

Papers can be submitted to one of two categories: the REGULAR PAPER
category or the POSTER category. Authors must designate one of these
categories at submission time. Although both categories of submmission
will be the same maximum length, regular papers will be presented a
single time to a potentially large audience during one of the parallel
paper sessions at the conference, and poster presentations will be
repeated several times before small groups of people (using paper
posters or demos) at one of the conference poster sessions. Regular
papers are most appropriate for presenting substantial research
results, while posters are more appropriate for presenting an ongoing
research effort. Regular papers and poster papers will appear in
separate volumes of the proceedings.

Submission Information

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document
template that will be made available on the conference Web site. A
description of the required format will be made available to those who
are unable to make direct use of these style files. We reserve the
right to reject submissions that do not conform to these styles,
including font size restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'',
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ''Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...''. Papers that do not conform to these
requirements will be rejected without review.

Submission will be electronic.  The only accepted format for submitted
papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than
February 28, 2006. Papers submitted after that time will not be
reviewed. For details of the submission procedure, please consult the
submission webpage reachable via the conference website at
www.coling2006.org.

Questions regarding the submission procedure should be directed to the
Program Co-Chairs (cardie@cs.cornell.edu, isabellep@nrc.ca).

Deadlines

Paper submission deadline:      February 28, 2006
Notification of acceptance:     April 28, 2006 
Camera ready papers due:        May 19, 2006 
COLING/ACL 2006 Conference:     July 17-21, 2006

Mentoring Service

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from
regions of the world where English is not the language of scientific
exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to read the
scientific literature in English, have little or no experience in
writing papers in English for conferences such as the COLING and ACL
meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential
mentors will be identified by Richard Power, who has agreed to
organize this service for COLING/ACL 2006. 

Richard Power

University of Brighton
Watts Building
Lewes Road
Brighton BN24GJ
UK
+44 1273 642904 
+44 1273 642908 (fax)
Email: Richard.Power@itri.brighton.ac.uk

To take advantage of this service, send the paper electronically to
the above email address, using pdf, ps or doc format. Alternatively,
hard copy can be sent to the postal address. The paper should arrive
before January 28, 2006. An appropriate mentor will be assigned to
your paper and the mentor will get back to you by February 21, 2006,
at least seven days before the deadline for the submission to
COLING/ACL 2006.  Please note that this service is for the benefit of
the authors as described above. It is not a general mentoring service
for authors to improve their papers.

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send
a message to Richard Power.

Meeting Description:

The central objective of this workshop is to bring together linguists who are engaged in research on the formal study of the Aboriginal languages of the Americas so that they may exchange ideas across theories, language families, generations of scholars, and importantly, across the academic and non-academic communities who are involved in language maintenance and revitalization. 

WSCLA 11: WORKSHOP ON THE STRUCTURE AND CONSTITUENCY OF THE LANGUAGES OF THE AMERICAS

March 31st - April 2nd 2006

University of British Columbia                               
Vancouver, Canada

Special Theme: QUANTIZATION:FORM AND FUNCTION

Invited speakers
Donna Gerdts (SFU)
Andrea Willhelm (UAlberta)

Invited student speakers

Marianne Milligan (U Wisconsin, Madison)

Call for Papers
Quantization: form and function

Languages of the Americas differ in non-trivial ways from the Indo-European languages in the expression of ''quantization''. This includes (but is not limited to) forms that measure: quantity, size,  frequency, duration, and degree. In many Indo-European languages, such expressions are often category-specific in the following way:

quantity 		-- plural/singular on count NOUNS
size		-- diminuitive marking on NOUNS
frequenczy 	--  adverbs of frequency modifying VERBS
duration 		--  aspect marking on VERBS
degree 		--  comparative/superlative marking or degree modifiers on ADJECTIVES

It is striking that, in many of the languages of the Americas quantizing expressions of the above sort are not always associated with the same categories as their notional equivalents in Indo-European langauges (e.g., number is often marked on verbs in the form of ''pluractional'' marking). This raises important question that go beyond the immediate scope of ''quantization'' per se. 

-Does the difference in the mapping from function to category reflect a difference in the form and function of the quantizing expressions themselves? 
-Does this difference reflect a difference in the categories that are quantized? (Are NOUNS, VERBS, and ADJECTIVES  universal or not? 
-Does this difference correlate with the difference between ''inflectional'' and ''polysynthetic'' languages?  

Another striking feature of quantizing expressions is that they are often formed by means of reduplicative processes or other non-concatenative morphology. This again raises a number of interesting questions:

-What is the status of non-concatenative processes in current theories of phonology?
-Are there formal correlates of the quantization function?
-Is there an inherent correlation between the form (reduplication) and its function?

We invite papers dealing with the forms and functions of quantizing expressins in analysis of languages of the Americas, including all aspects of the grammar: phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and language acquisition and language use.  
	
Papers in the core areas of formal linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) within any formal theoretical framework will also be considered. 
	
The special sessions on this year's theme (''quantization'') will be commented on by selected commentators. 

Following the tradition of this workshop, we dedicate the final day to a linking between our research and important work being done on language preservation and revitalization (details will be announced later).

Meeting Description:

This conference highlights new trends in theoretical and applied research in the area of normal and disordered speech motor control. 

Following a well-established Nijmegen tradition, the fifth edition of the International Conference on Speech Motor Control will be held in 2006 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. This conference, like the ones before, will highlight new trends and state-of-the-art approaches in theoretical and applied research in the area of normal and disordered speech motor control. One of the major developments we have witnessed is a stronger interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of speech motor research. Integration seems to be the key-concept. 

The program will be organized around the following main topics:

-Brain imaging, genetic and neurobiological research 

-Modelling of speech motor control 

-Development of speech motor control

-Disorders of speech motor control

-Methodology and technical innovations

The conference is organized by the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in close collaboration with international partners. For further details, the program, abstract submission and registration see our website: http://www.slp-nijmegen.nl/smc2006/

Meeting Description:

We cordially invite to participate in the 41st Linguistic Colloquium. The conference theme is "The Order of Standard and the Differentiation of Discourses". With this theme the conference seeks to explore new insights into language development and the conditions of speech. But we also follow in the annual colloquium's tradition of not limiting the theme too narrowly, as we wish to include a broad range of research interests among European linguists. 

Mannheim, August 16, 2005

Dear Colleagues,

We cordially invite you to participate in the 41st Linguistic Colloquium, which will take place from Wednesday, September 6 till Friday, September 8, 2006, at the University of Mannheim. 

The conference theme is ''The Order of Standard and the Differentiation of Discourses'' 

With this theme the conference seeks to explore new insights into language development and the conditions of speech. But we also follow in the annual colloquium's tradition of not limiting the theme too narrowly, as we wish to include a broad range of research interests among European linguists. 

Presenters of the plenum lectures will be: Ludwig Jäger (Aachen, Köln) on Language und Medial Differentiation, Dmitrij Dobrovolskij (Moskau) on Cultural Semiotics and Cognition with the Example of Idioms, Christian Kohlroß (Mannheim) on ?the Multitude of Languages' and ?the Unity of Metaphor', Eva Neuland (Wuppertal) on Styles of Youth Language, Gunnar Otte (Leipzig) on Social Differentiation, Lifestyle and Language.

Contributions from all linguistic fields (phonology, grammar, lexicology, se-mantics, text types, language technologies, etc.) are welcome. The conference will be divided up into the following sections:

-media differentiation
-cognitive differentiation / differentiation of knowledge
-aesthetic-stylistic / group bound differentiation and questions of gender
-speech differentiation in the framework of actions and situations
-ethnographic differentiation
-regional differentiation
-?

Prospective lectures need not have explicit connection to the conference theme, but, if possible, you should indicate which of the above section topics your lecture fits under. The lectures may be presented in English, French or German and must not exceed 20 minutes in order to allow time for discussion.

Proposals for lectures can be emailed or sent to one of the addresses noted above. Proposals are due on February 28, 2006 and should include a short abstract. If the number of proposed contributions is too high for the conference's projected time frame, the committee will choose the lectures on basis of the abstracts. The abstracts of the accepted lectures will be available online by the end of April 2006. The contributions will, as usual, be published after the colloquium.

Suggestions for sections /panels (including your willingness to moderate them) are very welcome and might differ from the ones mentioned above. The deadline for your proposal is December 1st, 2005.

Independent of the proposals you must register for the conference by May 05, 2006. The conference fee is 75 euros. Late registration costs 95 euros. The registration fee includes conference materials and catering during the breaks between the lectures. Transportation, accommodation, lunch, dinner and leisure time activities are not included.
A registration form as well as additional details concerning the 41st Linguistic Colloquium will soon be available online at http://www.phil.uni-mannheim.de/lingkoll06

Best regards,
Beate Henn-Memmesheimer

Meeting Description:

ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL LEXICAL FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR CONFERENCE

DATES 10 - 13 July 2006
Konstanz, Germany
Conference website: http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/conferences/lfg06/ 

First Call for Papers: LFG 2006

The 11th International Lexical Functional Grammar Conference will be hosted by the University of Konstanz, Germany from July 10th to 13th 2006.  Pre-conference activities are planned for July 8th and 9th.
LFG 2006 welcomes work within the formal architecture of Lexical-Functional Grammar as well as typological, formal, and computational work within the 'spirit of LFG' as a lexicalist approach to language employing a parallel, constraint-based framework. The conference aims to promote interaction and collaboration among researchers interested in non-derivational approaches to grammar, where grammar is seen as the interaction of (perhaps violable) constraints from multiple levels of structuring, including those of syntactic categories, grammatical relations, semantics and discourse.

Further information about LFG as a syntactic theory is available at the following sites:

 http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/LFG/
 http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/lfg/


SUBMISSIONS: TALKS AND POSTERS

The main conference sessions will involve 45-minute talks (30 min. + 15 min. discussion), and poster/system presentations. Contributions should focus on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational. Presentations should describe original, unpublished work.


DISSERTATION SESSION
As in previous years, we are hoping to hold a special session that will give students the chance to present recent PhD dissertations (or other student research dissertations).  The dissertations must be completed by the time of the conference, and they should be made publicly accessible (e.g., on the World Wide Web).  The talks in this session should provide an overview of the contents of the dissertation; the talks will be 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute discussion period.  The International LFG Association (ILFGA) will pay the conference fees for the students presenting at the student session.

Students should note that the main sessions are certainly also open to student submissions.


WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS

We also invite proposals for workshops, made up of a small group of talks (2-4) on a coherent topic that can be expected to provide a general overview of the issues relevant to the topic, and generate opposing views and discussion with the broader audience. Panelists for workshops are usually determined by the workshop organisers. Workshop papers should be distributed in advance among panelists so they can cross-reference one another's approaches.

Proposals are also welcome for tutorials, which provide an introduction for non-experts to a specific field of study.
At this point in time, we welcome suggestions for workshops and tutorials from potential organisers or people with specific interests. Suggestions for workshops (title, names and affiliations of organizers, 10 line description) and for tutorials (title, names and affiliations of teachers, and 20 line description of audience, goals, contents, teaching methods, tools used) should be sent to the local organisers.

Note: we no longer ask for a separate page for data and figures (c-/f- and related structures).  They can be included in the text of the abstract, obeying the overall two-page limit.

Abstracts may be submitted by email or by regular mail. Email submission is preferred.

The following information should be provided separately:

PAPER TITLE: 
(for each author:)
 NAME:                 
 AFFILIATION: 
 E-MAIL ADDRESS:       
 IS AUTHOR A STUDENT? (Y/N)

(for dissertation session submissions:)
 UNIVERSITY:            
 ADVISOR(S):          
 (EXPECTED) DATE OF SUBMISSION:

SESSION TYPE:  
(Should submission be considered for:
(1) talk or poster,
(2) talk only,
(3) poster/demonstration only,
(4) dissertation session.)
 
(Note: In the absence of session type specification, submissions will be considered for both the talk and the poster sessions, and the program co-chairs may decide that certain submissions are better as poster presentations than as read papers.)

Regular Mail:
Include:
- Eight copies of the abstract/paper.
- A card or cover sheet with author information.

Email:
Include the author information in the body of your email message. Include or preferably attach your abstract.  The preferred file formats are PDF or plain ASCII.  (If you cannot create PDF, HTML and postscript will be accepted too.  Postscript files require special care to avoid problems: make sure your system is set to include all fonts, or at least all but the standard 13; if using a recent version of Word, make sure you click the printer Properties button and then the Postscript tab, and there choose Optimize for Portability; on all platforms make sure the system is not asking for a particular paper size or other device-specific configuration.  It is your responsibility to send us a file that us and our reviewers can print. You can often test this by trying to look at the file in a screen previewer such as Ghostview.)

All abstracts will be reviewed by at least three people.
Papers will appear in the proceedings, which will be published online by CSLI Publications.  Selected papers may also appear in a printed volume published by CSLI Publications.

Call for papers
Workshop on ''Acquisition and impairments of inflectional morphology''

We cordially invite abstracts for the above mentioned workshop which will be held during the 12th International Morphology Meeting in Budapest, May 25-28, 2006.

Submission deadline for abstracts: Dec 15 05

In Humboldt's and Sapir's language typology, the languages of the world are classified according to their inflectional morphology: They distinguished isolating from analytical from synthetic languages; the latter can be inflectional, agglutinative, or polysynthetic. In language acquisition, the intensity or richness of inflection is a further important feature for the detection of the structure of the target language and the course of the acquisition process. Similarly, in language impairments, the distribution and severity of defects may depend on the structure of the inflectional morphology of the respective language.

Against this typological background, we aim in our workshop to discuss findings and hypotheses concerning universal and language-specific factors playing a role in the acquisition and impairments of inflectional morphology. 

The workshop aims to contribute to suggestions towards the following general questions:

1) How does the morphological typology of the target language(s) influence the L1 acquisition process or the results of language impairments?
2) What are characteristic delays in the acquisition of inflectional morphology in impaired children (in dependence of the morphological typology of the input)?
3) Which conclusions about the structure of inflectional systems can be drawn from the study of child language acquisition and language impairments?

We invite contributions from all theoretical backgrounds dealing with acquisition or impairments of inflectional morphology, especially if they take the typological variety of human languages into account. We particularly encourage studies comparing the morphological acquisition process in impaired and unimpaired children.

Colleagues interested in participating in the workshop are invited to announce their participation as soon as possible and to send a one-page abstract (preferably pdf) by e-mail to both of the organizers, Wolfgang U. Dressler and Dagmar Bittner, by December 15th, 2005:
wolfgang.dressler@univie.ac.at,

Meeting Description:

Explicit and implicit information in text. Information structure across languages.

Conference to be arranged by the project SPRIK Språk i kontrast/Languages in
Contrast at the University of Oslo, Norway,  June 8-10, 2006.

The goal of the conference is to present and discuss current research in text
interpretation, particularly textual cohesion and coherence across languages. We
aim to bring together researchers interested in systematizing and explaining the
variety of means exploited across languages to create cohesion and establish
dependencies and discourse hierarchies in text. Different languages exploit
similar means differently, partly due to competing structures available in the
individual languages, partly due to language-typological differences. We are
interested in empirically based cross-linguistic studies that contribute to a
better understanding of explicit and implicit information in 'real' discourse,
as well as in theoretical research modelling textual cohesion/coherence.

Conference Committee:

Prof. Cathrine Fabtricius-Hansen
Ass.Prof. Bergljot Behrens
Prof. Kjell Johan Så/bå¸
Prof. Stig Johansson 

Papers dealing with the following topics are welcome: 

-Triggers for textual updating across languages. What are the triggers and how
do they differ across languages? 
-Comparable clause connectives, their distribution and interpretation in
different languages. 
-Discourse subordinating and discourse coordinating devices across languages. 
-Implicit and explicit means of structuring information in text - what
difference do they make? 
-Presuppositional accounts of the implicit. 
-The semantic/pragmatic distinction in text interpretation (cross-linguistic
research and translation). 
-The interplay between information structure (at sentence level) and discourse
structure and information flow at text level.  We welcome submissions from
different theoretical frameworks.

Key note speakers:

Robyn Carston (University College London, UK) 
Regine Eckardt (Georg-August Universität Göttingen/ ZAS Berlin, Germany) 
Kjell Johan Sæbø (University of Oslo, Norway) 
Bonnie Webber (University of Edinburgh, UK) 

Important dates:

Submission of abstract: November 25, 2005 
Notification of acceptance/rejection: December 16, 2005

Call Deadline: 10-Feb-2006 

Meeting Description:

This conference discusses functions of and attitudes towards anglicisms in
Europe. The focus of attention will be on language as a means of forming
identities and of distinguishing between oneself and others. Main topics are:

1.Attitudes towards the influx of anglicisms ('Language Policy'), 
2.The use of anglicisms in certain fields of discourse ('Languages for Specific
Purposes'), and
3.Anglicisms in dictionaries ('Lexicography and Corpus Linguistics') 

Abstracts are now invited for papers dealing with one of the following topics:

1.Attitudes towards the influx of anglicisms ('Language Policy') 
2.The use of anglicisms in certain fields of discourse ('Languages for Specific
Purposes')
3.Anglicisms in dictionaries ('Lexicography and Corpus Linguistics') 

Ad 1) This section is about attitudes towards anglicisms, for instance the
question whether any institutional or other attempts have been made to influence
the influx of anglicisms into a language. Connected to this are the attitudes
towards one's own national language and culture, and whether one considers these
endangered and worthy of protection.

Ad 2) The number and type of anglicisms borrowed also depend on the activities
of a given nation. It seems therefore useful to focus on particular practices
and domains and examine the progress of institutionalization of the processes
involved. Questions to be addressed are whether, and to what extent, the adopted
technical vocabulary has become part of the common vocabulary of the target
language, and whether attitudes towards English have been changed as a result.

Ad 3) One practical consequence of the increased number of anglicisms are
dictionaries of English loan words and bilingual dictionaries of technical
jargon. In many European languages considerable efforts have been made to
produce such wordbooks. Regarding lexicographic matters, the conference should
provide a platform for exchanging information, support and experiences, as well
as for establishing future networks. 

Abstracts must be submitted by email - as files attached to a message - as per
the details listed below. They should be sent to
AiE2006@sprachlit.uni-regensburg.de by 10 February 2006. We expect that talks
will last around 20-25 minutes, with 10-15 minutes for discussion.
 
Acceptance will be notified by mid-March 2006.

The abstracts should be submitted in English (or German).

You may submit more than one abstract (either joint or single-authored) but we
will only allow each person to present one paper, as this allows more people to
take part in the conference.

For further details, download call for papers/submission procedure from our
website www-AiE2006.uni-regensburg.de (mind the hyphen after www).

The Conference will be organised by the Department of Intercultural Studies and Applied Languages of the University Paris 7 Denis Diderot, and will be held at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. 

The official languages of TaLC7 are French and English.

Conference aims:
The use of language corpora and corpus tools for the purposes listed below has been recognised by theoretical and applied linguistics researchers for many years:
-First and second language teaching and learning 
-Language awareness raising. 
-Teaching languages for specific purposes. 
-Student-centered linguistic investigation. 
-Interpreting and translation studies. 
-Cultural and historical studies 
-Teaching literature
-Pedagogic grammar
-Learners' dictionary development

The seventh TaLC Conference also aims at focussing on effective results and case studies in using corpora in language and language-related education. Language issues are becoming more and more important in non English speaking countries, especially concerning the dissemination of scientific information for non native speakers of English. With a view to this specific issue, a special session on the European Digital Library will be organised on July 4; the idea of a European Digital Library was initiated by the President of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Professor Jean-Noël Jeanneney, and is developing into an important area of interest.

Abstracts and workshop submission :
Abstracts (500-1000) should be uploaded on the Web site, using the abstract submission form, before February 20 2006. 
Pre-conference workshop proposals (500-1000 words) should be sent to the organising committee (talc7@eila.jussieu.fr), according to the guideline on the Web site, before 31 January 2006. All proposals will be reviewed. 
Authors of those proposals accepted for inclusion will be notified by April 30.

All submissions should include name(s) and institutional affiliation(s) of the author(s), as well as e-mail addresses. Please also indicate if you will need an overhead projector or any other equipment for your presentation. 

You can download abstract submission form and workshop proposal submission form from the website on November 20.

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Meeting Description: 

PACLIC (Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information, and Computation) is a unique conference in its inter-disciplinary and multi-lingual nature. It aims to create synergy between theoretical and computational linguists, as well as to provide a forum for exchange and sharing of ideas among scholars of the Pacific Asia region. Our vision is that the development and sharing of knowledge cannot be blocked by disciplinary and national boundaries. The strength of the Pacific Asia region lies in its multilingualism and multi-cultural heritage. Substantial contribution to human beings can be made if synergy is created across the multi-lingual and multi-cultural spectrum. The endurance and longevity of the PACLIC conferences attest to the validity of this vision.

PACLIC19, just like all previous PACLIC's, welcomes original researches in linguistic accounts and their application to and/or ramifications for language and speech processing.

Foci of these studies should be on Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, and other languages used in the Pacific-Asia region.

Subject: Fieldwork Time in Grammar Writing 
 

Folks,

I would like to know how much time experienced linguists believe should be
budgeted by prospective fieldworkers for field research. Therefore, if you
 have written a grammar or a dictionary of a language or languages -  based
on your own field research - I would be very grateful if you could let me
know how much time in the field/community working with language teachers
you invested. Also, if you have opinions on how long the field research
should take, i.e. if you believe that your own situation was less than
ideal,  I would appreciate receiving those opinions as well. Finally, I
would also like to know how many hours a day you worked with language
teachers in the field and how many hours a day you spent on data processing
and analysis.

Answers to all or a subset of the above questions would  be very much
appreciated. I   will post a summary if there is a sufficient number of
responses. Also, please let me know if you would prefer that your answers
remain anonymous.

Thanks in advance,

Dan Everett

About 25 years ago Dr. James Bostain presented a series of public televsion
lectures on Linguistics in the Baltimore/Washington area.  He introduced himself
as a "scientific linguist."  He also mentioned that he was employed by the
Federal Government.  I do not recall the agency or department.  Would you have
any idea what became of him?  I vividly recall his informative and unique style
of explaining Linguistics.  It would be interesting to know what published work
he has done.  He is not listed among the current roster of Linguists on the
LINGUIST web site.
