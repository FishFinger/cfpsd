Meeting Description:

The laboratory BCL ('Bases, Corpus, Langage', Nice) and the team LDOR of 
the laboratory ERSS ('Equipe de Recherche en Syntaxe et Sémantique', 
Toulouse) organize a conference on Gallo-Roman diachronics which is 
concerned with the phonological and the morphological evolution of 
French, Francoprovençal and Occitan. 

Background
The idea for this conference roots in the observation of several 
deficiencies of the Gallo-Roman domain:
- the paucity of contemporary studies that continue the tradition of the 
Phonétique Historique
- the minor role that dialects have played in the construction of 
classical diachronic knowledge
- the minor role played by modern theories in diachronic studies

We believe that our understanding of the evolution of Gallo-Romance will 
greatly benefit from the confrontation of the classical knowledge with 
diatopic variation and modern theories.

Indeed, knowledge from various sources have failed to be interwoven 
because
- the classical work in Gallo-Roman diachronics as well as modern 
theories have been largely built on the grounds of standard forms of 
languages;
- for a long time, diachronic material and dialectal variation have been 
neglected (sometimes rejected) as empirical evidence in generative 
phonology;
- the progress in diachronic and geolinguistic documentation (FEW, 
Atlases) has often been accomplished either in absence of concern for 
formal models of language, or in overt suspicion towards them.
In this context, it is useful to recall that linguistics was fed with 
diachronic and geolinguistic data (particularly Gallo-Romance data 
actually) at its beginnings in the 19th century. 

The conference is designed as a contribution to the task of restoring the 
continuity of exchange among dialectology, diachronics and theoretical 
linguistics. These disciplines having been too long estranged from each 
other socially, institutionally and culturally, we believe that a renewed 
collaboration represents substantial prospect for all them. Concrete 
benefits are also to be awaited on the institutional side: while French 
diachronics to day play an important role in the French education of 
teachers in secondary school (concours du Capes and de l'Agrégation), 
their teaching is not fed by active research anymore.

The conference specifically aims at overcoming a certain inclination to 
solipsism that is characteristic of the study of French diachronics. In 
order to understand the development of French, all present and past 
varieties of oïl need to be taken into account as much as standard French 
and its predecessors. Also, standard French and dialects of oïl need to 
be confronted with the two neighbouring Romance languages, 
Francoprovençal and Occitan.

All submissions that concern present or past varieties of the three 
languages identified are welcome. They may concentrate on one language or 
build on comparative material, focus on an idiolect or a larger dialectal 
area, and concern literarily elaborated or exclusively oral forms.

The limitation of the conference to the Gallo-Romance space is deliberate 
but of course arbitrary. The reference to this specific geographic domain 
singles out a clearly identifiable portion of Romance and corresponds to 
a certain academic tradition which the conference aims at critically 
continuating. This frame being set, it will have an open interpretation: 
all submissions that have some affinity with it will be considered. In 
particular, reference to other Romance and non-Romance languages is 
welcome as long as Gallo-Romance material is considered.
