Second workshop on Evaluation of Knowledge Discovery Methods (EvalECD 2010)

In conjunction with the 10th EGC conference, Hammamet, Tunisie, 2010.

Contact: evalecd10@lirmm.fr

January 26th, 2010, Hammamet, Tunisie

After the success of the first workshop of Evaluation of Knowledge
Discovery Methods -EvalECD, in conjunction with the 9th EGC conference, we
propose to organize the second edition of the EvalECD workshop, in
conjunction with the 10th EGC conference (26-29 January 2010).

The workshop aims at discussing the evaluation techniques that are used in
different domains and showing the advantages and the drawbacks of these
techniques. Such a workshop, open to different communities of EGC
conference, allows enriching and/or generalizing works that are presented
in more specific workshops (e.g. TIA'05 and COLING'08 on Automatic
Language Processing). This workshop will offer the opportunity to propose
first solutions for the problems caused by the variation of evaluation
techniques of knowledge discovery and data integration.

Following this workshop, we plan to prepare a special issue of RNTI
journal from a selection of good papers of the EvalECD workshop.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following

Pascal, OAEI, etc.)
* Tuning: specification of parameters
* Benchmarks building
* Knowledge validation
* Human expertise in ALP and in knowledge engineering
* Evaluation in data integration
* Evaluation in data reconciliation and fusion
* Evaluation of human interfaces (ergonomics, visualization)
