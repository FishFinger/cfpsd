You have sent a message to the Corpora discussion list.

To reduce the possibility of mail spamming, only messages from members are
automatically sent to the members of the list.

You will get this message either

1) because you are not a member of the list

   You can send a message to majordomo@uib.no with this line in the body:

   subscribe corpora

   if you want to be a member (all subscription requests are inspected
   and approved manually and therefore can be delayed from hours to days).

or

2) because your current address is different from the address you had when
   you subscribed (even how small this difference is).

   Send a message to corpora-request@uib.no if you want to change your
   address (and if possible give any of your old e-mail addresses).

Your current message is manually inspected and will be forwarded to the
list (after a delay of some hours or days) if the contents is appropriate
for the Corpora list.

Best regards
Knut Hofland, Listadm. Corpora (Knut.Hofland@hit.uib.no)

I'm not a legal expert, but if Google loses the case and is prevented
from displaying, for free, a snippet of a few sentences from a
copyrighted book, then I wonder about the consequences on things like
simply citing a book's paragraph: what's the difference between a
Google's snippet, and the paragraph I cite in my paper, in my book, on
on my web site, to refer truthfully to the original author's words?
Will I be expected to pay copyright fees for every citation?
Obviously the amount of data we are talking about is on a different
scale in the case of Google, but if the snippet view in itself is the
target rather than the "mass citation", then I don't really see a
difference between the two situations.

Best.
