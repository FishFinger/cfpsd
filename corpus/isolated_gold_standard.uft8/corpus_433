Named Entities: Recognition, Classification and Use  
Special Issue of Lingvisticae Investigationes

Special issue website:
http://www.linguateca.pt/Forum/SpecialIssueNERLingInv.html

This special topic issue of the journal Lingvisticae Investigationes is
scheduled to come out in early 2008 on the broad topic of Named Entities. 

The aim is to bring out innovative papers on the issues and advances in
Named Entity recognition, classification and use, and how Named Entities
could be handled more effectively in a variety of NLP applications.


Guest Editors

The guest editors for this special issue will be (in alphabetical order):

Elisabete Ranchhod 
University of Lisbon
 
Diana Santos
SINTEF ICT

Satoshi Sekine 
New York University



Background

Since the MUC Conferences about Information Extraction, Named Entity
Recognition and Classification (NERC) is a well-established task in the NLP
community and is regarded as a crucial technology for many NLP applications. 
The definition of what is a Named Entity (NE), however, still remains an
overt question. NEs include classical classes of proper names (persons,
organizations, geographic locations, geo-political entities) and numeric
expressions (time, currencies, percentages).
However, the correct identification and classification of single and
multiword domain specific expressions (e.g., disease names, biological
agents causing health problems, drugs used in disease treatment) should be
an important issue for a number of NLP applications (IE, MT, QA, etc.) and
dealing with these questions has become part and parcel of the problems
dealt by the NE camp.
Likewise, reference to definite events or entities no longer referenced as
proper names in text, as encompassed by the ACE program, has long been
accepted as part of the NER discipline.


TOPICS
The guest editors seek papers on original and unpublished research on all
aspects of NE recognition, classification, and use. Special topics of
interest include, but are not limited to: 

   * Real applications that employ NERC technology 
   * Linguistic properties of proper names 
   * Resources (lexicons, grammars, gazetteers, ontologies) for NERC 
   * The relevance of NERC as a subtask in NLP applications (e.g.
question-answering (QA), information retrieval (IR), summarization, machine
translation (MT)) 
   * Evaluation of NERC systems and of the import of NERC in larger
applications 
   * Cross-language issues in named entity research 
   * Philosphical and methodological concerns in NERC 
   * NEs in speech and transcribed speech and other media
