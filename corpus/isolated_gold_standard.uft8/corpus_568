The University of Cyprus is hosting the 4th International Conference on Language Variation in Europe (ICLaVE 2007) from 17 to 19 June 2007 in Nicosia, Cyprus. 

ICLaVE is one of the most important conferences for research in the area of language variation in Europe. It aims to bring together specialists in European languages/languages spoken in Europe with the purpose of discussing methodological and theoretical issues in the study of language variation and change. Scholars in any area of linguistics, such as historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, dialectology, sociolinguistics etc., are invited to submit proposals for a poster or paper presentation or a workshop.

Abstract/poster submission:
We invite abstracts for paper (20-minute presentation + 10-minute discussion) and poster presentations in all areas of language variation in European languages and languages spoken in Europe. 

Participants wishing to present a paper or a poster should send an anonymous copy with the title of their paper/poster and an abstract of 350 words maximum, including references. Please send your contact information (name, affiliation and a contact address) in a separate file, and clearly state which kind of presentation you prefer. 

Authors should use Times New Roman 12pt, 1.5 space. All proposals should be in English.

We have defined three broad areas for workshops: (a) intonational/prosodic variation, (b) delineating dialect continua (c) lexical variation and its consequences for phonology, morphology or syntax  

Proposals for workshops in other areas are also welcomed. Workshops are to be organized as two to four-hour sessions on a specific topic with 4 to 8 20-minute papers and time for discussion. In their proposal, workshop organizers should briefly describe the workshop topic and give the names, affiliation and e-mail addresses of presenters, as well as the abstracts of individual papers. 

Proposals for workshops should be 2 pages long (maximum) and should reach the organizing committee by October 30th 2006. Authors should use Times New Roman 12pt, 1.5 space. All proposals should be in English. Abstracts should be submitted as Word or RTF documents by e-mail to iclave4@ucy.ac.cy (preferably) or by surface mail at ICLaVE4, Pavlos Pavlou, University of Cyprus, P.O.
