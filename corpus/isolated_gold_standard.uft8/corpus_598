 The University of Queensland</h3>
<img src=3D"http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/files2/pictures/picture-103.jpg" />
<h4>Research area: Information Retrieval - Human-Computer Interaction</h4=
>
<p>Dr Smith's primary research interest was to develop a robust computati=
onal system for quantifying and visualising the conceptual information in=
 large text collections in ways that compensate for deficiencies in human=
 memory performance. This can be classified as an Analyst Support System.

The information architecture and visualisation techniques employed are ta=
ken from principals in Information Science. This discipline is particular=
ly useful for coping with large, diverse, and complex information spaces =
such as natural language corpora. In order to extract named concepts from=
 natural language in an unsupervised manner, principals from Corpus Lingu=
istics have been integrated with algorithms from Computational Linguistic=
s and Machine Learning. The resulting system is called Leximancer, and is=
 currently being commercialised for use in text analysis, intelligence, a=
nd knowledge management.

In order to examine the semantic and relational networks generated by the=
se techniques, Andrew has investigated and developed algorithms for scali=
ng and measurement of Complex Networks. His future research direction is =
towards finding large scale structure within complex knowledge networks, =
with a view to enhancing learning, recall, and ontological alignment. And=
rew takes the view that qualitative and quantitative data are simply two =
limits on a continuum of complexity.</p>
