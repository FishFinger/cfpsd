Call for Papers

Description:
Among tenses and linguistic expressions that anchor events and situations i=
n
time, those that refer to the future occupy a special place. The most obvio=
us
reason is the 'open' or 'indeterminate' character of the future: at least f=
rom
our present point of view, the future course of events is not fixed while t=
here
is arguably only one past. This problem has exercised the minds of all thos=
e who
have attempted to provide a semantic account of future temporal reference. =
Not
surprisingly, this has led numerous linguists to argue that (at least certa=
in)
linguistic markers of futurity belong to the category of modality rather th=
an to
the tense system proper. And it is true, typically in Germanic languages, t=
hat
the central markers of futurity have often developed diachronically from mo=
dal
verbs.

However, the semantic indeterminacy of future reference is just one among m=
any
fascinating questions. These include (the list is not exhaustive):=20
- pastness in the future
- futurity in the past
- 'distance' in the future (near vs. remote future)=20
- the use of future tense or other verbal forms marking future time in
subordinate clauses
- the use of verbal forms usually marking future time to mean other things =
than
reference to future time.

In this workshop, we would like to promote a fresh look at the future by
bringing together semanticists, typologists, cognitive linguists and other
linguists interested in all things future. We encourage scholars from vario=
us
theoretical traditions to submit papers. We also wish to reach across
traditional languages lines and welcome submissions that examine similariti=
es
and differences between Romance or Germanic languages on the one hand, and =
other
language groups on the other.

We ask potential participants to send us provisional titles and short
descriptions no later than 12 November so as to allow us to submit our work=
shop
proposal to the SLE Scientific Committee before 15 November 2009.=20

In case of acceptance of our proposal, all abstracts will have to be submit=
ted
by the end of December via the 'submit abstract' form to be found on the SL=
E
website.
