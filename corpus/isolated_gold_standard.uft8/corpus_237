Call for Papers

You are hereby invited to present your current CALL activities, highlighting
aspects such as:
- the impact of CALL on motivation;
- designing  for motivation;
- the role of ICT in the analysis of motivation;
- the relationship between motivation and proficiency level/attainment;
- learning styles;
- L2 anxiety;
- technophobia and willingness to use technology;
- Self-models and L2 identities;
- motivation of teachers
- motivation of policy makers;
- motivation in web 2.0 based learning environments;
- motivation and L2 gaming;
- the role of virtual, adaptive and intelligent systems;
- the role of mobile devices and applications.
 
We welcome proposals that address any of the above or related topics, as well 
as those involving studies of other individual or group differences that may
directly or indirectly influence motivation to use technology effectively in
language teaching and learning.

Besides these topics, panels and discussion groups will also tackle questions like:
- How to transform your daily work into research ?
- How to carry out collaborative research ?
- How to get published ?

Deadline for submissions is 15 February 2010. Please send your abstract(s) to 
ann.aerts@ua.ac.be.
 
Check the conference website for further information: www.antwerpcall.be.
 
Antwerp CALL 2010 will be combined with the second edition of the LINGUAPOLIS
Summer School: A Toolbox for Design-Based Research (22-27 August 2010). The
course will focus on methodological considerations in designing and conducting 
empirical research. Our lecturers will highlight the practical issues involved
in the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods in language teaching
and learning.  Participants of CALL 2010 get a reduction for the Summer School.
 
The maximum number of participants is limited, so enjoy the benefits of pre-
registration for both events by sending an e-mail to ann.aerts@ua.ac.be. Once 
pre-registered, your seat is reserved, but you keep the right to cancel until 15
March 2010.
