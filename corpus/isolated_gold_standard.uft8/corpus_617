HCSNet Priority Area Workshop on Next-Generation Search Technology
21st and 22nd September 2006
University of Melbourne

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Existing information retrieval systems effectively treat documents as
unstructured bags of words. As Google and its competitors demonstrate,
this approach works surprisingly well. At the same time, it is clear that
human processors of information make use of a much deeper understanding
of text than these systems exhibit. Humans cannot compete with machines
in terms of quantity, but their abilities far exceed those of machines
when it comes to quality.

This priority research area focuses on how we can improve search
engine technology by integrating more knowledge about the processing
and understanding of language. This knowledge comes from a range of
disciplines represented within HCSNet. Linguistics treats texts as richly
structured objects that obey complex and interacting rules about language
use, and natural language processing attempts to implement computational
models that embody these ideas: how do we add this sophistication to .....

intelligent and adaptive systems using machine learning and/or
evolutionary computation techniques; other artificial
intelligence techniques will also be considered. Examples of
topics include, but are not limited to, evolutionary learning,
neural network learning, autonomous agents/robots, artificial
life, evolutionary games, hybrid learning systems, other machine
learning systems.

Optimisation with Intelligent Systems: Both numerical and
combinatorial optimisation will be considered. Examples of the .....

  2nd International Workshop on Software for Sensor Networks Sensorware 2007
  rchell@deakin.edu.au

CALL FOR PAPERS
2nd International Workshop on Software for Sensor Networks (SensorWare)
To be held with Comsware 2007 (www.comsware.org)

8th January 2007, Bangalore India
www.sensorware.org

Advances in technology have made deployment of miniature sensors
a realistic proposition. Low-power, inexpensive smart devices with
multiple on-board sensors are connected through wireless links so as
to form a collaborative sensor network to perform a specific task. As a
result, it opens up a new paradigm of ubiquitous computing and enables
a range of applications that are previously unrealizable or too costly
to be realized. However, given the limitation of on-board hardware,
one of the key areas towards achieving superior performance is through
software implementation. The workshop is intended to bring together
industry experts and researchers to share novel techniques, algorithms
and software implementation for sensor networks, and to discuss the
current status, technical challenges, standards, fundamental issues,
and future services and applications in the form of panels and technical
presentation. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the .....

  JSAT S.I. on Satisfiability Modulo Theories
  Roberto Sebastiani <rseba@dit.unitn.it>

===================  Preliminary Call for Papers ====================

Journal on Satisfiability, Boolean Modeling and Computation (JSAT)
Special Issue on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)

http://dit.unitn.it/~rseba/jsat_smt06/

Deadline for paper submission (provisional): November 25th, 2006

======================================================================

GENERAL INFORMATION

Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is the problem of deciding the
satisfiability of first-order formulae with respect to some
decidable background theory (e.g., linear arithmetic, the theory of
arrays, the theory of bit-vectors).
SMT techniques are gaining increasing relevance in many application
domains, including formal verification of hardware and software,
compiler optimization, planning and scheduling.
SMT is strongly related to SAT, as most SMT tools are built on top of .....
