Meeting Description:

The French national research association for English for Specific Purposes
(GERAS) will hold its 31st annual Conference on the following topic =AB at =
the
intersection of specialised discourses : heterogeneity and unity =BB at the
University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis.=20

The discussion begun in 2008 concerning the unity and diversity of English =
for
Specific Purposes (ESP) will be pursued; the distinctive approach in 2010 w=
ill
thus examine the phenomenon from the perspective of interconnections.
Suggestions for contributions may approach this question from various angle=
s
along all four research strands: Applied Linguistics and Discourse Analysis=
,
Culture, Didactics and Technology.=20

Please visit the GERAS website www.geras.fr or the Nice conference website

Call for Papers

At the Intersection of Specialised Discourses: Heterogeneity and Unity

The topics covered by the 2010 GERAS Conference in Nice reflect the continu=
ing
focus of the scientific association's research on the multiplicity and unit=
y of
English for Specific Purposes. The 2008 conference looked at the theme of
distance/proximity in ESP. The 2009 conference raised issues about the stag=
es
leading from non-specialisation to specialisation. In 2010 it seems appropr=
iate
to move the focus towards the question of intersections between different E=
SP
discourses.

After spending so many years trying to define the scope of the various
discourses or fields so as to deal with each one individually, it may appea=
r
antonymic to now propose that they should be considered collectively in ter=
ms of
how they could perhaps be brought together. How does this affect ESP? How d=
o
various fields and discourses influence each other? Is it possible to envis=
age
the existence of a median or transversal discourse common to all varieties =
of
ESP? Could this transversality lead to the emergence of broader fields of
specialisation made up of specialised discourses which are necessarily clos=
ely
related?
These are the general issues which may be tackled from the four methodologi=
cal
angles which have traditionally been adopted by GERAS:

Linguistics
A linguistic approach to the theme of the conference allows researchers to
investigate the similarities and differences at the intersection of discour=
ses
in linguistic terms, including various levels of linguistic analysis and th=
e
correlations between them. Two key issues are of interest here: which lingu=
istic
features differentiate or bring together different specialised discourses? =
Which
particular types of intersection do we see in certain discourses?

Didactics
The intersection of specialised discourses is crucially important in langua=
ge
teaching. The multiplication of genres in ESP (oral presentations with slid=
e
shows, abstracts, research reports), makes new practices essential; what ar=
e the
implications for language teaching and learning? Can learner-centred teachi=
ng
contribute to defining different discourses? Can researchers differentiate
between discourses? Can the action-based approach currently advocated offer
solutions?

Culture
The intersection of discourses raises the issue of homogeneity in discourse
communities and discourse practices: how are cross-disciplinary or
interdisciplinary communities created? How are community members' identitie=
s
constructed? Which professional circles are concerned?

Technology
Technological innovation, and in particular the emergence of Web 2.0
collaborative tools (blogs, wikis, chats, etc.), is facilitating synchronou=
s
communication. What new communities of practice are developing with respect=
 to
these tools? In methodological terms, what new perspectives are being opene=
d up
by the development of NICT in terms of exploring intersections between thes=
e
communities?

The above questions are intended as guidelines for researchers.
Other proposals related to the general theme will also be examined.

Calendar
- 15 December 2009: Deadline for submission
- 15 January 2010: Notification of acceptance

Abstracts
An abstract of 300 words, including a title and description of the content =
of
the presentation, should be submitted in English or French by 15 December t=
o
geras2010@unice.fr. The presentation should be given in the same language a=
s the
abstract.
