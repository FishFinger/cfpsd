1. The special issue

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of
computational research on prepositions. Due to their importance in
computational tasks prepositions and related constructions have received a
considerable amount of attention and occupied a central position in
research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and related disciplines. 
Researchers from these backgrounds have looked at the role of prepositions in
language processing.

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP
tasks, very little progress has been made in systematically describing
preposition semantics. Notably, the only account of the lexical semantics
of prepositions in resources such as WordNet is indirect, in that they
feature in significant numbers within multiword expressions or as frame
elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated into such resources as
first-order entities, a large number of issues must be resolved such as how
to taxonomically deconstruct the spatial semantics of prepositions, and how
to tease apart preposition and verb semantics in phrasal verbs.

Our expectation is that such questions will be guided by careful analysis
of what semantic distinctions and representational granularity are required
in a range of applications, which will in turn be guided by such research
as the representation of prepositions within implemented grammars,
crosslingual preposition semantics, and computational models of the human
processing of prepositions.


2. Topics of interest

We specifically invite submissions that bring a theoretical basis to
research on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP tasks of the sort
described above. 
In particular, we focus on the syntactic and semantic treatment of
productive and collocational uses of prepositional phrases and markers in
resources such as WordNet and FrameNet, and the utilization of such resources in
NLP tasks.

- Extraction of Prepositions:
Papers which describe the extraction of prepositions and related
constructions, including their subcategorisation frames and alternation
patterns, as are necessary for the semi-automatic extension of lexical
resources.

- Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources:
Papers describing the challenges of providing adequate representation such
as would be generally applicable in NLP applications.

- Prepositions in Applications:
Papers that discuss the role of prepositions in NLP tasks, focusing
specifically on what insights various applications offer for lexical
resource building, what particular needs different application areas have,
necessary extensions to existing resources, and how prepositional lexical
resources of various types could enhance performance over a given task.


3. Submission information

Deadline for paper submissions: July 31, 2006.
