Last call for papers

The workshop will explore the precise role of linguistic variation in language
evolution. We invite submissions to the following (and related) topics:
-Empirical studies of language variation that are relevant for language
evolution. This includes experimental psycholinguistc studies as well as corpus
investigations;
-Computer simulations of language evolution;
-Formal and computational models of the micro-dynamics of language evolution,
like stochastic, exemplar based or memory based approaches;
-Studies of grammaticalization phenomena (and language change phenomena in
general) that relate diachronic change to synchronic variation;
-The role of variation in creolization;
-Mathematical models of language evolution.

For more details please consult the workshop website at: 
http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/gjaeger/dgfs2007/cfp.html

Submissions are invited for 60-minutes presentations (45 minutes + 15 minutes
