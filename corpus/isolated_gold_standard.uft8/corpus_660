Dear Colleagues,

We are proposing a panel on the theme of:

Vague language: the use of approximators and hedges in spoken and written
corpora 

For the International Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg, Sweden in July
2007 and would be interested in hearing from other people working on this
topic who might be interested in presenting a paper at this panel.

Lakoff's (1972) classic paper on hedges laid the foundation for the study
of linguistic markers which serve to blur the category boundaries of the
linguistic elements they operate on and/or reduce the speakers' commitment.
However, systematic studies, especially on languages other than English
(see Channell 1994) are still scarce.

The organisers of the panel have recently been researching the use of
parenthetical clauses (e.g. Engl. 'I think', Fr. 'disons', Sp. 'digamos')
and ''N1 of N2''-constructions such as sort of in different languages
(English, French, Spanish, Italian). However, we welcome any contributions
studying the various linguistic means used for expressing
approximation/hedging, e.g. pragmatic markers such as 'like', round
numerals, prepositions such as 'about', disjunctive list completers such as
'something like that', diminutive suffixes etc.

The aim of the panel is to bring together researchers from different
backgrounds interested in approximation and hedging at the interface
between semantics and pragmatics. We are particularly interested in
research based on corpus data and would like to address questions such as:
- the role of approximation in spoken and written texts
- types of approximators/hedges in different languages
- their linguistic status
- their status with respect to discourse markers
- their semantics, e.g. whether they are conceptual or procedural elements
- their historical dimension, e.g. the process of grammaticalization 

If interested, please let us know which topic you would like to address in
such a panel and get in touch with: gunther.kaltenboeck@univie.ac.at by the
end of June 2006.

Best wishes,
Gunther Kaltenböck (Vienna), Wiltrud Mihatsch (Bielefeld), Stefan Schneider
