Call Deadline: 01-Nov-2006 

Meeting Description:

GLOW XXX Colloquium with workshops on Selective Global Comparison, the
Structure of Segment Inventories, and the Acquisition of Variable Word Order,
April 11-14 2007. Keynote speaker Noam Chomsky, MIT; invited speaker Keren Rice,
Toronto. 

Call for Papers: Main Session 

GLOW XXX 

The 2007 Colloquium, April 12-14

and Workshops, April 11

At The Center for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics, Tromsø, Norway.

Deadline for two-page abstracts: November 1, 2006

Keynote speaker: Noam Chomsky

Theme of the Colloquium: Free

Meeting URL: http://www.hum.uit.no/glow/

Abstracts are invited on any topic in generative grammar (phonology,
morphology, syntax, or semantics).

Abstracts should be sent in two copies: one with a name and one without as
attached files (the name(s) should also be clearly mentioned in the e-mail)
to: glow@hum.uit.no in .pdf format.

Only electronic submissions will be considered. Deadline for submissions:
November 1, 2006.

Abstracts may not exceed two pages of text with at least a one-inch margin
on all four sides (measured on A4 paper) and must employ a font not smaller
than 12 point. Each page may include a maximum of 50 lines of text.
Abstracts may include an extra page for references (not examples), but this
third page will not be published in the Spring newsletter.

The 50-line limit includes examples. It is there to prevent tricks like
changing the line height in order to cram more ink onto the page.

Submitters whose computers are not envisioning A4 paper should adjust their
margin sizes in order to achieve a text box similar to that on A4 with 1''
margins (e.g. those using the American 8 1/2'' x 11'' size should use wider
left and right margins (1.13'' or 2.85 cm), and may use smaller top and
bottom margins (0.6'' or 1.5 cm)). This is especially important for the
printing of the spring newsletter.

There are abstract templates for your convenience if you choose to use
them. They are available from the ''Abstract Templates'' link on the
website. They will assist you in meeting the above requirements.

Speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses.

For further information follow links or write to glow@hum.uit.no 

The deadline for this year is November 1st, 2006.
