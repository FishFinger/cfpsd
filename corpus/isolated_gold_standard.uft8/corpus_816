*Canadian Conference on AI 2010
Graduate Students Symposium*

May 30th, University  of  Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

Call For Paper - Deadline 30 January 2010

http://glass.cs.unb.ca/~ebrahim/conf/cai-gs/



AI 2010, the twenty-third Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
invites graduate students to submit four-page extended abstracts of their
thesis for possible inclusion in the AI 2010 Graduate Student Symposium and
the Canadian AI proceedings published by Springer.
Symposium Objectives

The Symposium provides an opportunity for Master's and PhD students to
discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives with
their peers and with a panel of established researchers in Artificial
Intelligence, helping to develop a supportive community of scholars and a
spirit of collaborative research.

The symposium will be a one-day pre-conference event, where students of
accepted abstracts will be invited to give a presentation on their thesis
work before a group of peers as well as a small team of expert AI
researchers who would offer a critique of each presentation and provide
support, advice, and mentoring. Each student may also be invited to
participate in the poster session during the main conference. In addition, a
small selection of the best student submissions will be invited to give a
short talk during the main conference.

PhD and Master's students are invited to submit original work in all areas
of Artificial Intelligence. Submissions should have emphasis on work in
progress, with directions for future research clearly indicated wherever
appropriate. More weight will be placed on the significance of the work, the
proposed ideas or solutions, and the overall presentation than on
submissions which present work with complete results.
The Application Package

Applicants to the symposium need to submit the following materials. Please
combine all materials into one PDF document:

    * A four-page thesis summary that outlines the problem being addressed,
the proposed plan for research, and a description of the progress to date.
The most successful applications directly address all three of these
components. Please be sure to distinguish between work that has already been
accomplished and work that remains to be done. Be sure to include a title
for your work. All submissions must be written in English. Abstracts may be
up to 4 pages in length and must be formatted according to Springer's LNCS
style. Please follow the instructions for authors at Springer's site for
authors. The use of the LaTeX2e style file available at the web site is
strongly encouraged.
    * Include a CV (at most two pages) that describes your background and
relevant experience (research, education, employment). Your CV needs to
include your anticipated graduation date, or it may be rejected without
review. Please include any additional items that may indicate your potential
contribution to, and benefit from, the symposium.
    * A letter of recommendation from your thesis advisor. It must include
an assessment of the current status of your thesis research, and an expected
date for thesis submission. In addition, your advisor should indicate what
he or she hopes you would gain from participation in the symposium.
    * Participant's Expectations. A short (one page or less) statement of
what you expect to gain from presenting and participating in the symposium,
as well as what you think you can contribute to the symposium. For best
consideration, your statement must address both of these expectations.



The Reviewing Process

Each abstract will be reviewed by a team of program committee members.
Presenting students will be selected based on clarity of the submission,
stage of research, advisor's letter and evidence of promise such as
published papers or technical reports. (Partial) Financial assistance for
travel and accommodations may be available to the students presenting at the
Symposium.

All students are encouraged to attend and participate in the Symposium,
whether or not they apply to present their work. All the selected student
presenters are expected to actively participate in the full Symposium, as we
envision participants gaining as much by interacting with their peers as by
having their presentations critiqued by the faculty panel. In addition, a
senior AI researcher and faculty member will be invited to give a talk on a
topic of interest to graduate students.


Important Dates

Package submission due January 30th, 2010
Notification of acceptance March 3rd, 2010
Final paper due March 8th, 2010
