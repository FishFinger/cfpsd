Meeting Description:

We wish to call for papers for the panel 'Universalism and relativism in
face-saving: Focus on postcolonial contexts' scheduled for the 39th annual
meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea (SLE), 30-Aug-2006 to 02-Sep-2006
in Bremen, Germany.
 
Although the focus of this panel is primarily on face-saving, papers related to
the myriad locutionary forms, illocutionary functions, and perlocutionary
effects of language communication and communication systems in postcolonial
contexts are welcome as well. Papers dealing with natural discourse and issues
of cultural displacement, migration, hybridity, diaspora, and the role of public
and government media in shaping perceptions of postcolonial history, politics,
and regional, ethnic, and social identities will also be considered. With its
emphasis on communication and issues of identity, agency, understanding, and
empowerment in different postcolonial contexts, this panel wishes to provide a
common platform for interdisciplinary cooperation between scholars of different
persuasions with interests in language, communication, and postcolonial questions.

The main question this panel wishes to address is: to what extent are the
patterns of face-saving claimed by Brown and Levinson (1978) really universal?
Since the publication of Brown and Levinson's work, several other works have
been published that describe patterns of politeness and face-saving in
Non-western cultures that are distinctly different from those in Western
cultures. Although some researchers have discussed politeness in certain African
and Asian cultures, it is still not established if the further mix of languages
and linguistic identities created by colonialism play a significant role in the
way speakers in multilingual postcolonial speech communities produce and react
to speech acts related to politeness and face-saving. This issue is particularly
complex, because language use and abuse play important roles in many areas of
postcolonial life. Language can be a powerful mediator of understanding,
empowerment, and solidarity, or a source of repression, disempowerment, and
discrimination. Choices of what and how (and in what languages) things are
expressed stand at the centre of postcolonial pragmatic interest. 
 
If certain face-saving strategies (hedging, complimenting, understating,
distancing, etc.) are relatively uniform in Western cultures, as Brown and
Levinson claim, how are these realised in postcolonial contexts? What happens to
these strategies among speakers who have complex, hybrid linguistic identities
built on mixtures of foreign languages imposed during colonialism, indigenous
languages, and the languages of wider communication (Pidgins and Creoles)? Do
speakers adopt situational faces, using the different languages (and with these,
identities) at their disposal to project such faces? Or do they adopt stabile
face-saving patterns specific to one language and culture in their daily
communication? Answers to these questions could be found by analyzing everyday
face-to-face discourse, political and institutional discourse, print media
discourse, literary discourse, and all forms of electronically mediated
communication.

TOPICS

Papers are invited on the topic of text data mining in its strictest
sense: providing users with information not explicitly stated in
text. Work submitted to this session will be required to be more
ambitious with respect to either theory or reach than the entity
identification, information extraction, and information retrieval
projects that comprise most work in biomedical language processing.

We especially solicit work in the following areas:

 - Question answering
 - Summarization
 - Mining data from full text including figures, tables, and images
 - Coreference resolution and normalization
 - User-driven systems, including user needs, user model, interactive
   systems, and user interfaces for biomedical language processing
 - Evaluation: test collections and evaluation methods

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

 - All papers must be submitted to Russ Altman in PostScript (.ps),
   Adobe Acrobat (.pdf), or Microsoft Word (.doc) format. Adobe Acrobat
   is preferred.

 - Attached files should be named with the last name of the first
   author ( e.g. altman.ps, altman.pdf, or altman.doc). Hardcopy
   submissions or unprocessed TeX or LaTeX files will be rejected
   without review.

 - Every paper must be accompanied by a cover letter which must include
   the following:
    - The email address of the corresponding author
    - The specific PSB session that the paper should be considered for
    - A statement that the submitted paper contains original,
      unpublished results, and is not currently under consideration
      elsewhere
    - A statement that all authors concur with the contents of the
      paper

 - Submitted papers are limited to twelve (12) pages in the PSB
   publication format.

 - Please format your paper according to the instructions found at
   http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/psb-submit/.

 - If figures cannot easily be resized and placed precisely in the
   text, then it should be clear that with appropriate modifications,
   the total manuscript length would be within the page limit.

 - Color pictures can be printed at the expense of the authors.
   The fee is $500 per page of color pictures, payable at the time of
   camera-ready submission.

 - Contact Russ Altman ( russ.altman@stanford.edu) for additional
   information about paper submission requirements.
