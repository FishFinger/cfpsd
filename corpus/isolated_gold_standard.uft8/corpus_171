                     Ambiguity in Anaphora: Call for Papers

    http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/Research/nle/anaphora/

    7-11 August 2006, Málaga, Spain.

    A workshop held as part of ESSLLI 2006, the Eighteenth European Summer
    School in Logic, Language and Information.

    Deadline for receipt of five-page extended abstracts: 8 March 2006
    Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

Organizers

    Ron Artstein, Massimo Poesio (University of Essex)

Description

    We invite extended abstracts for 45-minute presentations (including
    discussion) relating to ambiguity in anaphora. Anaphoric expressions
    such as pronouns and definite descriptions can be ambiguous: they may
    relate to more than one antecedent, or (potentially) denote more than
    one referent. Such ambiguity poses challenges to the representation
    of anaphoric relations in grammar and discourse and to computational
    algorithms which resolve anaphoric reference, all of which should
    allow for representing ambiguity.

    The workshop aims to create a dialogue between researchers who work on
    anaphoric ambiguity from a variety of perspectives, such as:

      * Theoretical studies of the representation of ambiguous anaphoric
        relations in syntax and semantics;
      * Discourse models which represent referential ambiguity;
      * Computational studies on the annotation and resolution of
        anaphoric ambiguity;
      * Psychological studies on the interpretation of ambiguous anaphoric
        expressions;
      * Studies of anaphoric expressions and anaphora antecedents which
        are not noun phrases.

    We especially welcome studies that cross disciplinary boundaries and
    look at anaphoric ambiguity from multiple viewpoints.

Submission

    Deadline for receipt of extended abstracts: 8 March 2006
    Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

    Extended abstracts should conform to the following guidelines.

      * Maximum five (5) pages, including data/tables/figures/references.
      * Anonymous; do not identify the author via self-reference.
      * First paragraph should be a brief summary of the entire work.
      * A4 or letter size paper, 12 point font, 2.5 cm / 1 inch margins.
      * PDF file format, with all fonts embedded.

    Submit your extended abstracts as email attachments. In the body
    of the message include the paper title and the authors' names and
    affiliations, as well as the email address for the corresponding
    author.

    Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

Review

    Submissions will be reviewed by an international committee of
    theoretical linguists, computational linguists and psycholinguists.

        Jennifer Arnold, University of North Carolina
        Chris Barker, University of California, San Diego
        Kees van Deemter, University of Aberdeen
        Paul Elbourne, University of Manchester
        Alan Garnham, University of Sussex
        Klaus von Heusinger, University of Stuttgart
        Véronique Hoste, University of Antwerp
        Christer Johansson, University of Bergen
        Elsi Kaiser, University of Southern California
        Ruslan Mitkov, University of Wolverhampton
        Christoph Müller, EML Research
        Rebecca Passonneau, Columbia University
        Tanya Reinhart, Tel Aviv University
        Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh

    Selection will be strictly by quality, and there are no quotas based
    on discipline; we hope to get a mix of papers from a variety of
    viewpoints.

Proceedings

    Final versions of the accepted papers, slightly longer than the
    extended abstracts, will be distributed in a summer school reader.
    If there is sufficient interest among the contributors, we intend
    to approach a journal for publication as a special issue.

Workshop format

    The workshop is part of ESSLLI and attendance is open to all ESSLLI
    participants. It will consist of five sessions of 90 minutes each,
    held over five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI. Each
    session will consist of two 45-minute presentations (including time
    for questions and discussion).

Registration

    All workshop contributors will be required to register for ESSLLI
    2006. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will
    correspond to the early student registration fee.

    A number of additional fee-waiver grants might be made available
    by the ESSLLI local organizing committee on a competitive basis
    and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those.

    There will be no reimbursement for travel costs or accommodation.
    Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should
    contact the ESSLLI local organizing committee to ask for the
    possibilities of a grant.

Important Dates

    8 March, 2006: Deadline for receipt of extended abstracts
    21 April, 2006: Notification of acceptance
    1 May, 2006: Final version due for the proceedings
    7-11 August, 2006: Workshop
