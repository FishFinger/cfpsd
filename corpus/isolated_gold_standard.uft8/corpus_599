Call for Papers for the Workshop:

     CROSS LINGUAL INFORMATION ACCESS 
     ADDRESSING THE INFORMATION NEED OF MULTILINGUAL SOCIETIES

To take place on 6 January 2007 in Hyderabad, India,
at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)
=============================================================
URL: http://search.iiit.ac.in/CLIA2007/  

The development of digital and online information repositories is creating
many opportunities and also new problems in information retrieval. Online
documents are available internationally in many different languages. This
makes it possible for users to directly access previously unimagined sources
of information. However in conventional information retrieval systems the
user must enter a search query in the language of the documents in order to
retrieve it. This requires that the user can formulate his/her queries in
all possible languages and can decipher documents returned by the retrieval
process. This restriction clearly limits the amount and type of information
which an individual user really has access to. 

Cross-language information retrieval enables users to enter queries in
languages they are fluent in, and uses language translation methods to
retrieve documents originally written in other languages. Cross-Language
Information Access is an extension of the Cross-Language Information
Retrieval paradigm. Users who are unfamiliar with the language of documents
retrieved are often unable to obtain relevant information from these
documents. The objective of Cross-Language Information Access is to
introduce additional post retrieval processing to enable users make sense of
these retrieved documents. This additional processing may take the form of
machine translation of snippets, summarization and subsequent translation of
summaries and/or information extraction. 


In the past five years, research in Cross Lingual Information Access has
been vigorously pursued through the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF),
NTCIR Asian Language Retrieval, Question-answering Workshop and such other
fora. Significant results have been obtained in multilingual summarization
workshops and cross-language named entity extraction challenges by the ACL
(Association for Computational Linguistics) and the Geographic Information
retrieval (GeoCLEF) track of CLEF. 

This workshop aims to bring together various trends in cross and
multi-lingual information retrieval and access. It will provide a
comprehensive survey of the state of the art technology and systems, and
present emerging technologies in this domain. We will bring together ideas
from academia, government, and industry to cover a broad spectrum of
applications and views. The workshop will consist of a set of invited talks
and presentations of technical papers which will be selected after peer
review from the submissions received. 


=============================================================
