*Call for Papers*

*What is "AI, Cognitive Semantics and Computational Linguistics : New=20
Perspectives" ?*
Traditionally, the study of computational linguistics has been performed=20
by computer scientists, specializing in the application of computers to=20
the processing of a natural language.
Today, computational linguists often work as members of=20
interdisciplinary teams, including linguists (specifically trained in=20
linguistics), language experts (persons with some level of ability in=20
the languages relevant to a given project), and computer scientists. In=20
general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of=20
linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence,=20
mathematicians, logicians, cognitive scientists, cognitive=20
psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists,=20
among others.
Computational linguistics must become more connected to the cognitive=20
sciences through the development of cognitive semantic theories.=20
Computational linguistics is connected to artificial intelligence=20
through the development of methods and algorithms for all aspects of=20
language analysis and their computer implementation. We can see language=20
analysis divided into two parts: theoretical analysis and application.=20
The theoretical aspect includes standard areas studied in linguistics:=20
semantics, syntax, and morphology. Semantic theories guide the=20
development of syntactic theories and morphology. Semantic theories can=20
be based on some specific features of computation, but at the present=20
stage of research, there is a gap between linguistic analysis and=20
computer applications in two senses: there are many computer=20
applications without linguistic theoretical support and, conversely,=20
there are a number of theoretical methods with no computer=20
implementation. Another epistemological feature of the present stage of=20
research is that most computational linguistic methods are focused on=20
statistical approaches. The advantage of these methods is that they are=20
easy to apply but the drawback is that they distort the qualitative and=20
genuine cognitive features of language.
The goal of this track is to provide an international forum for=20
discussing the latest approaches in subfields of computational=20
linguistics related to cognitive semantics and to artificial=20
intelligence. Its aim is also to exchange ideas concerning the way of=20
building efficient systems of language analysis based on cognitive=20
semantic models.
Its mission is to prove the increase of interaction between modeling in=20
cognitive semantics and computer implementation: a good system analysis=20
requires a good semantic model as framework. On the other hand, the need=20
for semantic models other than those based on statistical methods has to=20
be proved.

*What is the GOAL of the track?*
This track is intended to present works ranking from logical and=20
mathematical models in syntax and semantics (logic of objects,=20
topological theories of time and space etc.) as foundations of the=20
design and analysis to natural language processing systems.

*Who should be interested?*
Special tracks, held in parallel with the general conference, are an=20
integral part of the conference. They provide researchers in focused=20
areas the opportunity to meet and present their work, and offer a forum=20
for interaction among the broader community of artificial intelligence=20
researchers.
Topics of interest are in all areas related to artificial intelligence.=20
For example, last year's special tracks included: AI Education; AI=20
Planning and Scheduling; Applied Natural Language Processing; Case-Based=20
Reasoning; Data Mining; Design, Evaluation, and Refinement of=20
Intelligent Systems (DERIS); Games and Entertainment; Intelligent=20
Tutoring Systems; Semantics, Ontologies, and Computational Linguistics;=20
and Uncertain Reasoning.

*What kind of studies will be of interest?*
Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work relating to AI,=20
Cognitive Semantics and Computational Linguistics. Topics of interest=20
may include (but are in no way limited to)

   1. cognitive semantics,
   2. logics of language,
   3. language modeling,
   4. computational linguistics (lexicology; morphology; syntax;
      semantics).



Any paper related to cognitive semantics and computational linguistics=20
is welcome.


Note: We invite *original* papers (i.e. work not previously submitted,=20
in submission, or to be submitted to another conference during the=20
reviewing process).

Other tracks at FLAIRS that may be of interest to those submitting to=20
this track include *Cognition and AI: Capturing Cognitive Plausibility=20
and Informing Psychological Processes, Applied Natural Language=20
Processing (http://tinyurl.com/kwwzs8)* in a total of 14 special tracks=20
that accompany the main conference.

*Submission Guidelines** for the track* Interested authors (for the
general track or the special topic) should format their papers
according to AAAI formatting guidelines
http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php. The papers
should be original work (i.e., not submitted, in submission, or
submitted to another conference while in review). Papers should not
exceed 6 pages (2 pages for a poster) and are due by November 23^rd ,
2009. For FLAIRS-23, the 2010 conference, the reviewing is a double
blind process. Fake author names and affiliations must be used on
submitted papers to provide double-blind reviewing. Papers must be
submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system, which can be
accessed through the main conference web site
(http://www.FLAIRS-23.info). Note : do not use a fake name for your
EasyChair login - your EasyChair account information is hidden from
reviewers. Authors should indicate the special track for submissions.
*The proceedings of FLAIRS will be* *published by the AAAI*. Authors
of accepted papers will be required to sign a form transferring
copyright of their contribution to AAAI. An author of each accepted
paper is required to register, attend, and present the paper at
FLAIRS.  Please, check the website http://www.flairs-23.info/ for
further information.

*Conference Proceedings*
Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the=20
conference proceedings, which will be published by AAAI Press.
