Full Title: Arena Romanistica 


Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 01-Feb-2010 

Arena Romanistica welcomes contributions for our next issue where we will
focus on professional communication and terminology in Romance languages.
New questions have been raised while many fundamental problems are still
unresolved in this subject field. We would like this issue to reflect the
current tendencies of research from theoretical, methodological and
practical perspectives. Topics can be, but not limited to, the following:

-	term variation, motivation and other linguistic features
-	indeterminacy and vagueness
-	knowledge representation and communication
-	technology and databases
-	domain loss and language planning 

of professional communication within Romance Languages as well as between
Romance languages and other languages of any specialized field, from hard
science to humanities, biomedical sciences to different crafts, law to
business administration, etc. Metareflections on professional communication
and terminology are also highly welcomed.

For our open section we also welcome contributions related to philology,
linguistics, literature and culture in Romance languages. 

Deadline for submission of papers: 1 February 2010
Stylesheet and submission procedures are available at our website:
http://arenaromanistica.uib.no
