Established late 2005, Arena Romanistica aims to be a refereed and

Romanistica. The papers should reflect upon current research in the field

The tools of corpus linguistics represent a growing field in linguistics.

languages but also valuable methodological and theoretical advances for
linguistics in general. 
Papers should preferably be written in French although we will consider
Spanish and English submissions. 
Deadline for submission of papers:  1st October 2006.

Papers will be reviewed anonymously by a panel of peer reviewers and will
