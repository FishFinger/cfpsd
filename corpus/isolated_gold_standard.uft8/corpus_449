I'd be interested in hearing how Google is going to stop people from 
recreating texts.  My gut feeling is that Google is in the wrong on this 
one.

An anecdote: My old professor of Religious Studies, Martin Abegg, used 
precisely such a concordance to piece together the corpus of Dead Sea 
Scrolls for his Ph.D dissertation.  A private paper concordance had been 
produced by the team in charge of publishing the scrolls; a few copies of 
that concordance were lent to various institutions.  The one that he used 
was freely available on the stacks of the library at Hebrew Union College. 
I remember how he told us that the reason he used the concordance to piece 
together the texts was because he needed just one text, an unpublished one, 
for his dissertation.  After he had assembled the entire corpus of texts 
known at that time, he was strongly encouraged by various people to publish 
all of them, which he eventually did.  He was sued, if memory serves 
correctly, in both an Israeli court and an American one, but I cannot recall 
the outcome of either case.  (Eventually, things worked out for him, as he 
ended up compiling the index volume to the official publication series some 
years later.  A young undergrad, I was paid to check the English 
transliteration of names for the volume.)  Anyway, good luck--and be 
careful.
