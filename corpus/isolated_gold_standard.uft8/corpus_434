- Program Co-Chairs -

Toru Ishida (Kyoto University, Japan),

Susan R. Fussell (Carnegie Mellon University, USA), 

Piek TJM Vossen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

The main theme of this workshop is intercultural collaboration, from both
technical and socio-cultural perspectives. Topics will include
collaboration support, such as natural language processing, Web, and
Internet technologies, social psychological analyses of intercultural
interaction, and case studies from activists working to increase mutual
understanding in our multicultural world. Submissions will be considered
for papers, panels, demonstrations, and posters.

Papers: 
Papers are solicited on any aspect of intercultural collaboration. 
Papers can address technologies to support cross-cultural collaboration,
laboratory and field studies of cross-cultural collaboration, and case
reports from field workers.  Examples of suitable paper topics include:
- Multi-lingual dictionaries and translations,
- Computer supported intercultural collaboration,
- Internet and Web technologies for intercultural collaboration,
- Cases of intercultural collaboration using IT,
- Field studies of cross-cultural teamwork,
- Ubiquitous/ambient technologies for intercultural collaboration,

Submit your abstract (ascii text, 300 words or less) and full paper (PDF)
written in English, by e-mail to iwic2007@khn.nict.go.jp. Full papers
should be submitted camera-ready in Springer Lecture Note Series (LNCS) format.
Please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer Web
page: <http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html>. 
Submitted full papers should be 12 to 15 pages long in the LNCS format.
Surface mail and e-mail addresses should be included for all contributing
authors.

Panels: 
Individuals may submit proposals for panels of three or four talks on a
related theme in intercultural communication.  Panel submissions should be
no more than four pages in length. They will not be archival, so panelists
may discuss previously published work.  Submissions should provide each
panelist's background and contact information, as well as a brief statement
of his or her position on the panel theme.  

Demonstrations: 
Individuals may submit proposals to present demonstrations of new
technologies for intercultural communication.  Demonstration proposals
should be no more than four pages in length. They should clearly describe
the motivation for the tool and how it will be demonstrated at the workshop.

Demonstration descriptions will not be archival; therefore, demonstrations
can include both previously published work and work that is not yet ready
for publication.

Posters:
Individuals may submit proposals to present informal posters during the
workshop.  Poster proposals should be no more than four pages in length and
summarize the poster content.  Poster descriptions will not be archival;
therefore, posters can describe both previously published work and work
that is not yet ready for publication. 

Review Process:
Submitted papers, panels, and demonstrations will be reviewed by a panel of
distinguished researchers in the area of intercultural communication.

Deadline for abstracts: September 1st, 2006
