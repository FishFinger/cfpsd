              What to Do with a Million Books:
Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science.

                    Call for Submissions
                 Deadline: August 31, 2006

Sponsored by the Humanities Division at the University of Chicago
and the College of Science and Letters at the Illinois Institute of
Technology.

Chicago, November 5th & 6th, 2006

The goal of this colloquium is to bring together researchers and
scholars in the Humanities and Computer Sciences to examine the
current state of Digital Humanities as a field of intellectual
inquiry and to identify and explore new directions and perspectives
for future research.

In the wake of recent large-scale digitization projects aimed at
providing universal access to the world's vast textual repositories,
humanities scholars, librarians and computer scientists find
themselves newly challenged to make these resources functional and
meaningful.

As Gregory Crane recently pointed out (1), digital access to "a
million books" confronts us with the need to provide viable solutions
to a range of difficult problems: analog to digital conversion,
machine translation, information retrieval and data mining, to name a
few. Moreover, mass digitization leads not just to problems of scale:
new goals can also be envisioned, for example, catalyzing the
development of new computational tools for context-sensitive
analysis. If we are to build systems to interrogate usefully massive
text collections for meaning, we will need to draw not only on the
technical expertise of computer scientists but also learn from the
traditions of self-reflective, inter-disciplinary inquiry practiced
by humanist scholars. If we do not, we run the risk of having our
interaction with these resources defined by technical and commercial
interests alone.

The book as the locus of much of our knowledge has long been at the
center of discussions in digital humanities. But as mass digitization
efforts accelerate a change in focus from a print-culture to a
networked, digital-culture, it will become necessary to pay more
attention to how the notion of a text itself is being re-constituted.
We are increasingly able to interact with texts in novel ways, as
linguistic, visual, and statistical processing provide us with new
modes of reading, representation, and understanding. This shift makes
evident the necessity for humanities scholars to enter into a
dialogue with computer scientists to understand the new language of
open standards, search queries, visualization and social networks.

Digitizing "a million books" is thus not only a problem for computer
scientists. Tomorrow, a million scholars will have to re-evaluate
their notions of archive, textuality and materiality in the wake of
these developments. How will the humanities scholar and the computer
scientist find ways to collaborate in the "Age of Google?"

Invited Speakers:

Greg Crane (Professor of Classics, Tufts University) has been engaged
since 1985 in planning and development of the Perseus Project, which
he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. Besides supervising the Perseus
Project as a whole, he has been primarily responsible for the
development of the morphological analysis system which provides many
of the links within the Perseus database.

Ben Shneiderman is Professor in the Department of Computer Science,
founding Director (1983-2000) of the Human-Computer Interaction
Laboratory, and Member of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies
and the Institute for Systems Research, all at the University of
Maryland. He is a leading expert in human-computer interaction and
information visualization and has published extensively in these and
related fields.

John Unsworth is Dean of the Graduate School of Library and
Information Science and Professor of English at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to that, he was on the faculty at
the University of Virginia where he also led the Institute for
Advanced Technology in the Humanities. He has published widely in the
field of Digital Humanities and was the recipient last year of the
Lyman Award for scholarship in technology and humanities.
