Large linguistically interpreted corpora play an increasingly
important role for machine learning, evaluation, psycholinguistics as
well as theoretical linguistics. Many research groups are engaged in
the creation of corpus resources annotated with morphological,
syntactic, semantic, discourse and other linguistic information for a
variety of languages.  In the tradition of previous LINC
(http://www.delph-in.net/events/05/linc/) and Frontiers
(http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/Frontiers_Workshop.html) workshops, we
aim to bring together these activities in order to identify and
disseminate best practice in the development and utilization of
linguistically interpreted corpora.

The goals of the workshop are two-fold: (1) to exchange and propagate
research results with respect to the annotation, conversion and
exploitation of corpora taking into account different applications and
theoretical investigations in the field of language technology and
research; and (2) work towards a consensus on issues crucial to the
advancement of the field of corpus annotation. In particular, we would
like to focus on questions like:

 - How can a system developer take advantage of the multitude of
  annotation efforts with completely different underlying assumptions,
  annotation schemata, etc.?

 - How might one merge different annotation of the same data into one
  single unified representation?

 - How can closely related schemes be applied across languages?

The workshop will include presentations of long (8 page) and short (4
page) papers, invited presentations by "working groups", as discussed
below, followed by an open discussion. All papers should use the same
formating guidelines as ACL (http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au).  It is
not necessary to make the corpus itself anonymous, just the authors.

Long papers on any aspect of linguistically interpreted corpora
including:

 - creation of practical annotation schemes
 - efficient annotation techniques
 - automation of corpus annotation
 - tools supporting corpus conversions
 - validation including consistency checking of corpora
 - browsing corpora and searching for instances of linguistic
 - phenomena
 - interpretation of quantitative results
 - automatic induction of linguistic competence through machine
learning techniques.
 - application of the same linguistic schema to multiple languages

Short papers on these same topics. However, preliminary work and pilot
studies will also be considered.

There will be a few invited "working group" presentations. Each
working group will consist of a group of researchers with the
expressed purpose of laying out the dimensions of some crucial problem
facing the field of corpus annotation, particularly problems involving
merging annotation and extending annotation to new languages, genres
and modalities. The actual final inventory of working group topics
will appear on our website within the next month. Our preliminary
topics include:

 - A roadmap of the compatibility of current annotation schemes with
   each other. This will include a discussion of how they should be
   expected to be compatible, e.g., for the past 50 years, a partial
   alignment between surface and predicate/argument relations has
   been assumed

 - A discussion of low density languages and the problems associated
   with them (resource limitation, segmentation issues, spelling
   variation, etc.)

 - A discussion how the concept of "level of representation"
   (semantic level, surface level, etc.)  applies to annotation.

We will attempt to lay out clearly and precisely the assumptions on
such topics held by members of the annotation community and in doing
so, we hope to both: (1) lay the foundations for the meaningful
integration of annotation resources; and (2) assess the limitations of
integrated approaches.

We will also be giving an Innovative Student Annotation Award to one
student presenter -- please indicate if your paper is a student
paper. This includes waiving of the workshop fee for one student.


WORKSHOP WEBSITE: http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~tim/events/frontiers2006/

TARGET AUDIENCE: Those interested in creating and using existing and
future annotated corpora. This includes annotators, lexicographers,
system developers and those designing NLP system evaluation tasks for
the NLP community.


SUBMISSIONS

Long paper submissions should not exceed 8
pages in length and short papers should not exceed 4 pages. Format
requirements will be the same as for full papers of ACL 2006. See
http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au for style files.

For details of the submission procedure, please consult the submission
webpage reachable via the workshop website.

Please indicate:
1) long or short paper;
2) choose all applicable paper categories from the following list:
syntax, semantics, predicate-argument structure, morphology, anaphora,
discourse;
3) indicate the language(s) your work applies to, e.g., those being
annotated as well and those you plan to annotate in the future.


LANGUAGE: All papers must be written and presented in English
