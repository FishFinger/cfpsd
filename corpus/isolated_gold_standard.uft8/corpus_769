                         Workshop on Matching and Meaning:
         Automated development, evolution and interpretation of ontologies

                      http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/wmm-2010

              31st March 2010, part of AISB'10 Convention, Leicester, UK


OVERVIEW

The problem of semantic misalignment - of two (or more) systems failing 
to understand one another when their semantic representation is not
identical - occurs in a huge variety of areas: the Semantic Web,
databases, natural language processing; anywhere, indeed, where
semantics are necessary but centralised control is undesirable or
impractical.  In highly dynamic domains, where interactions are between
a large, diverse and evolving community, there is a need for the
resolving of these misalignments - through developing and evolving
existing ontologies or interpreting unknown ontologies in terms of
known ones - to be done automatically and on-the-fly.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
the problems of automated development, evolution and interpretation of
ontologies in the many different domains in which it occurs. We are
primarily interested in the exchange of ideas and the stimulation of
debate, and the workshop is intended to be a forum for researchers to
present ongoing work and ideas and to engage in discussion with other
researchers from the field. We are particularly interested in novel
ideas and innovative research, which may be in its early stages, and
encourage reports on work in progress.

Topics of interest include:

      * Ontology evolution
      * Ontology matching and alignment
      * Ontology versioning
      * Representational or structural change
      * Formal aspects of ontology dynamics
      * Formalisation of and reasoning with contexts
      * Foundational issues
      * Social and collaborative matching
      * Background knowledge in matching
      * Extensions to ontology languages to better support change
      * Non-monotonic reasoning for ontologies and the Semantic Web
      * Inconsistency handling in evolving ontologies
      * Uncertainty in matching
      * Change propagation in ontologies and metadata
      * Ontologies for dynamic environments
      * Dynamic knowledge construction and exploitation
      * Matching for dynamic applictions (e.g., p2p, agents, web-services)
      * Case studies, software tools, use cases, applications
      * Open problems


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We encourage the submission of extended abstracts of 2-5 pages that
discuss ongoing research, problem descriptions and overviews of the
domain. Accepted papers will be included in the AISB 2010 proceedings
unless the authors prefer them not to be (for example, if the work is
very similar to work presented elsewhere which they nevertheless feel
it would be valuable to present in this context, or if the work is at
a stage where discussion would be valuable but publication would be
premature). Authors wishing their submissions to be included in the
convention proceedings must follow the style guide on the convention
website.

Submissions will be subject to light reviewing, mainly intended to
check fit to workshop.

Abstracts should be submitted electronically in pdf format to
mchan-at-ed.ac.uk by 18th December 2009. Notification of acceptance
will be sent to the submitting author on 15th February 2010.


VENUE

The workshop will take place at De Montfort University in Leicester,
as part of the AISB 2010 Convention
(http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb10/), from March 31st to 1st
April, 2010. All workshop participants must be registered for the AISB
2010 Convention. Registration for this workshop is included in the
convention registration fee.


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission: Friday, 18th December 2009
Notification: Monday, 15th February 2010
Workshop: 31st March - 1st April 2010
AISB10 Convention: 29th March - 1st April 2010


PROGRAMME

Presentations: Authors of accepted abstracts will give presentations of
their work; exact times to be decided.

Posters: If it is not possible to fit in presentations for all accepted
authors, some may be asked to present posters instead. There will be a
session of 5 minute poster talks.

Panel: The technical programme will end with a 90 minute panel
discussion on a topic of mutual interest to be decided. Three speakers
will speak for 10 minutes each with a brief to stimulate debate during
the remaining 60 minutes. Discussion amongst all participants, rather
than question-and-answering for the panel, will be strongly encouraged.
