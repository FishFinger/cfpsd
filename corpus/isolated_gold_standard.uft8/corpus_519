Subject: Japan: First International Workshop on Intercultural Collaboration
        (IWIC 2007) -- CFP
Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1153943710.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>


CALL FOR PAPERS

The First International Workshop on Intercultural Collaboration (IWIC
2007)
http://langrid.nict.go.jp/iwic2007/
January 25-26, 2007
Kyoto University Clock Tower International Conference Hall, Japan

Program Co-Chairs
Toru Ishida (Kyoto University, Japan)
Susan R. Fussell (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)
Piek TJM Vossen(Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands)

The main theme of this workshop is intercultural collaboration, from
both
technical and socio-cultural perspectives. Topics will include
collaboration support (such as natural language processing, Web, and
Internet technologies), social psychological analyses of intercultural
interaction, and case studies from activists working to increase
mutual
understanding in our multicultural world. Submissions will be
considered for
papers, panels, demonstrations, and posters.

This is a unique workshop in a world where physical borders disappear
rapidly and people and cultures are more and more on the move and in
contact. The workshop will feature four prominent invited speakers:

Christiane D. Fellbaum (Department of Psychology, Princeton
University)
Yumiko Mori (NPO Pangaea)
Gary Olson (School of Information, University of Michigan)
Wolfgang Wahlster (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence)

Papers: Papers are solicited on any aspect of intercultural
collaboration.
Papers can address technologies to support intercultural
collaboration,
laboratory and field studies of intercultural collaboration, and case
reports from field workers. Examples of suitable paper topics include:

- Field studies of intercultural teamwork
- Cases of intercultural collaboration using IT
- Computer supported intercultural collaboration
- Internet and web technologies for intercultural collaboration
- Ubiquitous/ambient technologies for intercultural collaboration
- Multilingual dictionaries and translations
- Multilingual NLP web services
- Standardization issues on resources and tools for multilingual
- processing
- Usability of multilingual resources and the Language Grid

Submit your abstract (ascii text, 300 words or less) and full paper
(PDF)
written in English, by e-mail to iwic2007[at]khn.nict.go.jp.
Full papers should be submitted camera-ready in Springer Lecture Note
Series
(LNCS) format. Please follow the instructions for authors available at
the
Springer Web page:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. Submitted
full papers should be 12 to 15 pages long in the LNCS format. Surface
mail
address, e-mail addresses should be included for all contributing
authors.
The post-proceedings of IWIC will be published as a volume of
Springer LNCS.

Panels: Individuals may submit proposals for panels of three or four
talks
on a related theme in intercultural communication. Panel submissions
should
be no more than four pages in length. They will not be archival, so
panelists may discuss previously published work. Submissions should
provide
each panelist's background and contact information, as well as a brief
statement of his or her position on the panel theme.

Demonstrations: Individuals may submit proposals to present
demonstrations
of new technologies for intercultural communication.  Demonstration
proposals should be no more than four pages in length. They should
clearly
describe the motivation for the tool and how it will be demonstrated
at the
workshop. Demonstration descriptions will not be archival; therefore,
demonstrations can include both previously published work and work
that is
not yet ready for publication.

Posters: Individuals may submit proposals to present informal posters
during the workshop.  Poster proposals should be no more than four
pages in
length and summarize the poster content.  Poster descriptions will not
be
archival; therefore, posters can describe both previously published
work and
work that is not yet ready for publication.

Review Process: Submitted papers, panels, and demonstrations will be
reviewed by a panel of distinguished researchers in the area of
intercultural communication.

Important Dates:
Deadline for abstracts: September 1st, 2006
Deadline for papers, panels, posters and demos: September 15th, 2006
Author notification: November 1st, 2006
Deadline for camera ready papers: December 1st, 2006
Deadline for camera ready post-proceedings papers: March 1st, 2007

Travel Support: We provide limited financial support to students and
other
researchers who are co-authors of accepted papers to give their
presentation
at the workshop. Instructions on how to apply for a grant will be
provided
with acceptance notifications.
