WORKSHOP: NEWS, (NEW) MEDIA, AND CORPORA: FROM METHODOLOGY TO THEORY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Giessen,  May 26 2009

To be held in conjunction with ICAME 2010

TOPIC
The focus of this pre-conference workshop will be on a set of topical issues
pertaining to corpus-based studies on the language of news, including both
printed and broadcast news.
So far, corpus studies in this context have focused mainly on written media
and on the language of newspapers in particular. While not disregarding
these studies, the workshop is intended to also address the interplay of
different media in the actualization of news on television, radio and on the
Internet. For example, we will also look at blogs, podcasts, vodcasts, and
video sharing from a corpus-linguistic perspective.

Papers (20 mins + 10 mins discussion) are invited, mainly focusing on
methodological and theoretical issues concerning two lead questions: =

* How can corpora and corpus-linguistic methods be applied to the study of
news in old and new media, including the wide range of Internet-based
communication?
* How do corpora and corpus-linguistic methods have to change to come to
grips with this new multi-modal scenario?


DEADLINE
The deadline for the submission of abstracts (max 400 words) is 20 December
2010. Please indicate your name and affiliation, your snail mail and email
address on the abstract and send it as a Word document to:
roberta.facchinetti@univr.it

NOTIFICATION of acceptance will be sent out by 31 January 2010.
