Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and 
Effective Practices
A book edited by Dr. Diana Perez-Marin and Dr. Ismael Pascual-Nieto
Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain

We cordially invite you to submit a chapter for the forthcoming 
Conversational Agents and Natural Language Interaction: Techniques and 
Effective Practices book to be published by IGI Global 
(http://www.igi-global.com/requests/details.asp?ID=754)

-------------
Introduction
-------------
Human-Computer Interaction can be understood as two potent information 
processors (a human and a computer) trying to communicate with each
other using a highly restricted interface. Natural Language (NL) 
Interaction, that is, to let the users express in natural language could 
be the solution to
improve the communication between human and computers. Conversational 
agents exploit NL technologies to engage users in text-based 
information-seeking and task-oriented dialogs for a broad range of 
applications such as e-commerce, help desk, Web site navigation,
personalized service, and education.

The benefits of agent expressiveness have been highlighted both for 
verbal expressiveness and for non-verbal expressiveness. On the other 
hand, there
are also studies indicating that when using conversational agents mixed 
results can appear. These studies reveal the need to review the research 
in a
field with a promising future and a great impact in the area of 
Human-Computer Interaction.

-----------------------
Objective of the Book
------------------------
The main objective of the book is to identify the most effective 
practices when using conversational agents for different applications. 
Some secondary
objectives to fulfill the main goal are:
- To gather a comprehensive number of experiences in which 
conversational agents have been used for different applications
- To review the current techniques which are being used to design 
conversational agents
- To encourage authors to publish not only successful results, but also 
non-successful results and a discussion of the reasons that may have
caused them

------------------
Target Audience
------------------
The proposed book is intended to serve as a reference guide for 
researchers who want to start their research in the promising field of 
conversational
agents. It will not be necessary that readers have previous knowledge on 
the topic.

Recommended topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Fundamental concepts
- Definition and taxonomy of conversational agents
- Motivation, benefits, and issues of their use
- Underlying psychological and social theories
2. Design of conversational agents
- Techniques
- Frameworks
- Methods
3. Practices
- Experiences of use of conversational agents in:
- E-commerce
- Help desk
- Website navigation
- Personalized service
- Training or education
- Results achieved
- Discussion of the reasons of their success of failure
4. Future trends
- Issues that should be solved in the future
- Expectations for the future

-----------------------
Submission Procedure
-----------------------
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before 
December 16, 2009, a 2-3 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the 
mission and
concerns of his or her proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals 
will be notified by January 16, 2010 about the status of their proposals 
and sent
chapter guidelines. Full chapters (8,00010,000 words) are expected to 
be submitted by April 16, 2010. All submitted chapters will be reviewed 
on a
double-blind review basis. Contributors may also be requested to serve 
as reviewers for this project.
