Second Call For Papers

NEW FRONTIERS IN BIOMEDICAL TEXT MINING

A Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing Session
January 3-7, 2007
Grand Wailea Resort, Wailea, Maui, Hawaii
http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-nlp.html

IMPORTANT DATES

    Paper submissions due:		July 17, 2006
    Notification of paper acceptance:	September 6, 2006
    Final paper deadline:			  September 25, 2006
    Meeting dates:
    January 3-7, 2007

TOPICS

Papers are invited on the topic of text data mining in its strictest
sense: providing users with information not explicitly stated in
text. Work submitted to this session will be required to be more
ambitious with respect to either theory or reach than the entity
identification, information extraction, and information retrieval
projects that comprise most work in biomedical language processing.

We especially solicit work in the following areas:

 o Question answering
 o Summarization
 o Mining data from full text including figures, tables, and images
 o Coreference resolution and normalization
 o User-driven systems, including user needs, user model, interactive
   systems, and user interfaces for biomedical language processing
 o Evaluation: test collections and evaluation methods

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

 o All papers must be submitted to Russ Altman in PostScript (.ps),
   Adobe Acrobat (.pdf), or Microsoft Word (.doc) format. Adobe
   Acrobat
   is preferred.

 o Attached files should be named with the last name of the first
   author (e.g. altman.ps, altman.pdf, or altman.doc). Hardcopy
   submissions or unprocessed TeX or LaTeX files will be rejected
   without review.

 o Every paper must be accompanied by a cover letter which must
 include
   the following:
    - The email address of the corresponding author
    - The specific PSB session that the paper should be considered for
    - A statement that the submitted paper contains original,
      unpublished results, and is not currently under consideration
      elsewhere
    - A statement that all authors concur with the contents of the
      paper

 o Submitted papers are limited to twelve (12) pages in the PSB
   publication format.

 o Please format your paper according to the instructions found at
   http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/psb-submit/.

 o If figures cannot easily be resized and placed precisely in the
   text, then it should be clear that with appropriate modifications,
   the total manuscript length would be within the page limit.

 o Color pictures can be printed at the expense of the authors.
   The fee is $500 per page of color pictures, payable at the time of
   camera-ready submission.

 o Contact Russ Altman (russ.altman@stanford.edu) for additional
   information about paper submission requirements.
