Meeting Description:

Seminar S.62: New Developments in Digital Resources for Researching and Tea=
ching
Scottish Language and Literature

Convenors
John Corbett (University of Glasgow, Scotland) j.corbett@englang.arts.gla.a=
c.uk;
Marina Dossena (Universit=E0 di Bergamo, IT) marina.dossena@unibg.it=20

Call for Papers

Papers are invited exploring recent developments in the use of corpus
linguistics and other electronic resources to teach and research Scots, Sco=
ttish
English and Ulster-Scots. Papers may address literary and/or non-literary t=
exts,
and cover the periods of Older Scots (pre-1700) and Modern Scots (post-1700=
).=20

Possible issues might include:
- the structure and development of Scots/Scottish English digital resources
(corpora, dictionaries, thesauri, grammars, electronic editions, etc.);
- the interplay between different digital resources;
- research findings derived from the use of digital resources;
- teaching applications of such tools;
- the use of such tools in language planning and promotion.

Procedure for submitting proposals for papers:

Those wishing to participate in the Conference are invited to submit 200-wo=
rd
abstracts of their proposed papers directly to all convenors of the panel i=
n
question before 31 January 2010. The convenors will let the proponents know
whether their proposals have been accepted by no later than 28 February 201=
0.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral
presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply read=
ing
their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced versions of the pa=
pers
are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in question. Th=
ere
will be a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar session, and conveno=
rs
should plan so that there is time for discussion between speakers and with =
the
audience. It is possible that we may be able to extend some seminars over t=
wo
sessions, but this is very much dependent on the proposals received and on =
the
way the programme as a whole develops, and cannot be determined until after=
 all
convenors have reported to the Academic Programme Committee in February.

ESSE members (or other participants) can only make one paper proposal per
conference. Organising Committees should ensure that this is implemented. T=
hose
giving lectures might be encouraged to be respondents in Seminars or to
participate in Round Tables. A speaker at a Seminar can participate in a Ro=
und
Table or be the co-convenor in a different Seminar.
