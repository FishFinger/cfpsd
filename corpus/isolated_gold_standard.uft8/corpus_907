Meeting Description:

Lancaster University will be hosting the 4th International Conference on Bantu 
Languages from Monday 22nd to Friday 26th March 2010.

This is the fourth conference in a series of international conferences that is
meant to cover all the Bantu languages, and seeks to promote the exchange of
ideas between specialists in particular Bantu languages and general linguists
with an interest in Bantu. With over 400 languages, the Bantu family provides a
rich field for descriptive, comparative and theoretical linguistic studies. We
welcome contributions on all aspects of Bantu linguistic research, see the call
for papers for details. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts are invited for presentations at the conference, addressing any aspect
of the description or analysis of Bantu languages and linguistics such as:
- Syntax
- Morphology/morpho-syntax
- Semantics and pragmatics
- Phonetics and phonology
- Typology
- Language contact (pidgins and creoles, borrowing, code-switching, etc.)
- Sociolinguistics
- Language documentation
- Language technology
- Historical linguistics
- Language and development
- Textual and discourse studies

We particularly welcome papers which combine theoretically motivated analysis 
with the description of new or lesser known aspects of Bantu languages.

Time for presentations is 30 minutes including discussion.

Abstracts, written in English or French, should be no longer than one page A4,
including data and references, with 2.5 cm margins and font size no smaller than
12 point. Please send two copies of your abstract. One of these should be
anonymous, and one should include your name, affiliation and email at the top of
the page, directly below the title.

Abstracts may be submitted electronically, preferably as PDF, RTF, or MS Word 
attachment (email address: Bantu4Conference@gmail.com. Abstracts must reach the
organizers by Tuesday, 15 December 2009.
