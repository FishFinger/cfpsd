Full Title: 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics 
Short Title: ACL07 

Date: 24-Jun-2007 - 29-Jun-2007
Location: Prague, Czech Republic 
Contact Person: Annie Zaenen
Meeting Email: zaenen@parc.com
Web Site: http://www.aclweb.org/acl2007/ 

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 23-Jan-2007 

Meeting Description:

Annual meeting of the ACL. 

ACL-07 Preliminary Call For Papers

General Conference Chair:
-John Carroll (University of Sussex, UK)

Program Co-Chairs:
-Annie Zaenen (PARC, U.S.A.)
-Antal van den Bosch (Tilburg University, The Netherlands)

Local Organization Chair:
-Eva Hajicova (Charles University, Czech Republic)

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites the submission of papers
for its 45th Annual Meeting. Papers are invited on substantial, original, and
unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics, including, but
not limited to: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon;
phonetics, phonology and morphology; lexical semantics and ontologies; word
segmentation, tagging and chunking; parsing; generation and summarization;
language modeling, spoken language recognition and understanding; linguistic,
psychological and mathematical models of language; document retrieval, question
answering, information extraction, and text mining; machine learning for natural
language; corpus-based modeling of language, discourse and dialogue;
multi-lingual processing, machine translation and translation aids; multi-modal
and natural language interfaces and dialogue systems; applications, tools and
resources; and evaluation of systems.

Requirements:

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed work
rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion
of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation results
should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality,
technical strength, significance and relevance to the conference, and interest
to the attendees.

A paper accepted for presentation at the ACL Meeting, including ACL-related
workshops and conferences, cannot be presented or have been presented at any
other meeting with publicly available published proceedings. Papers that are
being submitted to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the
title page, as must papers that contain significant overlap with previously
published work.

Reviewing:

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed by an
international Conference Program Committee consisting of Area Chairs and
associated Program Committee Members. Final decisions on the technical program
will be made by a meeting of the Program Co-Chairs and Area Chairs. Each
submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. 

Submission Information:

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should
not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use
of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's
conference. A previous version is available at
http://www.aclweb.org/acl2007/styles/. Please, check the website for possible
changes before submitting your paper. A description of the format is also
available in case you are unable to use these style files directly. Papers must
conform to the official ACL-07 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to
reject submissions that do not conform to these styles including font size
restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names and
affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other references (e.g. to
projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal the author's identity should
be avoided.  For example, instead of ''We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'',
write ''Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...''.

Submission will be electronic, using the paper submission software that will be
accessible through the conference web page. The only accepted format for
submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no later than 5pm US
Eastern time January 23, 2007 (10pm GMT January 23, 2007). Papers submitted
after that time will not be reviewed. Pleaseconsult the submission web page for
details of the submission procedure. Questions regarding the submission
procedure should be directed to the Program Co-Chairs (zaenen@parc.com or
antal.vdnbosch@uvt.nl ).

Deadlines:

Paper submission deadline: January 23, 2007

Notification of acceptance: March 30, 2007
Camera ready papers due: May 4, 2007

ACL-07 Conference: June 24 - 29, 2007

Mentoring Service:

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from regions of the
world where English is not the language of scientific exchange. Many authors
from these regions, although able to read the scientific literature in English,
have little or no experience in writing papers in English for conferences such
as the ACL meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential
mentors will be identified by Florence Reeder (Mitre, USA), who has agreed to
organize this service for ACL-07. If you would like to take advantage of the
service, send a draft of your paper to:

Florence Reeder freeder@mitre.org.

To take advantage of this service, send the paper electronically to the above
email address, using pdf, ps or doc format. The paper should arrive before
December 15, 2006. An appropriate mentor will be assigned to your paper and the
mentor will get back to you by January 15, 2007, at least seven days before the
deadline for the submission to ACL-07 program committee. Please note that this
service is for the benefit of the authors as described above. It is not a
general mentoring service for authors to improve their papers.''

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send a message
to Florence Reeder.

Site:

The conference is organized by the Charles University (''Univerzita Karlova'')
in Prague, Czech Republic, the oldest University in Europe to the north of the
Alps (founded in 1348). It will take place in the TOP HOTEL Praha
(http://www.tophotel.cz/en), located in the quiet neighborhood of the Prague 4
district, only 15-20 minutes from the historic center of Prague. The hotel can
accommodate up to 1000 participants on-site (with a small number of dormitory
rooms available nearby). The hotel offers one auditorium, three large lecture
rooms, number of smaller rooms for tutorials and workshops, several restaurants
and cafes and lot of open air space for walks and informal discussions. The
conference banquet and a conference concert will take place in the historic
buildings in the city center - one in the Municipal Hall (built in the
Art-nouveau style of the early 20th century) and the other in the 14th century
main University Hall.

Prague, being in the center of Europe (only 3-hour drive from Vienna or Budapest
or 4 hours from Berlin or Munich), is easily reachable by car, bus or train from
Central Europe, by cheap flights from the rest of Europe, and by several direct
flights from overseas. Czech Air (CSA), the official carrier of the conference,
a member of the Skyteam alliance (with Delta, Continental, Northwest, Air
France, Korean Air and others), will offer discount on its own direct flights
from New York and Singapore and other destinations in Europe.
