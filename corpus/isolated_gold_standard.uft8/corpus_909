Call for Papers
Special Issue On 'Current Developments In Form-Focused Interaction And
Second Language Development'

The Canadian Modern Language Review (CMLR) invites manuscripts to be
considered for a special issue on 'Current developments in form-focused
interaction and second language (L2) development' to appear in September
2010. Form-focused interaction is defined here as any attempt to draw
learners' attention to linguistic forms in the context of communicative
interaction, including various forms of corrective and interactional
feedback. Much of the published research in this area to date has been
descriptive, often concentrating on the existence of corrective feedback in
conversational interaction. Fewer studies have explored the exact
mechanisms whereby interactional feedback facilitates L2 acquisition. For
this special issue, we invite submissions that examine more directly the
contributions of form-focused interaction to L2 development. Our aim is to
present the latest developments in this area from both theoretical and
pedagogical perspectives. We welcome articles in English or French
presenting original research on all aspects of form-focused interaction in
either instructed or uninstructed contexts, targeting L2 development in any
language. Papers submitted should be of interest to CLMR's readers by
presenting results that might be applicable in the Canadian learning and
teaching context. Submitted articles will be subject to the normal peer
review process of the CMLR.=20

Please visit the submission guidelines at the following link for
information on manuscript length, the mandate of the journal, and other
aspects of submission:
http://www.utpjournals.com/cmlr/CMLR_submission_guidelines.pdf

Final deadline for submissions: December 20th, 2009

Submissions should be sent electronically either through PReSTO:
http://www.utpjournals.com/cmlr/cmlrpresto.html=20
or by email to:=20
cmlr@utpress.utoronto.ca
Receipt of all manuscripts will be acknowledged within a week of their arri=
val.
