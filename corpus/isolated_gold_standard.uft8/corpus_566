Meeting Description:

AnÃ¯Â¿Â½la and GAL are pleased to announce:

Applied Linguistics: A New Generation
International Research Meeting for Junior Applied Linguists

January 24-26, 2007; University of Groningen, the Netherlands
www.anela.nl/juniorresearchmeeting 

Final Call for Papers

For more than 10 years, AnÃ¯Â¿Â½la, the Dutch affiliate of AILA, has been organizing
the so called 'junior days' to which beginning researchers, PhD students, and
graduate students are invited to present their work in an informal and
supportive setting. These meetings have been very successful over the years,
providing beginning researchers the opportunity to present their work on an
academic forum and to receive valuable feedback. 

Stimulated by suggestions from the AILA International Committee, AnÃ¯Â¿Â½la and GAL,
the German affiliate, have now planned to organize a joint International
Research Meeting for Junior Applied Linguists, aiming at an international
exchange of ideas and a stimulation of contacts between European affiliates of
AILA. Interaction with and feedback from both junior and senior researchers is
highly emphasized.

We invite junior researchers to submit abstracts for thirty-minute oral
presentations and/or poster presentations describing original work addressing
topics from one of the following fields of applied linguistics:

-Language development;
-Language in the community;
-Language in education;
-Language in professional settings.

Possible topics range from first and second language acquisition, literacy
development and language disorders to language variation and linguistic
discrimination, multilingualism and intercultural communication and from
language conflict, language policy and language planning to language and
communication in politics and by audiovisual- and virtual means. 

We are happy to announce our keynote speakers:
 
Jan Hulstijn
Department of Second Language Acquisition, University of Amsterdam

Eva-Maria Jakobs
Institut fÃ¯Â¿Â½r Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft, RWTH Aachen University

Language choice for abstracts and presentations is free. Abstracts can be
submitted through the website: www.anela.nl/juniorresearchmeeting.
