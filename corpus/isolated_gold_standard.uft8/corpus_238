Call for Papers

Time Frame:
We ask potential participants to send us their provisional titles and short
descriptions no later than 12 November  so as to allow us to submit to the SLE
Scientific Committee the workshop proposal, including a preliminary list of
participants and a short description of their topics, before 15 November  2009. 

All abstracts should be submitted by the end of December to the submit abstract
form to be found at the SLE website.

Description:
Evidentiality defines a functional-conceptual domain pertaining to the cognitive
and/or communicative ground (e.g., hearsay, perceptual evidence or reasoning
leading to different kinds of inferences) on the basis of which the speaker
makes a statement. Languages have several means for encoding the source of
evidence for a judgment; e.g., Germ. sollen as a hearsay auxiliary, Engl.
apparently, be supposed to or parenthetical it seems as markers of
perception-based inferences or hearsay. The encoding of evidentiality can be
arranged along a lexicon-grammar cline ranging from grammatical markers (bound
affixes, e.g. Turk. -mI?, or functional extensions of tense, mood or aspect
paradigms) via auxiliaries (see above) toward functional lexemes such as
particles (e.g. Russ. budto by, vrode), complementisers (Pol. jakoby etc.) or
adpositional phrases (headed, e.g., by Germ. laut, zufolge). 

As a categorial distinction, evidentiality has become a subject of research in
both functional and formal linguistic frameworks. With evidentiality studies
proliferating, there is a need for a more unified and verifiable theoretical
framework (see Mainz workshop 2009). Such a framework involves several ongoing
tasks: 

(i) on what functional criteria are evidentiality and its subfunctions best
delineated? 
(ii) how can conflations of evidential and epistemic function be described and
explained? 
(iii) how are various markers of evidentiality to be distinguished along a
lexicon-grammar cline, and how are these distinctions related with their
structural and distributional properties? 
(iv) which procedures allow to distinguish stable semantic components from
pragmatically triggered ones? 
(v) along which diachronic paths do evidential markers develop? 
(vi) which are the specific discourse conditions favouring the evolution of
evidential markers, and how are they distributed over genres and registers? 

An appropriate joint treatment of these six issues provides an integrated
approach to evidentiality marking.

The proposed workshop aims at further disentangling the research lines involving
the above-mentioned questions and, by doing so, is concerned with research
directed toward an integrative theory of the marking of evidential functions. It
is a follow-up of previous workshops (see Lund 2005, at SLE 2006, Bremen, and at
the DGfS-meeting 2008, Bamberg), but first of all of the workshop Database of
evidential markers in European languages (Mainz University 2009), as it pursues
the aim of further elaborating on theoretical and technical details needed to
establish a database of evidential markers in European languages. During the
Mainz workshop a preliminary version of the database was defined, the template
of entries was agreed upon and participants started using it with a sample of
markers of their respective languages. The proposed SLE workshop will present
new data and new problems arising from them.

Accordingly, we will give clear preference to talks that contribute not only to
an empirical corroboration of details concerning any one of the six theoretical
issues (or combinations thereof) mentioned above, but also to their treatment in
the database. Data need not be restricted to European languages, although these
are considered as the primary target.

For more information on the criteria and the labels used in the database, please
send a message to <mailto:evidentials@gmail.com>.
