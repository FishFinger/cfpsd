Meeting Description:

The goal of the event is to inform researchers as to the current projects a=
nd
studies that identify, investigate, and (attempt to) resolve issues that re=
late
to morphological analysis and generation, as well as provide researchers th=
e
opportunity to meet, interact and present their work among the broader comm=
unity
of NLP researchers.=20

Call for Papers

Knowledge Sharing Event -1

The development of core technologies has an important role to play within t=
he
context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Morphological Analysis and
Generation are important components for building computational grammars. As
small parts of NLP, Analysis and Generation allow for greater efficiency an=
d
accuracy in the development of various language applications.

Extensive work is being carried out in the area of NLP, both, in India and
abroad, towards building high quality analysers and generators for various
languages. Building analysers and generators demands the synergy of theoret=
ical
analysis and processing of language; which poses a wide range of challenges=
 both
linguistically as well as computationally.

The Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDC-IL), CIIL, Mysore,=
 is
organising a two day event which aims to provide a platform for researchers=
 in
this area to bring together diverse contributions from theoretical and
computational linguistics, which explore newer approaches to morphological
analysis and generation, and thereby share their experiences and learn from=
 one
another.

Abstracts of no more than 500 words (including references) mentioning the t=
itle
of the paper, author(s) name, institutional affiliation, and email address
should be submitted by the due date in *.rtf or *.pdf format to the followi=
ng
email address: ldc-monaparakh@ciil.stpmy.soft.net.

Important Dates (Extended)

Last date for submitting the Abstract: 22nd November, 2009
Abstract acceptance notification: 29th November, 2009
Last date for submitting full length Papers: 31st December, 2009

Minimal financial support for travel shall be provided to the authors of a =
few
selected papers.
