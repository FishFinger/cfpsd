(Please see the Call for Events Proposals in the conference Web page for mo=
re
information).


The submission of a paper implies that the paper is original and has
not been submitted under review or copyright protected by the author if
accepted. Besides papers in regular sessions, papers in special
sessions are also invited to provide forums for focused discussions on
new topics and innovative applications of established approaches. A
special session consists of at least four related papers. Proposals for
special sessions including the session organizers, author names, paper
titles, abstracts, and brief statements on the purposes of the sessions
must be submitted to by May 1, 2006.

All papers should be submitted electronically via Online Paper
Submission System.

http://isda2006.ujn.edu.cn/isda/author/submit.php

The format of the initial submissions can be PDF, MS
Word, or Postscript. The file of the final accepted papers should be in
either Word or Latex.

All submitted papers will be refereed by at least THREE experts in the
respective
fields according to the criteria of originality, significance, quality,
and clarity. The authors of accepted papers will have an opportunity to
revise their papers and take consideration of the referees' comments
and suggestions, before submitting the final papers.


All accepted papers with paid registration will be included in the
Proceedings of ISDA2006, to be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
