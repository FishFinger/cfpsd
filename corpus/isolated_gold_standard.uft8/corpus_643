Subject: Rochester: NAACL HLT 2007 - Call for Workshop Proposals
Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1158183464.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>



HLT-NAACL 2007 
Call for Workshop Proposals 

Proposals are invited for the Workshop Program for HLT-NAACL 2007, to
be held at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York on April
22-27, 2007; the workshop dates are April 26 and 27, 2007.

HLT-NAACL 2007 continues the combination of the Human Language
Technology Conferences (HLT) and North American Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) Annual Meetings
begun in 2003. Human language technology incorporates a broad spectrum
of disciplines working towards enabling computers to interact with
humans using natural language, and providing services such as speech
recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text
summarization, and information extraction. For further information on
the main conference, please see
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/

TOPICS OF INTEREST

  Topics of interest for the workshops include those described in the
Call for Papers for HLT-NAACL07.  Extra consideration will be given to
workshops that are likely to be of interest to more than one of the
NLP, Speech and IR communities. We therefore encourage workshop
proposers to include in their proposals a description of how their
workshop will appeal to more than one community.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

We recognize that a growing number of workshops invite participation
in a shared task, i.e., a workshop where a set of training and later
test data is distributed and some or all of the workshop participants
attempt the same task, e.g., reference resolution or machine
translation.  The workshop committee encourages proposals for
workshops with shared tasks, which may be submitted at any time prior
to the deadline. The workshop committee will make every attempt to
provide early notification of proposal acceptance for workshops with
shared tasks, so that task data sets can be distributed as soon as
possible.

Proposals for workshops should contain:

  - A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic
    and content. If the workshop is part of a series, please list
    previous
    workshops.

  - The desired workshop length (one or two days), and an estimate of
    the audience size.

  - The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
    the organizers, with one-paragraph statements of their research
     interests and areas of expertise.

  - A list of potential members of the program committee, with an
    indication of which members have already agreed.

  - A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.

  - A description of special requirements for technical needs
    (computer  infrastructure, etc.)

Proposals should be submitted, by the date shown below, using the
START conference reviewing system.  The link to the submissions is
available on the conference web site at
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/meetings/hlt-naacl07/ Proposal format may
be in (ASCII) text, HTML, or PDF.

PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS

Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no later
than October 14, 2006. In order to make sure that workshops, once
accepted, proceed in a timely manner, we require that the workshop
Call for Papers be distributed no later than October 17, 2006. If the
workshop organizers wish, they may vet their CFP's with the workshop
chairs, but in any case the final version must be submitted for
publication no later than October 17th.

We also strongly suggest that the submission deadline for papers be
set no later than January 18, 2007, in order to allow enough time for
reviews and the submission of revised versions of the accepted papers.
The workshop organizers can use the START conference management
package to handle paper submissions and reviewing.

Accepted workshop organizers must provide descriptions of their
workshops for inclusion in the conference registration material by
February 22, 2007. The description must be provided in two formats: an
ASCII version that can be included with the email announcement, and an
HTML version that can be included on the conference home page.

The final workshop materials must be received by the Publications
Chair by
approximately March 5, 2007 (this date is tentative and subject to
change).

Individual workshop organizers must provide the final camera ready
copy for their ENTIRE workshop to the publications committee.  Each
workshop chair is expected to independently produce their workshop
proceedings, mirroring the way the Publications Committee will produce
the main conference proceedings.  Each workshop chair will receive a
"recipe" for preparing their proceedings once the workshop proposals
are accepted, with assistance from the Publications Committee.  Each
workshop chair will be ultimately responsible for their respective
camera-ready versions, which the Publications Chair will simply pass
on to the publisher.


FINANCES

Workshops must be financially self-supporting. The conference
organizers will establish workshop registration rates so as to provide
the room, audio-visual equipment, internet access, snacks for breaks,
and the workshop proceedings.

In the case of ACL SIG workshops, specific policies on sponsorship
and financial support appears at
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/index-policies.html
