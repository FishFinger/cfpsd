Hard Deadline for Abstract Submission : May 30 2006
============================================================

14th International Conference on

COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

(CoopIS 2006)

Montpellier, France, Oct 29 - Nov 3, 2006

http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf

Acceptance rate of CoopIS'05 and CoopIS'04 was approx. 1/5

Proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag

The Cooperative Information System (CIS) paradigm encompasses the 
technological
infrastructure (e.g., Middleware, Web technologies, and Business Process 
Management) to
support a diversity of application areas (e.g. e-Business, e-Commerce, 
e-Government,
e-Health, networked and virtual enterprises). The paradigm involves 
interconnected networks
of information systems that manage large amounts of possibly 
heterogeneous information and
computing services and cooperate as-needed to fulfil their mission.

The CoopIS conference series has established a prestigious international 
forum for exchanging
ideas and results on scientific research from a variety of Computer 
Science areas, such as CSCW,
Internet data management, electronic commerce, human-computer 
interaction, workflow management,
agent technologies, and software architectures, to name a few.

As in previous years, CoopIS'06 will be part of a joint event with two 
other conferences,
Distributed Object and Applications (DOA) and Ontologies, Databases and 
Applications of
Semantics (ODBASE).

The technical programme for the three conferences will be organized 
within the global
theme "On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems". All three events 
will be
hosted in Montpelier, France from October 29 to November 3, 2006. More 
details about
the federated event can be found at http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf

CoopIS'06 is intended to provide a platform for a useful exchange 
between researchers
and practitioners, and to foster the cross-fertilization of ideas. 
Topics that are
addressed by this conference are logically grouped in four broad areas 
and include but
are not limited to:

     * Business Process Modeling and Management
           o Business Process Integration and Management
           o Distributed Workflow Management and Systems
           o Web services, business processes and web services choreography
           o Integrated supply chains
     * Advanced Middleware and Architectures
           o Advanced middleware architectures
           o Federated and distributed systems and architectures
           o Semantic interoperability
           o Model driven architectures
           o Multi-agent systems and architectures for CIS
           o Peer-to-peer and grid technologies
           o Enterprise Grids architectures and services
           o Markets, auctions, exchanges, and coalitions
           o Self-adapting systems
           o Concurrent engineering and distributed groupware frameworks
           o Collaboration and negotiation protocols
           o Matchmaking, and brokering
           o Security and privacy in CIS
     * Information Services and Modeling
           o Software and information services for CIS
           o Web information systems and service
           o Multi-modal delivery mechanisms and protocols for CIS 
applications
           o CIS applications, modeling and software development techniques
           o Customization of information systems
           o Enterprise knowledge management
           o Data and knowledge modelling
     * CIS Applications
           o CIS applications for e-business, e-commerce, e-government
           o Medical and biological information systems
           o CIS in the telecommunications industry
           o Other industrial applications of CIS

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Papers submitted to CoopIS'06 must not have been accepted for 
publication elsewhere or be
under review for another workshop or conference.

All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, 
significance, technical
soundness, and clarity of expression. All papers will be refereed by at 
least three members of
the program committee, and at least two will be experts from industry in 
the case of practice
reports. All submissions must be in English. Submissions must not exceed 
18 pages in the final
camera-ready paper style. Submissions must be laid out according to the 
final camera-ready
formatting instructions and must be submitted in PDF format.

The paper submission site is located at:

http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/coopis/2006/papers/

The final proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag as LNCS 
(Lecture Notes in Computer Science).
Author instructions can be found at:
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Failure to comply with the above formatting instructions for submitted 
papers will lead to the
outright rejection of the paper without review.

Failure to commit to presentation at the conference automatically 
excludes a paper from the
proceedings.
