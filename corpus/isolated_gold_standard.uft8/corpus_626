2nd call for papers

RIAO 2007 Large-Scale Semantic Access to Content (Text, Image, Video
and Sound) - 8th Conference - May 30 to June 1, 2007 Pittsburgh, PA,
USA

RIAO'2007 will be held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, USA from May 30 through June 1, 2007. The RIAO
conferences, organized by the "Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationales
d'Informatique Documentaire - C.I.D., treat robust and large-scale
scientific and industrial solutions to information processing. This is
the 8th RIAO after conferences in Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988),
Barcelona (1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997),
Paris (2000), and Avignon (2004).

The conferences are composed of peer-reviewed scientific sessions and
demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and advanced
research prototypes.

Scope of the Conference
      

Papers are invited on recent, substantial, original and unpublished
research that has been validated to the level of the creation of a
functioning prototype. We are interested in large-scale solutions to
the problem of accessing the semantic content found in unstructured
text, images, video and audio. Submissions should describe solutions
to these problems from the following perspectives:

    * Automatic indexing of video, images, and speech
    * Improved indexing of text, image, video and sound
    * Ontologies and unstructured data
    * Semantic Web and Ontologies for Full-Scale Information Retrieval
    * Automatically producing textual descriptions of images
    * Automatically adding metadata to video and sound
    * Indexing and retrieval of mixed-media documents
    * Indexing interactive documents
    * Natural interface dialogue
    * Multimedia question answering systems
    * Competitive Intelligence
    * Intelligent Search Agents
    * Multimodal search
    * Architectures for semantic treatment of very large databases
    * Algorithms for semantic treatment of very large databases
    * Comprehension-based question answering and summarization
    * Cooperative indexing between media
    * Semantics for less studied languages
    * Semantic representations and standards
    * Collaborative construction of semantic resources
    * Indexing multilingual collections
    * Automatic extraction of ontologies from unstructured data
    * Aligning multilingual ontologies
    * Language resources for multimedia indexing
    * Extracting semantic resources from raw data
    * Semantic annotation of blogs and videoblogs
    * Exploiting large-scale resources for e-learning
    * Structuring cultural heritage
    * Technological, commercial, industrial watch systems
    * Semantic access to large and open archives


  
Paper Submission

      

We welcome submissions both from the research community and industry
concerning the main conference theme of treating the semantic content
of large quantities of text, images, videos, and sound.

Submitted papers should describe original work, emphasizing completed
or well advanced, rather than intended, research. The state of
completion of the reported work must be clearly indicated. Where
appropriate, results should be rigorously evaluated; the assessment of
statistical significance for quantitative results is encouraged.

Submissions should contain original material that has not been
previously presented to the scientific community. A parallel
submission for other publication or a significant overlap in contents
with previously published work should be clearly indicated to the
program committee.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee
members. The submissions will be judged on originality, relevance,
technical quality, and presentation.

Papers must be submitted on the conference's web site:
http://www.riao.org/cyberchair/cyberPapers/

Papers can be submitted in two categories: long papers or short
papers. Full papers are appropriate for describing substantial
research with well-evaluated results and short papers will typically
describe ongoing research and preliminary results. All accepted papers
in both categories will be published in the conference proceedings. At
the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short
papers will be presented as a poster.

Long papers must not be more than 20 pages (on one column,
single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an
abstract. Short papers must not be more than 6 pages (on one column,
single-spaced, using Times font 12 points), starting with an
abstract. Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format or in PDF.

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees
and through the CID after the conference.
