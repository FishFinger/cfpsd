** CALL FOR PAPERS **

CLAW 2006: 5th International Workshop on Controlled Language
Applications

Location: Boston Marriott, Cambridge, MA, USA
Sponsor:  2006 Conference of the Association for Machine Translation
in the
Americas (AMTA 2006)
Website: AMTA2006 website: http://amta2006.amtaweb.org/index.htm
Dates: Saturday, August 12, 2006, (day after AMTA2006 main conference)

CONTEXT

The 5th International Workshop on Controlled Language Applications
(CLAW) is
planned to be held 29-30 April 2000 as a 1-day post-conference
Workshop in
conjunction with the AMTA2006 (Association for Machine Translation in
the
Americas) conference in Cambridge, MA, USA at the Boston Marriott.

For information on the past four CLAWs:

CLAW96   http://www.ccl.kuleuven.ac.be/CLAW/Welcome.html
CLAW98   http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/CLAW98/
CLAW2000 http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/~veronis/claw2000/
CLAW2003 http://www.eamt.org/eamt-claw03/


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Of interest are submissions on all topics relating to the design,
implementation
and application of controlled languages, including but not limited to:
human
communication protocols; controlled text authoring; conformance
checking
systems; controlled language authoring aids; memory-based authoring;
(re-)authoring combined with translation; issues in Controlled
Language design;
industrial experience and evolving requirements; quality and usability
evaluations of controlled language.

On the research front, we are grappling with issues like
standardization,
design, and evaluation of controlled language systems. On
implementation
issues, we are particularly interested in studies regarding author
productivity
and document usability. The workshop will give equal emphasis to the
academic,
corporate and industrial perspectives, while bringing together
researchers,
developers, users, and potential users of controlled language systems
from
around the world.


WORKSHOP FORMAT

The one-day workshop will feature paper presentations.
