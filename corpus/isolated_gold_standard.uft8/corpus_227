Call for Papers

Time Frame:
The workshop proposal, including a preliminary list of participants and a t=
hree
line description of their topics, should be submitted to the SLE organizers
before November 15, 2009. Therefore we ask potential participants to send u=
s the
provisional titles and short descriptions of their presentations no later t=
han
November 12.

Abstracts should be submitted by the end of December.

Recent decades show an increase in contact studies, while genealogical stud=
ies
seem to loose in interest. However, contact linguistics and genealogical
linguistics are no antonyms: they complement each other.

Shared properties between languages may have arisen independently in each o=
f
them by chance or nature, they may be copied or diffused between them, or t=
hey
may have arisen only once, when the languages were one and the same. Chance
explanations can be ruled out by regularity and paradigmaticity. And, viola=
tions
of the arbitrary relationship between sound and meaning can often be unmask=
ed at
face value. It is much more difficult, however, to distinguish between copi=
es
and cognates. A major obstacle for the establishment of language families a=
nd
the reconstruction of proto-languages is the fact that copies are often mis=
taken
for cognates.

Going beyond the concept of basic vocabulary on which lists of copy-proof
meanings, such as the Swadesh list or the Leipzig list, are based, we would=
 like
to organize a panel on the stability and copiability of bound morphology. A=
s a
result of the marked difference in the ease of linguistic borrowing between
grammar and lexicon and between bound and free morphemes, bound morphology =
is
held to be one of the most fruitful parts of language structure when it com=
es to
the distinction between copies and cognates.

The goal of the workshop is to discuss a hierarchy of morphological copiabi=
lity
and to work out criteria to distinguish between cognates and copies in boun=
d
morphology. The approach is empirical. We welcome comparisons of borrowed a=
nd
inherited morphology in a particular group of languages that display contac=
t in
their family as well as typological contributions that compare borrowing
patterns with genealogical patterns in a cross-linguistic sample of languag=
es.=20

Specific issues to be addressed include, among others:
- Are there any constraints on morphological borrowing?
- Is it possible to copy processes of grammaticalization?=20
- Is agglutinative morphology more copiable than fusional morphology?
- Is derivational morphology more copiable than inflectional morphology?=20
- Is nominal morphology more copiable than verbal morphology? Is there an
inequality for different parts of speech when it comes to morphological bor=
rowing?
-Is there an inequality for different verbal categories when it comes to
morphological borrowing?
- Are there universal tendencies that allow predictions about the stability=
 of
structural features in morpho-syntax?
- Is shared paradigmatic morphology a conditio-sine-qua-non for genealogica=
l
relationship?
- Is it possible to establish linguistic relationship on the basis of share=
d
morphology alone?=20
- Should phonological comparison always precede morphological evidence in
matters of genealogical relationship?
- Is it possible to find tendencies or to set up criteria to distinguish be=
tween
cognates and copies in bound morphology?
