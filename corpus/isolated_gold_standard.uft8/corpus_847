International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management

EKAW 2010

Lisbon, Portugal, 11th October-15th October 2010

http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt

The 17th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and
Knowledge Management is concerned with all aspects of eliciting,
acquiring, modeling and managing knowledge, and its role in the
construction of knowledge-intensive systems and services for the
semantic web, knowledge management, e-business, natural language
processing, intelligent information integration, etc.

The focus of the 17th edition of EKAW will be on "Knowledge Management
and Engineering by the Masses".

The call for papers in PDF available at
http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/docs/cfpEkaw2010.pdf

Important dates

* Submission: 19th of March 2010
* Notification: 14th of May 2010
* Camera Ready: 11th of June 2010

Organizing Committee

* General and PC chairs:
- Sofia Pinto (INESC-ID, Lisbon)

* Tutorial chair:
- Victoria Uren (University of Sheffield)

Demonstration chairs:

EKAW 2010 will also feature a tutorial and workshop program, as well
as a poster and demo track. Poster/demo notes and workshop/tutorial
notes will be published separately in a companion booklet.

Paper submission and reviewing for EKAW 2010 will be electronic via
the EasyChair conference submissions site. Submissions should be 15
pages long (max) formatted according to Springer Verlag LNCS
guidelines.

As an important difference to earlier conferences, EKAW will accept
different types of papers. The papers will all have the same status
and follow the same formatting guidelines in the proceedings but will
receive special treatment during the reviewing phase. In particular,
each paper type will be subject to own evaluation criteria. The PC
will also make sure that there is a reasonable balance of the paper
types accepted. At submission time the paper has to be clearly
identified as belonging to one of the following categories.

A) Standard research papers

These are "standard" papers presenting a novel method, technique or
analysis with appropriate empirical or other types of evaluation as
proof-of concept. The main evaluation criteria here will be
originality, technical soundness and validation.

B) In-use papers

Here we are expecting papers describing applications of knowledge
management and engineering in real environments. Applications need to
address a sufficiently interesting and challenging problem on real and
large datasets, involving many users etc. The focus is less on the
originality of the approach and more on presenting real, large-scale
and complex systems that solve a significant problem. Technical
details to understand how the problem is solved are
required. Evaluations should involve real users of a system rather
than representing a pure academic exercise.

The papers will be evaluated according to the significance and
practical relevance of the described research as well as with respect
to the technical soundness of the described solution and accompanying
evaluation.

C) Problem Analysis papers

We invite researchers to also publish problem analysis papers which do
not present any novel method, technique or approach to solving a
problem, but help to understand the problem itself. Understanding the
characteristics of a problem itself is an important task in research
and can benefit many people working on the same or at least similar
problems. We expect in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain
phenomenon or problem, with clear definitions as well as qualitative
and quantitative analyzes of the main characteristics of the
problem. We also expect a reasonable review of the state-of-the-art
stating in how far current solutions fall short. Papers will mainly be
evaluated with respect to how general and technically sound their
problem analysis is and how useful it will be for other researchers
working on the same problem. We expect that such papers will guide
future research by highlighting critical assumptions, motivating the
difficulty of a subproblem or explaining why current techniques are
not sufficient, all corroborated by quantitative and qualitative
arguments. Evaluation criteria will also include appropriate
categorization of the problem area and description of present
solutions and approaches; and appropriate description of the
limitations of the present solutions and approaches.

D) Validation papers

A fundamental characteristic of research is that it should be
reproducible. In some disciplines, reproduction of results by others
is a basic research activity. We would like to encourage researchers
to reproduce and validate methods, results and experiments
etc. proposed by others before in a new context or application, on new
datasets, under new assumptions etc. The goal is clearly to reach
interesting and significant new conclusions about the method/approach
in question that warrant a stand-alone publication. The reproduction
of results should thus lead to new knowledge about the method in
question or reveal inherent problems in the assumptions of the
original research or limitations of previous solutions. Papers will be
evaluated with respect to the soundness of the rationale for
reproducing a certain approach as well as with respect to the new
knowledge that is generated by reproducing the approach in question. A
clear comparison between the results obtained through the reproduction
and the original results are mandatory.
