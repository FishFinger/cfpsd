                         Final CALL FOR PAPERS

              Cross-Language Knowledge Induction Workshop

    International Workshop held as part of the Eurolan 2005 Summer School
                    25 July - 6 August, 2005,
             "Babes-Bolyai" University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania

Workshop website:
http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~diana/Eurolan2005KnowledgeInductionWorkshop.htm

The dates of the workshop are August 2,3,4. See 
http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/eurolan2005/ for updated schedule.

Knowledge of words and text behavior in other languages has recently
been used to help solving tasks in a first language. An example of such
a task is word sense disambiguation by using translations in a second
language. Another example is verb classification by studying properties
of verbs in several languages.

A second modality of knowledge transfer across languages is to take
advantage of resources already built for English and for a few other
resource-rich languages. These resources have been used to induce
knowledge in languages for which few linguistic resources are available.
This was made possible by the wider availability of parallel corpora
(better alignment methods at paragraph, sentence, and word level).
Examples of knowledge induction tasks are: learning morphology,
part-of-speech tags, and grammatical gender. The development of wordnets
for many languages used as a starting point knowledge transfer from the
Princeton WordNet.

This workshop will provide a forum for discussion between leading names
in the field and researchers involved in cross-language applications. We
would like to invite researchers, master and Ph.D. students, to submit
their original and unpublished work to the workshop.

Special consideration will be given to papers for which one of the
languages involved in the knowledge transfer is an East-European
language. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* applications that exploit parallel corpora (aligned at paragraph,
sentence, or word level).
* induction of knowledge from a language for which resources are
abundant to another language for which fewer resources are available.
* using other languages to solve a task in a first language:
  - word-sense disambiguation by using translations in other languages.
  - verb classification by studying verb properties in several languages.
  - other tasks of this kind
* identifying and using cognate words between languages.
* building wordnets by knowledge transfer.
* exploiting multi-language wordnets for NLP applications.
