Call for Paper

Call for Abstracts for a special session: NLP for the Social Sciences

In recent  years, the field of natural language processing  (NLP) has
experienced a renewed interest  in the analysis of non "factual" discourse,
which is characterized by the presence of affective language, sentiments,
opinions, feelings, believes, and manifestations of emotional states, and w=
hich
is charged with subjectivity. There are not only interesting theoretical is=
sues
which deserve scientific study such as what makes a discourse subjective, o=
r how
to discriminate between emotional states in text or speech, but also practi=
cal
applications (e.g., dialogue systems, question answering, summarization,
extraction) may benefit from those studies. Thus, we are calling for
contributions which will bring together the areas of Natural Language Proce=
ssing
and the Social Sciences.

Main Topics:
- Natural Language Processing in Psychology
- Electronic Language Resources for the Social Sciences (e.g., dictionaries=
,
lexicons, grammars) =20
- Natural Language Processing of non-factual Discourse
- Natural Language Processing in the analysis of Political Discourse=20
- Automatic Analysis of Emotional Discourse
- Automatic Detection of Sentiments and Opinions
- Other topics related to the study and application of NLP to psychology an=
d
more generally the social sciences

Format of Submission:
At this stage we are soliciting abstracts (in pdf)  of between 1000-1500 wo=
rds.
The abstract should include:
- Title
- Authors and affiliations
- Contact e-mail
- 1000-1500 words (about 4 pages) including text, figures, and tables
- References

Language of the abstract: English or Spanish

Detailed submission instructions will be specified together with notificati=
ons
to the authors.

Workshop Dates: 10th May-14th May 2010.
