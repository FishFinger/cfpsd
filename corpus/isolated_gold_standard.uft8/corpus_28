Call
Prosody has certainly been one of the most popular components of language
and speech within not only language sciences, but also parent disciplines
such as psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics. Prosody thus constitutes a
new linguistic dimension which paves the way for an increased knowledge of
language and its uses, captured by the general notion of discourse. This
symposium aims at questioning which theoretical and methodological
frameworks would be most likely to favour an integrative approach of the
relations of prosody to discourse. More precisely, our objective is to
focus on the modelling of these relations, taking into account both
experimental and theoretical perspectives. In this context, conceptions of
the relations of prosody to discourse as a complex interface, and not
simply as binary interactions (prosody/syntax or prosody/semantics) will
be favoured. Communications will consist in invited, oral and poster
presentations.

Themes
	Syntax, macrosyntax and discourse
	Discourse semantics and pragmatics
	Discourse prosody

Both theoretical and empirical propositions are welcome.
