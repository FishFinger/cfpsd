================================================================================
:: 1. Comments from the General Chair
================================================================================

COLING/ACL 2006 is the joint conference of the International Committee
on
Computational Linguistics and the Association for Computational
Linguistics. The conference was held in Sydney, Australia, from 17-21
July
2006, with tutorials on July 16, workshops on July 22-23, and
co-located
events on July 15-16 and July 22-23.

In this joint conference we tried to maintain the spirit of both
COLING and
ACL, but the combination had its own personality, in a mixture that
was more
than the simple sum of the two. Part of its character was due to the
location,
for the first time -- for both conferences -- in Australia. For this
reason we
decided to have a member of AFNLP (the Asian Federation of Natural
Language
Processing) on the Advisory Board and to give particular attention and
visibility to the Asia-Pacific context, communities and languages. We
sincerely thank both the AFNLP-Nagao Fund for providing financial
support for
those presenting Asian NLP research, and ALTA (the Australasian
Language
Technology Association) for their local support.

It is my task here -- but I should say my pleasure -- to express
gratitude to
all those without whom this conference would not have existed, and I
think I
can do that on behalf of all participants.

My biggest thanks go to all the Chairs, for their invaluable effort
and
dedication which made this Conference possible.  First of all the two
Program
Chairs: Claire Cardie and Pierre Isabelle, who did a tremendous job,
managing
so many submissions and taking care of both regular papers and
posters, and
the two Local Arrangements Chairs: Robert Dale and Cecile Paris, who
succeeded
in keeping so many details under control, in such a smooth way as if
everything were natural and effortless for them.

And all the others, for their precious, competent and hard work

I warmly thank the Advisory Board -- composed of four ICCL, four ACL,
and one
AFNLP members -- to whom we resorted for suggestions on important and
sometimes delicate issues: Sandra Carberry, Eva Hajicova, Aravind
Joshi,
Martin Kay, Kathleen McCoy, Martha Palmer, Priscilla Rasmussen,
Benjamin
T'sou, Jun'ichi Tsujii.

I express my gratitude to all the sponsors for their great support to
the
conference.  

I thank all the organizers of the so numerous surrounding workshops,
tutorials, and other co-located events -- conferences, workshops,
summer
school -- adding value to the main conference, creating altogether
probably
the biggest ever happening in Computational Linguistics.  

My thanks to the area chairs, the reviewers, the invited speakers, the
authors
of the various presentations, in particular the students who enter
with
enthusiasm in such an exciting field, all the participants who in many
cases
made a long trip to be present at COLING/ACL 2006, and all those who
contributed in many ways to a success of the conference.  

And I finally thank both ICCL and ACL for having decided to join
forces again
in such a great enterprise.  COLING/ACL 2006 was, I'm sure, an
exciting,
stimulating and inspiring event for all those who attended.

Finally, as part of the conference's Asian Language focus, four papers
were
identified by the program and area chairs as contenders for the Best
Asian
Language Paper Award.  These papers were presented in a special
parallel
session:

  "Tree-to-String Alignment Template for Statistical Machine
  Translation", by
  Yang Liu, Qun Liu, Shouxun Lin

================================================================================
:: 4. Lifetime Achievement Award
================================================================================

The ACL Lifetime Achievement Award was instituted on the occasion of
the 40th
anniversary meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics. The
award is for scientific achievement, of both theoretical and applied
nature,
in the field of Computational Linguistics. The executive committee of
the ACL
nominates and selects at most one award recipient annually,
considering the
originality, depth, breadth and impact of the entire body of the
nominee's
work in computational linguistics. The recipient is invited to give a
speech
on the topic of their choice relating to Computational Linguistics at
the
annual meeting. 

One of the highlights of COLING/ACL 2006 was the presentation of the
2006 ACL
Lifetime Achievement Award to:

  Eva Hajicova

The following is an excerpt from the introduction made by Jun'ichi
Tsujii
(president of the ACL) at the COLING/ACL 2006 award ceremony.



I first met Eva, 26 years ago, at Coling in Tokyo, 1980.

I had just started my career as researcher then, while she was already
an
established researcher, a member of ICCL (International Committee of
Computational Linguistics) and the representative, the banner carrier
of the
legendary Prague school of linguistics. Prague is the birth place of
modern
scientific linguistics, formal theory of discourse, and dependency
representation.

She started her career 40 years ago, and has successfully represented
the
Prague school together with Professor Petr Sgall. Throughout her
career, she
has been successful in leading the Prague school of linguistics and
making it
the Prague School of Computational Linguistics, one of the most
influential
centers of Computational Linguistics, always a front-runner of new
ideas, in
particular, in semantics and pragmatics.

She not only inherited the strong tradition of the Prague school in
linguistics, but also, under the communist regime, despite the harsh
restrictions on communication with the outside world, spread the
Prague way of
thinking on language to researchers outside, and has extended it in
accordance
with development of the fields.

One of her recent accomplishments, the Prague dependency treebank, is
a good
example of the combination of deep theoretical thinking nourished in
the tradition
of the Prague school, with the modern methodology of our days.

It consists of surface and deep annotations,analytical and
tectogrammatical
levels, for Czech, English, and Arabic.  This effort has been
extremely
influential in that it represents one of the major annotation efforts
in
dependency syntax.

Furthermore, it was conceived from the beginning as a multi-layer
annotation
that goes beyond morphology and surface syntax.  The Prague Dependency
Treebank is used for linguistic research, and as the basis for machine
learning experiments in computational linguistics.

She is certainly one of the people who have defined and formed the
field of
computational linguistics, and has developed it to the scientific
field as we
know it now.  She has successfully injected the unique perspective of
the
Prague school, European tradition of linguistics, into our field,
Computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

Without her, with the long period of the dark age in the region, we
would have
lost one of the greatest traditions in European linguistics which has
enriched
enormously our fields.
 
I remember her lectures on multi-layered representation including
discourse
structures, and their Machine Translation research at Kyoto University
in
Japan, some 20 years ago.

Her talks struck me by their strong intellectual, theoretical
orientations,
since MT research in Japan at the time was taken mostly as engineering
endeavor, very much concerned with engineering issues such as
efficiency,
management of huge lexicon etc.

Eva's leadership quality has contributed to not only the Prague school
but to
the international movement of our field. She was Chair of European ACL
and ACL
as well as permanent member of International Committee of
Computational
Linguistics.




From the entire computational linguistics community, congratulations
Eva on a
lifetime of achievement!
