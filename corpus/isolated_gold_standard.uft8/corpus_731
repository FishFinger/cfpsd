Journal name: Academic Exchange Quarterly

Editor: Hiroshi Matsumoto, Ph.D. Soka University of America, California

This issue aims to explore useful cutting-edge knowledge of second language
acquisition and pedagogy among East Asian languages and students. It will
examine the process of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (as a second) language
acquisition among American students as well as ESL (English as a second
language) acquisition among students with East Asian backgrounds. Both
quantitative and qualitative studies are welcome. 

More specific topics encompass, but are not limited to, (1) interlanguage
or learner language analysis (such as conversation analysis), (2) input and
interaction, including teacher talk (i.e., the language of instruction that
second language teachers use in the classroom), (3) learner variables (such
as motivation, personality characteristics, age, and learning styles), (4)
pragmatic competence, (5) cultural understanding (or sociolinguistic
competence), (6) grammatical acquisition and form-focused instruction, (7)
vocabulary acquisition, (8) phonetic/phonological acquisition and teaching
pronunciation, (9) task or content-based instruction, (10) language for
specific purposes (LSP) (including science and technology), (11) study
abroad, and (12) teaching listening, speaking, reading, and/or writing skills.

The purpose of this edition is to bring together new findings about second
language acquisition and pedagogy among East Asian languages and students
and, hence, contribute to the enhanced efficacy of their learning and
teaching processes.

teacher educators at all levels. Please identify your submission with
