Starting with the second issue of 2006 (volume 42.2), Language Research 
will adopt substantive changes in its publication schedule and scope. New 
editors and editorial boards will be in place with longer terms of service, and 
the journal will focus on selected areas of linguistics rather than covering the 
full spectrum of languages and linguistics. 

The new editorial policies for the journal effective with volume 42.2 are as 
follows: 

(1) The journal will publish two issues per year, instead of four. Submitted 
papers to the first volume may be in English or Korean. All papers submitted 
to the second volume will be in English. 

(2) The journal will no longer accept papers whose focus is on language 
teaching. Submitted manuscripts should have a focus on linguistics. In 
addition to all subfields within general/theoretical linguistics, papers in 
psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, historical/comparative linguistics, and 
computational linguistics are welcome. Though we see topics in Korean 
linguistics as the main area of concentration for the journal, papers need not 
be restricted to issues related to Korean. 

(3) Manuscripts may be submitted to either the domestic editor/associate 
editor or the international editor/associate editor. Paper or electronic 
submissions (PDF) are welcome. 

(4) No page charges will be levied on submitted manuscripts. The journal will 
offer editorial assistance starting with volume 42.2. 

The newly appointed editors and the editorial board are as follows: 

Editors: 
Domestic - Hyunhee Lee (Dept. of Korean Language and Literature, Seoul 
National University) 
International - James Hye Suk Yoon (Dept. of Linguistics, University of 
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA) 

Associate Editors: 
Domestic - Hee-Rahk Chae (Dept. of Linguistics and Cognitive Science, 
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies) 
International - Stuart Davis (Dept. of Linguistics, Indiana University, USA)
