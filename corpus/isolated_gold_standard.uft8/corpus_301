Full Title: Computational Modelling of Sound Pattern Acquisition 
Short Title: CMSPA 

Date: 13-Feb-2010 - 14-Feb-2010
Location: Edmonton, Alberta, Canada 
Contact Person: Robert Kirchner
Meeting Email: kirchner@ualberta.ca

Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Language Acquisition; Phonetics;
Phonology 

Call Deadline: 20-Nov-2009 

Meeting Description:

Major advances have been made in recent years towards explicit modelling of
phonological acquisition, including increasingly sophisticated OT learning
algorithms, as well as application of general machine learning techniques (e.g.
expectation maximization and maximum entropy learning). At the same time,
evidence of token and type frequency sensitivity in the propagation of both
categorical and gradient patterns in speech has spurred growing interest in
exemplar-based models of acquisition and processing. This workshop aims to bring
together these two strands of research, promoting dialogue between those
pursuing symbolic and subsymbolic approaches to acquisition of the sound
patterns of spoken language. 

Invited speakers will include: Adam Albright (MIT), Michael Becker (Harvard),
Andries Coetzee (Michigan), Robert Daland (UCLA), Bruce Hayes (UCLA), Jeff
Mielke (Ottawa), Ben Munson (Minnesota), James Myers (CCU, Taiwan), Janet
Pierrehumbert (Northwestern), Alan Yu (Chicago).  Titles to be announced. 

Call for Papers

We invite oral and poster presentations from phonologists, phoneticians,
psycholinguists, computational linguists, and speech scientists on this general
theme. Though relevant analytic, programmatic, or experimental presentations are
also welcome, priority will be given to abstracts reflecting original
computational modelling results for some aspect of phonological/phonetic
acquisition. 

Submission: 
Abstracts for oral or poster presentations should be no longer than one page (US
letter or A4, 11 pt, 1 inch margins) with a second page for references, data
and/or figures. 

Abstracts should be emailed as a PDF attachment to phonmod@ualberta.ca,
deadline: midnight (Mountain Time), November 20, 2009. 

Unless the submitter indicates otherwise, the organizers will consider each
abstract's suitability for oral or poster presentation. Authors should include
the title, name(s), and affiliation(s) in the body of the email. 

Funding and Registration Fee: 
The organizers anticipate sufficient funding to cover travel and accommodation
costs (not counting meals) of all presenters whose abstracts are accepted, above
and beyond the invited speakers. There will be a registration fee of $70 ($50
for students) to cover the cost of coffee break refreshments. Late registration
(after Jan. 1, 2010) is $100 ($75 students). Registrants are encouraged to order
tickets for a Saturday evening banquet for an additional $35. All prices are in
Canadian dollars.
