Corpus approaches to the language of literature

CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION

A one-day pre-conference workshop
Corpus Linguistics 2005
14th July 2005
Birmingham University, UK

Workshop website: http://www.corpus.bham.ac.uk/conference/wynnecl2005.htm

Organised by:
Oxford Text Archive, PALA and AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics

** Deadline for proposals: May 6th 2005 **

This workshop features two invited speakers on research at the interface 
between literary study and corpus linguistics:

    * Bill Louw (Harare) on collocation and semantic prosody in 
literature and in corpora;
    * Mick Short (Lancaster) on annotating stylistic features in corpora.

Further contributions and papers are invited, to address one or more of 
the following issues:

    * corpus annotation and analysis of linguistic features in literary 
texts;
    * the study of literary effects in texts by using the evidence of 
language norms in a reference corpus, including the use of collocations, 
colligations and semantic prosody;
    * creativity in language, as identified or analysed with reference 
to corpus evidence;
    * theoretical and practical problems with the use of corpora in 
literary study;
    * resources and techniques for the study of literature using corpora.

Proposals for papers to be presented at the workshop should be between 
250 and 500 words in length, and should be sent to 
martin.wynne@oucs.ox.ac.uk by the deadline of 6th May 2005.

Papers will be assessed for inclusion on the basis of their relevance to 
the above topics. However, there will only be space in this short 
workshop for a maximum of 6 presentations. We hope to have many 
participants in addition to those who are giving papers, so please do 
not feel you have to submit a paper in order to attend. If you submit a 
paper and it is not accepted due to the time restrictions, we very much 
hope that you will still be able to attend and contribute to the discussion.

This is a one-day workshop at the Corpus Linguistics 2005 (CL2005) 
conference. Conference registration is open at the CL2005 website at 
http://www.corpus.bham.ac.uk/conference/. Participants may register only 
for the workshop, but are encouraged to also register for the main 
conference, which will take place 15-17th July. Registration and 
accommodation is organised through the main conference administration.

This workshop is supported by the Poetics and Linguistics Association 
(PALA - http://www.pala.ac.uk), the leading international association 
for stylistics, and is a PALA 25 anniversary event. It is organised by 
the Oxford Text Archive (http://ota.ox.ac.uk/), which hosts AHDS 
Literature, Languages and Linguistics (http://litlangling.ahds.ac.uk/). 
The Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) promotes good practice in 
the creation and use of electronic resources in literary and linguistic 
research, and is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and 
the JISC.
