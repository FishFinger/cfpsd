 TENTH WORKSHOP ON THE SEMANTICS AND PRAGMATICS OF DIALOGUE (SEMDIAL)

			  Potsdam (Germany)
			 September 11-13 2006

brandial06 will be the tenth in a series of workshops that aims to
bring together researchers working on the semantics and pragmatics of
dialogues in fields such as artificial intelligence, formal semantics
and pragmatics, computational linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.
The SemDial conferences are always stimulating and fun, and
Potsdam/Berlin is a great place to visit.

INVITED SPEAKERS: 

- James Allen       (University of Rochester, USA)
- Elisabeth Andre   (University of Augsburg, Germany)
- Manfred Krifka    (Humboldt University and ZAS, Germany)
- Emanuel Schegloff (University of California LA, USA)

SUBMISSIONS:

We invite papers on all topics related to the semantics and
pragmatics of dialogues, including, but not limited to:

- models of common ground/mutual belief in communication
- modelling agents' information states and how they get updated
- multi-agent models and turn-taking
- goals, intentions and commitments in communication
- semantic interpretation in dialogues
- reference in dialogues
- ellipsis resolution in dialogues
- dialogue and discourse structure
- interpretation of questions and answers
- nonlinguistic interaction in communication
- natural language understanding and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems
- multimodal dialogue systems
- dialogue management in practical implementations
- categorisation of dialogue moves or speech acts in corpora
- designing and evaluating dialogue systems

For the first time, we will have a special session (one afternoon), on
  ** Visual Attention and References to the Visual Situation **
chaired by Massimo Poesio and Hannes Rieser. (Committee: Sarah
Brown-Schmidt (University of Illinois at Urbana), John Kelleher
(Dublin Institute of Technology), Pia Knoeferle (University of the
Saarland), Geert-Jan Kruijff (DFKI).) 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): linguistic and
philosophical studies of deixis; eye-tracking studies of reference
resolution in situated language use; and computational models of
deictic references and reference interpretation. As always, especially
encouraged are interdisciplinary submissions, e.g., providing a sound
theoretical analysis based on solid empirical evidence. 

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

Authors should submit an *anonymous* paper of at most 8 pages (for
talks with a duration of 25' plus 10' discussion) via the web-site
(please indicate if you are submitting for the special session).
Please see the website for details on formatting, etc. 
(Submissions are now open!)

Meeting Description:

The conference Syntax and Semantics of Spatial P is organized by UiL OTS, Utrecht University. The conference will be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands from June 2nd to 4th, 2006. We invite abstracts for 40-minute talks with an additional 20-minute discussion.

CALL FOR ELECTRONIC POSTERS

The conference on Syntax and Semantics of Spatial P will take place at the UiL OTS, Utrecht University from June 2nd to 4th, 2006. Its main aim is to stimulate discussion about the category P in a broad sense (prepositions, postpositions, circumpositions, particles, prefixes) from various linguistic perspectives. Abstracts for presentation have been selected and the programme can be found below.

If you wish to attend the conference and participate in the discussion, you are welcome to submit an electronic poster to the conference web site. Electronic posters will be reviewed only for pertinence to the topic of the conference. They should summarize recent work that is unpublished or otherwise not widely known. If published, please include the reference.

Electronic posters should be up to 1000 words (roughly 5 pages), ideally in .html format, or else in .pdf.

Please create a text that is easy to read off the screen, in terms of wording, organization, and typography. Examples and analyses should be presented in their logical order, not on separate pages as in some conference abstracts.

Each poster should start with the name, affiliation, email address, and possibly home page link of the author(s), followed by the title. We will not post submissions that do not contain the author information.

Please email the poster files by May 15th, 2006 to both of the following e-mail addresses:

Anna.Asbury@let.uu.nl
Rick.Nouwen@let.uu.nl

The submissions will be posted on this site soon thereafter and are to be used as potential sources of discussion during the conference.

If you would like to draw attention to a related paper of yours, please post them at your home page and send us an entry consisting of the author(s), the full title of the paper, and the link. Such entries will be posted alongside electronic posters, for the long-term benefit though perhaps not for the immediate edification of participants.

Further details including possible topics as well as information about registration can be found on the conference site:
