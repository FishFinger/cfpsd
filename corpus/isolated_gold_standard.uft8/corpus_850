Call Deadline: 29-Jan-2010

Meeting Description:

Since 1995, the NLDB conference has aimed at bringing together researchers,
industrials and potential users interested in various applications of Natural
Language in the Database and Information System area. Natural Language
Processing has become an important factor in the field of Information and
Communication systems in the last years. It has contributed to both improving
the development process from the viewpoints of the developers (e.g. the process
of requirements engineering, conceptual modelling, validation etc.) and the
usability of applications (e.g. natural language query interfaces, retrieval,
semantic web etc.) 

To underline these inspiring connections, NLDB 2010 will take place from June 23
to June 25 in Cardiff (Wales).
