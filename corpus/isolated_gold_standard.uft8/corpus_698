Full Title: Nordic Journal of Linguistics=20


Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition=20

Call Deadline: 31-Jan-2010=20

Call for papers: NJL Special Issue on the Nordic Languages and Second
Language Acquisition Theory

Deadline for submissions: 31 January 2010

The second issue of Volume 33 (2010) of the Nordic Journal of Linguistics
will be a special issue devoted to the Nordic Languages and Second Language
Acquisition Theory, edited by Ute Bohnacker and Marit Westergaard.=20

The theme of the special issue is intended to solicit contributions on
Nordic languages being acquired as non-native languages as well as work on
Nordic-language native speakers learning a second language - not
necessarily a Nordic one. We adopt a wide definition of the term 'second
language' (L2), i.e. a non-native (second, third, etc.) language acquired
in late childhood, adolescence or adulthood, in a naturalistic or an
instructed setting.=20

We hereby invite papers on L2 acquisition issues relating to any of the
Scandinavian languages (Danish, Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish)
and the other Nordic languages (Finnish, Greenlandic and Saami). We would
be particularly interested in contributions that identify claims of
grammatical models and theories of L2 and test these claims by using
empirical data.=20

The deadline is January 31, 2010. A detailed version of the call for papers
can be found in the June 2009 issue of the Nordic Journal of Linguistics 32
(1), p.3-4.=20

Submissions should follow the NJL style sheet:=20
http://assets.cambridge.org/NJL/NJL_ifc.pdf

Papers should be sent to one of the following two guest editors:

Ute Bohnacker, Institutionen f=F6r lingvistik och filologi, Uppsala
universitet, Box 635, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden. ute.bohnacker@lingfil.uu.se

Linguistics, Universitet i Troms=F8, N-9037 Troms=F8, Norway.
