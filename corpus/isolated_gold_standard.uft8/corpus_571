Call for Abstracts: HCSNet Workshop on Perception and Action
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/hcsnetevents/2006/perception
Thursday Nov. 30 2006
University of Sydney

A one-day workshop on Perception and Action will be held on November 30
during the HCSNet SummerFest at the University of Sydney.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together established and emerging
researchers to discuss hot topics in Perception and Action as it applies =
to
Human Communication Science. The ultimate goal is to facilitate new
collaborations that lead to novel projects, new interactions between
disciplines, and fresh approaches to perception and action.

Background
Evidence accumulates that perception and action are linked. The process =
of
producing actions and reading actions by others is one of neural =
mirroring
or simulation. Despite the coupling of perception and action in humans, =
the
two are often considered separate domains of research. Similarly, many
machine systems have been designed for either perception or production,
e.g., automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, computer
vision. As technology advances multimodal systems capable of both =
perception
and production are on the increase. In parallel with those developments
there is increasing interest in inter-sensory processing in humans. How =
can
knowledge emerging in the area of perception-action and motor-simulation
inform and enhance new multimodal technologies such as avatars, personal
assistants, and embodied conversational agents? For example, can motor
simulation be modeled? Can systems be programmed to develop expectancies =
and
to anticipate actions and responses? Can systems be developed that solve
problems or interpret information from more than one sensory domain?

The way that humans attend to particular information from the wide array
available, and use this information to guide and direct action, is not =
only
of theoretical and practical interest for studies on human behaviour and
human movement, but also for human studies of when such behaviours go =
awry
in such conditions as motor disorders, and studies of machine-based =
learning
and robotics.

No one discipline will solve these complex problems - an integrated
interdisciplinary approach is required, which might include input from a
range of areas, e.g., visual and auditory perception, motor control, =
motor
learning, cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, sign language, =
gesture
analysis, non-verbal communication, music perception and performance,
computer science, and signal processing.

The Perception and Action Workshop will be held under the umbrella of =
the
HCSNet SummerFest, a multi-disciplinary event encompassing a number of
workshops and courses held around the theme of Human Communication =
Science.
The Perception and Action stream will begin with "Speed Paper" sessions =
on
November 29, open to researchers to present their research areas to the
wider community. A one-day workshop on November 30, with invited
presentations and keynote speakers, will follow. The goal of the =
workshop
will be to develop links and relationships to identify and plan
interdisciplinary strategies to address and solve the issues and =
problems
identified in during the meeting.

Registrants presenting in the Speed Paper sessions or at an associated
workshop will have their registration fee waived for SummerFest (Summer
School, Speed Papers, Keynotes, Workshops).

We are interested in receiving 200 word abstracts for short speed papers =
(5
minutes, 4 slides) on any aspect of Human and Machine Perception and =
Action.
In addition to new and novel findings presentations can include outlines =
of
a current or anticipated research projects, risky or whimsical project
ideas, calls for collaboration and so on.

Thematic topics might include:
Cognitive neuroscience and mirroring
Visual, auditory, and other perceptual processes
Intersensory interactions
Human/Machine interfaces
Machine-based learning
Robotics.
Motor disorders and motor control
Motor learning
Psycholinguistics, sign language, non-verbal communication, and gesture
analysis
Music perception and performance
Computer science
Signal processing

In addition, we welcome submissions on any other topic of interest to =
those
interested in Perception and Action. In particular, we encourage =
submissions
that broaden the scope of the Perception and Action community through
multi-disciplinary research.

Submission Format
Please submit a title and 200 word abstract following directions on the
HCSNet website (available later this month): http://www.hcsnet.edu.au.

Important Dates
Abstract submission: September 7 2006
Notification of acceptance: September 29, 2006
Speed Papers: Nov 29 2006
