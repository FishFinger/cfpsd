Announcement and Call for Papers

Why Translation Studies matters

3rd - 5th September 2007

Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia

Translation Studies in its modern form as a distinct inter-discipline has been
in existence for several decades. We now have a number of specialized journals,
hundreds of scholars who meet often for conferences, many theses, dissertations
and academic positions. Clearly, Translation Studies matters to those who are
engaged in it, be it because they find it fascinating as a scholarly activity,
because it is part of their academic career, or for other reasons. But does it
matter to others? Does it, for example, add value to practitioners of
translation, by teaching them something useful and allowing them to enhance
their translation skills, or perhaps by enhancing their status in society? Does
it contribute to translator training by offering useful training methods,
assessment criteria or other elements? Does it matter to other academic
communities by contributing new knowledge and new methods from the realm of
translation? Does it matter to society at large, for instance by showing what
impact translation-related phenomena have had on various communities? Are some
effects of Translation Studies still to come? Which, how and when?

Contributions could address these important questions from many angles, for
example by dis­cussing the relations between Translation Studies and the
practice of translation and/or between Translation Studies and translator
training, by performing sociological analysis of the groups involved, by
examining the relationship between Translation Studies and immigration policies,
or the links between Translation Studies and new forms of electronic literacy.
In addition, questions can be raised about the 'interdisciplinary' nature of
Translation Studies and its shifting and often problematic relationship with
neighbouring fields. 

Sessions and Pre-congress workshops:

The congress programme is scheduled to start on the morning of 3rd September and
end by lunch time on 5th September. It will include plenary sessions, panels,
parallel sessions and posters. 

Pre-congress workshops will take place on 2nd September - two in the morning and
two in the afternoon. They require a minimum of 20 participants. The provisional
issues and moderators are: 

Critical reading for learning and self-improvement (Moderator: Daniel Gile) 

Democratization of knowledge through Specialized Translation (Moderators:
Susanne Göpferich and Peter Kastberg)  

The challenge of using a plurality of methods in empirical translation research
(Moderator: Gyde Hansen)

Terminological issues in TS (Moderator: Gerhard Budin)

(Estimated workshop fee: Euros 70)

Paper proposals:

Abstracts of minimum 500 words with five keywords for 20 min. papers and for
posters should be submitted online via this website: www.est2007.si  

Panel proposals should be submitted by the moderator as a single abstract with
the list of panellists (names and affiliation). Panels, made up of 4-5
panellists, should be structured around a precise topic and consist of 90 min.
debates on a pre-determined set of questions formulated by the moderator. 

The Congress languages will be English, French, German and Spanish.
Contributions may be given, and abstracts should be submitted, in any of these
languages. Contributions in other languages than English should be announced
with an abstract and a title in the relevant language. The title should also be
translated into English for the benefit of colleagues who do not understand it.
As there will be no interpreting into English, presentations given in the other
languages may have a limited number of listeners. 

Key Dates: 

The deadline for submission of abstracts and panel proposals is 1st November 2006. 

The scientific committee will return its decision around 15th March 2007.
