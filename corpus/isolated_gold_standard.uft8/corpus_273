Development. India has a wide repertoire of languages and many initiatives have
been taken in the field of Text. Speech is still a new venture in the field of
NLP. We target to:
- Accelerate the development of large scale spoken language corpora for Indian
Languages.

- Speech Synthesis
- Multi-lingual Speech Translation 
- Multi-lingual Information Retrieval
- Speaker Identification
- Verification for Forensic Applications
- Speech Translation Trial service

Keeping into consideration the earnest need of quality data in Indian Languages
for the research in the above mentioned fields, the idea to conduct an Event on
'Creation of Multilingual Speech Resources' came into existence.

Event Aims:
- Establish a National research initiative group which may lead to an
International community working on Indian Languages.
- Create a knowledge group to cater with issues of Building large scale speech
corpora and technologies in Indian Languages.
- To explore methodologies, new R&D information and emerging trends.
