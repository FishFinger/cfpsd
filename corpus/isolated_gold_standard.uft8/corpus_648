2nd Call for Papers

Dear  Colleague,

On 14-16 May 2010, we are very proud to be organizing "The 6th Internationa=
l ELT
Research Conference" with the chosen theme of: Current Trends in SLA Resear=
ch
and Language Teaching in Ephesus/Sel=E7uk, Izmir/Turkey. The conference is
organised under the auspices of =C7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Facult=
y of
Education, ELT Department, in collaboration with Educational Research
Association, Turkey. The official conference website is http://www.comuelt.=
com
and now you can submit your abstract, using our online abstract submission =
system at
http://www.comuelt.com/conference/author/submit.php

The 6th International ELT Research Conference aims to provide the highest
calibre of ELT research by means of keynote speakers, a large number of sch=
olars
and presenters, and scientific and cultural exchange within a friendly,
informative and stimulating atmosphere. This year we are honoured to have
distinguished scholars as our keynote speakers. Our invited speakers are Ay=
Se
Akyel, Bob Burden, Cem Alptekin, Nick Ellis, and Tony Lynch, whom we believ=
e
will turn the event into a truly learning experience. We also expect many
international ELT researchers  to choose
our biennial event as an outlet for their research findings.

Attending conferences can cost more than some of us can afford. This year w=
e
have been lucky enough to raise some funds from our sponsors to support som=
e
presenters. So far we have managed to raise enough money to finance three
postgraduate presenters.  We, therefore, invite postgraduate students who c=
annot
get any financial support to apply for a student stipend when they submit t=
heir
proposals. We really hope to make this event possible for those who really =
deserve.

The conference is also supported by two international journals, Internation=
al
Journal of Research in ELT and Journal of Theory and Practice in Education.=
=20
Selected papers will be considered and given priority for publication in th=
ese
journals. International Journal of Research in ELT is a newly established
research journal to be published by Educational Research Association
http://eab.org.tr/  and will be first launched in January 2011 with selecte=
d
papers/articles from the conference programme while Journal of Theory and
Practice in Education http://eku.comu.edu.tr  will publish a special issue =
on
SLA research and language teaching in 2010.

Venue of the conference surely impacts on the ambience of the event. This y=
ear,
we have decided to convene our traditional ELT research conference in one o=
f the
most interesting tourist resorts in the world. Sel=E7uk is home to the beau=
tiful
ancient Roman city of Ephesus, library of which can be seen in the conferen=
ce
poster as a symbol of learning. The area is also very well known for the Ho=
use
of Virgin Mary, who is believed to have lived the last days of her life in =
the
area. Further, the merry month of May makes the event even more inviting wi=
th a
good possibility for an early dip in warm waters of the Aegean Sea. The
sightseeing organized by our sponsor travel agency to places of interest ma=
y
also add to the taste of the event. Further information about Ephesus and S=
el=E7uk
can be obtained at http://www.selcuk.bel.tr/  or take a visual through
http://www.selcuk.bel.tr/eng/video.html .

Proposals for oral presentations, workshops, and poster presentations are
invited on the following (but not limited to) themes:

Language Learning and Acquisition
Teacher Training and Education
Approaches and Methods in English Education
English Language Curriculum and Teaching Materials
Culture and Literature in English Education
Language Testing and Evaluation
Early English Education
Multimedia and ICT in English Education
Translation Studies & Language Teaching
Life-long Language Learning
Intercultural Communication
English as an International Language
Lingua Projects

Speakers can choose to do an oral presentation (30'), a workshop (45'), or =
a
poster presentation. For all types of proposals, speakers are expected to s=
ubmit
a minimum 500-word structured abstract via our electronic submission system
until January 15, 2010.  All proposals will be blind-reviewed by the Screen=
ing
Committee for scope and quality. You can find further information about
structuring & submitting your proposal as well as screening policy and impo=
rtant
dates for the conference in related links on our web site.

We hope that this event will provide an occasion for us to consider issues =
and
share strategies and perspectives from a wide variety of contexts and that =
the
friendships made and insights gained at the conference will endure long bey=
ond
your participation and be further enriched by new contacts in years to come=
,
leading to better understanding and appreciation of our profession.

We, on behalf of =C7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, are looking forward t=
o
welcoming you in Ephesus/Sel=E7uk, Izmir-Turkey in May 2010.
