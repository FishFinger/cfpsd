As an important difference to earlier conferences, EKAW will accept=20
different types of papers. The papers will all have the same status and=20
follow the same formatting guidelines in the proceedings but will=20
receive special treatment during the reviewing phase. In particular,=20
each paper type will be subject to own evaluation criteria. The PC will=20
also make sure that there is a reasonable balance of the paper types=20
accepted. At submission time the paper has to be clearly identified as=20
belonging to one of the following categories.

A) Standard research papers

These are "standard" papers presenting a novel method, technique or=20
analysis with appropriate empirical or other types of evaluation as=20
proof-of concept. The main evaluation criteria here will be originality, =

technical soundness and validation.

B) In-use papers

Here we are expecting papers describing applications of knowledge=20
management and engineering in real environments. Applications need to=20
address a sufficiently interesting and challenging problem on real and=20
large datasets, involving many users etc. The focus is less on the=20
originality of the approach and more on presenting real, large-scale and =

complex systems that solve a significant problem. Technical details to=20
understand how the problem is solved are required. Evaluations should=20
involve real users of a system rather than representing a pure academic=20
exercise.
The papers will be evaluated according to the significance and practical =

relevance of the described research as well as with respect to the=20
technical soundness of the described solution and accompanying evaluation=
=2E

C) Problem Analysis papers

We invite researchers to also publish problem analysis papers which do=20
not present any novel method, technique or approach to solving a=20
problem, but help to understand the problem itself. Understanding the=20
characteristics of a problem itself is an important task in research and =

can benefit many people working on the same or at least similar=20
problems. We expect in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain=20
phenomenon or problem, with
clear definitions as well as qualitative and quantitative analyzes of=20
the main characteristics of the problem. We also expect a reasonable=20
review of the state-of-the-art stating in how far current solutions fall =

short. Papers will mainly be evaluated with respect to how general and=20
technically sound their problem analysis is and how useful it will be=20
for other researchers working on the same problem. We expect that such=20
papers will guide future research by highlighting critical assumptions,=20
motivating the difficulty of a subproblem or explaining why current=20
techniques are not sufficient, all corroborated by quantitative and=20
qualitative arguments. Evaluation criteria will also include appropriate =

categorization of the problem area and description of present solutions=20
and approaches; and appropriate description of the limitations of the=20
present solutions and approaches.

D) Validation papers

A fundamental characteristic of research is that it should be=20
reproducible. In some disciplines, reproduction of results by others is=20
a basic research activity. We would like to encourage researchers to=20
reproduce and validate methods, results and experiments etc. proposed by =

others before in a new context or application, on new datasets, under=20
new assumptions etc. The goal is clearly to reach interesting and=20
significant new conclusions about the method/approach in question that=20
warrant a stand-alone publication. The reproduction of results should=20
thus lead to new knowledge about the method in question or reveal=20
inherent problems in the assumptions of the original research or=20
limitations of previous solutions. Papers will be evaluated with respect =

to the soundness of the rationale for reproducing a certain approach as=20
well as with respect to the new knowledge that is generated by=20
reproducing the approach in question. A clear comparison between the=20
results obtained through the reproduction and the original results are=20
mandatory.
