OntoLex 2005 - Call for Paper

OntoLex 2005 - Ontologies and Lexical Resources

IJCNLP-05 Workshop

October 15, 2005 Jeju Island, South Korea


Background and Goals

The new framework of Information Society fostered the growing of the HLT=20
area and the project of turning the World Wide Web into a machine=20
understandable resource to access digital information (the so-called=20
Semantic Web), posing new  challenges for integrated technologies.=20
Lexicographers, lexical semanticists and ontologists are joining forces to=
=20
build innovative systems for integrating ontological knowledge with lexical=
=20
and semantic resources. Important examples of  this interaction are the=20
recent works on the conceptual analysis of WordNet, and the wide use of=20
upper ontologies in innovative international projects like EuroWordNet,=20
SIMPLE, Balkanet, DWDSnet, etc. OntoLex 2005 will be the fourth workshop on=
=20
Ontologies and Lexical Knowledge Bases, following OntoLex 2000, 2002, and=20
2004. In this workshop we want to discuss the relation between ontological=
=20
knowledge and language. A special focus
will be on the role of ontologies in multilingual language processing. This=
=20
relation can be investigated from a number of different angles, for example:
- what differences and similarities there are between ontologies and more=20
traditional lexical resources such as dictionaries and wordnets;
- how ontologies can be extracted from language corpora;
- what role language plays in the definition and mapping of ontologies;
- how to enrich semantic information in wordnets using formal tools;
- how ontologies can be used to treat language in language technology=20
applications.
Ontologies and lexical resources can benefit from each other and converge=20
into a unified framework where semantics is provided by formally rigorous=20
ontological and lexical information.


Topics of interests

The workshop is open to any research contribution dealing with the relation=
=20
between ontologies and lexicons. Topics of interest include, but are not=20
limited to:
- Design principles and methodologies for ontologies and semantic lexical=20
resources, with a special focus on Asian languages
- Evaluation, comparison, mapping and integration of ontologies and lexical=
=20
semantic resources
- The role of ontologies in the development of Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI)
- Applications of ontologies and lexical semantic resources in Information=
=20
Retrieval and Information Extraction
- Use of ontologies and lexical resources in Semantic Web applications
- Role of lexical semantic resources in ontology learning
- Ontology-based query expansion techniques
- Ontologies and multi-lingual lexical resources
- Ontologies and lexical resources for meaning negotiation
