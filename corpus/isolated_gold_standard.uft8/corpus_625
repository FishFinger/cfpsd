Meeting Description:

11th International Conference on Minority Languages (ICML XI)

Multilingualism, citizenship and the future of minority languages Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ideologies
and practices of linguistic difference in Europe

5-6 July 2007
PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs, Hungary 

Call for Papers:

The Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(HAS), the Research Institute for Ethnic and National Minority Studies HAS, and
the Faculty of Political and Legal Sciences of the University of PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs are
pleased to announce the 11th International Conference on Minority Languages
(ICML 11), to be held on 5-6 July 2007 in PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs, Hungary. 

Conference theme:

Multilingualism, citizenship and the future of minority languages -- Ideologies
and practices of linguistic difference in Europe. 

It is the historical strength of the concept ''nation'' that makes us aware of
the contrast between the reality of minorities delineated by state borders and
the ideal of a supra-national entity in which the word ''minority'' only has a
numerical reference. The aim of the conference is to provide a frame for mutual
transfer of knowledge between research communities about the current situation
of linguistic minorities in Europe - a geographical unit in temporal transition
between a past of nation states and a future of the enlarged European Union. The
conference will bring together researchers working on linguistic minorities,
different aspects of bi- and multilingualism, bilingual education, ideologies of
language, language and identity construction, language policy, and especially on
maintenance and revitalization of minority languages in the new Europe, as well
as researchers with sociolinguistic, anthropological, historical, political,
legal, economic and social approaches.

Background and goals:

Numerous minority communities around the world and even in Europe are
continuously under economic, social, ideological, political, cultural,
religious, military etc. pressure to integrate into the dominant society which
often involves the loss of their native languages and often their ethnic
identities. However, preserving one's native language is not only a fundamental
linguistic human right, but, simultaneously, is necessary to perceive and
negotiate one's cultural identity and is a key to understanding and appreciating
the history, knowledge, ideas, and values of the community. Questions about the
legal protection of regional and minority languages have regularly appeared on
the European agenda: for many years various political and civic actions have
centered upon the legal regulations applying to minorities. Nevertheless,
despite the eventual positive legal developments administrative and political
barriers in everyday practice often render the public use of minority languages
difficult. Furthermore, the accession of the new Central and Eastern European
Member States opened up new prospects, at the same time creating new problems
for the enlarged EU with regard to protection and maintenance of minority
languages. The communist regimes and their collapse in the late 1980s created
rather unique political and linguistic arrangements in the East-Central-Eastern
European region. Impacts of the European enlargement, new social-economic order
in East-Central and Eastern Europe that are restructuring the former
relationships at regional and at European level, together with economic,
technological and cultural forces of globalization have created a need for a
re-evaluation of the theoretical questions and research methodologies that guide
investigations of minority languages and their communities. 

Main themes for paper and poster presentations:

- Bilingualism and education
- Models of language learning in education
- Minority languages and the ''new economy'' (country studies, analysis of the
administration of the European Union)
- Negotiation of identities in a new European context: national, regional and
transnational perspectives
- Language policies, language planning and linguistic human rights within
national and international legal frameworks
- The challenges of comparative analysis of minority languages
- Patterns of language shift and maintenance 
- Minority languages, the media and the Internet
- Minority languages and corpus linguistics
- The Roma minority and their languages in Europe
- Linguistic minorities in the enlarged EU

Proposed themes for colloquia include (but are not limited to):

- Linguistic imperialism and bilingualism of minorities in Europe
- Migration and bilingualism
- European Union: Old and New - Common and specific linguistic arrangements in
old and new Member States
- Areas of citizenship, human rights, equality, and the
trans-national/international nature of the Deaf community
- The EU and the protection of linguistic minorities

Location of the conference:

This is the first time an ICML conference is held in an East-Central European
country after the Eastern Enlargement of the European Union. The conference in
PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs, Hungary, will be the first ICML conference in the region. A historical
town, PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs is located in the South-West of Hungary and has won to be the
cultural capital of Europe in 2010. Due to its geographical location and
cultural position, PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs is an ideal bridge to neighboring non-EU member
countries. PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs is a bridge between the cultures of the Balkan and that of
Western Europe and is a multicultural town itself with its nine minority local
governments. In February 1994, the Gandhi Secondary School opened in PÃ¯Â¿Â½cs. The
school is not exclusively for Roma - one fifth of its students are Hungarian -
nor is it formally an ethnic Roma school, but it does focus on Roma cultural
issues and teaches both the Romani and Boyash languages. The town hosted the
first national Roma festival in 2005.

Call for Proposals:

Proposals regarding original, previously unpublished research on minority
languages are invited in three formats: colloquia, individual papers, and
posters. Proposals should fall broadly within the conference theme.

Proposals for colloquia:

Colloquia are collections of paper presentations which relate to a narrowly
defined topic of interest, and are offered in a 3-hour time block. Proposals for
colloquia are limited to 700 words, and should include brief summaries of each
of the papers to be included, along with paper titles and individual authors'
names. Sufficient detail should be provided to allow peer reviewers to judge the
scientific merit of the proposal. The person submitting a proposal for a
colloquium is responsible for securing the permission and cooperation of all
participants before the proposal is submitted. A chair for the session must also
be identified. Although the proposals should be submitted in English, the
language of the colloquia themselves may be chosen freely. 

The submission deadline for proposals for colloquia is September 30, 2006.
Submissions should be sent to  icml11prop@nytud.hu.

Proposals for individual papers or posters:

Please, submit by e-mail a one-page 450-word abstract of your paper or poster.
Include your name, affiliation, address, phone and e-mail address at the end of
your abstract. The abstract should include enough detail to allow reviewers to
judge the scientific merits of the proposal. All abstracts will be reviewed
anonymously by the members of the Academic Committee of ICML 11. We kindly ask
you to attach to your abstract a short presentation of your professional
activities (in third person singular form) - in maximally 150 words. All
abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by the members of the Academic Committee
of ICML 11. 

We will accept for presentation by each author: (a) a maximum of 1 first
authored paper/poster, and (b) a maximum of 2 papers/posters in any authorship
status. At the time of submission you will be asked whether you would like your
abstract to be considered for a poster, a paper, or both.
Oral papers will be allotted 30 minutes, allowing 20 minutes for presentation
and 10 minutes for questions. Posters will be on display for a full day with two
attended sessions during the day. The official language of the conference is
English. The submission deadline for individual papers and posters is October
30, 2006. Submissions should be sent to icml11prop@nytud.hu.

Acknowledgment of receipt of the abstract will be sent by email as soon as
possible after receipt. You will receive notification of acceptance no later
than March 15, 2007.
