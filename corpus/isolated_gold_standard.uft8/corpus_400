Linguistic Field(s): Computational Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: 15-Jul-2006 

Meeting Description:

The workshop will focus on contemporary methods to investigate both the role of lexical knowledge useful for discourse purposes as well as the role of discourse knowledge in lexical interpretation. 

Workshop on the Interface between
			Lexical and Discourse Semantics

Call for Papers

Call Deadline: 15/07

The issue of exploring lexical semantic knowledge for the needs of discourse semantic analysis and the use of discourse knowledge for a better understanding of lexical semantics has been addressed by a number of scholars. The goal of this workshop is to investigate  the interface between these two distinct levels of linguistic representation more closely. It has proven to be  difficult to isolate the appropriate lexical and discourse knowledge that play a role in the interaction between these two levels, since the needs and granularity of information in the representation of both levels are expected to be different. 

These questions have been addressed from both a theoretical and computational point of view, since computational semantic models of discourse seek to integrate lexical knowledge in their analyses in order to improve the efficiency of their inferences concerning the intersentential connectedness.   We therefore welcome contributions from both theoretical and computational perspectives.


The workshop is organized as a satellite event of the KONVENS06, which takes place in Konstanz this year. The webpage of the workshop appears as part (subsection) of the webpage of
KONVENS06, http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/conferences/konvens06/

Submissions:

Contributions to this subject from both lexical and discourse (computational or not) semantics are welcome. Authors should submit an *anonymous* paper of at most 3 pages, 12 font size, in PDF format (for talks with a duration of 25' plus 10' discussion) via e-mail to Alexandros.Tantos@uni-konstanz.de. Printable versions of the accepted papers will be published in the KONVENS' on-line proceedings.

Subject: Standard Prosody or Prosody of Linguistic Standards? Prosodic Variation and Grammar Writing 

	

Full Title: Standard Prosody or Prosody of Linguistic Standards? Prosodic Variation and Grammar Writing 

Date: 28-Feb-2007 - 02-Mar-2007
Location: Siegen, Germany 
Contact Person: Jörg Peters
Meeting Email: j.peters@let.ru.nl
Web Site: http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/jp/dgfs2007/main.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: 15-Aug-2006 

Meeting Description:

With the advances of prosodic theory in the last few decades, descriptive grammars have paid more and more attention to prosody. Encyclopaedic grammars like the Comprehensive grammar of the English language (Quirk et al. 1985) and the 7th edition of the Dudengrammatik (2005) even devote entire chapters to prosody. Those grammars claim to describe national standard languages, which are codified in written language. Prosody, however, is only partly codified, if at all. The question arises whether there is nonetheless a standard prosody shared by all speakers of a national standard language on which grammars can be built. Until the mid 90s of the last century, prosodic research mainly dealt with standard languages, using impressionistic judgements or a few speakers of the standard language as their data source. In the last decade, prosodic variation has become one of the fastest-growing topics, especially in Autosegmental Phonology and in spoken language research. The findings !
 in these research areas challenge the view that there is a single standard prosody shared by all speakers of a standard language. One of the tasks of prosodic research, therefore, will be to examine how much variation is involved in the prosody used by speakers of national standard languages, and, more generally, to examine the implications prosodic variation has for grammatical description. 

CALL FOR PAPERS

Papers on all topics related to prosodic variation and the relevance of prosody for grammar writing are welcome. In particular, we encourage contributions to 
- the prosody of standard and non-standard varieties
- regional, social, and stylistic variation of prosody
- syntactic structure and prosodic variation
- the modelling of prosody as part of grammars.

Presentations will be 20 minutes long followed by a 10-minute question period.

The workshop will be part of the Annual Meeting of the German Society of Linguistics (DGfS) (http://www.dgfs.de).

SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS

Abstracts should fit on one page (using 2.5 cm margins on each side and 12pt font size). The body should include the following information: author's name(s), affiliation, email address, and title of abstract.

All abstracts must be submitted as PDF documents. If you encounter a problem creating a PDF file, please contact us for further assistance.

Please send your submission electronically to all three organizers (see below).

IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for abstract submission: 15 August 2006
Notification of acceptance: 15 September 2006
Final programme: 15 December 2006
