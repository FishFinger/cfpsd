Please note the contact email for submission of papers: ial2006@163.com.


Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Call Deadline: 30-Jul-2006 

The inaugural issue of Journal IAL is scheduled to appear in October 2006.

International Applied Linguistics, a professional, refereed journal, is
published bimonthly a year. The primary aim of the new journal is to
fulfill the need for a publication forum devoted to the discussion of
topics and issues in Applied Linguistics in the world, with a strong
preference for contributions relating to second language acquisition,
foreign/second language teaching, computer-assisted learning, curriculum
design and development, teaching and research methodology, testing and
evaluation, educational linguistics and the like. Two issues every year
will be special ones organized thematically and regionally, which will be
devoted to China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, Korea and other
EFL/ESL fast-developing areas in the Asian region. These issues will be
guest-edited by advisory board members or other scholars.
