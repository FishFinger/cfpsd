Full Title: Languages and Linguistics 


Linguistic Field(s): Arabic, Standard;Sociolinguistics 

Call Deadline: 31-Dec-2009 

Call for Papers for the next issue of the international journal of
Languages and Linguistics on the theme: Language Policy in the Arab World

The symbolic significance of language can help explain why standard Arabic,
which is not a spoken language anywhere in the Arab world, has survived
amidst colonization, modern technology, and globalization. Yet the path of
standard Arabic was not always smooth and the differences among different
Arab countries in their attitudes towards it are as different as the
history and environment of each country. 

Thus, to study language policies in the Arab world one has to look at the
political situation and at the sociolinguistic map in every country. This
issue of Languages and Linguistics will examine three main topics. First,
it will study different language policies in the Arab world, implemented
ones or even unimplemented ones. Second, it will discuss the domain of the
study of language policy and the factors that govern and influence
different policies. Third, the issue will examine case studies of Maghreb
and Middle Eastern countries and compare and contrast their experiences
with language policies.  The role of ethnicity, religion, media, and
academies in the Arab world will also be tackled. 

Articles may be in English, French, or Arabic

Scholars who are interested in contributing are requested to send their
abstract before the end of December 2009, and the whole article by the end
of March 2010. Please send your abstract to Professor Moha Ennaji:        
mennaji2002@yahoo.fr
