CALL FOR PAPERS
The Australasian Ontology Workshop (AOW 2006)
Held in Conjunction with the 19th Australian Joint Conference on =
Artificial Intelligence (AI'06)

Advances in Ontologies:

The use of formal ontologies in knowledge systems has many advantages. =
It allows for an unambiguous specification of the structure of knowledge =
in a domain, enables knowledge sharing and, as a result, makes it =
possible to perform automated reasoning about ontologies. In recent =
years there has been a worldwide increase in the use of ontologies, both =
in industry and in research laboratories. There is a growing community =
of researchers in Australia and New Zealand, working on various aspects =
of ontologies. The primary aim of this workshop is to bring together =
ontology researchers in the region.=20

Australian Computer Society in Volume 58 of the Conferences in Research =
and Practice in Information Technology (CRPIT) series. The proceedings =
of AOW06 will also be published in Volume 72 of the CRPIT Series =
(http://crpit.com) with an ISBN. Authors will be notified of acceptance =
