==================================================
CI 2006 Special Session on
Natural Language Processing for Real Life Applications
November 20-22, 2006 San Francisco, California, USA
==================================================

see http://w5.cs.uni-sb.de/~cmueller/ci06


The value to our society of being able to communicate with machines in
everyday "natural" language (NL) cannot be overstated. NL-interfaces enable
the user to communicate with the computer in French, English, German, or
another human language. Their applications invole database queries,
information retrieval from texts, so-called expert systems, and robot
control.
Communication with computers using speech has a lasting impact upon the work
environment, completely new areas of application for information technology
are opening up. Recent advances in speech recognition improve the usability
of many types of NL-systems: Today's state-of-the-art NL-systems combine
speech with other modes of communication such as pointing with mouse or
finger. In addition, due to the vital interest from telecommunications
industry, much research is done on the paralinguistic level, where features
of the users' speech are exploited for user model acquisition.

The Special Session on Natural Language Processing for Real Life Applications
will cover the following topics (but is not limited to):

1. speech recognition, in particular
* multilingual speech recognition
* large vocabulary continuous speech recognition with focus on the
 application

2. real life dialog systems
* natural language dialog systems
* multimodal dialog systems

3. speech-based classification
* speaker classification, i.e. exploiting paralinguistic features of
the speech to gather information about the speaker (for example age, gender,
cognitive load, and emotions)
* language and accent identification

Paper Submission

Please submit papers for the special session directly to the session chair
(christian.mueller@dfki.de). DO NOT submit the papers through the IASTED
website. Otherwise, the papers will be handled as general papers for the
conference. Each submission will be reviewed by at least two independent
reviewers. The final selection of papers for the session will be done by the
session chair; acceptance/rejection letters and review comments along with
registration information will be provided by IASTED by the general
Notification deadline.
