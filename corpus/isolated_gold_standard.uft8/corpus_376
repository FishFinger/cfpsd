INFORMATION ON PRESENTATION (PAPER OR WORKSHOP)

Title (max. 15 words)

-	Paper
-	Workshop

Specific area(s) of applied linguistics addressed

Equipment required:
-	VHS Video / VCR
-	Beamer / projector  (see note 1 below)
-	OHP
-	Cassette recorder


IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR SPEAKERS

1.	Since the organizing committee cannot guarantee full availability of a beamer / projector --or its compatibility with the speakers' laptop/notebook computer-- presenters are kindly requested to make contingency plans (= OHP).


2.	Papers and workshops may be presented in either English or Spanish.  The time for papers and workshops will be 40 minutes, including in all cases 5 minutes for discussion.

3.	Co-presenters are required to pay their registration fee and take part in the presentation in order to receive the conference certificate. 

4.	All speakers are requested to devote the first 5 minutes of their time to introducing the specific topic to be addressed by placing it in an appropriate context and a wider framework. Similarly, speakers are requested to emphasize the main points/findings rather than give unnecessary detail during the presentation. The organizing committee feels that a reasonably uniform format will make it easier for the audience --mostly advanced undergraduate students-- to follow the talks.

5.	At ELIA the workshop format is usually based on some teaching strategy, classroom activity, data collection/analysis procedure, teaching materials (either academic or commercial), and the like. It includes a brief introduction followed by a practical demonstration (live or recorded) intended to show the comparative benefits of the strategy, procedure or materials being presented. References to and/or discussion of specific theories, hypotheses, authors, etc. are less relevant in this format type. Although the overall time available for workshops is the same as for paper presentations, the time assigned for participation by the audience may need to be more flexible in workshops (eg. 10 min. out of the total 40).

6.	VERY IMPORTANT: A 300- to 400-word (maximum) single-spaced abstract and a sequential outline of the presentation must be attached to this proposal form. The sequential outline will consist of a step-by-step distribution of the contents to be covered organized according to the total time available for presentation.

7.	CRITERIA FOR SELECTION: The following criteria will be used for assessing the proposals received: 
Relevance: Topics must be based on the conference's main theme from the perspective of learning, teaching, or using the L2 in question.
Significance to the field: Proposals must include at least two (2) of the following aspects of the topic discussed: original research / critical analysis of an issue / innovative practice / contrastive analysis / review of the literature. 
Clarity: Abstracts must be clear and specific; sequential outlines must be well-organized and reflect the total time available for presentations.
Implications and/or applications: These must be clearly stated as an integral part of the conclusion.

8.	All proposals will consist of a completed proposal form, an abstract, and a sequential  outline, as indicated above. The deadline to submit proposals --either by regular or electronic mail to elia@siff.us.es (WORD, RTF, ASCII format)-- is December 1, 2006.
