Meeting Description:

The Center for Research In Syntax, Semantics & Phonology (CRISSP) in Brussels is pleased to host the 15th annual Conference of the Student Organization of Linguistics in Europe, from January 11 to 13, 2007.

ConSOLE is organized by a different European university every year and provides a forum for students of linguistics from all over the world to present their research. 

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS 

Abstracts are solicited from all areas of generative linguistics including but not limited to phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. ConSOLE is a conference on theoretical linguistics, so papers in fields like psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics or phonetics will also be welcome if they have a theoretical orientation. 

GUIDELINES FOR ABSTRACTS 

Abstracts should not exceed two pages, including data, references and diagrams. Abstracts should be typed in at least 11-point font, with one-inch margins (letter-size; 8''1/2 by 11'' or A4) and a maximum of 50 lines of text per page. Abstracts must be anonymous and submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author. We will only accept abstracts by students (i.e., people not having defended a PhD. by September 15th, 2006). 

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Send name, affiliation, e-mail, mailing address and title of the paper in the body of the message. The anonymous abstract should be sent as an attachment, and only abstracts in pdf format will be accepted. Abstracts should be sent to console@crissp.be.

Accepted papers are allotted 30 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.   

INVITED SPEAKERS 

We are proud to announce that the following linguists have already accepted our invitation for ConSOLE XV in Brussels:

Kyle Johnson (University of Massachusetts Amherst)
Arnim von Stechow (Universität Tübingen)
Jean Lowenstamm (Université de Paris)

IMPORTANT DATES:

Deadline for abstracts: September 15th, 2006

Notification of acceptance: November 15th, 2006 

Final program: December 1st, 2006  

Conference: January 11-13, 2007

FINANCIAL SUPPORT: 

The organization of the 15th Annual Conference of the Students Organization of Linguistics in Europe will do its best to offer travel support for presenters without sufficient funds, to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The Evidence of Projecting D in The Initial State of L2 English Grammars 
by Chinese-Speaking L2 English Learners

A number of hypotheses on second language acquisition have been proposed by theoretical 
linguists during the 1990s. A controversial issue is if functional categories exist in the initial 
state of L2 grammars or not. It is known that Chinese is a [-ART] language, which is not 
like English with article system. The interesting issue is how L2 learners whose native 
language like Japanese or Chinese that lacks English article system acquire functional 
categories D of L2 grammars (White, 2003). It is suggested that even thought Chinese does 
not have article system like English, the functional categories like classifier exist in Chinese 
(Tang, 1990; Li, 1998). When Chinese-speaking L2 learners of English learn English, it 
could be possible for them to transfer the use of classifier system in the English L2 
grammars. So far, just a few studies have tackled with this issue. Thus, it is needed for 
further investigation. In the study, there are forty 19-to-21-year-old Taiwanese college 
students (20 females and 20 males) participating into the study. The participants were 
divided into two English proficiency levels, low and high, by the Michigan Listening 
Comprehension Test, and were asked to perform an oral story-telling task. Bickterton's 
(1981) semantic wheel model, [±Specific Referent (±SR)] and [±Assumed Known to the 
Hearer (±HK)], was adopted as data analysis. And, TLU (Target-like Use) was selected for 
measuring accuracy rate of article use. The results found that the L2 learners at the high 
proficiency levels used English articles correctly than the low proficiency levels did, 
suggesting that the advanced Chinese-speaking L2 English learners can gradually reset the 
parameter of L2 grammars in acquiring the functional category D that is absent in the L1. 
The result contradicts No Parameter Resetting Hypothesis, supporting L2 learners can access 
to partial UG of L2 grammars.  In addition, the interlanguage data showed there are some 
interesting errors made by the Chinese-speaking L2 English learners, and theoretical 
discussions were provided in the study.  For instance, the misuse of numeral one for English 
indefinite article a/an was found in the data, implying that it is influenced from the usage of 
Chinese classifier system 'yige'. The comparison on syntactic positions and semantic 
interpretations between Chinese 'yige' and English indefinite a/an was discussed. And, it is 
argued that the syntactic behavior of Chinese classifier system 'yige' is more complex than 
that of English indefinite article a/an, and 'yige' has more wider distribution than 'a/an'.  
Furthermore, an interesting error made by the L2 learners at low proficiency levels is the 
placement of definite article the before proper name, the Cinderella. The misuse of the 
Cinderella for Cinderella reflects the existence of projecting functional category D in the 
initial state of L2 grammars by the Chinese speaking L2 learners. And, it is argued that the 
projection of D could be universal linguistic phenomenon by the L2 learners even for those 
whose native language lacks clear English-type articles.  Also, there is significant difference 
in the misuse of the Cinderella for Cinderella between the group of low proficiency level 
and that of high proficiency level. The group of low proficiency levels made the errors 
highly than the group of high proficiency level did, implying that the Chinese-speaking L2 
learners can gradually acquire the usage of English proper names with the increase of 
proficiency level.
