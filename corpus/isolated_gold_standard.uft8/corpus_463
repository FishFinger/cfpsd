Meeting Description:

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is an annual workshop
designed for students, post docs, and junior researchers working in applied
spoken dialog systems research. The roundtable provides an open forum where
participants can discuss their research interests, current work and future
plans. The workshop is meant to foster creative thinking about current issues in
spoken dialog systems research, and help create a stronger international network
of young researchers working in the field.

This year, the workshop will be held on September 16th, 2006, in Pittsburgh, PA,
USA, as a satellite workshop to Interspeech 2006. 

YRR-2006: 2nd Call for participation (http://www.yrrsds.org/)

Workshop topic

The Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems is a satellite
workshop to the INTERSPEECH 2006 - ICSLP in Pittsburgh. This workshop will bring
together students, post docs, and junior researchers from different countries,
different research institutions, and different disciplines who share an interest
in applied dialog systems research. It will provide a setting in which 
participants can discuss their own research and work and obtain feedback from
others who are at a similar level and who are working on similar problems. The
discussions will have an eye toward (1) solving the problems participants
currently face in their work and (2) identifying issues that are likely to be
important in the coming years. And, perhaps most importantly, (3) the event will
help to create a more permanent international network of young researchers
working in spoken dialog systems. We hope to continue the success of last year's
Young Researchers' Roundtable on Spoken Dialog Systems
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dod/YRR/index.html).

Workshop format

This workshop will be a full-day event consisting of multiple small-group
discussions of topics that will be chosen based on suggestions submitted by the
participants themselves. Potential roundtable discussion topics could include:

- Use and usefulness of user simulation: What are the best practices for
building and evaluating user simulations?
- Dialogue and question answering: How can dialogue research help with
interactive question answering?
- Multimodality: Today spoken dialog systems are common in call centers, mobile
phone, and cars, but multi-modal systems are much less widely deployed. Why is
this so? Can multimodal dialogue systems play a useful/fun role in
gaming/virtual reality?
- Para-linguistic and non-linguistic phenomena: How should dialogue systems
account for and respond to affect (e.g., user frustration)? 
- Bridging the gap: How can research on spoken dialogue systems benfit from
other fields? What techniques from other fields (such as operations research,
ergonomics, data mining, or others) might be  borrowed and extended to advance
spoken dialog systems? What can linguistic theories and psycho-lingusitic
research tell us?
- ...

After the small-group discussions, each of the groups will present a summary to
the rest of the participants. We hope that the discussion format will foster
creative thinking about current issues in spoken dialog systems research,
setting the stage for the co-located INTERSPEECH-2006.

Submission process

We invite participation from students, post docs, and junior researchers who are
currently working in applied spoken dialog  systems research. We also invite
participation from those who are  working in related fields such as human
factors, speech recognition, artificial intelligence, or speech synthesis, as
applied to spoken dialog systems. Potential participants should submit a 2-page
position paper following the template provided on the webpage. The paper will
include a statement of research interests with a short overview of past, current
and future work. Furthermore a discussion  on the following questions:

- What is the next killer application for spoken dialog systems?
- What sort of impact could that application have?
- What questions need to be answered before we can realize that application?

This discussion should be followed by an enumeration of three possible
discussion topics for the event itself. Finally the authors are asked to provide
a short biographical sketch. Accepted papers will be collated and distributed to
participants in CD-ROM and/or paper format. We also plan to publish the position
papers and presentations from the workshop on the web, subject to sponsor or
publisher constraints.

Further information concerning the submission format is provided on the web-page.

Submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis starting March 27th, 2006, until
the maximum number of participants for the workshop (45) is reached, or until
the submission deadline (July 20th, 2006) is  reached.
