FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

VARIETIES OF VOICE - 3rd international BAAHE conference - Theoretical and=20
Applied Linguistics
7-9 December 2006, University of Leuven, Belgium
http://www.kuleuven.be/ilt/baahe_2006conference/

EXTENDED DEADLINE: 14 September 2006

The Belgian Association of Anglicists in Higher Education (BAAHE) will=20
organize its Third International Conference from 7 to 9 December 2006 at=20
the University of Leuven, Belgium.

This conference will explore the role played by VOICE in the English=20
language. It will consider:
* the synchronic and diachronic ways in which the (subjective) voice of the=
=20
language user manifests itself linguistically, i.e. in the constructional=20
properties of syntagms used,
* those aspects of academic English that are relevant to helping learners=20
find an appropriate academic voice in speaking and writing.

Paper proposals (20 minutes + 10 minutes discussion) are invited on the=20
following questions and issues:

LINGUISTICS
* (inter-)subjective motivations of voice such as
-choice of active vs. passive voice for optimal negotiation of information=
=20
between speaker/hearer;
-evaluative and other subjective effects of middle constructions;
* subjective vs. more objective constructions (e.g. subjective vs.=20
objective modality);
* speech and thought representation: representational vs. subjective uses,=
=20
their impact on point of view;
* the diachronic shift from representational to interpersonal import of=20
constructions;
* other aspects of interpersonal varieties of voice.

ELT-Academic English
* author stance in academic writing: differences between disciplines and=20
cultures (e.g. hedging)
* register varieties: formality in academic genres; diachronic developments
* citation strategies: how and why do writers incorporate other voices in=20
their own writing?
* resentation and seminar skills: tone and register; strategies to voice=20
comments and objections
Exploring the differences between native and non-native speakers, or=20
between learners and experienced speakers, should yield insights into how=20
EAP materials can help learners construct an appropriate academic voice.


Plenary speakers:
Suzanne Kemmer (Rice University): "Intransitive Structures and Functions"
Ken Hyland (University of London): "Disciplinary voices: interactions in=20
research writing"

Selected proceedings will be published in the 2007 issue of the=20
international journal BELL.

Abstracts (up to 500 words) should be sent before 14 September 2006 to
