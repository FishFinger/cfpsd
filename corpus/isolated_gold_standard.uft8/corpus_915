Workshop on East Asian Languages/Linguistics
February 20, 2010

The Linguistics Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara
announces its 16th Workshop on East Asian Languages (WEAL). The workshop is an
informal meeting where participants can present and discuss issues concerning
languages in East Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean; work on
minority languages from any part of eastern Asia is especially welcome. WEAL
2010 will take place on Saturday, February 20th at the McCune Conference Room,
6020 HSSB, UCSB.

Abstracts are invited for talks on any topic in East Asian linguistics. This is
an informal workshop for work in progress: presentations can be about
preliminary results and issues arising from ongoing projects, rather than
finished papers. We welcome proposals from UCSB, UCLA and other departments in
the Southern California area, and we encourage both students and faculty to
participate.

Talks will be 20 minutes, followed by 10 minutes for discussion. Abstracts
should be 500 words or less (excluding examples and/or references) and can be
submitted by hard copy or email. Please indicate your source(s) and type(s) of
data in the abstract (e.g. recordings, texts, conversational, elicited,
narrative, etc.). For co-authored papers, please indicate who plans to present
the paper as well as who will be in attendance.

Please include the following information along with your abstract: (1) your
name; (2) affiliation; (3) mailing address; (4) phone number; (5) email address;
(6) title of your paper.

- For email submissions: Include the information noted above in the body of the
email message. Include the abstract as an attachment. Please limit your
abstracts to the following formats: PDF, RTF, or Microsoft Word document. Send
email submissions to: 2010weal@gmail.com

- For hard copy submissions: Please send two copies of your abstract, along with
the information noted above to:

Workshop on East Asian Languages
Attn: Allison Adelman
Department of Linguistics
University of California, Santa Barbara
