PURPOSE / HISTORY:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering
   of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing. We anticipate to have 2,000 or more
   attendees from over 85 countries participating at the Congress.
   A number of individual research tracks of WORLDCOMP have been
   held for many years; for example, PDPTA has been held annually
   since 1995 (PDPTA'10 is the 16th annual conference); ERSA has
   been held annually since 2001 (ERSA'10 is the 10th annual
   conference); ICAI has been held annually since 1999 (ICAI'10
   is the 12th annual conference); other tracks of WORLDCOMP
   Congress have similar records.

   The motivation behind this federated conference is to assemble
   a spectrum of affiliated research conferences into a coordinated
   research meeting held in a common place at a common time. The
   main goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas in a
   number of research areas that interact. The model used to form
   these annual conferences facilitates communication among
   researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.
   Both inward research (core areas of computer science and
   engineering) and outward research (multi-disciplinary,
   inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered during
   the conferences. The Congress makes concerted effort to reach
   out to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such as:
   universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies,
   and research centers/labs) from all over the world.

   WORLDCOMP'10 will be composed of research presentations, keynote
   lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions,
   and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel
   speakers have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer/computer
   architecture, U. of California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler
   (known as Father of Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known
   as Father of Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster
   (known as Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago & ANL),
   Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (pioneer/VR, U. of California, Berkeley),
   Prof. Barry Vercoe (Founding member of MIT Media Lab, MIT),
   Dr. Jim Gettys (known as X-man, developer of X Window System,
   xhost; OLPC), Prof. John Koza (known as Father of Genetic
   Programming, Stanford U.), Prof. Brian D. Athey (NIH Program
   Director, U. of Michigan), Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna (pioneer,
   U. of Southern California), Dr. Jose L. Munoz (NSF Program
   Director and Consultant), Prof. Jun Liu (Broad Institute of
   MIT & Harvard U.), Anousheh Ansari (CEO, Prodea Systems & first
   female private space explorer), and many other distinguished
   speakers. To get a feeling about the conferences' atmosphere,

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS, PUBLICATION, INDEXING INFORMATION:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by
   uploading them to the evaluation web site at:
   http://worldcomp.cviog.uga.edu/
   Submissions must be uploaded by March 1, 2010 and they must
   be in either MS doc (but not docx) or pdf formats (about 5
   to 7 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All
   reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the
   authors of accepted papers will be asked to follow a
   particular typesetting format to prepare their final papers.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
   limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must not have been
   previously published or currently submitted for publication
   elsewhere. The first page of the draft paper should include:
   title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, and
   email address for each author. The first page should also
   identify the name of the Contact Author and a maximum of 5
   topical keywords that would best represent the content of
   the paper. Finally, the name of the conference that the paper
   is being submitted to must be stated on the first page.

   Full papers will be evaluated for originality, significance,
   clarity, impact, and soundness. Each paper will be refereed
   by two experts in the field who are independent of the
   conference program committee. The referees' evaluations will
   then be reviewed by one member of the program committee who
   will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
   the paper has been submitted to. The chair will make the
   final decision. Lastly, the final papers will be reviewed
   by one member of the program committee.

   All accepted papers will be published in the respective
   conference proceedings (in both, printed book form as well as
   online). The proceedings will be indexed in Inspec / IET /
   The Institute for Engineering and Technology, DBLP / Computer
   Science Bibliography, and others.) The printed proceedings
   will be available for distribution on site at the conference.

   In addition to the publication of the proceedings, selected
   authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their
   papers for publication in a number of research books being
   proposed/contracted with various publishers (such as, Springer,
   Elsevier, IOS, ...) - these books would be composed after the
   conference. Also, many chairs of sessions and workshops will
   be forming journal special issues to be published after the
   conference.

PROPOSAL FOR ORGANIZING SESSIONS/WORKSHOPS:

   Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from
   different authors (12 papers in the case of workshops). The
   session chairs will be responsible for all aspects of their
   sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...
   The names of session chairs will appear as Associate Editors
   in the conference proceedings and on the cover of the books.

   Proposals to organize sessions should include the following
   information: name and address (+ email) of proposer, his/her
   biography, title of session, a 100-word description of the
   topic of the session, the name of the conference the session
   is submitted for consideration, and a short description on
   how the session will be advertised (in most cases, session
   proposers solicit papers from colleagues and researchers
   whose work is known to the session proposer). email your
   session proposal to H. R. Arabnia ( hra@cs.uga.edu ). We would
   like to receive the session proposals by January 16, 2010.

IMPORTANT DATES:

   Jan. 16, 2010:    Proposals for organizing sessions/workshops
   March 1, 2010:    Submission of papers (about 5 to 7 pages)
   March 25, 2010:   Notification of acceptance

                     (WORLDCOMP'10 - 22 joint conferences)

MEMBERS OF PROGRAM AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEES:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World
   Academy of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific
   computing; AI; imaging science; databases; simulation;
   software eng.; embedded systems; internet & web technologies;
   communications; computer security; & bioinformatics.) The
   Program Committee for individual conferences is currently
   being formed. Many who have already joined the committees
   of individual tracks are renowned leaders, scholars,
   researchers, scientists and practitioners of the highest
   ranks; many are directors of research labs., fellows of
   various societies, heads/chairs of departments, program
   directors of research funding agencies, deans and provosts.
   Program Committee members are expected to have established
   a strong and documented research track record. Those
   interested in joining the Program Committee should email
   H. R. Arabnia (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information for
   consideration/evaluation: Name, affiliation and position,
   complete mailing address, email address, a one-page biography
   that includes research expertise and the name of the
   conference offering to help with.

LOCATION OF CONFERENCES:

   The conferences will be held at Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by hotels).
   This is a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities and
   over 3,000 rooms. It is minutes from the airport with 24-hour
   shuttle service to and from the airport. This hotel has many
   recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools,
   sunning decks, Easy River, wave pool, nightly shows, many
   restaurants, ... The negotiated room rate for conference
   attendees is very reasonable. The hotel is adjacent to
   CityCenter ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityCenter ) which
   is the largest private development in the United States' history
   (costing over $11 Billion) with access to additional recreational
   and entertainment attractions.
