Call For Papers:
Working Papers in Athabascan/Dene Languages and Linguistics
Deadline for submission: September 30, 2006

To be published as Alaska Native Language Center Working Papers No. 6,
edited by Siri Tuttle, Leslie Saxon, Suzanne Gessner and Andrea Berez.

Since 2001 the Alaska Native Language Center has annually published the
proceedings of the Athabascan/Dene Languages Conference in its Working
Papers series. After the very successful Dene Languages Conference in
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada in June 2006, we would like to
continue the annual publication tradition by assembling a collection of
working papers to be published in late Fall 2006. We welcome submissions
both from participants in the Yellowknife Conference, and from people who
were not able to participate.

Papers are invited on all areas of Athabascan/Dene linguistics, language
teaching, language policy, and language revitalization. Any topic that
would be appropriate for presentation at the Athabascan/Dene Languages
Conference is also appropriate for this Working Papers volume. We
particularly welcome reports on works-in-progress, explorations of new
data, and language pedagogy. As with previous Working Papers volumes,
submissions will be editorially reviewed and publication in the volume does
not preclude publication elsewhere.

The deadline for submission is September 30, 2006. Electronic submission is
encouraged. If possible, submit papers in Microsoft Word format, and
include copies of all fonts with your submission. Submissions should be
emailed to aberez@umail.ucsb.edu or andrea.berez@gmail.com. Electronic
submission is preferred, but papers can be sent via traditional mail to:

Working Papers
c/o Siri Tuttle
Alaska Native Language Center
Box 757680
Fairbanks AK 99775-7680
USA

The following are some basic style guidelines to follow when preparing your
paper:

*Papers should be single spaced. The Working Papers will not be reduced, so
there is no need to add extra space or make the font large size. 

*There is no predefined page limit, though we expect most contributions
will not exceed 20 pages.

*Font: 12 pt. Times for text and subheadings.

*Margins: 1'' left, right, top. 1.5'' bottom.

*Numbering: leave pages unnumbered (but pencil in number on back of page if
submitting via traditional mail).

*Headings should be formatted as follows:

Title (bold and centered, 14 point)
[skip a line]
Name (centered)
[skip a line]
Affiliation (centered)

*Do not include an abstract in the heading of the paper.

*Subheadings should be flush left. Subheading 1: bold. Subheading 2:
italic. Subheading 3: same as normal text. Do not go below subheading 3.

*Use footnotes, not endnotes.

Please direct questions to Siri Tuttle ffsgt1@uaf.edu or (907)474-5708.
