                       EXTENDED CALL FOR PAPERS
                              ICGI 2006
          8th International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference
                 http://www.tnlab.ice.uec.ac.jp/icgi06/
                       icgi06@dna.bio.keio.ac.jp
               The University of Electro-Communications,
                    Chofu, Tokyo 182-8585, JAPAN
              September 20(Wednesday) - 22(Friday), 2006

     *** Paper Submission Deadline is extended to May 27, 2006 ***

# SCOPE #
ICGI-2006 is the eighth in a series of successful biennial international
conferences in the area of grammatical inference.

Grammatical inference has been extensively addressed by researchers in
information theory, automata theory, language acquisition, computational
linguistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational learning
theory and neural networks.

ICGI-2006 will be the first conference in this series to be held in Asia.
Further, as in the previous ICGI conference, we are planning to hold a
grammatical inference competition that will be known as the Tenjinno
competition as part of ICGI-2006.

# INVITED TALKS #
Yuji Matsumoto (Nara Institute of Science and Technology) 
"Parsing without grammar rules"

Jean-Philippe Vert (Ecole des Mines de Paris) 
"Kernel methods for classification of biological sequences"

# AREAS OF INTEREST #
The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of
original research papers on all aspects of grammatical inference including,
but not limited to:

   *  Different models of grammar induction: e.g., learning from examples,
learning using examples and queries, incremental versus non-incremental
learning, distribution-free models of learning, learning under various
distributional assumptions, learnability results, complexity results,
characterizations of representational and search biases of grammar
induction algorithms.

   *  Algorithms for induction of different classes of languages and
automata: e.g., regular, context-free, and context-sensitive languages,
interesting subclasses of the above under additional syntactic constraints,
tree and graph grammars, picture grammars, multidimensional grammars,
attributed grammars, parameterized models, etc.

   *  Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to
grammar induction including artificial neural networks, statistical
methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches, minimum
description length, complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic methods, etc.

   *  Broader perspectives on grammar induction, e.g. acquisition of
grammar in conjunction with language semantics, semantic constraints on
grammars, language acquisition by situated agents and robots, acquisition
of language constructs that describe objects and events in space and time,
developmental and evolutionary constraints on language acquisition,
statistical modelling of natural language, etc.

Particular emphasis will be given to papers presenting work on innovative
applications of grammar induction in natural language acquisition,
computational biology, Web mining, structural pattern recognition,
information retrieval, text processing, adaptive intelligent agents,
systems modelling and control, and other domains.

# LOCATION #
ICGI-2006 will be held in Chofu, Tokyo. The conference will be located in
The University of Electro-Communications (UEC) (http://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/).

# CONFERENCE FORMAT #
The conference will include plenary and invited talks, software
demonstrations and possibly poster presentations of accepted papers and
tutorials. A special session will be devoted to the results of the Tenjinno
competition. All plenary and invited papers will appear in the conference
proceedings. The proceedings of ICGI-2006 will be published by
Springer-Verlag as a volume in their Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence, a subseries of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

# SUBMISSION OF PAPERS #
Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper which represents
original and previously unpublished work. Simultaneous submission to other
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. The paper should be
written in English with the following format. The cover page should
specify: submission to ICGI-2006, title, authors and affiliation, mailing
address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the contact author, a brief
abstract describing the work, at least three keywords which can specify
typically the contents of the work. Postscript versions of the papers
should not exceed 12 single spaced pages (excluding the cover page) on A4
or letter-size paper, and should be in single-column format using at least
1 inch margins and at least 11-point font. Submissions deviating
significantly from these guidelines will be rejected without review.
The technical expositions should be directed to a specialist and should
include an introduction understandable to a non specialist that describes
the problem studied and the results achieved, focusing on the important
ideas and their significance.

All paper submissions, review and notification of acceptance will be done
electronically through the conference's WWW pages
(http://www.tnlab.ice.uec.ac.jp/icgi06/).
