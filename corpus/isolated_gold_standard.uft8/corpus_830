Meeting Description:

This is an invitation to participate in the conference Preserving the Futur=
e:
Sustainability of Language, Culture and Nature and a Call for Papers. The
conference is organized by the Vigd=EDs Finnbogad=F3ttir Institute of Forei=
gn
Languages at the University of Iceland and will take place in Reykjav=EDk, =
15th-
17th April 2010. It will also celebrate the eightieth birthday of Madame Vi=
gd=EDs
Finnbogad=F3ttir, former President of Iceland and UNESCO's Goodwill Ambassa=
dor for
Languages.

The aim of the conference is to examine and discuss how the relevance and
interaction of languages, the natural environment, and intangible cultural
heritages can ensure the development and prosperity of future generations.
Culture is here intended in its broadest meaning to include history, custom=
s,
traditions and folklore, both past and present; language can be perceived a=
s
both foreign and native, local, regional and international, but with the
constant varying attitudes as to which are taught, which are translated, wh=
ich
are becoming extinct; nature can imply both the beauty, vitality and unique=
ness
of a specific locality, region, or the natural environment of the globe its=
elf.
In all instances we need to explore how a viable interaction between langua=
ge,
culture and/or nature can help create and sustain a sense of identity and
continuity in a world increasingly confronted with rapid environmental and
social change.

Among keynote speakers are:
- Martti Ahtisaari, Former President of the Republic of Finland
- Professor Bernard Comrie, Director of the Department of Linguistics, Max =
Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig
- Professor Claire Kramsch, Director of the Berkeley Language Center, Unive=
rsity
of California, Berkeley=20
