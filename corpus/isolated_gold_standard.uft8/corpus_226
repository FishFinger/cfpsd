Meeting Description:

Syntax in Cognitive Grammar
Czestochowa, Poland
April 9-11, 2010 

Call for Papers

Most older students of linguistics remember that cognitive grammar, as it
emerged in the 1980s from the work of R. Langacker, G. Lakoff, L. Talmy, C.
Fillmore and others, was at first concerned with such issues as the
cognitive/conceptual foundations of linguistic categories and semantics,
cognitive models and frames, prototype theory applied to linguistic
categorization and metaphor. With the focus on meaning, relatively little
attention was paid to the formal aspects of language, especially syntax.
Increasingly more studies of traditional syntactic phenomena appeared in the
nineties, particularly after the publication of R. Langacker's second volume of
Foundations of Cognitive Linguistics. Soon this new "cognitive syntax" took a
slightly different turn and gained a new momentum after A. Goldberg published
her Stanford dissertation and C. Fillmore, in cooperation with P. Kay, started
to work out the principles and formalism of construction grammar. As a result,
Langackerian cognitive grammar and various versions of construction grammar now
offer sophisticated theories of grammatical structure, which make it possible to
describe a growing number of traditional as well as new aspects of the formal
structure of language, viewed as a symbolic unity of form and meaning. We hope
that the conference will provide a suitable forum in which researchers of
different cognitive and functional persuasions can present their ideas and
proposals concerning syntactic theory within the broad cognitive paradigm as
well as studies of particular grammatical problems within the cognitive and
functional frameworks.

The main areas of interest for the conference are:
Morphology viewed as a study of single word constructions 
Idioms as constructions 
Phrasal, sentential and other constructions in the world's languages 
Long-distance dependencies in constructions 
Functional and pragmatic components of constructions 
Constructions in discourse 
Constructional polysemy 
Diachronic construction grammar 
Acquisition of syntax 
Grammaticalization in cognitive grammar 
Contrastive construction grammar 
Cognitive grammar vs. construction grammar vs. functional grammar vs. conceptual
grammar 
Metonymy, metaphor and conceptual blending in syntax 

Abstracts should be 250 words long and anonymous (each participant must give us
the title of the paper and include that title in the abstract but without the
name of the author)

Important Dates:
31/12/2009 - deadline for abstract submission
(contact e-mails: olakalaga.wp.pl , frank@wsl.edu.pl)
30/01/2010 - acceptance notification and first draft of conference programme
09-11/04/2010 - the conference
