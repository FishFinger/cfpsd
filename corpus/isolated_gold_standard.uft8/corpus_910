Meeting Description:=20

The Organising Committee of the next AELCO/SCOLA conference is pleased to a=
nnounce that its 7th meeting will be held in the Palace of Valdeparaiso (Al=
magro) under the auspices of the University of Castilla-La Mancha from Sept=
ember 30th  to October 2nd 2010.

The conference has chosen the topic of "Figuring the World: Cognitive Mecha=
nisms of Thought and Discourse" and aims at creating a forum of debate on t=
hose topics related to Cognitive Linguistics (e.g. the categorization of na=
tural languages, prototypes, metaphor and metonymy, the interaction between=
 syntax and semantics, etc.). It also aims at offering the opportunity to d=
iscuss how people use various cognitive schemas in discourse interaction fo=
cusing on who uses them, in which situations and for which purposes.

Together with plenary talks (one hour), there will be several parallel sess=
ions and thematic sessions (organized according to topic), as well as a pos=
ter session.

In this conference, we will also hold two thematic workshops on two differe=
nt areas within Cognitive Linguistics. Thus, we will have one workshop on C=
ognitive Sociolinguistics and another on Sensorial Perception and the role =
of metaphor and etonymy in its communication. Each of these workshops will =
consist of 5-6 papers including keynote speakers and presentations).

We have invited the following plenary speakers:

- Ricardo Maldonado (U. Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)
- Juana Marin Arrese (U. Complutense de Madrid)
- Daniel Casasanto (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen Ho=
landa)

We will also have two keynote speakers in order to organise and conduct the=
 two Workshops of the conference:

- Carita Paradis (V=E4xjo University, Sweden)
- Dirk Geraeerts (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium)=20
