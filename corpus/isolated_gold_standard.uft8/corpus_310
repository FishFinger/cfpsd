Poland has a strong tradition of research in cognitive linguistics; particu=
larly
in Lodz (the second biggest city in Poland) we have organized a series of
well-attended conferences focusing on the main areas in the field. In 2003 =
the
University of Lodz awarded an Honorary Doctorate to Ronald Langacker. =20

Call for Papers

The aim of the conference is discussing the recent developments in Cognitiv=
e
Poetics and Cognitive Rhetoric. Broadly speaking, Cognitive Poetics (also c=
alled
Cognitive Stylistics) applies the insights from cognitive linguistics to th=
e
analysis of texts. The practitioners of this approach point out its importa=
nce
for literary studies, where it can become an effective analytical tool; but=
 also
its potential in the study of non-literary texts, especially those in which
language has been used in some creative way (as in advertising, linguistic
humour, etc.), as well as the study of visual images or music.=20

Possible areas of interest include, but are not limited to:=20
-  metaphor and metonymy as basic cognitive mechanisms (the use of novel
metaphors in both literary texts and a range of non-literary discourses in
public and interpersonal communication; the literalization of metaphors;
synaesthetic metaphors; pictorial and multimodal metaphors; corpus-based st=
udies
of metaphorical patterns in texts);=20
-  the mechanism of conceptual and formal blending;=20
-  mental imagery and its reflection in language (the figure/ground distrib=
ution
of information, and the reversal of the figure/ground pattern; the manipula=
tion
of the point of view);=20
-  the use of frames, scripts and mental schemas in conceptualization;=20
-  the linguistic construal of text worlds;=20
-  the novel linguistic categorization of reality; etc.   =20

Close to this approach to texts is Cognitive Rhetoric, which we see as focu=
sing
on the study of linguistic devices and strategies used by the authors of
literary, political, or media messages with the aim of affecting the
readers'/recipients' conceptualizations. We are therefore also interested i=
n the
papers examining readers' responses to texts, and the potential of texts to
alter our perspective and way of thinking.

We welcome both more theoretical contributions, and those that offer a deta=
iled
analysis of a particular text. A selection of the papers presented at the
conference will be published in book form.=20

The deadline for outline proposals is 23 November 2009. Please send your
abstracts of up to 300 words, accompanied by your name and institutional
affiliation, in the *.doc or *pdf format, to akwiat@uni.lodz.pl.=20
Notification of acceptance will be sent by 30 November.  =20
