FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

VARIETIES OF VOICE - 3rd international BAAHE conference
7-9 December 2006, University of Leuven, Belgium
http://www.kuleuven.be/ilt/baahe_2006conference/

EXTENDED DEADLINE: 20 August 2006

The Belgian Association of Anglicists in Higher Education (BAAHE) will=20
organize its Third International Conference from 7 to 9 December 2006 at=20
the University of Leuven, Belgium.

This interdisciplinary conference will explore the role played by VOICE in=
=20
various fields of English studies. It will consider:
* the synchronic and diachronic ways in which the (subjective) voice of the=
=20
language user manifests itself linguistically, i.e. in the constructional=20
properties of syntagms used,
* those aspects of academic English that are relevant to helping learners=20
find an appropriate academic voice in speaking and writing.
* the literary status of 'voice': we will inquire into the impact of recent=
=20
theoretical and/or technological developments on how the concept is handled=
=20
in literary studies,

Paper proposals (20 minutes + 10 minutes discussion) are invited on the=20
following questions and issues:

LINGUISTICS
* (inter-)subjective motivations of voice such as
-choice of active vs. passive voice for optimal negotiation of information=
=20
between speaker/hearer;
-evaluative and other subjective effects of middle constructions;
* subjective vs. more objective constructions (e.g. subjective vs.=20
objective modality);
* speech and thought representation: representational vs. subjective uses,=
=20
their impact on point of view;
* the diachronic shift from representational to interpersonal import of=20
constructions;
* other aspects of interpersonal varieties of voice.

ELT-Academic English
* author stance in academic writing: differences between disciplines and=20
cultures (e.g. hedging)
* register varieties: formality in academic genres; diachronic developments
* citation strategies: how and why do writers incorporate other voices in=20
their own writing?
* resentation and seminar skills: tone and register; strategies to voice=20
comments and objections
Exploring the differences between native and non-native speakers, or=20
between learners and experienced speakers, should yield insights into how=20
EAP materials can help learners construct an appropriate academic voice.

Literature
* Is voice still part of 'what is at stake in modernity', as Barthes once=20
argued?
* After deconstruction, does voice exist hors texte? How does it relate to=
=20
=E9criture?
* What is the relation between voice and (point of) view? How does a=20
textual voice acquire authority?
* To what extent is voice a gendered concept?
* Can a literary voice travel across cultures, periods and languages? Is it=
=20
bound to cultural identity?
* Do different voices always imply Bakhtinian polyphony? Does the single,=20
lyrical voice survive in poetry? How crucial is voice in drama and film?

Plenary speakers:
Suzanne Kemmer (Rice University): "Intransitive Structures and Functions"
Ken Hyland (University of London): "Disciplinary voices: interactions in=20
research writing"
Anne Fogarty (University College Dublin): "'I was a Voice': Orality and=20
Silence in Contemporary Irish Women's Poetry"

Selected proceedings will be published in the 2007 issue of the=20
international journal BELL.
