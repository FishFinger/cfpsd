CALL FOR PAPERS 

 Journal of Logic and Computation - Special Issue on Natural Language
 and Knowledge Representation

We cordially invite submissions of articles for a special issue of the
journal of logic and computation <http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/>
on
natural language and knowledge representation. 

Submission deadline: July 31st, 2006.

TOPICS

We believe that the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the
Knowledge
Representation (KR) communities have common goals. They are both
concerned
with representing knowledge and with reasoning, since the best test
for the
semantic capability of an NLP system is performing reasoning
tasks. Having
these two essential common grounds, the two communities ought to have
been
collaborating, to provide a well-suited representation language that
covers
these grounds. However, the two communities also have
difficult-to-meet
concerns. Mainly, the semantic representation (SR) should be
expressive
enough and take the information in context into account, while the KR
should
be equipped with a fast reasoning process.

The main objection against using an SR or a KR is that they need
experts to
be understood. Non-experts communicate (usually) via a natural
language
(NL), and more or less they understand each other while performing a
lot of
reasoning. An essential practical value of representations is their
attempt
to be transparent. This will particularly be useful when/if the system
provides a justification for a user or a knowledge engineer on its
line of
reasoning using the underlying KR (i.e. without generating back to
NL).

We all seem to believe that, compared to Natural Language, the
existing
Knowledge Representation and reasoning systems are poor. Nevertheless,
for a
long time, the KR community has dismissed the idea that NL can be a
KR.
That's because NL can be very ambiguous and there are syntactic and
semantic
processing complexities associated with it. However, researchers in
both
communities have started looking at this issue again. Possibly, it has
to do
with the NLP community making some progress in terms of processing and
handling ambiguity, the KR community realising that a lot of knowledge
is
already 'coded' in NL and that one should reconsider the way they
handle
expressivity and ambiguity.

For this special journal issue of logic and computation, we invite the
submission of original high quality articles.   Topics for this
special
issue include but not limited to:

+ A novel NL-like KR or building on an existing one

+ Reasoning systems that benefit from properties of NL to reason with
NL

+ Semantic representation used as a KR : compromise between
expressivity 
+ and
efficiency? 

+ More Expressive KR for NL understanding (Any compromise?)

+ Any work exploring how existing representations fall short of 
+ addressing some problems involved in modelling, manipulating or 
+ reasoning (whether reasoning as used to get an interpretation for a 
+ certain utterance, exchange of utterances or what utterances follow 
+ from other utterances) with NL documents

+ Representations that show how classical logics are not as efficient,
transparent, expressive or where a one-step application of an
inference rule
require more (complex) steps in a classical environment and
vice-versa; i.e.
how classical logics are more powerful, etc. 

+ Building a reasoning test collection for natural language 
+ understanding
systems: any kind of reasoning (deductive, abductive, etc); for a
deductive
test suite see for e.g. deliverable 16 of the FraCas project. Also,
look at
textual entailment challenges 1 and 2. 

+ Comparative results (on a common test suite or a common task) of 
+ different representations or systems that reason with NL (again any 
+ kind of reasoning). The comparison could be either for efficiency, 
+ transparency or expressivity

+ Knowledge acquisition systems or techniques that benefit from 
+ properties of NL to acquire knowledge already "coded" in NL

+ Automated Reasoning, Theorem Proving and KR communities views on all 
+ this

+ Challenges in Natural Language and Reasoning

+ Where is the NLP or KR community going wrong/right in meeting the
challenges?
