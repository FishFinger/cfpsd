             Exploring Syntactically Annotated Corpora 
              Workshop to be held on July 14th 
                  CORPUS LINGUISTICS 2005 
            University of Birmingham, 14-17 July 
            http://www.bultreebank.org/ESyntAC/ 


Deadline Extended to 03.06.2005


Workshop motivation and aims 

A lot of syntactically annotated corpora have been created 
recently for various languages. Therefore, the question of 
applicability and usefulness of such resources seems to have 
become of big importance. Syntactically annotated corpora can be 
viewed in two ways: 1) as a reliable base for resource creation: 
further annotation (for example, semantic and discourse 
annotation); automatic extraction of linguistic knowledge 
(grammar and lexicon extraction; creation of automatic parsing 
tools etc.) and environment for testing tools.; 2) as a base for 
navigation and search: query languages and support engines. 


We envisage a one-day workshop and 10-12 presentations. 

Topics of interest: 

- creation of resources  on top of syntactic corpora; 
- various kinds of knowledge extraction; 
- creation and testing of parsing tools; 
- search languages; 
- symbolic and subsymbolic methods for syntactic corpora 
exploration; 
- software systems for management and accessibility to 
syntactically annotated corpora; 
- various applications of  syntactic corpora. 

Important dates 

Deadline for workshop abstract submission: 29th May 2005 

Notification of acceptance: 15th June 2005 

Final version of paper: 30th June 2005 

Submissions 

Papers should describe existing research connected to the topics 
of the workshop. The presentation at the workshop will be 30 
minutes long (25 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for 
questions and discussion). Each submission should show: title; 
author(s); affiliation(s); and contact author's e-mail address, 
postal address, telephone and fax numbers. Abstracts (maximum 500 
words, plain-text format) should be sent to:
