First Call for Papers

We are pleased to announce DiSS-LPSS Joint Workshop 2010, a satellite meeting of
INTERSPEECH 2010, to be held in Tokyo, Japan, on September 25-26, 2010.

DiSS is a series of interdisciplinary workshops (Berkeley, 1999; Edinburgh,
2001; Goteborg, 2003; Aix-en-Provence, 2005), which have been addressing
disfluency --- stalls, hesitations, and self-repairs --- in normal spontaneous
speech from a wide range of disciplines, from automatic speech recognition to
linguistic analysis and psycholinguistics.  LPSS, another interdisciplinary
workshop on spontaneous speech, took place in Taiwan in 2006, focusing on a
broader range of phenomena in spontaneous speech including automatic speech
recognition, prosody, spoken dialogues, and disfluency. Now, it is an
opportunity for both organizations to meet.

We invite you to submit original papers in any related area, including but not 
limited to:
- Characteristics of disfluency in spontaneous speech
- Human production and perception of speech errors, repairs and hesitations
- Neurocognitive correlates of speech disfluency
- Comparison of normal disfluencies with those occurring in communication  disorders
- Prosody in spontaneous speech
- Linguistic analyses on spontaneous speech 
- Automatic speech recognition of spontaneous speech
- Understanding spontaneous speech in dialogue systems
- Corpora of spontaneous speech
- Automatic or manual annotation of spontaneous speech data
- Comparison of spontaneous speech and read speech

We would welcome submission of 4-page papers by May 31, 2010, for review.  All 
accepted papers will be published in CD-ROM proceedings.

Important dates:  
Deadline for full-paper submission: May 31, 2010
Acceptance notification to authors: July 15, 2010 
Deadline for camera-ready paper: August 31, 2010 
Workshop dates: September 25-26, 2010

Organizing Chairs:
Kikuo Maekawa (National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics)
Yasuharu Den (Chiba University)
