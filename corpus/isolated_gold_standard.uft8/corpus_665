Meeting Description:

The North American Conference on Afroasiatic Linguistics (NACAL) 
provides scholars from North America and around the world with a venue 
to discuss the Afroasiatic language phylum. Now in its 35th year, NACAL 
has held annual meetings since 1973. Meetings are held in tandem with 
the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society, which shares a joint 
session with NACAL. Previous meetings have been held in Ann Arbor, 
Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, 
New Haven, San Diego, Seattle, Toronto, and several other cities in the 
United States and Canada. 

Papers are solicited for the 35th annual meeting of the North American 
Conference on Afroasiatic Linguistics (NACAL 35), which will be held in 
San Antonio, Texas, USA from March 16-18, 2006 (Friday-Sunday).

Papers on linguistic topics relevant to the languages of the Afroasiatic 
phylum (Chadic, Berber, Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian, Semitic) are 
requested. While all topics relating to aspects of Afroasiatic languages will 
be considered, including phonology, grammar, syntax, synchrony, 
diachrony, sociolinguistics, and epigraphy, the 35th meeting will be 
dedicated to the memory of Robert Hetzron (1937-1997). The organizer 
strongly urges prospective participants to consider submitting papers 
related to Hetzron's interests, including:

- Comparative Studies,
- Semantic Analysis,
- Theoretical Aspects of Grammar,
- Translation Studies,
- Textual Analysis.

These topics should be considered as general guidelines and are not 
intended to be exclusive. No original paper will be rejected on account of 
its subject, so long as it relates to the languages of the Afroasiatic phylum 
and it meets the standards established by previous conferences. 

Abstracts describing the precise topic treated with a length of 
approximately 200-300 words can be sent as an electronic version (pdf or 
word document) or as a paper copy to the addresses specified on the 
registration page. The deadline for submission is December 1st, 2006.  For 
more information, please visit our website at www.nacal.org.

Please feel free to distribute this announcement widely.

Meeting Description:

Founded in 1980, the Spanish in the US Conference brings together 
researchers from various disciplines - such as linguistics, sociology, 
anthropology, education, and legal studies - investigating a wide range of 
topics related to Spanish and Spanish-speaking communities in the United 
States. Since 1991, the Spanish in the US Conference has been held in 
conjunction with the Spanish in Contact with Other Languages Conference, 
allowing productive connections between researchers focusing on the US 
context and researchers investigating the entire Spanish-speaking world.  
In recent years, interest and participation have increased dramatically, 
thanks to both the growing public and scholarly recognition of Spanish-
speaking communities in the United States. 

Plenary speakers:
Carol Klee, University of Minnesota
Luis Moll, University of Arizona
Rachel Moran, University of California-Berkeley
Alejandro Portes, Princeton University

Roundtables:
In addition to plenary addresses and individual papers, the 2007 
conference will host two special roundtables designed to encourage 
interaction between academic researchers and professionals working 
outside of academia: 
-  Spanish and the media, organized by María Carreira (California State 
University-Long Beach).
-  Educational policies and practices affecting Spanish in the US, organized 
by Ana Roca (Florida International University). 

Spanish in the U.S. & Spanish in Contact with Other Languages

Abstract submissions are invited for papers on original, unpublished 
research on any area related to Spanish in the United States or Spanish in 
contact with other languages including but not limited to the following: 
bilingualism, educational policies and practices, formal aspects of US

language and the law, language change, language contact, language 
ideologies, language in politics and politics of language, language 
maintenance, language planning, language policy, language rights, 
linguistic variation, mass media and Spanish, Spanish in the professions, 
and Spanish and the economy.
