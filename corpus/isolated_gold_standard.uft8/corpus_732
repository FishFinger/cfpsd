Meeting Description:

Invitation:
We are very pleased to invite you to the 11th International conference 'The
Science of Aphasia' to be held in Potsdam, Germany, from August 27th to
September 1st, 2010 at the University of Potsdam.

The SoA 11 conference will bring together experts in biolinguistic theory w=
ith
experts in the neurocognition of language and experts in animal communicati=
on.
All three areas of research are by definition interdisciplinary fields and =
will
be represented by leading researchers working on functional aspects as well=
 as
neurophysiological ones.

Biolinguistics defines language as a product of biological adaptation in th=
e
Darwinian sense. The questions addressed in this conference concern the
contributions of studies on aphasia, dyslexia and neuroimaging in advancing=
 our
knowledge of the nature of the biological bases of human language. Potsdam,=
 the
conference site, is the largest university of the German Federal state of
Brandenburg and ideally located close to Berlin. Affectionately called the =
city
of royal residence, castles, palatial parks, and striking architecture mark=
 the
Potsdam landscape. With its variety of social and and cultural offerings,
abundance of lakes and green nature, and proximity to Berlin, Potsdam offer=
s for
many the best of all worlds.

We look forward to meeting you in Potsdam
