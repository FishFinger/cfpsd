AIMS:

LATA is a yearly conference in theoretical computer science and its
applications. As linked to the International PhD School in Formal
Languages and Applications that was developed at Rovira i Virgili
University (the host of the previous three editions and co-organizer
of this one) in the period 2002-2006, LATA 2010 will reserve
significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their
career. It will aim at attracting contributions from both classical
theory fields and application areas (bioinformatics, systems biology,
language technology, artificial intelligence, etc.).

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

- algebraic language theory
- algorithms on automata and words
- automata and logic
- automata for system analysis and programme verification
- automata, concurrency and Petri nets
- cellular automata
- combinatorics on words
- computability
- computational complexity
- computer linguistics
- data and image compression
- decidability questions on words and languages
- descriptional complexity
- DNA and other models of bio-inspired computing
- document engineering
- foundations of finite state technology
- fuzzy and rough languages
- grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, multidimensional,
  unification, categorial, etc.)
- grammars and automata architectures
- grammatical inference and algorithmic learning
- graphs and graph transformation
- language varieties and semigroups
- language-based cryptography
- language-theoretic foundations of artificial intelligence and
  artificial life
- neural networks
- parallel and regulated rewriting
- parsing
- pattern matching and pattern recognition
- patterns and codes
- power series
- quantum, chemical and optical computing
- semantics
- string and combinatorial issues in computational biology and
  bioinformatics
- symbolic dynamics
- term rewriting
- text algorithms
- text retrieval
- transducers
- trees, tree languages and tree machines
- weighted machines

STRUCTURE:

LATA 2010 will consist of:

- 3 invited talks
- 2 invited tutorials
- refereed contributions
- open sessions for discussion in specific subfields, on open
  problems, or on professional issues (if requested by the
  participants)
