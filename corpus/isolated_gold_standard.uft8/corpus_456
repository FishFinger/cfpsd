Workshop ''Multilingualism and universal principles of language change''

The topic of this workshop is the role multilingualism has in processes of
language change. The central question is to what extent a multilingual or
multidialectal situation can be the trigger for linguistic change. In this
context, we want to discuss how socio-linguistic and/or individual aspects of
multilingualism are, on the one hand, preconditions for linguistic change and
induce, on the other hand, certain patterns of language change. Which domains of
grammar (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) are particularly involved in
this?

This leads to the question on the base of which empirical factors linguistic
change that has been induced by multilingualism can be ascertained in a given
case. For historical instances of multilingualism, there is the further
difficulty of the methodological approach, since there are only written sources
as a data basis.

The questions outlined above will be looked at from different theoretical points
of view. Furthermore, it is intended to discuss a variety of phenomena and
languages in this context.


Presentations will be 30 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion.
