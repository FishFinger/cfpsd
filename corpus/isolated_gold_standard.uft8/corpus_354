Meeting Description:

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is the leading conference dedicated to computational learning in the context of theoretical neuroscience. It should be of interest to linguists who care about the state of the art in learning algorithms and in their application to understanding brain function. 

Submissions are solicited for the Twentieth Annual meeting of an interdisciplinary Conference (December 4-7, 2006) which brings together researchers interested in all aspects of neural and statistical processing and computation.  The Conference will include invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers.  It is single track and highly selective. Preceding the main Conference will be one day of Tutorials (December 4, 2006), and following it will be two days of Workshops at Whistler/Blackcomb ski resort (December 8 and 9, 2006).

Call Deadline: 20-Jun-2006 

Meeting Description:

(Non-)Commitment and in French (non-)prise en charge) are notions which are fairly often used in the analysis of certain types of linguistic phenomena but are hardly ever the subject of explicit investigation in their own right. This conference welcomes theoretical and empirical contributions within both the French and the Anglo-American linguistic tradition addressing the issue in its own right or in terms of its role in different linguistic phenomena. 

-Pour le texte français de description voir le site web du colloque (www.ua.ac.be/commitment).

* The notion of commitment
(Non-)Commitment ((non-)prise en charge in French) is a notion which is fairly often used in the analysis of certain types of linguistic phenomena (sometimes under the guise of other la-bels, such as performativity) - e.g. in the analysis of speech acts, of semantic categories such as modality, evidentiality and subjectivity, of different forms of reported speech, and of cer-tain tenses and moods. But it is hardly ever the subject of explicit investigation in its own right. 

* Goal of the conference
The aim of this conference is to bring together research which crucially draws on the notion of (non-)commitment in one or another way, in an attempt to achieve a better understanding of the nature and the extension of the notion itself. It welcomes theoretical and empirical con-tributions addressing the issue in its own right or in terms of its role in any relevant linguistic or conceptual phenomenon, using any kind of methodological approach, and coming from any kind of theoretical background. One section of the conference will be devoted to typological contributions, next to other sections dealing with grammatical or lexical markers or strategies of (non-)commitment in the Romance and Germanic languages.

* Theoretical problems pertaining to the notion 
The theoretical issues addressed in this conference can be summarized in terms of five central questions:
A) To what does (non-)commitment apply? What are possible objects or (aspects of) ob-jects of (non-)commitment (elements of form, of meaning)?
B) Who commits him/herself? Who is the agent of the commitment (which instance of the speaker)? 
C) When does (non-)commitment apply? Only at the moment of speech, or also at other times?
D) What is the nature of (non-)commitment? Are there different forms or degrees of it?
E) How is (non-)commitment taken? Under which conditions and by means of which forms, mechanisms or strategies is it signalled?

* Conference languages
In view of the fact that the notion of (non-)commitment or (non-)prise en charge ((non )responsibilité) is quite manifestly present in the French linguistic tradition (especially in the af-termath of the work of Benveniste), more so than in the Anglo-American tradition, the present conference also explicitly aims to establish communication on the issue between these 'geo-graphical' research traditions. Therefore, the conference will feature presentations in French as well as in English.

* Deadline for abstract submission is June 20, 2006

* Format and evaluation of abstracts
- Abstracts will be refereed anonymously.
- Abstracts are to be submitted as an attachment in Word or Rich Text Format to an email sent to commitment2007@ua.ac.be. Your abstract should be in French or in English (please use the language of the actual presentation). It should not exceed 500 words (references not included). Please include the title but do not mention the name of the author(s). Use Times Roman 12 and single spacing, and make sure to embed TrueType Fonts for special characters (cf. typological studies).
- The email accompanying the abstract should contain the title of the presentation (iden-tical to the title indicated on the abstract in the attachment), the name of the author(s), and their full coordinates (affiliation, postal address, email address).
- Notification of acceptance/rejection: late August 2006.

* Conference registration
Registration fee: 80 Euro. Special registration fees apply to members of the Linguistic Society of Belgium, please check the website (www.bkl-cbl.be) for details.
