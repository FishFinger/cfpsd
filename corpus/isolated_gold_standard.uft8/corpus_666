Meeting Description:

Workshop on Theories of Information Dynamics and Interaction and their
Application to Dialogue
http://www.irit.fr/~Laure.Vieu/Esslli10

Workshop organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language=
 and
Information, ESSLLI 2010 (http://esslli2010cph.info/) August 16-20 (ESSLLI =
2nd
week) 2010, Copenhagen=20

Call for Papers

Workshop Purpose and Topics:
Theoretical approaches to communication and dialogue modeling are varied an=
d
often unrelated because separately focusing on different aspects of dialogu=
e
(speech acts, goals, beliefs, plans, questions, conventions, roles, coopera=
tion,
disputes, argumentation, reference, semantics-pragmatics interface...). On =
the
other hand, the area of foundations of multi-agent systems is inducing new
developments in logics of interaction and information dynamics, with a rece=
nt
trend towards comparison and integration. Analyzing the impact of this tren=
d on
communication and dialogue modeling is timely.

This workshop aims at discussing formal theories and logics of information
dynamics and interaction and their applications to dialogue and communicati=
on
modeling. It is intended to bring together logicians, linguists and compute=
r
scientists in order to provide a better understanding of the potentialities=
 and
limitations of formal methods for the analysis of dialogue and communicatio=
n.
Its scope includes not only the technical aspects of logics, but also
multidisciplinary aspects from linguistics, philosophy of language, philoso=
phy
of social reality, social sciences (social psychology, economics).

The following are some examples of formal theories and logics that are rele=
vant
to the workshop (no order):
-  speech act theory,
-  argumentation theory,
-  game theory,
-  public announcement logic,
-  dynamic epistemic logic (DEL),
-  logics of agency and power (e.g. STIT, ATL, Coalition Logic),
-  theories of persuasion,
-  theories of commitment,
-  dynamic semantics,
-  semantic approaches to interrogative clauses,
-  rhetorical approaches to dialogue (e.g., segmented discourse representat=
ion
theory).

The focus of the workshop will be on recent developments, especially those =
that
combine several approaches (e.g. dynamic epistemic logic and speech act the=
ory,
dynamic epistemic logic and segmented discourse representation theory, publ=
ic
announcement logic and commitment theories, STIT and dynamic epistemic logi=
c,
Coalition Logic and public announcement logic...) to deal with complex dial=
ogue
and communication phenomena.
