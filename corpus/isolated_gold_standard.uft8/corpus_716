Meeting Description:

Computability in Europe 2010: Programs, Proofs, Processes
Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal
June 30 to July 4, 2010
http://www.cie2010.uac.pt/

Computability in Europe provides the largest international conference dealing
with the full spectrum of computability-related research.

CiE 2010 in the Azores is the sixth conference of the Series, held in a
geographically unique and dramatic location, Europe's most Westerly outpost. The
theme of CiE 2010 - 'Programs, Proofs, Processes' - points to the usual CiE
synergy of Computer Science, Mathematics and Logic, with important
computability-theoretic connections to science and the real universe.

Special tribute to Marian Pour-el: Ning Zhong.

CiE serves as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of
computability and foundations of computer science, as well as the interplay of
these theoretical areas with practical issues in computer science and with other
disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.

Formal systems, attendant proofs, and the possibility of their computer
generation and manipulation (for instance, into programs) have been changing a
whole spectrum of disciplines. The conference will address not only the more
established lines of research of Computational Complexity and the interplay
between Proofs and Computation, but also novel views that rely on physical and
biological processes and models to find new ways of tackling computations and
improving their efficiency.

We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different parts of the
research community. Since women are underrepresented in mathematics and
computer science, we emphatically encourage submissions by female authors.
The Elsevier Foundation is supporting the CiE conference series in the programme
"Increasing representation of female researchers in the computability
community". This programme will allow us to fund child-care support, a mentoring
system for young female researchers, and also a small number of grants for
junior female researchers (see below).

The dates around the submission process are as follows:

Paola Bonizzoni (Milano), Alessandra Carbone (Paris), Steve Cook
(Toronto ON), Barry Cooper (Leeds), Erzsebet Csuhaj-Varju (Budapest), Fernando
Ferreira (Lisbon, co-chair), Nicola Galesi (Rome), Luis Mendes Gomes (Ponta
Delgada), Rosalie Iemhoff (Utrecht), Achim Jung (Birmingham), Michael Kaminski

The Programme Committee cordially invites all researchers in the area of the
conference to submit their papers (in PDF-format, at most 10 pages) for
presentation at CiE 2010.

The best of the accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
within the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of Springer, which
will be available at the conference. Authors of accepted papers are expected to
present their work at the conference. Submitted papers must describe work not
previously published, and they must neither be accepted nor under review at a
journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings.

All papers need to be prepared in LNCS-style LaTeX. Papers must not exceed
10 pages. Full proofs may appear in a technical appendix which will be read at
the reviewers' discretion. Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the
Programme Committee are not allowed.

Papers that have only student authors are eligible for the "CiE 2010 Best
Student Paper Award." If your submission satisfies the requirements, please
submit your paper in the category "Regular paper (eligible for Best Student
Paper Award)." The Programme Committee will select the best submission among
these after acceptance. The recipient of the Best Student Paper Award will get a
fee waiver of the registration fee, a certificate, and a small symbolic cash prize.

Funded by the Elsevier Foundation's programme 'Women in Computability' we shall
offer five travel grants (covering registration fee and up to 300 EUR in
reimbursement for travel and accomodation expenses) for junior female
researchers. More information will become available in March 2010.

Funded by the Elsevier journal Annals of Pure and Applied Logic (APAL), the
organizers are offering a number of travel grants (including fee waivers and a
modest reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses) for students to
attend CiE 2010. Student authors of accepted papers will have priority for these
grants.

The Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL) sponsors modest student member travel
grants. See http://www.aslonline.org/studenttravelawards.html

New funding opportunities are expected to be offered. For more details
concerning funding and up to date information, please consult regularly the web
page of the conference http://www.cie2010.uac.pt/
