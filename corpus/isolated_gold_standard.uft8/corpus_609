Meeting Description:

10th International Pragmatics Conference 
July 9-14, 2007

Panel Theme: 

Meeting medical and patient concerns in prenatal consultations: evidence 
from multicultural contexts 

Chaired by: Olga Zayts & M. Agnes Kang (University of Hong Kong)

Panel Theme: 

Meeting medical and patient concerns in prenatal consultations: evidence from
multicultural contexts 

We would like to propose a panel on the above theme for the next International
Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg, Sweden, and we would be interested in hearing
from researchers working on the topic of prenatal consultations who may wish to
participate in the panel. We are especially interested in bringing together
researchers working in various countries and cultural contexts who use a
qualitative data-based approach to prenatal consultation data. 

The field of research in medical interaction and communication has grown 
significantly in the past several decades. One trend that has been particularly
influential in increasing awareness of the need for better communication in the
medical field has been the focus on patient-centered health care. Mishler's
(1984) now classic study of the tensions between the 'voice of medicine' and the
'voice of the lifeworld' has laid the groundwork for recognizing that health
care providers and patients are not always working in cooperation when attending
to health care issues. This finding has served as an important insight into
primary and secondary care consultations. 

Prenatal consultations differ from primary and other secondary care
consultations in significant ways. For example, these do not generally involve a
patient complaint regarding pain or injury, and patients are all female and fall
within a certain age range. It is hoped that by bringing researchers together
working on prenatal consultations, we may be able to address various issues,
including but limited to: 

-How can prenatal consultations be characterized with respect to other 
health care encounters? 
-What are the medical concerns and patient concerns that may be particular 
to the prenatal context, and how are these evidenced in interaction? 
-What linguistic and interactional features may contribute to a patient-centered
approach to prenatal consultations? 
-How do prenatal consultations compare across geographic and cultural 
contexts and how do they differ? 

We look forward to meeting other researchers working in this area, and hope 
to collaborate with authors to publish the papers from the panel after the 
conference. 

The organizers of this panel have been working on videotaped data of prenatal
consultations in Hong Kong; specifically, consultations with older mothers at
higher risk for Down Syndrome. We have been struck by the various means by which
both medical concerns and patient concerns are addressed in the consultations
and wish to explore the linguistic and interactional means by which these
concerns are addressed. 

We would like to invite those interested in participating to send a 350-word
abstract describing their data, approach, and research focus to:
zaytshkucc.hku.hk and makanghkucc.hku.hk by 25th August 2006. Please include:
title of paper, author name and affiliation, and contact details.
