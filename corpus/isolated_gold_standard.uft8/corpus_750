Linguapolis Summer School on Design-Based Research 

Date: 22-Aug-2010 - 27-Aug-2010 
Location: Antwerp, Belgium 
Contact: Ann Aerts 
Contact Email: ann.aerts@ua.ac.be 
Meeting URL: http://summerschool.linguapolis.be 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics 

Meeting Description: 

Linguapolis, the Institute for Language and Communication of the University
of Antwerp, organises, from 22 to 27 August 2010, a Summer School course on
qualitative and quantitative research methods in language learning and
teaching: 

A Toolbox for Design-Based Research 

Lecturers are Sven De Maeyer, PhD and Vincent Donche, PhD (Institute of
Education and Information Sciences, University of Antwerp).

The course will focus on methodological considerations in designing and
conducting empirical research. We will highlight the practical issues
involved in the use of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
Insight will be given into the most commonly used data-collection
techniques such as surveys, interviews, and observation. Further we will
analyse how to generate more data-driven conclusions.

The target group are researchers in language learning and teaching who need
to investigate user data or results of specific design practices and
experiments in a more evidence-based manner. The number of participants is
limited to 25. Timely registration (or reservation) is therefore necessary.

This Summer School can be combined with Antwerp CALL 2010: Motivation and
beyond (18-20 August 2010). Participants of CALL 2010 get a reduction for
the Summer School. 

Check http://summerschool.linguapolis.be for more information and
registration or contact ann.aerts@ua.ac.be
