Natural Language Processing for Metadata Extraction
                          (NLP4ME 2006)
             http://www.bultreebank.org/NLP4ME2006/
      Workshop to be held on September 12th as part of the
                      AIMSA 2006 Conference

Workshop Motivation and Aims

In spite of the massive amount of work in the last years in the  area of Semantic Web, the problem of the creation of semantically  annotated electronic content is still one of the main bottlenecks  for the Semantic Web technology. A key technology, which is  employed to overcome this problem is Natural Language Processing,  because most of the content of the web is still textual. Any  support for automatic and semi-automatic extraction, elicitation  of metadata to such content will be of great assistance to the  authors and users of the web content.

The workshop aims at being a forum for researchers to present  their work in the area of semantic annotation, key word  extraction, practical compositional semantics etc. It will  provide an opportunity to present and discuss original methods  for identification of metadata in text, semantic annotation of  text, dealing with multilingual content, interconnecting metadata with ontologies, etc.

Topics of interest are connected with, but not limited to the  following suggestions:

- standards for metadata
- extraction of metadata from texts
- metadata and ontologies
- extraction of concepts and keyphrases from text
- metadata in a multilingual environment

ABSTRACT FORMAT AND CONTENT

Abstracts submitted must represent original, unpublished research. Abstracts should be anonymous, clearly titled and no more than 450 words in length. They should also fit on one page, with an optional second page for references or figures if required. Abstracts longer than 450 words will be rejected without being evaluated. Please note the word count at the bottom of the abstract. Note that words counts need not include the abstract title or the list of references.

A suggested format and style for abstracts is available at:
http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/template.html

An excellent example of how to formulate the content of the abstract can be found on the LSA website at:
http://www.lsadc.org/info/dec02bulletin/model.html

The criteria used by the reviewers to evaluate abstracts can be found at:
 http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/reviewprocess.html#rate


All abstracts must be submitted as PDF documents. Specific instructions for how to create PDF documents are available at:
http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/pdfinfo.html.
If you encounter a problem creating a PDF file, please contact us for further assistance. Please use the first author's last name as the file name (eg. Smith.pdf). No author information should appear anywhere in the contents of the PDF file itself.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Electronic submission: To facilitate the abstract submission process, abstracts will be submitted using the form available at the conference website at http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/abstract.htm. Specific instructions for abstract submission are available on this website. Abstracts will be accepted between March 15 and May 15. Contact information for each author must be submitted via webform. No author information should appear anywhere in the abstract PDF. At the time of submission you will be asked whether you would like your abstract to be considered for a poster, a paper, or both. Although each author may submit as many abstracts as desired, we will accept for presentation by each author: (a) a maximum of 1 first authored paper/poster, and (b) a maximum of 2 papers/posters in any authorship status. Note that no changes in authorship (including deleting an author or changing author order) will be possible after the review process is completed or for publicat!
 ion in the conference proceedings.

DEADLINE

All submissions must be received by 8:00 PM EST, May 15, 2006. Late abstracts will not be considered, whatever the reason for the delay. We regret that we cannot accept abstract submissions by fax or email. Submissions via surface mail will only be accepted in special circumstances, on a case by case basis. Please contact us well in advance of the submission deadline (May 15, 2006) to make these arrangements.

ABSTRACT SELECTION

Each abstract is blind reviewed by 5 reviewers from a panel of approximately 100 international scholars. Further information about the review process is available  at http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/APPLIED/BUCLD/reviewprocess.html. Acknowledgment of receipt of the abstract will be sent by email as soon as possible after receipt. Notice of acceptance or rejection will be sent to first authors only, in early August, by email. Pre-registration materials and preliminary schedule will be available in late August, 2006. If your abstract is accepted, you will need to submit a 150-word abstract including title, author(s) and affiliation(s) for inclusion in the conference handbook. Guidelines will be provided along with notification of acceptance. Abstracts accepted as papers will be invited for publication in the BUCLD Proceedings. Abstracts accepted as posters will be invited for publication online only, but not in the printed version. All conference papers will be selected on the b!
 asis of abstracts submitted. Although each abstract will be evaluated individually, we will attempt to honor requests to schedule accepted papers together in group sessions. No schedule changes will be possible once the schedule is set. Scheduling requests for religious reasons only must be made before the review process is complete (i.e. at the time of submission). A space is provided on the abstract submission webform to specify such requests.
