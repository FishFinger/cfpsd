PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

SPIRE 2006 - String Processing and Information Retrieval
11-13 October 2006, Glasgow, Scotland
(http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/spire06/)

Submission date: 14 April, 2006

SPIRE 2006 is the 13th Symposium on String Processing and
Information Retrieval. The first four editions focused primarily
on string  processing and South America, and were called WSP
(South American Workshop on String Processing). Starting in 1998,
the focus of the workshop was broadened to include the area of
information retrieval due to its increasing relevance and its
inter-relationship with the area of string processing. In
addition, since 2000, the conference venue has been in Europe in
even years.

The symposium will be organised by the University of Strathclyde,
in Glasgow and chaired by Prof. Fabio Crestani. Glasgow is
Scotland's largest city and is surrounded by some of the most
breathtaking scenery in Western Europe, made famous down the years
in verse and song. Today, the city has emerged as the cultural,
commercial and convention capital of Scotland. The finest specimen
of Victorian architecture in Europe according to the late poet
laureate Sir John Betjeman, the city made ships and gigantic
locomotives and powerful machines. But most of all, it made
friends. The world has been meeting in Glasgow for over a hundred
years. In 1888 eleven million visitors attended the International
Exhibition of Industry, Science and Art. Nine million visitors
came to the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901 and the
Empire Exhibition of 1938 attracted over thirteen million
visitors. The tradition has continued with the city hosting the
National Garden Festival in 1988, the Cultural Capital of Europe
in 1990, the UK City of Architecture and Design 1999 and was
European Capital of Sport in 2003.

TOPICS:

SPIRE 2006 covers research in all aspects of string processing,
information retrieval, computational biology, pattern matching,
semi-structured data, and related applications. Typical topics of
interest include (but are not limited to):

String Processing: dictionary algorithms, text searching, pattern
matching, text compression, text mining, natural language
processing, and automata based string processing.

Information Retrieval (IR): IR modelling, indexing, ranking and
filtering, interface design, visualisation, cross-lingual IR
systems, multimedia IR, digital libraries, collaborative
retrieval, and Web related applications.

Interaction of biology and computation: DNA sequencing and
applications in molecular biology, evolution and phylogenetics,
recognition of genes and regulatory elements, and sequence driven
protein structure prediction.

Information Retrieval languages and applications: XML, SGML,
information retrieval from semistrutured data, text mining, and
generation of structured data from text.

PROGRAM COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRS:

- Paolo Ferragina, Univ. of Pisa, Italy
- Mark Sanderson, Univ. of Sheffield, UK

CONFERENCE CHAIR:

- Fabio Crestani, Univ. of Strathclyde, UK

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

Details about submission instructions will appear soon on the
symposium web site on: http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/external/spire06/.
The proceedings will be published by Springer- Verlag in the LNCS
series (pending final approval).
