of the paper is September 12, 2005.
The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in LaTeX
format, using the llncs2e document class. Please refer to the
instructions found on Springer website

Alternatively, if you prefer to work in WYSIWIG environment,
you can submit your article in OpenOffice 1.1 format, with standard
fonts. If you need to use any special fonts, make sure they are
Truetype fonts with correct unicode table, and include the font with
your article. As a last resort, authors can submit their articles
using MS WORD (at least version 97), but they must use the LNCS

into OpenOffice, with any eventual loss of formatting being a sole
