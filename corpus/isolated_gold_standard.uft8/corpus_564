Meeting Description:

Organizing a panel on pragmatic markers with a focus on items other than DMs,

markers (in the classification of Fraser 1996). In keeping with the special
theme of the conference, we would like contributions to reflect on issues of
corpora and data collection. Historical and comparative approaches welcome. 

Bruce Fraser and Neal Norrick are organizing a panel on pragmatic markers for
the 10th International Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg, Sweden, 9-13 July
2007. Maj-Britt Mosegaard Hansen has already agreed to participate and provide
a historical pragmatics perspective. If you have relevant research to report and
you're interested in joining us in Göteborg, contact Neal Norrick at
n.norrick@mx.uni-saarland.de.
