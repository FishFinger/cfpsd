Meeting Description:

The Organising Committee of the next AELCO/SCOLA conference is pleased to
announce that its 7th meeting will be held in the Palace of Valdeparaiso
(Almagro) under the auspices of the University of Castilla-La Mancha from
September 30th  to October 2nd 2010.

The conference has chosen the topic of "Figuring the World: Cognitive Mecha=
nisms
of Thought and Discourse" and aims at creating a forum of debate on those t=
opics
related to Cognitive Linguistics (e.g. the categorization of natural langua=
ges,
prototypes, metaphor and metonymy, the interaction between syntax and seman=
tics,
etc.). It also aims at offering the opportunity to discuss how people use
various cognitive schemas in discourse interaction focusing on who uses the=
m, in
which situations and for which purposes.

Together with plenary talks (one hour), there will be several parallel sess=
ions
and thematic sessions (organized according to topic), as well as a poster s=
ession.

In this conference, we will also hold two thematic workshops on two differe=
nt
areas within Cognitive Linguistics. Thus, we will have one workshop on Cogn=
itive
Sociolinguistics and another on Sensorial Perception and the role of metaph=
or
and etonymy in its communication. Each of these workshops will consist of 5=
-6
papers including keynote speakers and presentations).

We have invited the following plenary speakers:

- Ricardo Maldonado (U. Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)
- Juana Marin Arrese (U. Complutense de Madrid)
- Daniel Casasanto (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen Ho=
landa)

We will also have two keynote speakers in order to organise and conduct the=
 two
Workshops of the conference:

- Carita Paradis (V=E4xjo University, Sweden)
- Dirk Geraeerts (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium)=20
