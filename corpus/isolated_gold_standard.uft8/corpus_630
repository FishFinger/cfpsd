Thank you very much,

                  ACL-07 Preliminary Call For Papers

                     45th Annual Meeting of the 
             Association for Computational Linguistics

                         June 24 - 29, 2007
                       Prague, Czech Republic

                       http://www.acl2007.org

        * * * Submission deadline: January 23, 2007 * * *

General Conference Chair:
     John Carroll (University of Sussex, UK)

Program Co-Chairs:
     Annie Zaenen (PARC, U.S.A.)
     Antal van den Bosch (Tilburg University, The Netherlands)

Local Organization Chair:
     Eva Hajicova (Charles University, Czech Republic)

The Association for Computational Linguistics invites the submission
of papers for its 45th Annual Meeting. Papers are invited on
substantial, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of
computational linguistics, including, but not limited to: pragmatics,
semantics, syntax, grammars and the lexicon; phonetics, phonology and
morphology; lexical semantics and ontologies; word segmentation,
tagging and chunking; parsing; generation and summarization; language
modeling, spoken language recognition and understanding; linguistic,
psychological and mathematical models of language; document retrieval,
question answering, information extraction, and text mining; machine
learning for natural language; corpus-based modeling of language,
discourse and dialogue; multi-lingual processing, machine translation
and translation aids; multi-modal and natural language interfaces and
dialogue systems; applications, tools and resources; and evaluation of
systems.


Requirements

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasize completed
work rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state
of completion of the reported results. Wherever appropriate, concrete
evaluation results should be included. Submissions will be judged on
correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and
relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees.

A paper accepted for presentation at the ACL Meeting, including
ACL-related workshops and conferences, cannot be presented or have
been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published
proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to other conferences or
workshops must indicate this on the title page, as must papers that
contain significant overlap with previously published work.


Reviewing

The reviewing of the papers will be blind. Reviewing will be managed
by an international Conference Program Committee consisting of Area
Chairs and associated Program Committee Members. Final decisions on
the technical program will be made by a meeting of the Program
Co-Chairs and Area Chairs. Each submission will be reviewed by at
least three program committee members. 


Submission Information

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style
files tailored for this year's conference. A previous version is
available at http://www.aclweb.org/acl2007/styles/ . Please, check the
website for possible changes before submitting your paper. A
description of the format is also available in case you are unable to
use these style files directly. Papers must conform to the official
ACL-07 style guidelines, and we reserve the right to reject
submissions that do not conform to these styles including font size
restrictions.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-citations and other
references (e.g. to projects, corpora, or software) that could reveal
the author's identity should be avoided.  For example, instead of "We
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", write "Smith previously showed
(Smith, 1991) ...".

Submission will be electronic, using the paper submission software that will be accessible through the conference web page. The only accepted format for submitted papers is Adobe PDF. The papers must be submitted no
later than 5pm US Eastern time January 23, 2007 (10pm GMT January 23,
2007). Papers submitted after that time will not be reviewed. Please
consult the submission web page for details of the submission
procedure. Questions regarding the submission procedure should be
directed to the Program Co-Chairs (zaenen@parc.com or
antal.vdnbosch@uvt.nl ).


Deadlines

Paper submission deadline:  January 23, 2007
Notification of acceptance: March 30, 2007
Camera ready papers due:    May 4, 2007
ACL-07 Conference:          June 24 - 29, 2007


Mentoring Service

ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for authors from
regions of the world where English is not the language of scientific
exchange. Many authors from these regions, although able to read the
scientific literature in English, have little or no experience in
writing papers in English for conferences such as the ACL
meetings. The service will be arranged as follows. A set of potential
mentors will be identified by Florence Reeder (Mitre, USA), who has
agreed to organize this service for ACL-07. If you would like to take
advantage of the service, send a draft of your paper to:

  Florence Reeder <freeder@mitre.org>

To take advantage of this service, send the paper electronically to the
above email address, using pdf, ps or doc format. The paper should
arrive before December 15, 2006. An appropriate mentor will be assigned
to your paper and the mentor will get back to you by January 15, 2007,
at least seven days before the deadline for the submission to ACL-07
program committee. Please note that this service is for the benefit of
the authors as described above. It is not a general mentoring service
for authors to improve their papers."

If you have any questions about this service please feel free to send
a message to Florence Reeder.

Site

The conference is organized by the Charles University ("Univerzita Karlova") in Prague, Czech Republic, the oldest University in Europe to the north of the Alps (founded in 1348). It will take place in the TOP HOTEL Praha (http://www.tophotel.cz/en), located in the quiet neighborhood of the Prague 4 district, only 15-20 minutes from the historic center of Prague. The hotel can accommodate up to 1000 participants on-site (with a small number of dormitory rooms available nearby). The hotel offers one auditorium, three large lecture rooms, number of smaller rooms for tutorials and workshops, several restaurants and cafes and lot of open air space for walks and informal discussions. The conference banquet and a conference concert will take place in the historic buildings in the city center - one in the Municipal Hall (built in the Art-nouveau style of the early 20th century) and the other in the 14th century main University Hall.

Prague, being in the center of Europe (only 3-hour drive from Vienna or Budapest or 4 hours from Berlin or Munich), is easily reachable by car, bus or train from Central Europe, by cheap flights from the rest of Europe, and by several direct flights from overseas. Czech Air (CSA), the official carrier of the conference, a member of the Skyteam alliance (with Delta, Continental, Northwest, Air France, Korean Air and others), will offer discount on its own direct flights from New York and Singapore and other destinations in Europe.
