Final Call for Papers

Varieties of Voice - 3rd international BAAHE conference - Theoretical and
Applied Linguistics
7-9 December 2006, University of Leuven, Belgium
http://www.kuleuven.be/ilt/baahe_2006conference/

Extended Deadline: 14 September 2006

The Belgian Association of Anglicists in Higher Education (BAAHE) will organize
its Third International Conference from 7 to 9 December 2006 at the University
of Leuven, Belgium.

This conference will explore the role played by VOICE in the English language.
It will consider:

- the synchronic and diachronic ways in which the (subjective) voice of the
language user manifests itself linguistically, i.e. in the constructional
properties of syntagms used, 
- those aspects of academic English that are relevant to helping learners find
an appropriate academic voice in speaking and writing.

Paper proposals (20 minutes + 10 minutes discussion) are invited on the
following questions and issues:

Linguistics
- (inter-)subjective motivations of voice such as:
-choice of active vs. passive voice for optimal negotiation of information
between speaker/hearer;
- evaluative and other subjective effects of middle constructions;
- subjective vs. more objective constructions (e.g. subjective vs. objective
modality);
- speech and thought representation: representational vs. subjective uses, their
impact on point of view;
- the diachronic shift from representational to interpersonal import of
constructions;
- other aspects of interpersonal varieties of voice.

ELT-Academic English
- author stance in academic writing: differences between disciplines and
cultures (e.g. hedging);
- register varieties: formality in academic genres; diachronic developments;
- citation strategies: how and why do writers incorporate other voices in their
own writing?
- presentation and seminar skills: tone and register; strategies to voice
comments and objections;
- exploring the differences between native and non-native speakers, or between
learners and experienced speakers, should yield insights into how EAP materials
can help learners construct an appropriate academic voice.

Plenary speakers:
Suzanne Kemmer (Rice University): ''Intransitive Structures and Functions''
Ken Hyland (University of London): ''Disciplinary voices: interactions in
research writing''

Selected proceedings will be published with an international publisher.

Abstracts (up to 500 words) should be sent before 14 September 2006 to
Linguistics: liesbet.heyvaert@arts.kuleuven.be
ELT: an.laffut@ilt.kuleuven.be

Notification of acceptance: mid September 2006

within easy reach of Brussels airport and Eurostar/Thalys terminals. Visit
