After the successful LR4Trans-I (28 May 2002, Las Palmas) and
LR4TRans-II (28 August 2004, Geneva) Workshops, we would now like
to draw your attention to this Third Edition. Please refer to the
workshop-related Internet pages (see below) to know more about the scope,
motivation, history, organising and scientific committees and latest

Here the main points for now:

1) Target audience: we encourage participation from everyone interested in
translation and localisation technologies, from practicing translators to
translator trainers, going through researchers in various
interdisciplinary fields, ranging from computational linguistics,
translation to corpus linguistics, terminology and multilingual technical
documentation. We would be happy to have a more significant representation
of industry and government agencies handling electronic language resources
(LRs) to satisfy their multilingual needs.

2) Important dates (subject to slight changes):
- Deadline for workshop paper submission: ***10th February 2006***
---> Please note the NEW EXTENDED DATE and the slight modifications
in the dates below with regard to the two previous calls!
- Notification of Acceptance: By 20th March 2006
- Paper Final Version for Workshop Proceedings: 14th April 2006.
- Workshop Date: 28th May 2006.
