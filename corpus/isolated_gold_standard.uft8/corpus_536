Meeting Description:

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting. 

Anaphoric Uses of Demonstrative Expressions

Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft(DGfS)
28 February - 2 March, 2007, Siegen

Second call for papers

In many languages, demonstrative expressions such as German  'der', 'dieser', 'jener' and English 'this' and 'that' have - in addition to their familiar deictic uses - anaphoric uses, on which they refer to objects introduced not in the utterance situation, but rather in the preceding discourse. In recent years increasing attention has been paid to these ''anaphoric demonstratives'' by formal, functional, computational and corpus linguistic researchers.

In this workshop we propose to investigate the properties of anaphoric demonstratives in a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary setting, comparing them with other more prototypically anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns, reflexives, definite noun phrases and logophoric expressions and cataloguing their unique properties. We expect that a focussed study of anaphoric demonstratives will shed significant light on general processes of anaphoric reference, anaphora resolution, and the cross-linguistic variation in these processes.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Syntactic properties of anaphoric demonstratives
- Relations of anaphoric demonstratives to deictic
demonstratives
- Studies of patterns of use of anaphoric demonstratives
- Contrasts with pronominal expressions
- Psycholinguistic studies of anaphoric demonstratives
- Cross-linguistic investigation of anaphoric demonstratives

Note that in addition to traditional syntactic and semantic investigation we welcome studies of usage and of processing.
