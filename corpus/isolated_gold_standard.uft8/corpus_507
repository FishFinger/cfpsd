Call Deadline: 20-Aug-2006 

Meeting Description:

(Non-)Commitment ((non-)prise en charge in French) are notions which are fairly often used in the analysis of certain types of linguistic phenomena but are hardly ever the subject of explicit investigation in their own right. This conference welcomes theoretical and empirical contributions within both the French and the Anglo-American linguistic tradition addressing the issue in its own right or in terms of its role in different linguistic phenomena. 

The Notion of Commitment:

(Non-)Commitment ((non-)prise en charge in French) is a notion which is fairly often used in the analysis of certain types of linguistic phenomena. 

Goal of the conference:

The aim of this conference is to bring together research which crucially draws on the notion of (non-)commitment in one or another way, in an attempt to achieve a better understanding of the nature and the extension of the notion itself. It welcomes theoretical and empirical contributions addressing the issue in its own right or in terms of its role in any relevant linguistic or conceptual phenomenon, using any kind of methodological approach, and coming from any kind of theoretical background. One section of the conference will be devoted to typological contributions, next to other sections dealing with grammatical or lexical markers or strategies of (non-)commitment in the Romance and Germanic languages.

Theoretical problems pertaining to the notion:
 
The theoretical issues addressed in this conference can be summarized in terms of five central questions:
A) To what does (non-)commitment apply? What are possible objects or (aspects of) objects of (non-)commitment (elements of form, aspects or levels of meaning, illocutionary force)? Is commitment entirely dependent on ''what is in the speaker's mind'' (the concepts and intentions a speaker has access to) or may one be committed to ''things that are in other people's minds''?
B) Who commits him/herself? Who is the agent of the commitment (which instance of the speaker)? This, which relates to the notion of ''polyphony'' popularised by Oswald Ducrot, is especially important when several speakers/thinkers can be identified in an utterance, as in cases of reported speech or reported thought.
C) When does (non-)commitment apply? Only at the moment of speech, or also at other times?
D) What is the nature of (non-)commitment? Are there different forms or degrees of it?
E) How is (non-)commitment taken? Under which conditions and by means of which forms, mechanisms or strategies is it signalled?

Conference languages:

In view of the fact that the notion of (non-)commitment or (non-)prise en charge ((non)responsibilité) is quite manifestly present in the French linguistic tradition (especially in the aftermath of the work of Benveniste), more so than in the Anglo-American tradition, the present conference also explicitly aims to establish communication on the issue between these 'geographical' research traditions. Therefore, the conference will feature presentations in French as well as in English.

Deadline for abstract submissions is August 20, 2006
