Meeting Description:

In recent years, the fields of linguistics, musicology, experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and evolutionary anthropology have witnessed an increased interest in the comparative study of music and language as cognitive systems. This conference is structured around four core areas in which the collaboration between music and language has proven to be particularly fruitful:

(1) Structural comparisons between language and music,
(2) Evolution of language and music,
(3) Learning and processing of language and music,
(4) Neuroscience of language and music.

The event aims to bring together major contributors from these areas of research in order to assess the progress made, and future directions to take, in this truly interdisciplinary enterprise, and to provide researchers and graduate students from diverse backgrounds with a unique forum for discussion. 

Call for Papers (deadline: Nov 17, 2006)

May 11-13, 2007, University of Cambridge

The format of the event is designed to encourage discussion of theoretical models, empirical results, and methodological approaches to the investigation of musical and linguistic cognition. For this purpose, outstanding contributors to the different subsections have been invited to serve as keynote speakers, namely:

Ray Jackendoff, Center for Cognitive Studies, Tufts University,
Tecumseh Fitch, School of Psychology, University of St. Andrews,
Jamshed Bharucha, Department of Psychology, Tufts University,
Aniruddh Patel, The Neurosciences Institute, San Diego.

Each keynote speech will be followed by a panel discussion composed of three leading researchers, drawn from within and outside the University of Cambridge, and by a paper session, in which four researchers will present their work. In addition, a number of proposals will be accepted for poster presentations.

The period for Abstract Submission for both paper and poster presentations is August 15, 2006 to November 17, 2006. For more information on how to submit an abstract, please download the Submission Guidelines from our website. Notification e-mails will be sent out on January 15, 2007.

This event is co-organized by the Research Centre for English & Applied Linguistics (Professor John Hawkins, Patrick Rebuschat) and the Centre for Music & Science (Dr. Ian Cross, Martin Rohrmeier).

The organizers would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and the Humanities (CRASSH), and the Arts & Humanities Research Council, UK.
