Meeting Description:

Workshop on Pragmatic Markers in Asian Languages
A pre-conference workshop of The 4th Conference on Language, Discourse and =
Cognition
April 30, 2010=20

Call for Papers

There has been much work on pragmatic markers over the years, not only in
Indo-European languages, but also in a number of Asian languages, in partic=
ular
Japanese (e.g. Fujii 2000; Matsui 2000; Suzuki 2000; Onodera 2002). However=
,
more work need to be done to include a wider range of languages spoken with=
in
the Asian continent and the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Previ=
ous
works have often focused on sentence final particles and sentence-initial
discourse markers (e.g. Wu 2003), yet languages have various other pragmati=
c
marking strategies as well (e.g. Englebretson 2003, 2007), including the us=
e of
stand-alone nominalization constructions to express mirativity or speaker
surprise and unexpectedness (e.g. DeLancey 1997; Noonan 1997; Grunow-H=E5rs=
ta, in
press; Kaufman, in press). More work need to be done to identify under-repo=
rted
strategies by which languages convey speaker stance such as mood, attitude,=
 and
perspective. Some recent works have focused on evidentials, particularly in
Tibeto-Burman languages (see the special issue on evidentiality guest-edite=
d by
Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald in Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area, volume 30=
,
issue 2). A number of recent works have further focused on finer calibratio=
ns of
stance that have evolved from inherent distinctions within the deictic syst=
em of
individual languages (e.g. Abui; see Kratochvil, in press); more work is ne=
eded
to identify how robust such calibrated systems might be. Many more interest=
ing
questions remain to be investigated.

To this end, we invite abstracts on original topics dealing with pragmatic
markers in any Asian language. Possible topics include but are not restrict=
ed to:=20
- analyses of epistemic, evidential and attitudinal markers of individual l=
anguages=20
- comparisons of pragmatic markers across different languages
- typology of epistemic/evidential systems within specific language familie=
s
- interactional analysis of pragmatic markers in narratives, colloquial
conversations, as well as more formal public and workplace discourse
- diachronic development or grammaticalization of pragmatic markers=20
- anthropological studies of pragmatic markers in less studied languages

Form of Presentation:
Each paper will be allotted thirty minutes (20 minutes for presentation plu=
s 10
minutes for discussion).
