Call for Papers

We invite papers dealing with any aspect of the processes of grammaticalization 
and (inter)subjectification, both empirical and conceptual, from any theoretical
angle, but we are especially interested in papers dealing with
- the interaction between the processes of grammaticalization and (inter)
subjectification;
- the relation of grammaticalization and (inter)subjectification to other
mechanisms of language change, including, most notably, analogy; and
- processes of degrammaticalization and de-(inter)subjectification: how
(in)frequent are they, what kinds of factors trigger them, and what mechanisms
are at work in them?

Presentations are 20 minutes, followed by 5 minutes discussion.

Abstracts of max. 4000 characters (i.e. app. 500 words; including references) 
should be submitted via the conference website.

Deadline for submission of abstracts: February 15, 2010
Notification of acceptance: late March, 2010

Information regarding registration, accommodation and other practical matters 
will be provided in the second circular, to be distributed early 2010, and will
be posted on the conference website as soon as they are available.
