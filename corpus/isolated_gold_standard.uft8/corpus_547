TOPIC AND TARGET GROUP
The Ninth International Conference on Spatial Information Theory, COSIT'07,
is concerned with theoretical aspects of space, time, and spatial
information. Of special interest are aspects of "large-scale" space, i.e.
spaces too large to be apprehended at once without technological aid. These
include spaces of geographic and environmental scales in which humans make
decisions and carry out actions. Spatial information theory also deals with
the formal and natural description of processes and events in spatial
environments, thus providing a foundation for the design and construction of
geographic information systems (GIS) and for spatial information systems
(SIS) in general. Empirical investigations, formal models, and the use of
spatial information technologies reveal a large number of interesting
research questions which require an interdisciplinary approach for their
solution. The COSIT conference series brings together researchers from many
disciplines and topics, in particular:

    * Cognitive, Perceptual, and Environmental Psychology
    * Geography and Geoinformation Science
    * Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Science
    * Engineering and Human Factors
    * Cognitive Anthropology, Psycholinguistics and Linguistics
    * Ontology of the Geospatial Domain
    * Architecture, Planning, and Environmental Design

An idea of the conference's orientation can be gained from the previous
COSIT proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series. The following (non-exclusive) topics (listed
alphabetically) are indicative of the field of interest:

    * activity-based models of spatial knowledge
    * cognitive structure of spatial knowledge
    * cooperative work with spatial information
    * events and processes in geographic space
    * incomplete or imprecise spatial knowledge
    * languages of spatial relations
    * naive geography/behavioral geography
    * navigation by organisms and robots
    * ontology of space
    * presentation/communication of spatial information
    * quality issues in geographic information
    * social and cultural organization of space
    * spatial and temporal reasoning
    * spatial data integration/interoperability
    * spatial decision-support systems
    * structure of geographic information
    * time in geographic information
    * user-interface design/spatialization of interfaces

CONFERENCE PROGRAM
At the conference, results from recent research are presented and
discussions about advanced work in progress take place. The conference
program is established by an international and multidisciplinary program
committee. Papers are selected through a rigorous review of full paper
contributions by internationally renowned reviewers, based on relevance to
the conference, intellectual quality, scientific significance, novelty,
relation to previously published literature, and clarity of presentation.
The proceedings are published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series before the conference. Before the conference,
workshops and tutorials on topics relevant to the conference are offered.
Topical meetings ("birds-of-a-feather sessions") can be organized. A
Doctoral Colloquium, facilitated by a small panel of experienced
researchers, will conclude the conference. It is intended as a forum where
PhD students can meet, present their research, and hold discussions with
others at a similar stage in their careers.

SUBMISSIONS
Prospective authors must submit full papers in pdf format by the deadline
above. Papers must be in English, and formatted using the Springer "Lecture
Notes in Computer Science" style. For formatting instructions, please refer
to the information for authors of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) by Springer. The total
length of the paper must not exceed 18 pages, including figures and
bibliography; this is approximately 6000 words. 


A NOTE ON THE SITE
The conference will be held at the Melbourne Business School in Mt Eliza,
Melbourne, Australia. The conference venue is located above the cliffs of
Port Phillip Bay, with wonderful views, an English park landscape, and a
private beach. Mount Eliza is about one hour's drive from Melbourne's
international airport Tullamarine (MEL). A shuttle service will operate from
the airport to the conference site at Mt Eliza. Melbourne is well-connected,
with direct flights from major cities around the world. September is low
season for traveling to Australia and several airlines offer budget tickets.
The latest travel and conference information will appear on the COSIT'07 web
site http://www.cosit.info as it becomes available.
