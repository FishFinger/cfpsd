Meeting Description:

Workshop on Negation and Polarity
University of Tuebingen, Germany
March 8-10, 2007 

Call:

The study of negation and polarity phenomena occupied a central position in syntactic, semantic and pragmatic research. New insights have been obtained regarding the syntax of sentential negation, the nature of negative concord, the licensing of (negative) polarity items, and the semantics and pragmatics of negative and positive polarity items.

To discuss recent developments of this quickly expanding research area, scholars working on negation and polarity are invited to share their results in a 3-day workshop and discuss the current state of affairs in this field. This meeting is to be held at the University of Tübingen, Germany from March 8-10. 

We welcome submission of 2-5 page abstracts (anonymous, PDF-format, 12pt font, one column, references and examples included) on any topic that relates to negation and polarity, for instance:

- the syntax of negative markers
- negative concord
- the interaction between negation and other functional categories (such as tense and modality)
- the interaction between negation and information structure
- the licensing of negative and positive polarity items
- the distribution and classification of polarity items
- the semantics of negative indefinites
- polarity and free-choice items

We welcome not only theoretical contributions, but also papers concerning any kind of linguistic evidence regarding negation and polarity.

There are 15 slots of 45 minutes for selected talks. We will also hold a round table discussion at the end of each day. The workshop will also feature three invited speakers:

- Theresa Biberauer (Cambridge)
- Cleo Condoravdi (PARC/Stanford)
- Jack Hoeksema (Groningen)

The deadline for abstract submission is November 15. Notification will follow early January.

Organisers: Doris Penka, Frank Richter, Jan-Philipp Söhn, Arnim von Stechow, Hedde Zeijlstra
