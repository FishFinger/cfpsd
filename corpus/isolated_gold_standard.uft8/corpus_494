1st International Workshop on Semantic Media Adaptation and
Personalization (SMAP 2006)
December 5th, 2006
Athens, Greece

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CALL FOR PAPERS*
-----------------

The emergence of advanced network infrastructures enables fast,
efficient and reliable end-to-end transmission of huge multimedia
content. This, combined with the development of a plethora of terminal
devices available for media display through networked access has lead
to immense market opportunities for content and service
providers. During the last years providers have invested in
technologies that utilize higher level content adaptation and
personalization techniques in order to achieve a cross-media world.

Still, in today's market it is becoming obvious that in order for
media content and media services to be competitive they cannot limit
their consideration to diverse networking infrastructures and diverse
terminal devices; diverse users also need to be served in a way that
is more suitable to their own needs and preferences. Although
presentation preferences (such as video quality) can be addressed by
something as simple as low level content adaptation, a user's
preferences at a semantic level are more difficult to understand,
model and finally satisfy. The realization of the notions of context
and contextualization at a semantic level is expected to aid
significantly in the area of media content and services.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners
from related fields in order to discuss the state of the art, recent
advances and future perspectives for semantic media
adaptation. Specifically, it will cover areas such as knowledge
acquisition and management, ontologies, knowledge models for
personalization, semantic context modeling and extraction, content
adaptation, user profiling, personalized filtering and so on.

The above mentioned topics are broadly identified as central in
current research efforts in the field of semantic media
technology. Thus, it is expected that the proposed workshop will draw
the attention of an audience much broader than its prospective
authors. We strive to have a diverse academic audience, varying from
young researchers working on PhD level to experts in the field. The
workshop aims to provide a platform for exchanging fresh ideas and
expertise, and for obtaining feedback on ongoing research.

*WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS AND CHAIRS*
--------------------------------

*General Chairs*

Phivos Mylonas, MSc, fmylonas@image.ntua.gr
National Technical University of Athens, Greece

Manolis Wallace, PhD, wallace@uindy.gr
University of Indianapolis, Athens Campus, Greece

Marios Angelides, BSc PhD FBCS CITP, marios.angelides@brunel.ac.uk

*SUBMISSION PROCEDURE*
----------------------

Prospective contributors are invited to submit research papers at the
dedicated submission area of the workshop's web site
(http://image.ntua.gr/events/smap). A peer review process will be
applied to all submissions, provided by the workshop's Program
Committee members, being selected among well-known researchers in the
area.


*WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS*
----------------------

The proceedings of the workshop will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society. Following the IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing
Services (CPS) all publications will also be available through IEEE
Xplore and through the IEEE Computer Society Digital Library. The
format of papers will have to be prepared according to IEEE Computer
Society standards. Only IEEE Xplore(TM)-compliant PDF files can be
accepted for final paper submissions. An author kit will be made
available soon in order to assist you in preparing IEEE
Xplore(TM)-compliant PDF files.


*JOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE*
-----------------------

Deserving papers will be solicited for inclusion in an international
journal special issue after extension and re-evaluation. The journal
that will host the issue will be announced soon. 


*VENUE/ACCOMODATION*
--------------------

SMAP 2006 will take place on December 5th, 2006, right beneath the
Acropolis and just next to the roman market, in the beautiful building
that used to host the Goulandri Horn museum. This is in the very
center of the "Athens Historical Triangle". This is a mostly
pedestrian area downtown Athens and includes most of the historical
landmarks that the city has to display.
The workshop organizers are negotiating special hotel rates for SMAP
delegates at different hotels in the area of the venue. More
information on affiliated hotels will be available soon.
