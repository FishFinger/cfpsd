sense:=20
providing users with information not explicitly stated in text. Work
submitted to=20
this session will be required to be more ambitious with respect to

or reach than the entity identification, information extraction, and
information=20
retrieval projects that comprise most work in biomedical language
processing.=20

We especially solicit work in the following areas:=20
o Question answering
o Summarization
o Mining data from full text including figures, tables, and images
o Coreference resolution and normalization
o User-driven systems, including user needs, user model, interactive
systems,=20
  and user interfaces for biomedical language processing=20
o Evaluation: test collections and evaluation methods

Submission information:
o All papers must be submitted to Russ Altman in PostScript (.ps), Adobe
Acrobat (.pdf),=20
  or Microsoft Word (.doc) format. Adobe Acrobat is preferred.=20

unprocessed TeX or LaTeX files will be rejected without review.
o Every paper must be accompanied by a cover letter which must include
the following:=20
	- The email address of the corresponding author
	- The specific PSB session that the paper should be considered
for
	- A statement that the submitted paper contains original,=20
	  unpublished results, and is not currently under consideration
elsewhere=20
	- A statement that all authors concur with the contents of the
paper
o Submitted papers are limited to twelve (12) pages in the PSB
publication format.=20
o Please format your paper according to the instructions found at
http://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/psb-submit/.=20
o If figures cannot easily be resized and placed precisely in the text,
then it should be clear=20
  that with appropriate modifications, the total manuscript length would
be within the page limit.=20
o Color pictures can be printed at the expense of the authors.=20
  The fee is $500 per page of color pictures, payable at the time of
camera-ready submission.
o Contact Russ Altman ( russ.altman@stanford.edu) for additional
information about paper submission requirements.
