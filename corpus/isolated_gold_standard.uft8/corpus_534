ELR Journal - Empirical Language Research - http://ejournals.org.uk/ELR

** Call for Papers **


Dear Colleagues,

you may remember that during the 1980s and 1990s the ELR Journal,
published by the Department of English at the University of Birmingham
and standing for 'English Language Research', was the forum for many
seminal works in Corpus Linguistics, Discourse and Genre Analysis, and
Computer Assisted Language Learning. We are about to re-launch it in a
new format with the updated title 'Empirical Language Research' to
reflect how evidence from real language data underpins much language
research across a wide area.

We intend the ELR journal to avoid the superficiality and lack of
rigour associated with some online journals by establishing it as a
quality peer-reviewed journal, with an editorial board comprised of
leading international scholars in the field. We also support the
movement towards making academic research open and freely available
rather than obscure, expensive, and inaccessible. The re-launched ELR
Journal will be fully online. Online publishing has several advantages
in that costs and publication lead times are reduced, and readership
is increased.

The first issue of the ELR journal will be published towards the end
of 2006, and publication will be continuous from then onwards.

We now invite papers which describe work in any area of language, with
the principal criterion being that the findings are supported by
empirical evidence from corpus data. Areas of particular focus would
be:

    * Empirical Approaches to Linguistic Theory
    * Multilingual Corpora and Translation
    * Data-Driven Learning
    * Natural Language Processing
    * Corpus-Driven Lexicography and Lexicology

There are two different types of articles, short papers, which are
about 3,000 to 5,000 words in length, and full papers, which should be
more than 5,000 words long. The maximum length of a full paper should
be about 10,000 words.

Eventually submission will be possible through the journal's website
(see URL above), but at present please send articles to
elr-journal@contacts.bham.ac.uk. This address can also be used to get
in touch with the editors.


With best wishes,

Pernilla Danielsson
