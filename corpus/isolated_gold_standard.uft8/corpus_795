Lodz Papers in Pragmatics - Call for Papers

Edited by Piotr Cap & Iwona Plisiecka
http://versita.com/science/socialsciences/lpp/    

Developments in Socio-Pragmatics

The upcoming issue of LPP aims at presenting and discussing multiple
approaches to cross-cultural communication. We welcome contributions on a
wide range of subjects, such as e.g. sociolinguistic studies on
biculturalism and migration, child and adult education of migrants and
members of linguistic minorities, business communication, new media, as
well as the communication aspect of political relations and cultural
exchange. We welcome contributions on the role of pragmalinguistic
differences and different conventions of speech and text genres in
encounters between members of different cultures, as well as on the effects
of power relations upon the forms of intercultural discourse. 

Today to an even larger extent than in the past centuries, communication
frequently takes place between individuals and institutions representing
different national and cultural backgrounds. This has resulted in a vast
body of theoretical discussions on the relation between language, culture
and discourse as well as in the emergence of empirical research on
intercultural encounters.

Social change, international political campaigning, linguistic minorities,
intercultural pedagogy, advertising, management, corporate internal
communication, tourism, youth culture and public media discourse.
Contributions from empirical studies, as well as proposals related to the
acquisition and teaching of cross-cultural competence are most welcome.

Deadline: 15 February
