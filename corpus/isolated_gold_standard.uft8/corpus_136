Dear all

At the upcoming EUROCALL conference in Cracow (24-27 August 2005, see 
http://www.eurocall-languages.org.pl/), we will offer the following 
pre-conference workshop:

"Using corpora in language learning and teaching - introduction and 
'expert' talk"
24 August 2005, 9:00-16:00

Please check the CorpusCall SIG website http://www.corpuscall.org.uk for 
details.

The workshop will be organised as two sessions, the first being an 
introduction to the topic and the second offering a series of 
mini-presentations (practical examples of corpus use in 
learning/teaching and/or reports of work in progress). If you are 
interested in giving a mini-presentation, please contact Ylva Berglund 
or Sabine Braun at workshop@corpuscall.org.uk. If you want to attend the 
workshop but not give a presentation, register at the conference website 
http://www.eurocall-languages.org.pl/ (the conference offers a series of 
corpus related papers).

Please pass the info on to interested colleagues.

Looking forward to seeing you in Krakow!
 
Ylva Berglund & Sabine Braun
