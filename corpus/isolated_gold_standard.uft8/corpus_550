The main topic of the conference is

   Data structures for linguistic resources and their applications

The conference is centred around all aspects of data structures for
applications in the fields of computational linguistics, humanities
computing and computer philology, for example, modelling XML-based
applications, the (semi)-automatic analysis and querying of annotated
corpus data, and linguistic data structures for the semantic web.
Contributions may address the following topics (among others):

  - Text technological standards for language technology
  - Humanities computing and computer philology: formats, methods, resource=
s
  - (Semi)-automatic text analysis, text structuring and text annotation
  - Formal properties of linguistic data structures
  - Sustainability of linguistic resources (e.g., metadata)
  - Applications and data structures for corpus linguistics
  - Computational linguistics in and for the semantic web
  - Information retrieval, ontologies, text classification

In addition, contributions from other fields of computational
linguistics, speech and language technology, humanities computing and
computer philology are welcome.
