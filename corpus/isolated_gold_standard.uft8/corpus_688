Dear Colleague

This year's SummerFest is being held at the University of Sydney from 27th
November to 1st December.

The deadline for submission of speed paper and student poster abstracts
for HCSNet's SummerFest is Friday 15th September.  Attendance at all of
SummerFest (the summer school, the speed papers session, and the three
workshops (the Australasian Language Technologuy Workshop, the Human and
Machine Speech Workshop, and the Perception and Action Workshop -- see
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/summerfest06/cfp) is FREE for those who present
speed papers, student posters, or are accepted presenters at the
workshops; otherwise a registration fee applies.  There is also travel and
accommodation support for those outside of Metropolitan Sydney available
for presenters.

The student poster session, held on Monday evening, is an opportunity for
those attending the summer school to chat informally with other students;
last year it was a great success, and we expect it to be even bigger this
year.

The speed papers session, held on Wednesday, gives you an overview of what
a large and diverse grooup of people are doing in a very short space of
time -- last year's attendees raved about the session.

Please make sure you submit an abstract by the end of the week to ensure
your place at SummerFest, and pass this message on to others who might be
interested.

Best regards

Robert Dale
HCSNet Convenor
