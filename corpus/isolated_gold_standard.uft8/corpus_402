Meeting Description:

Call for poster abstracts 

The second annual Rovereto Workshop on Bilingualism will be held September 28 - October 1 this year (2006) at the Laboratorio di Scienze Cognitive at the University of Trento in Rovereto (Italy). The goal for this annual workshop is to bridge the cognitive and neural perspectives on bilingual language processing and to foster discussion and productive collaborations between senior and junior researchers. The topic for year's workshop is Bilingual Sentence Processing: Functional and Neural Perspectives.

The present call for submissions is for the poster session that is being organized.  If you are interested in presenting a poster, please submit your abstract (500 words maximum) online by June 1st, 2006 at http://www.unitn.it/events/bilingualism/. A limited number of posters will be accepted on the basis of their scientific merit. Although submission of posters related to the main topic of the workshop are encouraged, we will also consider any submission that deals with cognitive and/or neuropsychological aspects of bilingualism. For those individuals who do not have institutional support and who would benefit from financial assistance, a small number of travel grants funded by the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto are available on a competitive basis. Please indicate in your submission if you would like your abstract to be considered as an application for a travel grant. The Workshop is funded in part by the CARITRO Foundation and the University of Trento.

Meeting Description:

International, multidisciplinary symposium on any aspect of research on bilingualism 

The 6th International Symposium on Bilingualism invites proposals for presentations on any aspect of research on bilingualism. Topics may include grammatical development in bilingual children, sociolinguistic and grammatical studies of code-switching, psycholinguistic studies of bilingualism, bilingual speech processing, language impairment in bilinguals, translation and interpreting, sociolinguistic studies of bilingual communities and migration, child/adult second language acquisition, language policy and ideology, language shift, language attrition/forgetting.
Proposals regarding original, previously unpublished research on bilingualism are invited in three formats: colloquia, individual papers, and posters.

Proposals for colloquia: colloquia are collections of paper presentations which relate to a narrowly defined topic of interest, and are offered in either 2-hour or 3-hour time blocks. Proposals for colloquia are limited to 3000 characters, and should include brief summaries of each of the papers to be included, along with individual paper titles and individual authors' names, professional affiliations, and email addresses. Sufficient detail should be provided to allow peer reviewers to judge the scientific merit of the proposal. A chair for the session must also be identified. It is the responsibility of the person submitting a proposal for a colloquium to secure the permission and cooperation of all participants before the proposal is submitted. Proposals for colloquia must indicate whether a 2-hour or 3-hour time block is requested. Typically, each paper presentation within a colloquium should be scheduled for 30 minutes, including time for discussion.

Proposals for individual papers or posters: please submit an abstract of no more than 3000 characters. The abstract should include enough detail to allow reviewers to judge the scientific merits of the proposal. Abstracts for paper/poster presentations will be double-blind peer-reviewed. Authors will be asked to specify a format (paper presentation or poster session) at the time the work is submitted.

Please submit your proposal online at www.isb6.org. Deadline for proposal submission is October 13th, 2006. If you have problems with online submission, please do not hesitate to contact our conference coordinator at isb6@uni-hamburg.de or via snail-mail.
