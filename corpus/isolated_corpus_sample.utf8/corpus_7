           SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS


IMPORTANT DATES

    Submission:		April 20, 2005

    Camera ready:	May 18, 2005 
    Workshop:           July 10, 2005


WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

This one-day workshop will focus on the issues related to question
answering in restricted domains. Restricted domains provide an
interesting mix of challenges and opportunities that are yet to
explore. For example, the limited data available makes it difficult to
apply conventional question-answering techniques based on data
redundancy and the specific terminology of some domains typically is
not available in generic lexical resources. On the other hand,
restricted domains enable the development of specific ontologies or
knowledge bases that can be used for high-precision question answering
tasks.

Note that there is an AAAI workshop on inference in textual question
answering. If you are wondering what workshop your research fits best,
please contact the organisers of any of these two workshops.

This workshop is a follow-up of the ACL 2005 workshop
<http://www.clt.mq.edu.au/Events/Conferences/acl04qa/>

TOPICS

    * Comparison between open-domain and restricted-domain QA

    * Characterisation of types of restricted domains and type of
      technology required for QA on those domains

    * Methodologies

    * Tools and resources

    * Description of specific restricted-domain QA systems

    * Development of modules (e.g. document preselection, NE
      extraction, terminology extraction) for use in restricted-domain
      QA systems

    * Portability of QA systems between different restricted domains

    * Evaluation

FORMAT OF WORKSHOP

The workshop includes an invited presentation, a set of full papers
and short papers, and a final discussion panel.

The invited presenter will address some of the questions posed
above. The emphasis is not so much about addressing the questions but
about presenting a challenging topic that encourages discussion.

There will be full papers and short papers. The full papers will focus
on the specific issues listed above, whereas the short papers can
focus on system descriptions or provide small contributions to the
workshop goals.

The discussion panel includes 5-minute statements from leading
researchers in different related areas of expertise. The panel will be
followed by a discussion moderated by one of the workshop organisers.

ATTENDANCE 

We expect an attendance of 25-50 people from the areas of question
answering in open domains and restricted domains to allow for useful
comparison and generalisation. To encourage discussion and
participation, only invited people can attend. We therefore require
potential participants that do not wish to contribute with a paper to
send an email to the workshop organisers with a one-page description
of their interest in the topic and their position statements. The
information will be used to organise the final workshop discussion
session.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Submitted papers should describe original work, completed or in
progress, rather than merely planned, and clearly indicate the current
state of advancement of the work.  No previously published papers
should be submitted.

Authors should submit regular papers of maximum 10 pages or short
papers of maximum 5 pages, including references and figures, following
the AAAI technical reports guidelines. The review will not be blind.

Submissions must be in PS or PDF format only.
