WORKSHOP OVERVIEW:
=20
=20
Recently, there has been a growing awareness of the difficulties posed=20
by prepositions and the importance of providing adequate means of=20
capturing them, for many different applications. Several projects have=20
now focused on the understanding of certain aspects of prepositions from =

perspectives such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language=20
Processing (NLP), psycholinguistics and ethnolinguistics.
=20
For instance, some research has concentrated on spatial or temporal=20
aspects of prepositions, and their cross-linguistic differences. Several =

investigations have also been carried out on quite diverse languages,=20
emphasizing, for example, monolingual and cross-linguistic contrasts or=20
the role of prepositions in syntactic alternations. These observations=20
cover in general a small group of closely related prepositions. The=20
semantic characterization of prepositions has also motivated the=20
emergence of a few dedicated logical frameworks and reasoning =
procedures.
=20
Languages like English have phrasal verbs, and these combinations of=20
verbs and prepositions (in prepositional verbs or verb-particle=20
constructions), have also been the subject of considerable effort, going =

from techniques for their automatic extraction from corpora, to methods=20
for the determination of their semantics.  Other languages, like Romance =

languages or Hindi, either incorporate the preposition or include it in=20
the prepositional phrase. All these configurations are semantically as=20
well as syntactically of much interest.
=20
In NLP, PP attachment ambiguities have attracted a lot of attention,=20
with different machine learning techniques having been employed with=20
varying degrees of success.
=20
In this context, a successful workshop on prepositions was held in=20
Toulouse, in September 2003, with papers presenting research in a wide=20
variety of topics, examining prepositions in languages like French,=20
English, German and Japanese, some from a more computational approach=20
and others more linguistic. Selected papers of this workshop are now=20
planned to be published by Kluwer in a special volume=20
("Computational Linguistics Dimensions of the Syntax and the=20
Semantics of Prepositions" Patrick Sain-Dizier (ed.), forthcoming).
=20
The aim of the second workshop is to bring together researchers working=20
on prepositions from a variety of backgrounds, such as linguistics, NLP, =

AI and psycholinguistics, providing a forum for discussing, among=20
others, the syntax, semantics, description, representation and=20
computational applications of prepositions, with the ultimate aim to=20
advance the state-of-the-art, identify challenges, and promote future=20
collaborations among researchers interested in the different aspects of=20
prepositions.
