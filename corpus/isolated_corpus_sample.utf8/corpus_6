WDA2005 Call for Participation
Third International Workshop on Web Document Analysis

August 28, 2005
Seoul, Korea
(co-located with ICDAR2005)

http://wda2005.blogspot.com/

** Short Papers Due April 15, 2005 **


CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS


Background


With the ever-increasing use of the Web, a growing number of documents are
published and accessed on-line. The emerging issues pose new challenges for
Document Analysis. The need is evident for further discussion to identify
the role of Document Analysis in Web applications.


While there has been active research on Web Content Extraction using
text-based techniques, documents are in fact 2-dimensional entities, and
often include multimedia content. Hence, techniques that have been developed
for image-based documents could prove valuable in the realm of Web
documents, and new methods for the analysis of multimedia content will be
required.


Following the success of the first two WDA workshops in Seattle, USA (WDA2001)
and in Edinburgh, UK (WDA2003) the series continues with WDA2005 in Seoul,
Korea. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from the
Document Analysis and Web communities such as Web Content Extraction, Web
Publishing, Digital Libraries and e-Commerce Security, to share experiences
and discuss possible avenues for future collaboration.

Technical Focus

This workshop is intended as a forum for discussing emerging issues in
document analysis in Web environments. Special attention will be given to
new applications and requirements created by opportunities on the Internet
(in the area of multimedia document analysis and management). We invite
contributions in areas including but not limited to the following:


     * Layout analysis of Web documents and its applications to content
       extraction, multimodal access and Web mining.

     * Document understanding and semantic tagging for web services.

     * Digital document models: homogeneous representation of structured
       documents, hypertext and multimedia components.

     * Structural feature extraction for concept learning, extraction and
       retrieval.

     * Automated and semi-automated wrapping methods for information extraction.

     * Knowledge integration from heterogeneous collections of documents.

     * Theme extraction and document clustering/visualization.

     * Access of textual information embedded in Internet images.

     * Document image processing for Internet: data compression, color analysis,
       representation and coding for multiresolution or resolution-independent
       images.

     * Collaborative annotation and manipulation of documents on the Web.

     * Authoring, editing and presentation systems for complex multimedia
       documents.

     * Enterprise applications: intranet and workflow management.

     * Document analysis and reformatting for multimodal interfaces.

     * Web content summarization and repurposing for mobile access.

     * Cross-language multi-web-document summarization / knowledge integration.

     * Web Security and Image Understanding (CAPTCHAs).

     * Data collection and evaluation methods.


Workshop Format

WDA 2005 is planned to be a one-day single-track event. Participants are
expected to give a short description of their work (submitted for review in the
form of a short paper) and participate in the discussions.


The workshop will consist of short presentations grouped in thematic
sessions. In addition there will be sessions focusing discussion on
a number of specific topics as yet to be determined.

Publications

As in the previous editions of the workshop, accepted short papers will published
in print for distribution at the workshop. Other formats also being considered
include the conference Web site (for digests of discussions) and publication
of expanded versions of papers in a book.


Submission Information

We invite the submission of original, previously unpublished work. Papers
should identify current/future needs, open problems and discuss the authors'
view of the subject and overall direction. Papers describing work in
progress are also encouraged.


We also welcome, with some restrictions, submissions that are closely
related to work submitted also to ICDAR2005. Authors can use this workshop
as a forum to present work that differs materially from their ICDAR
presentations, in any of several ways:


     * recent results too late for the ICDAR deadline;

     * methodological issues facing the WDA community;

     * proposals for community-wide data sets, experiments, competitions,
       websites etc.



Papers should be submitted via the Web in camera-ready format and should
not exceed 4 printed pages. The format adopted is that of the IEEE-CS
Conference Publications and is the same as that of ICDAR2005.


Full details of the formatting instructions, a sample document and templates
for LaTeX and MS-Word users can be found at the ICDAR2005 submissions site
(http://image.korea.ac.kr/icdar2005/paper.html). PDF is strongly preferred as
the submission format, though PostScript may also be used.


Important Dates


Paper-submission due   15 April 2005
Author Notification    31 May 2005
Camera-ready copy due  30 June 2005
