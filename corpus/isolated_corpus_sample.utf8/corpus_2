International Workshop

Modern Approaches in Translation Technologies=20
(http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/view/RANLPMT2005/WebHome)
- Workshop in conjunction with the international=20
Conference "Recent Advances in Natural Language=20
Processing- RANLP 2005"-
(http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2005/)

In the current globalized communications scene,=20
both machine and computer-aided translation have=20
become key technologies. Indeed, a recent survey=20
regarding ten emerging technologies that will=20
change the world, placed  Machine Translation at=20
the leading number one position. It is expected=20
that with the increased number of official=20
languages in Europe, and the continuing growth of=20
non-English Internet resources, machine=20
translation and computer-aided translation=20
systems will become indispensable tools in=20
everyday work.

Machine Translation is a complex scientific task=20
involving almost every aspect of natural language=20
processing. Following the developments in=20
language technology, during the last 10 years,=20
corpus-based approaches to machine translation=20
(statistical or example-based) tried, and=20
partially succeeded to replace traditional=20
rule-based approaches. The main advantage of=20
corpus-based machine translation systems is that=20
they are self-customising in the sense that they=20
can learn the translations of terminology and=20
even stylistic phrasing from previously=20
translated materials.

However, after a first enthusiastic period it=20
turned out that pure corpus-based methods also=20
have limitations, which can only be overcome by=20
introducing linguistic knowledge. Therefore=20
current research focuses on hybrid methods,=20
combining data-driven (corpus) and rule-driven=20
methods. On the other hand, more practical CAT=20
applications such as translation memories and=20
bilingual concordancers along with the extensive=20
use of electronic dictionaries and term=20
tools/banks, emerged as popular, vital tools for=20
professional translators.

The current workshop aims to bring together=20
researchers working in machine and machine-aided=20
translation. The workshop will alternate paper=20
presentations with panel discussions.  Main=20
topics of interest are:

o	Hybrid approaches to machine translation
o	Recent advances in machine aided translation
o	Evaluation of MT and CAT systems
o	Impact of Semantic Web activities on MT and CAT systems.
o	Tools for professional translators

We welcome original papers related (but not=20
limited) to one or more of the following topics:

o	Learning from parallel aligned corpora
o	Integration of statistical and example-based approaches
o	Statistical support for rule-based machine translation
o	Dynamic combination of example-based=20
machine translation or translation memories with=20
rule-based approaches
o	Template learning in example based machine translation
o	Integration of Termbases, Translation Memories, and Parallel Corpora 
o	Evaluation criteria for MT and CAT systems
o	Usage of semantic web-ontologies for machine translation
o	Usage of semantic web annotations in corpus-based machine translation
o	Perspectives of grid technologies for MT and CAT systems.
o	Practical MT systems (MT for=20
professionals, MT for multilingual eCommerce, MT=20
for localization
o	Automatic and semiautomatic acquisition=20
of bilingual and multilingual lexica
o	Practical CAT tools (Translation=20
memories, bilingual concordancers, terminology=20
tools and resources)
o	Use of corpora in translation
We also encourage demonstrations of developed=20
tools. Submissions for a demonstration session=20
should include a 2 page demo-note describing the=20
system-architecture and performance as well as=20
technical requirements.
