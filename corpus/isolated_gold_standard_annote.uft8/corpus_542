Workshop description:
 
Systematic phonological alternations often seem to be bound to a particular
phonological domain. The theory of Prosodic Phonology (e.g. Selkirk 1980, 1986;
Nespor & Vogel 1986; Hayes 1989) holds that speech is hierarchically organized
into constituents that are not necessarily isomorphic to syntactic constituents.
Previous literature has largely dealt with how morphological elements can be
organized into the prosodic structure. It has been reported that within
individual languages as well as cross-linguistically, there can be systematic
differences in the prosodization of function words. For instance, Selkirk (1984)
states that the principles of syntax-phonology mapping are blind to the presence
of functional categories. Closer examination reveals that not only function
words, but also various other morphological elements - e.g. suffixes and clitics
- may vary with respect to the way they are prosodized. Moreover, within one
syntactic category, elements may belong to different prosodic categories (e.g.
the German preposition statt 'instead of' seems to function as a prosodic word,
whereas in 'in' does not form a prosodic word of its own). Furthermore,
morphological elements may behave as part of a prosodic domain x with respect to
a (set of) phonological process(es) while they may seem to belong to another
domain in the context of other processes (e.g., Turkish instrumental suffix -lA,
which undergoes vowel harmony but fails to receive word-level right-most default
stress). Also, the rules posited for morphology-phonology mapping seem to be
based on circular logic: a syntactic category may determine the onset of a
particular prosodic domain in which, for example, stress assignment takes place,
but at the same time presence or absence of primary stress suggests the
inclusion or exclusion of a particular element from that very same domain. Apart
from various issues concerning phrasing algorithms and syntax-phonology mapping,
the precise nature of the prosodic hierarchy and its various components have
also been controversial. While, for instance, several researchers questioned the
necessity of the Clitic Group (e.g., Zec 1988; Booij 1988; Peperkamp 1997),
others argue that the theory predicts even less structure than is attested
across the languages of the world (e.g., recent work by Balthasar Bickel and
colleagues at the University of Leipzig). 

In this workshop, we are specifically interested in the nature of the
morphosyntax-phonology mapping and the principles that govern the prosodization
of morphological elements, with special attention to cross-linguistic variation.
In this respect, the following issues will be addressed: (i) how much of mapping
rules is given by universal grammar versus language-specific principles?, (ii)
do morphological elements bear any (lexical) information with respect to their
morphophonological categorization (cf. Inkelas 1989) and how should that
information be represented?, (iii) is there a set of universal prosodic domains
and are all of the domains suggested in the literature necessary?

We invite linguists who work on prosodic phonology and phonology-morphosyntax
interface from all perspectives and methodologies including those working in the
fields of typology, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and language
modeling. General theoretical discussions and analyses of language-specific
issues are equally welcome.

Talks will be 20 minutes each, with 10 minutes of discussion.
