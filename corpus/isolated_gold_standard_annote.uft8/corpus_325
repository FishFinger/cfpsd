AIMS:

LATA is a yearly conference in theoretical computer science and its applica=
tions. As linked to the International PhD School in Formal Languages and Ap=
plications that was developed at Rovira i Virgili University (the host of t=
he previous three editions and co-organizer of this one) in the period 2002=
-2006, LATA 2010 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the be=
ginning of their career. It will aim at attracting contributions from both =
classical theory fields and application areas (bioinformatics, systems biol=
ogy, language technology, artificial intelligence, etc.).

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limit=
ed to:

- algebraic language theory
- algorithms on automata and words
- automata and logic
- automata for system analysis and programme verification
- automata, concurrency and Petri nets
- cellular automata
- combinatorics on words
- computability
- computational complexity
- computer linguistics
- data and image compression
- decidability questions on words and languages
- descriptional complexity
- DNA and other models of bio-inspired computing
- document engineering
- foundations of finite state technology
- fuzzy and rough languages
- grammars (Chomsky hierarchy, contextual, multidimensional, unification, c=
ategorial, etc.)
- grammars and automata architectures
- grammatical inference and algorithmic learning
- graphs and graph transformation
- language varieties and semigroups
- language-based cryptography
- language-theoretic foundations of artificial intelligence and artificial =
life
- neural networks
- parallel and regulated rewriting
- parsing
- pattern matching and pattern recognition
- patterns and codes
- power series
- quantum, chemical and optical computing
- semantics
- string and combinatorial issues in computational biology and bioinformati=
cs
- symbolic dynamics
- term rewriting
- text algorithms
- text retrieval
- transducers
- trees, tree languages and tree machines
- weighted machines

STRUCTURE:

LATA 2010 will consist of:

- 3 invited talks
- 2 invited tutorials
- refereed contributions
- open sessions for discussion in specific subfields, on open problems, or =
on professional issues (if requested by the participants)
