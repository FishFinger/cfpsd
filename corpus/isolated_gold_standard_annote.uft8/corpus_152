	  2005 AUSTRALASIAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP (ALTW2005)




			    SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS




		   University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia

			    10 - 11 December 2005

PURPOSE

A two-day workshop on Natural Language Technology will be organised by =
the
Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA).  This event will b=
e the
third annual installment of the workshop in its most-recent incarnation=
, and
the continuation of an annual workshop series that has existed under va=
rious
guises since the early 90s.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with a day of tutorials, also =
at the
University of Sydney, on 9 December, 2005.



The goals of the workshop are:

 * to bring together the growing Language Technology (LT)
   community in Australia and New Zealand and encourage interactions;
 * to encourage interactions between this community and the
   international LT community;
 * to foster interaction between academic and industrial research;
 * to encourage dissemination of research results;
 * to provide a forum for the discussion of new and ongoing research an=
d
   projects;
 * to provide an opportunity for the broader artificial intelligence
   community to become aware of local LT research; and, finally,
 * to increase visibility of LT research in Australia, New Zealand
   and overseas.


An innovation in this year's Australasian Language Technology Workshop =
will be
the introduction of poster presentations in addition to the regular tal=
ks, in
order to encourage more interactive discussion of research-in-progress.=
  In
this vein, we encourage submissions from students describing their thes=
is work
and any preliminary results.  Note that both publication types will hav=
e the
same status in the proceedings.

TOPICS

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research=
 on all
aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

 * speech understanding and generation;
 * phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse;=

 * interpreting and generating spoken and written language;
 * linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language;
 * language-oriented information extraction and retrieval;
 * corpus-based and statistical language modelling;
 * summarisation;
 * machine translation and translation aids;
 * natural language interfaces and dialogue systems;
 * natural language and multimodal systems;
 * message and narrative understanding systems;
 * evaluations of language systems;
 * computational lexicography.

We welcome submissions on any topic that is of interest to the LT
community, and particularly encourage submissions that broaden the
scope of our community through the consideration of practical LT
applications and through multi-disciplinary research.


SUBMISSION FORMAT

All papers are to be submitted electronically via the Commence system, =
at:

http://www.alta.asn.au/events/altw2005/submission/

If we cannot print your file by the submission date it will be rejected=

without being reviewed.  Therefore you are encouraged to send an early =
