Abstract:

The only international periodical devoted to linguistic morphology. Widely
considered to be the best series of publications on morphology at the
international level, and is referred to very frequently in linguistic
publications. A revival of interest in morphology has occurred during
recent years. The periodical Yearbook of Morphology, published since 1988,
has proven to be an eminent support for this upswing of morphological
research, and has shown that morphology is central to present-day
linguistic theorizing.

In the Yearbook of Morphology 2005 a number of important theoretical issues
are discussed: the role of inflectional paradigms in morphological
analysis, the differences between words and affixes, and the adequacy of
competing models of word structure.

In addition, the role of phonological factors in shaping complex words is
discussed. Evidence for particular positions defended in this volume is
taken from a wide variety of languages. This volume is of interest to those
working in theoretical, descriptive and historical linguistics,
morphologists, phonologists, computational linguists, and psycholinguists

Abstract:

This volume presents the results of the largest ever language
attitude/motivation survey, involving over 13,000 teenage language learners
in Hungary on three successive occasions: in 1993, 1999 and 2004. The
results are not confined to the European environment but have wider
implications concerning attitude change, motivational dynamics and language
globalisation.

Applied Linguistics_a new generation
International Research Meeting for Junior Applied Linguists

January 24-26, 2007; University of Groningen, the Netherlands
www.anela.nl/juniorresearchmeeting 

CALL FOR PAPERS
For more than 10 years, An√©la, the Dutch affiliate of AILA, has been organizing
the so called 'junior days' to which beginning researchers, PhD students, and
graduate students are invited to present their work in an informal and
supportive setting. These meetings have been very successful over the years,
providing beginning researchers the opportunity to present their work on an
academic forum and to receive valuable feedback. 

Stimulated by suggestions from the AILA International Committee, An√©la and GAL,
the German affiliate, have now planned to organize a joint International
Research Meeting for Junior Applied Linguists, aiming at an international
exchange of ideas and a stimulation of contacts between European affiliates of
AILA. Interaction with and feedback from both junior and senior researchers is
highly emphasized.

We invite junior researchers to submit abstracts for thirty-minute oral
presentations and/or poster presentations describing original work addressing
topics from one of the following fields of applied linguistics:

-	Language development
-	Language in the community
-	Language in education
-	Language in professional settings

Possible topics range from first and second language acquisition, literacy
development and language disorders to language variation and linguistic
discrimination, multilingualism and intercultural communication and from
language conflict, language policy and language planning to language and
communication in politics and by audiovisual- and virtual means. 

Language choice for abstracts and presentations is free. Abstracts can be
submitted through the website: www.anela.nl/juniorresearchmeeting.
For further information on the conference, please visit the website or contact

Meeting Description:

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for presenting recent research on constraints in discourse. The target areas include the recognition of discourse structure as well as the interpretation and generation of discourse in a broad variety of domains. 

Workshop on Constraints in Discourse   
                              
http://www.constraints-in-discourse.org/cid06

This is the second in a series of workshops entitled ''Constraints in
Discourse''.

For a many years, the development of precise frameworks of discourse
interpretation has been hampered by the lack of a deeper understanding
of the dependencies between different discourse units. The past 15
years have seen a considerable advance in this field. A number of
strong constraints have been proposed that restrict the sequencing and
attaching of segments at various descriptive levels, as well as the
interpretation of their interrelations. Last year's workshop CID2005 in
Dortmund revealed a number of issues that still have to be clarified
and worked upon. Most relevant topics turned out to be:
- the necessity to have a look at intonation and discourse structure
  more closely;
- the question of formal properties of discourse structure (tree-like
  or graph-like etc.);
- the question of (psychological, social or linguistic) reality of
  constraints;
- the interface between utterance-level and discourse-level analysis;
- and the empirical foundation and availability of corpus
  annotation of constraints.

The goal of this series of workshops is to provide a forum for
presenting recent research on constraints in discourse. The target
areas include the recognition of discourse structure as well as the
interpretation and generation of discourse in a broad variety of
domains. The workshop offers a forum for researchers from diverse
formal approaches, including but not limited to:
- Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
- Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
- Tree Adjoining Grammars
- Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
- The QUD Modell
- Plan Based Reasoning
- Abductive Reasoning
- Gricean Pragmatics
- Speech Act Theory

We invite talks that further our theoretical understanding of
the role of constraints in discourse, as well as empirical studies
that shed light on their empirical validity. The conference is explicitly
intended for discussion and comparison of theoretical
accounts that lay the ground for applications. It is not intended as a
platform for system demonstrations. Specific topics might relate to
 - Anaphora Resolution
 - Co-reference
 - Dialogical vs. Monological Discourse
 - Questions and Answers
 - Lexicon and Discourse Relations
 - Cognitive Modeling
 - Underspecification and Nonmonotonic Inferences
etc.

The organisers are planning to publish a selection of the results of
the workshop either as a special issue of a journal or as a book.

Publication (and workshop) language is English

The workshop is endorsed by SIGdial, the Special Interest Group on
Discourse and Dialogue, and SIGsem, the Special Interest Group on
Semantics, of ACL.

Invited Speakers

Barbara Kaup, Technical University Berlin
Alex Lascarides, University of Edinburgh
Jerry Hobbs, University of Southern California

CALL FOR PAPERS
Atlantic Provinces Linguistic Association Conference
Saint Mary's University
Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada
November 3 & 4, 2006

Conference Theme: Linguistic Communities

Community is the framework within which languages, and specific ways of using them, are acquired, developed, and practiced. Speakers often value and use social and regional varieties or minority languages as a way of acting out solidarity and belonging. Contact between linguistic communities can lead to changes in speech varieties and the contexts in which they are used. 
 
Papers are invited that look at the characteristic ways that language is used in particular communities as well as papers that examine aspects of linguistic communities in contact:
-	How is communication achieved within and across community boundaries? 
-	How does contact between communities influence in-group communication? 
-	How does use of language create and maintain group boundaries?
-	How does bilingualism/bidialectalism allow individuals to cross boundaries? 
-	What are the characteristics and functions of varieties in bilingual speech communities? 
-	Which factors contribute to the spread or decline of certain speech communities?

Keynote Speaker: Jean Briggs, Memorial University, Newfoundland
''Language Dead or Alive: What's in a Dictionary?''

We welcome proposals, in English or French, for papers relating to the conference theme and/or any other topic in linguistics. Graduate students are especially encouraged to submit. Papers are of 30 minutes duration (allow 20 minutes for presentation and 10 for discussion).

Abstracts should be no more than 300 words in length, excluding title and references. In a separate section, please list your paper title, name, affiliation (indicate if you are a student), your current
mailing and electronic address, your phone and fax numbers, and any audiovisual equipment that will be needed for your presentation. Please submit abstracts via email as separate attachments (MSWord, WordPerfect or Rich Text Format).

All presenters must be members of the Association. The annual membership fee of $25 ($10 for students) may be paid at the conference. The registration fee for the conference is $50 ($15 for students).

APPEL √Ä COMMUNICATIONS
Colloque annuel de l'association de linguistique des provinces atlantiques
Saint Mary's University
Halifax, Nouvelle-Ecosse, Canada
les 3 et 4 novembre 2006

Th√®me du colloque : Les communaut√©s linguistiques

La communaut√© est le cadre dans lequel se d√©veloppe, s'acquiert et se pratique une langue et ses usages.  Les personnes qui parlent une vari√©t√© r√©gionale ou sociale, ou une langue minoritaire, sont souvent tr√®s attach√©es √† celle-ci, qu'elles utilisent aux fins de d√©montrer leur solidarit√© et leur appartenance.  Les contacts entre communaut√©s linguistiques peuvent mener √† des changements dans les vari√©t√©s de langue et dans les contextes dans lesquels celles-ci s'utilisent.

Nous invitons les communications portant sur les usages caract√©ristiques de la langue au sein des communaut√©s linguistiques, aussi bien que sur les diff√©rents aspects du contact entre ces communaut√©s :
-	Comment s'effectue la communication, √† la fois √† l'int√©rieur des fronti√®res communautaires et au travers de celles-ci ?
-	Comment le contact entre communaut√©s influence-t-il la communication √† l'int√©rieur du groupe ?

Meeting Description: 

Explicit and implicit information in text. Information structure across languages.

Conference to be arranged by the project SPRIK Spr√•k i kontrast/Languages in Contrast at the University of Oslo, Norway,  June 8-10, 2006.

The goal of the conference is to present and discuss current research in text interpretation, particularly textual cohesion and coherence across languages. We aim to bring together researchers interested in systematizing and explaining the variety of means exploited across languages to create cohesion and establish dependencies and discourse hierarchies in text. Different languages exploit similar means differently, partly due to competing structures available in the individual languages, partly due to language-typological differences. We are interested in empirically based cross-linguistic studies that contribute to a better understanding of explicit and implicit information in 'real' discourse, as well as in theoretical research modelling textual cohesion/coherence.

Conference Committee:

Prof. Cathrine Fabtricius-Hansen
Ass.Prof. Bergljot Behrens
