Textgraphs

HLT/NAACL 2006 Workshop
Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing

http://www.textgraphs.org/ws06

New York City, June 9, 2006
.................................................


Graph theory is a well studied discipline, and so is the field of
natural language processing. Traditionally, these two areas of study
have been perceived as distinct, with different algorithms, different
applications, and different potential end-users. However, as recent
research work has shown, the two disciplines are in fact intimately
connected, with a large variety of natural language processing
applications finding efficient solutions within graph-theoretical
frameworks.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers
working on problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for
natural language processing. The workshop is expected to bring
together people working on areas as diverse as lexical semantics, text
summarization, text mining, ontology construction, clustering and
learning, connected by the common underlying theme consisting of the
use of graph-theoretical methods for text processing tasks.


We invite submissions of papers addressing the following or related
topics:

- Graph algorithms for text understanding
- Graph matching for text mining
- Graph algorithms for thesaurus construction
- Graph methods for identification of semantic relations
- Graph-based ranking algorithms for language processing
- Random walk methods
- Graph algorithms for information extraction
- Spectral learning or clustering applied to NLP
- Graph algorithms for word sense disambiguation
- Lexical chaining algorithms and applications


Submission format:

Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages, or short
papers of max. 4 pages, formatted following the NAACL 2006 guidelines.
Papers should be submitted using the online submission form:
http://www.softconf.com/start/HLT-WS06-TextGraphs


Important dates:

Regular paper submissions               <deadline>March 10</deadline>
Short paper submissions                 <deadline>March 17</deadline>
Notification of acceptance              April 7
Camera-ready papers                     <deadline>April 26</deadline>
Workshop                                June 9
