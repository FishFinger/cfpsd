History

The RIAO conference is a triennial conference, addressing research topics related to the design of robust and large-scale scientific and industrial solutions to information processing. Previous RIAO editions were held at Grenoble (1985), MIT (1988), Barcelona(1991), Rockefeller University (1994), Montreal (1997), Paris (2000), Avignon (2004), and Carnegie Mellon University(2007). RIAO conferences provide peer-reviewed scientific sessions and demonstrations of innovative industrial applications and advanced research prototypes.

Paper Submission 

We welcome submissions from both research and industrial communities addressing the main conference theme. 
Submitted papers must describe unpublished original work, emphasizing completed or advanced research. 
A parallel submission to other venues should be clearly indicated to the program committee. 
Submissions must be blind, any submission containing the authors names will be rejected.
Submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. 
The submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, relevance, technical quality, and presentation. Papers can be submitted in two categories: full papers and short papers.
Full papers are appropriate for describing substantial research with relevant evaluation.
Short papers may describe ongoing research and preliminary results.
All accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference proceedings. 
At the conference, full papers will be presented as a talk and short papers will be presented as a poster.
Long papers must not exceed 12 pages (5000 words), in one column format, including the abstract. 
Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (2500 words), in one column, including the abstract. 
See http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates for the accepted paper format.

The conference proceedings will be available to conference attendees, and through the CID after the conference. 
The submission site for scientific papers is the following: https://wwwsecu.irit.fr/riao2010-adm

Call for Applications

Program Chair:
* Josiane Mothe (France) 
* Philippe Roy (France) 

The RIAO conferences are meeting places for scientific and industrial specialists in information retrieval. There are sites for presentations of both high-level peer-reviewed scientific research and prototypes and of innovative products, selected by a special Call for Applications. This present Call for Application has been sent at the same time that the Call for Papers for the RIAO 2010 Conference. The products presented are chosen uniquely on the basis of their innovativeness in the area of the conference topics. 
The "Centre de Hautes Etudes Internationales d'Informatique Documentaire" (C.I.D.) organizes the RIAO conferences every three years since 1985. RIAO stands for "Recherche d'Information Assistee par Ordinateur", i.e. computer aided Information search.
RIAO conferences have two selection committees: a Program Committee for scientific papers, and an Applications Committee which seeks out and selects those innovative products for the conference. 
The RIAO conferences are not trade shows since the teams presenting innovative applications are selected and do not pay for the booth and time that they are given during the conference. 
Companies whose application fulfills the criteria of novelty and of innovativeness can fill in an electronic form designed by the conference organizers that describes their submitted application. 
In addition to the form, application submitters will have to provide access to an online or CD version of the demo or released product that demonstrates the claimed innovative functionalities of the application. Applications Committee members will verify the functionalities of the product.
After examination of the dossier and the demonstration of each application, the Application Committee members select the best products.
Each chosen company will be provided with a demonstration space (including table and chair) free of charge. The space is near the amphitheatre in which the scientific papers are presented. 
Each company may also be given a special time slot (15 minutes) to give a short presentation of the product. 
A dedicated social event sponsored by Cap Digital, digital content cluster of the Paris Region, will allow selected companies to meet with French top innovative SMEs in the domain of knowledge engineering and multimedia services.
The general topic of the Call for Applications is: 
ADAPTIVITY, PERSONALIZATION AND FUSION OF HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION
Detailed topics are listed above in the call for papers.
Descriptions of the products demonstrated during RIAO 2010 will be published in the proceedings.

To submit an application please fill the following form:  http://riao.free.fr/index.php?action=application.form&lang=en
