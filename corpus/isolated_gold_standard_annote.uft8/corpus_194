*********************************************************************

1. General Invitation for Submissions

The Student Research Workshop is an established tradition at ACL=20
conferences. The workshop provides a venue for student researchers=20
investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language=20=

Processing to present their work and receive feedback. Participants=20
will have the opportunity to receive feedback both from the general=20
audience and from selected panelists -- experienced researchers who=20
prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation.=20=

We invite all student researchers to submit their work to the workshop.=20=

As the main goal of the workshop is to provide feedback, the emphasis=20
is on work in progress.

The research being presented can come from any topic areas within=20
computational linguistics including, but not limited to:
	=95  	 pragmatics, discourse, semantics, syntax and the =
lexicon
	=95 	 phonetics, phonology and morphology
	=95 	 linguistic, mathematical and psychological models of =
language
	=95 	 information retrieval, information extraction, question =
answering
	=95 	 summarization and paraphrasing
	=95 	 speech recognition, speech synthesis
	=95 	 corpus-based language modeling
	=95 	 multi-lingual processing, machine translation, =
translation aids
	=95 	 spoken and written natural language interfaces, =
dialogue systems
	=95 	 multi-modal language processing, multimedia systems
	=95 	 message and narrative understanding systems

The main conference also features tutorials, workshops, and demos. More=20=

information on these can be found at the main ACL-06 page,=20
http://www.acl2006.org/ .

2. Submission Requirements

The emphasis of the workshop is on original and unpublished research.=20
The papers should describe original work, still in progress. Papers=20
should clearly indicate directions for future research wherever=20
appropriate.
	=95 	The papers may have more than one author; however, all =
authors MUST=20
be students (graduate or undergraduate).
	=95 	Paper submitted are eligible only if they have not been =
presented=20
at any other meeting with publicly available published proceedings.
	=95 	Students who have already presented at an ACL/EACL/NAACL =
Student=20
Research Workshop may not submit.

3. Submission Procedure

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and=20=

should not exceed six (6) pages, including references. We strongly=20
recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style=20
files tailored for this year's conference. These will be available from=20=

the web pages of ACL-06 and the Student Research Workshop. A=20
description of the format is also available in case you are unable to=20
use these style files directly. Submission must be electronic. Details=20=

regarding the submission procedure will be posted on the workshop=20
website: http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au/cfp/student-workshops .

4. Reviewing Procedure

Reviewing of papers submitted to the Student Workshop will be managed=20
by the Student Workshop Co-Chairs, with the assistance of a team of=20
reviewers. Each submission will be matched with a mixed panel of=20
student and senior researchers for review. The final acceptance=20
decision will be based on the results of the review. Note that=20
reviewing of papers will be blind; therefore, please make sure your=20
paper shows the title, but no author information. You should likewise=20
not have any self-identifying references anywhere in the paper=20
submitted for review. For example, rather than this: "We showed=20
previously (Smith, 2001), ...", use citations such as: "Smith (2001)=20
previously showed ...".

5. Schedule

will be automatically disqualified. Acknowledgment will be e-mailed=20
