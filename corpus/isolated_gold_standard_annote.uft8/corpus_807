Meeting Description:

The workshop 'Variation and Change in Argument Realization,' organized by
J=F3hanna Bar=F0dal (University of Bergen) and Michela Cennamo (University =
of
Naples), will take place at the premises of the University of Naples in Cap=
ri
and Naples, 28-30 May 2010.

The workshop aims at exploring the diachronic and/or variational implicatio=
ns of
modern current frameworks, pertaining to, for instance, their applicability=
 on
diachronic changes and variational data, the predictions they make on the
progression and actualization of change, and the generalizations offered fo=
r
patterns of variation and change.=20

Research on the nature of argument structure and the factors determining it=
s
encoding and representation has highlighted the complex interplay of semant=
ic,
syntactic and pragmatic factors that determine argument realization within =
and
across languages (cf. Cennamo 2003, Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005, Bentley
2006, Goldberg 2006, Bar=F0dal 2006, 2008, Ramchand 2008, Van Valin 2009, a=
mong
others). The consensus view emerging from a large body of synchronic resear=
ch
acknowledges the key roles played by event-based notions such as aspect (e.=
g.,
telicity, incremental theme) and control, and inherent features of argument
fillers, such as animacy and definiteness, in determining the mapping from =
the
lexical semantic to the morphosyntactic planes. The existence of non-event =
based
aspects in the encoding of arguments has also prompted current investigatio=
n of
the contribution of the idiosyncratic (the root) and structural facets (the
event-structure templates) of the meaning of verbs to argument realization,=
 and
the principles governing their integration (Rappaport Hovav 2008).

This workshop aims at exploring these issues from a diachronic and variatio=
nal
perspective (cf. Bar=F0dal and Chelliah 2009, Cennamo 2009), bringing toget=
her
different strands of research on event/argument structure, as reflected in =
the
choice of invited speakers, and focusing on:
a) the applicability of current models, whether typological, projectionist,
constructional, neo-constructional, co-compositional, and others, on actual
diachronic changes and variational data from different domains, such as
auxiliary selection, argument marking and linking, ditransitives, the conat=
ive,
locative, (anti)causative alternation, etc.

b) the predictions they make as to the progression and actualization of cha=
nge,
for instance whether syntactic aspects are affected earlier by change than
lexical aspects, the role played by pragmatic notions, frequency, etc.

c) the generalizations offered for recurrent patterns of variation and chan=
ge,
and the uniformity encountered.

Contributions are invited from scholars of different theoretical persuasion=
s for
discussion on the general and specific implications of different theoretica=
l
models on argument/event structure in a diachronic and/or variational
perspective, including, but not limited to, the following:
- voice
- case-marking and grammatical relations
- (in)transitive alternations
- split intransitivity
- existential/presentative constructions

Please send your abstracts of 500 words or less to the workshop's contact
person: Eystein Dahl (Eystein.Dahl@uib.no). Abstracts should be sent no lat=
er
than <deadline>15 December 2009</deadline>, preferably in pdf-format. A response on abstracts wi=
ll be
sent out no later than 20 January 2010.
