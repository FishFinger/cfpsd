es of
the University of Helsinki.

Confirmed invited speakers:
Dirk Geeraerts (University of Leuven)
Martin Haspelmath (MPI, Leipzig)
Beth Levin (Stanford University)

Call for Papers

Traditionally, synonymy refers to a situation where a language has two (or =
more)
linguistic forms for expressing one meaning. Synonymy is by no means uncomm=
on in
languages, exemplified also by the large number of synonym dictionaries and
thesauri. However, it is important to note that the existence or lack of
synonymy is largely a matter of definition. On the one hand, if we define
synonymy as (very close) semantic similarity or (essentially) identical
reference, it definitely exists to some extent in all languages. On the oth=
er
hand, if we confine the notion to total synonymy (comprising not only refer=
ence,
but also, for example, stylistic and sociolinguistic factors as well as
contextual preferences), it becomes less evident whether synonymy really ex=
ists.

Many theories of grammar (such as Cognitive Grammar and Construction Gramma=
r) do
not acknowledge the concept of synonymy at all. Synonymy seems to militate
against the expected relation of meaning and form: a difference in form sho=
uld
always and necessarily correspond to a difference in meaning. However, with=
in
these theories (and within linguistics in general), a recurring topic of st=
udy
is lexical, constructional, functional and formal similarity. In addition,
current research seems to steer clear of synonymy(and sameness), but at the=
 same
time puts a great deal of emphasis on similarities, e.g. when and why two o=
r
more constructions with seemingly similar meanings are used as each other's
alternatives. Nevertheless, where does the boundary lie between the two, i.=
e.
when do we cross over from synonymy to mere similarity, or vice versa, and,
moreover, how different can two constructions or expressions be and yet sti=
ll be
considered similar in terms of their meaning/function? Do all synonymous
expressions share a common conceptual (abstract) schema? What is the relati=
on
between these schemas and lexical (i.e. 'traditional') synonymy?

The idea of the proposed symposium is to challenge linguists both to re-thi=
nk
the concept of synonymy and sameness, as opposed to the similarity, of
linguistic expressions and to approach the concept of synonymy from a broad=
er
perspective. What we propose is that synonymy is best seen as sameness or
similarity of forms and functions, not only as a notion related to lexical
semantics. For example, many languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, allow=
 the
expression of location through both cases and adpositions, and many languag=
es
have both intransitive and transitive reflexive forms; these expressions ma=
y be
identical in meaning in certain contexts, but upon closer examination they =
also
display differences.

In brief: Does a difference in form always correspond to a difference in
meaning/function? If so, is there any justification for the validity of the
notion of synonymy in linguistic description? If synonymy really exists on =
some
level, do we need to broaden the concept of synonymy and if so, how? What d=
oes
the way that synonymy has been studied tell us about language and, perhaps =
as
interestingly, about linguistics?

Possible topics for talks include (but are not restricted to) the following=
:
- The role of synonymy in linguistic theory
- Corpus-based studies of (lexical/functional) synonymy
- Psycholinguistic studies of synonymy/processing of synonymy
- Seemingly synonymous/similar categories across languages (e.g. dative,
reflexive, person, tense, deixis etc.), comparability of functions across l=
anguages
- The role of synonymy in lexical typology: do 'identical' lexemes in diffe=
rent
languages express identical/similar meanings? Translatability of lexemes
- The development of synonymy; competition of synonymous forms in
grammaticalization/lexicalization
- Synonymy in different theories of grammar
- The relation between lexical ('traditional') synonymy and functional syno=
nymy
- Potential differences between sameness and similarity
- What does synonymy (at any level/in any form) reveal about language?
- What motivates the use of seemingly synonymous forms? Context, meaning,
sociolinguistic factors, disambiguation, verbal semantics etc.
- Synonymy of constructions within and across languages
- Semantic vs. pragmatic synonymy

The deadline for submission of abstracts (in English; max 500 words excludi=
ng
data, tables and references) is <deadline>April 16, 2010</deadline>. Please submit your abstract=
 by
e-mail to the address of the organizing committee: synonymy-2010/at/helsink=
i.fi.=20

Send your abstract as attachment to an e-mail message (in both .pdf and .do=
c
formats). Please indicate clearly whether your abstract is intended as a po=
ster
or a section paper. The abstracts will be evaluated by the organizing commi=
ttee
and by the members of the scientific committee (see below). Participants wi=
ll be
notified about acceptance by May 15, 2010. The book of abstracts will be
published on the web pages of the symposium.

Workshop Proposals
Proposals for workshops should be submitted no later than <deadline>March 15, 2010</deadline>.
Notification of acceptance will be given by April 9. These one-day workshop=
s
will run in parallel sessions with the main conference program. Alternative=
ly,
the first day of the symposium may be dedicated to workshops. The symposium
organizers will provide the lecture rooms and other facilities, but the wor=
kshop
organizers will be responsible for the organization of their workshops (cho=
osing
the speakers etc.).

The Abstract Submission
The body of the e-mail should include the following information (preferably=
 in
this order):
1) Name of the participant
2) Title of presentation
3) Affiliation
4) E-mail address
5) Whether the paper is meant as a section paper, a poster, or a workshop
