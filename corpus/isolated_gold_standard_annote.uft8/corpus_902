Call for papers
European Society for the Study of English (ESSE)
Turin/Torino

24-28 AUGUST 2010

The 10th Conference of the European Society for the Study of English will b=
e hosted by the University of Torino in the first capital city of Italy, wh=
ich will celebrate 150 years as a nation in 2011.

Seminar S.62: New Developments in Digital Resources for Researching and Tea=
ching Scottish Language and Literature

Papers are invited exploring recent developments in the use of corpus lingu=
istics and other electronic resources to teach and research Scots, Scottish=
 English and Ulster-Scots. Papers may address literary and/or non-literary =
texts, and cover the periods of Older Scots (pre-1700) and Modern Scots (po=
st-1700). =


Possible issues might include:

* the structure and development of Scots/Scottish English digital resources=
 (corpora, dictionaries, thesauri,
grammars, electronic editions, etc.);
* the interplay between different digital resources;
* research findings derived from the use of digital resources;
* teaching applications of such tools;
* the use of such tools in language planning and promotion.

Convenors
John CORBETT (University of Glasgow, Scotland) j.corbett@englang.arts.gla.a=
c.uk;
Marina DOSSENA (Universit=E0 di Bergamo, IT) marina.dossena@unibg.it

Procedure for submitting proposals for papers:

Those wishing to participate in the Conference are invited to submit 200-wo=
rd abstracts of their proposed papers directly to all convenors of the pane=
l in question before <deadline>31 January 2010</deadline>. The convenors will let the proponents=
 know whether their proposals have been accepted by no later than 28 Februa=
ry 2010.

Please note that authors of seminar papers will be expected to give an oral=
 presentation of not more than 15 minutes' duration, rather than simply rea=
ding their papers aloud. Convenors should ensure that reduced versions of t=
he papers are circulated among all speakers in advance of the seminar in qu=
estion. There will be
a maximum of 5 papers in each two-hour seminar session, and convenors shoul=
d plan so that there is time for discussion between speakers and with the a=
udience.

It is possible that we may be able to extend some seminars over two session=
s, but this is very much dependent on the proposals received and on the way=
 the programme as a whole develops, and cannot be determined until after al=
l convenors have reported to the Academic Programme Committee in February.

ESSE members (or other participants) can only make one paper proposal per c=
onference. Organising Committees should ensure that this is implemented. Th=
ose giving lectures might be encouraged to be respondents in Seminars or to=
 participate in Round Tables. A speaker at a Seminar can participate in a R=
ound Table or be the co-convenor in a different Seminar.

To: "corpora@uib.no" <corpora@uib.no>


We are pleased to announce that CorTrad, a subproject of the COMET project,=
 is now available for search on the Web at http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlm/come=
t/consulta_cortrad.html

Making CorTrad available on the Web is a joint USP (http://www.usp.br/inter=
nacional/home.php?&idioma=3Den), NILC (http://www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/) a=
nd Linguateca (http://www.linguateca.pt) project, using the DISPARA system.

CorTrad features two special properties:
it is multiversion (with several versions of a translated text) it has spec=
ific search capabilities relative to the structure of the specific texts

Currently it comprises three subcorpora:
- technical text, with a Brazilian cookbook translated into English
- scientific magazine, with Brazilian short research news translated into E=
nglish
- Australian short stories translated into Portuguese

The corpora are annotated with PALAVRAS for Portuguese and with CLAWS for E=
nglish.

We welcome comments and feedback!

Apologies for cross-posting ...

Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara

The Department of Linguistics at UCSB offers a Ph.D. program with a functio=
nal theoretical orientation and a strong commitment to the principle that l=
inguistic theory should be based on language use. We seek explanations for =
the linguistic structures of the world?s languages in discourse and interac=
tion, the sociocultural, cognitive, and physical forces shaping language us=
e, and the ways in which these forces motivate language change.

Our recently restructured graduate program offers Ph.D. tracks in structura=
l, sociocultural, cognitive, and corpus linguistics.
Following a rigorous two-year Master?s program including courses in all fou=
r areas, students take doctoral-level courses in their chosen track, with f=
lexibility reflecting their individual interests, and advance to Ph.D. cand=
idacy by the end of their fourth year. Training in empirical methodologies =
is an essential component of our program; in addition to Master?s level cou=
rses in discourse transcription and basic statistics for linguistics, each =
Ph.D. track features relevant methods courses, such as field methods, socio=
cultural methods, and advanced statistics.

Our department has a strong tradition of language documentation and descrip=
tion and, in addition to field methods, offers courses in typology, languag=
e contact, grammar writing, and documentary linguistics. The department als=
o has an international reputation in sociocultural linguistics, a broadly i=
nterdisciplinary specialization originating at UCSB that encompasses the tr=
aditional fields of sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, socially ori=
ented discourse analysis, and related areas. We now offer a corpus linguist=
ics track that gives students in-depth training on how to transcribe, annot=
ate, and retrieve corpus data, how to compile a corpus, and how to analyze =
corpus data of different types using the most current statistical technique=
s. Our cognitive track provides training in the cognitive and psycholinguis=
tic underpinnings of language, including language acquisition, production, =
and comprehension, as well as advanced statistical analysis.

We welcome applications to our graduate program. Be sure to note our applic=
ation deadline of December 1. UCSB offers four- and five-year central fello=
wships to qualified applicants; smaller awards are also available.

Please visit our website?www.linguistics.ucsb.edu?for further information a=
bout our graduate program, faculty, research specializations, and language =
areas.

Subject: [Corpora-List] BNC n-grams
To: "'Corpora list'" <corpora@uib.no>

Is anyone aware of a source for n-grams (2-grams and 3-grams) from the BNC?=
 I'm aware of Phrases in English (pie.usna.edu), but I'm referring to the f=
ull set of n-grams, e.g. a downloadable file with all 15,000,000+ 2-grams i=
n the BNC. I can generate and distribute these n-grams from my BYU-BNC (htt=
p://corpus.byu.edu/bnc), but I first wanted to see whether they're already =
available somewhere else. I've googled this, but haven't found anything.

I guess the more basic question is whether this data would be useful. We al=
ready have, of course, the Google ngrams data, based on a "corpus" tens of =
thousands of times as large as the BNC. As I see it, though, the ngrams dat=
a from a structured 100-500 million word corpus might have the following ad=
vantages over the Google data:

-- at 10-15 million rows (for 2-grams; 30-40m 3-grams (??) ), small enough =
to actually load on most machines
-- it could include separate frequency figures for different genres (e.g. s=
poken, fiction, newspaper, academic)
-- since the BNC is tagged (and in my version, lemmatized as well), it woul=
d have an advantage over the untagged and unlemmatized Google data

Comments?

I did this quite some time ago, but I never thought of this as an achieveme=
nt, since it's trivial to produce.  In case you need them, http://corpus.le=
eds.ac.uk/frqc/bnc-bi.gz
(it's based on lemmas, but I didn't use POS tags).

Another advantage of the BNC over Google data is noise coming from navigati=
on frames (Have your say, Click here) as well as from duplicate pages (Stef=
an Evert published some examples of this, nothing comes from the top of my =
head).  The disadvantage of the BNC is obviously the time frame (Soviet Uni=
on is still quite prominent there) and British English only.
