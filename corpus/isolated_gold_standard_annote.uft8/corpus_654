Full Title: Revista argentina de historiograf=EDa ling=FC=EDstica=20


Linguistic Field(s): History of Linguistics=20

Call Deadline: <deadline>28-Feb-2009</deadline>=20

Revista argentina de historiograf=EDa ling=FC=EDstica (RAHL) is an open acc=
ess
journal aimed at disseminating research into the history of language
science in Argentina and Latin America framed within linguistic historiogra=
phy.

Above all, RAHL encourages the publication of papers focusing on: a) the
discussion of theoretical, methodological, or epistemological issues in
linguistic historiography as a discipline within linguistics; and b) the
critical analysis of the ways in which ideas on language have historically
been put forward, developed, and circulated. Papers on Latin America are
especially welcome, although work on other geographical areas can also be
reviewed for publication.

For more information please visit the journal's homepage at
http://www.rahl.com.ar
