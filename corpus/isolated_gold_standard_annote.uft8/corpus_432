6th International Conference RANLP-07: September 27-29, 2007

We are pleased to announce that the dates for RANLP '07 have been finalised (see above). Building on both the successful international summer schools organised for more than 17 years, and previous conferences held in 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2005, RANLP has become one of the most influential, competitive and far-reaching conferences, with wide international participation from all over the world. Featuring leading lights in the area as keynote speakers or tutorial speakers, RANLP has now grown into a larger-scale meeting with accompanying workshops and other events. In addition to the 6 keynote speeches and tutorials on hot NLP topics, RANLP07 will be accompanied by workshops and shared task competitions.

Volumes of selected papers are traditionally published by John Benjamins Publishers and previous conferences have enjoyed support from the European Commission.

Time-table:
Conference 1st Call for Papers: October 2006;
Call for Workshop proposals: <deadline>November 2006</deadline>, deadline of proposals <deadline>end of January 2007</deadline>;
Workshop selection: early March 2007;
Conference Submission deadline: <deadline>March 2007</deadline> with notification 30 May 2007;
Workshop Submission deadline: <deadline>15 June 2007</deadline> with notification in July 2007;
RANLP-07 tutorials, workshops and conference: 23-29 September 2007

The conference will be held in the picturesque resort of Borovets. It is located in the Rila Mountains and is one of the best known ski and tourist resorts in South-East Europe. The conference venue Samokov hotel offers excellent working and leisure facilities. Borovets is only 1 hour away from Sofia international airport.
