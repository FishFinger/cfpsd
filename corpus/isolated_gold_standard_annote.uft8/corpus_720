Scope and Aims
==============

The Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence is organised
biennially by the Hellenic Artificial Intelligence Society (EETN). It
has already been established as one of the most prominent forums for
Greek and International AI scientists to present original and
high-quality research on emergent topics of Artificial Intelligence.

SETN 2010 highly encourages international participation and the
language of the conference is English.

The 6th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SETN-2010)

by EETN, the Hellenic AI Society, in collaboration with the Institute
of Informatics and Telecommunications at NCSR "Demokritos".

The conference includes a tutorials session on May 5th, which aims to
inform undergraduate and postgraduate students about the current state
of affairs of AI research as conducted by scientists in Greece and
worldwide.

To this purpose, the SETN-2010 tutorials session will strive to offer
conference attendees and local participants a stimulating and
informative selection of tutorials reflecting current theoretical as
well as applied AI topics that have a relevance to any of the
scientific topics of the conference.

A focus on AI in the field of Cultural Heritage preservation,
curation, and presentation is encouraged.
