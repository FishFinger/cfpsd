                                 IJCNLP-05 Workshop

                         October 15, 2005 Jeju Island, South Korea


Background and Goals

The new framework of Information Society fostered the growing of the HLT 
area and the project of turning the World Wide Web into a machine 
understandable resource to access digital information (the so-called 
Semantic Web), posing new challenges for integrated technologies. 
Lexicographers, lexical semanticists and ontologists are joining forces to 
build innovative systems for integrating ontological knowledge with lexical 
and semantic resources. Important examples of this interaction are the 
recent works on the conceptual analysis of WordNet, and the wide use of 
upper ontologies in innovative international projects like EuroWordNet, 
SIMPLE, Balkanet, DWDSnet, etc.
OntoLex 2005 will be the fourth workshop on Ontologies and Lexical 
Knowledge Bases, following OntoLex 2000, 2002, and 2004. In this workshop 
we want to discuss the relation between ontological knowledge and language. 
A special focus will be on the role of ontologies in multilingual language 
processing. This relation can be investigated from a number of different 
angles, for example:
- what differences and similarities there are between ontologies and more 
traditional lexical resources such as dictionaries and wordnets;
- how ontologies can be extracted from language corpora;
- what role language plays in the definition and mapping of ontologies;
- how to enrich semantic information in wordnets using formal tools;
- how ontologies can be used to treat language in language technology 
applications.
Ontologies and lexical resources can benefit from each other and converge 
into a unified framework where semantics is provided by formally rigorous 
ontological and lexical information.


Topics of interests

The workshop is open to any research contribution dealing with the relation 
between ontologies and lexicons. Topics of interest include, but are not 
limited to:
* Design principles and methodologies for ontologies and semantic lexical 
resources, with a special focus on Asian languages
* Evaluation, comparison, mapping and integration of ontologies and lexical 
semantic resources
* The role of ontologies in the development of Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI)
* Applications of ontologies and lexical semantic resources in Information 
Retrieval and Information Extraction;
* Use of ontologies and lexical resources in Semantic Web applications
* Role of lexical semantic resources in ontology learning
* Ontology-based query expansion techniques
* Ontologies and multi-lingual lexical resources
* Ontologies and lexical resources for meaning negotiation
