Germanic Linguistics Annual Conference (GLAC) 16
April 30-May 2, 2010
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
Abstract submission deadline: <deadline>January 15, 2010</deadline>

The Germanic Linguistics Annual Conference (GLAC) is the conference of the
international Society for Germanic Linguistics (SGL), an organization serving
the broad community of scholars teaching and researching in Germanic Linguistics
and Philology. 

Call for Papers:

Faculty, graduate students, and independent scholars are invited to submit
abstracts for 20-minute papers for presentation at GLAC 16.  Papers may be on
any linguistic or philological aspect of any historical or modern Germanic
language or dialect, including English (to the Early Modern period) and the
extraterritorial varieties.  Authors may submit a maximum of two abstracts.  

Papers from the full range of linguistic and philological subfields, including
phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
sociolinguistics, stylistics, metrics, language acquisition, contact, and
change, as well as differing theoretical perspectives, are welcome.  All
abstracts will undergo anonymous review.

Abstracts must be submitted electronically in PDF format on the conference
website:  http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/conferences/glac
This website is not yet operational, but will be able to accept submissions by
early December at latest. Other conference information and updates will also be
posted on this site. If you experience problems with the website or have
questions, please contact the organizing committee at GLAC16@uwm.edu.  

Abstracts should be a maximum of one single-spaced page in length, and be
written in a standard 12-point font. The page should be headed only by the title
of the paper, and the abstract should contain no self-identification. Follow the
directions on the website to submit the author's name, institutional affiliation
(if any), title of the paper, and e-mail address. Notification of acceptance
will be sent out by e-mail by approximately February 15, 2010.  Those not
receiving notification by that date are advised to check the spam folder on
their computer before contacting the conference organizers. 

Tips for writing a good abstract are provided by the Linguistic Society of
America at: http://lsadc.org/info/abstract-models.cfm
Conference Email : GLAC16@uwm.edu
