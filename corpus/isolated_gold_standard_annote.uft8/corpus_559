CALL/INSTRUCTION FOR SUBMISSION 
Asian Language Technology: Resources and Processing 
A Special Double-Issue of
Language Resources and Evaluation 
 
Guest Editors:
Tokunaga Takenobu 
Chu-Ren Huang 
 
Asian language technology presents an illuminating focal point in the
emerging challenges of multilingualism and multiculturalism to our
society. On one hand, studies on well computerized languages (such as
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai) apply states of the art
technology. They present new theoretical issues and attest to the
robustness of current paradigm at the same time. On the other hand,
studies on less computerized languages in Asia require delicate
balancing between resource building and processing application. 
We invite original papers on Asian Language resources and processing
to submit to this special issue. All submission will be strictly
reviewed by the standard LRE procedure. Instructions for authors and
online manuscript submission links can be found on the LRE homepage: 
http://www.springer.com/west/home/linguistics?SGWID=4-40369-70-35554703-0  
									   All papers must be submitted online at the LRE website ;
