Call Deadline: <deadline>30-Sep-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Since the pioneering investigations of the 19th century, scholars around the world have extensively studied a persisting set of cultural practices transmitted orally among children in their peer groups. This conference aims to bring together researchers who seek to listen to the voices of "the people in the playground" (Iona Opie). We welcome contributions from the many disciplines and professions that are concerned with this field of study, including anthropologists, educationalists, ethnologists, folklorists, historians, linguists, literary scholars, play workers, psychologists and sociologists. The focus of the conference will be on how children's cultures relate to universality and diversity. Papers will deal mainly with the cultural processes and production of children aged roughly four to twelve. Contributions concerning children's verbal art, children's play discourse, dialectal variation in children's verbal folklore and similar topics would be particularly relevant. 

The conference will take place at the Centre International des Langues, Université de Nantes, France, March 15-17, 2007.

Organized by CERSE (Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche en Sciences de l'Education) Université de Caen and CRINI (Centre de Recherches sur les Identités Nationales et l'Interculturalité), Université de Nantes, with the support of the research program ''Apprentissage, Territoires, Temps, Patrimoine,'' Région Pays de la Loire.

Organization Committee: Andy Arleo (CRINI, Université de Nantes), Julia Bishop (Elphinstone Institute, University of Aberdeen), Julie Delalande (CERSE, Université de Caen). 

Advisory board: Andy Arleo, Jean-Paul Barbe (CRINI, Université de Nantes), Nicole Belmont (Laboratoire d'Anthropologie sociale, EHESS),  Julia Bishop, Gilles Brougère (EXPERICE, Université de Paris 13), Isabelle Danic (ESO, Université de Rennes 2), Julie Delalande, June Factor (University of Melbourne), Sylvaine Hughes (Université de Paris 10).

Papers may be presented in English or French and should last no longer than 20 minutes. 

Proposals (title + abstract of approximately 250 words) should be sent by e-mail to Andy Arleo and Julie Delalande by <deadline>September 30, 2006</deadline>:
