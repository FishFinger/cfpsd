Special one-day topic: Morphology and Dialectal Variation

Variation constitutes an important property of human language in time,  as well as in geographical and social space. Dialectal variation is fundamental for all branches of linguistics, and more particularly for morphology, where theoretical hypotheses can be tested on dialectal data, which deviate from standard linguistic forms. The exploitation of such data may present new challenges to the formulation of theoretical proposals, help to develop  efficient theoretical tools, and enhance more sophisticated analyses.   
	
The aim of this session is to bring together morphologists working with dialects of various languages in order to promote research in dialectal morphology, and improve our understanding of variation in human language.  We encourage abstract submission dealing with dialectal data of all language types, all word-formation domains, i.e. derivation, compounding and inflection, and with analyses of synchronic or diachronic interest. 
 
Ithaca (Ithaki): a few words 

Ithaca, the small and beautiful island of Ulysses is in the middle of the Ionian sea, at 52 miles from Patras. It is mountainous, but also full of vegetation, and the climate is mild with no strong winds. Its population counts about 2.500 people, and most of them live in the capital Vathy.
  
The island has several picturesque villages (Perachori, Stavros, Exogi, Kioni, etc.), and beaches (Filiatro, Afales, Kurvulia, etc.). The caves of Eumaeus and Nymphes, the Aretousa spring, and the monastery of Kathara are some of the most exciting places to visit.

Ithaca can be reached by boat from Patras* (12 Euros), or from the close by island of Kefalonia (2-3 Euros), where is the nearest airport. Everyday boats from Patras leave at 8.30, and 16.00, and the trip is about 4 hours, while the trip from Kefalonia is only 10-15 minutes.
 
For more information on Ithaca, see http//: www.ithacagreece.com
	
Lodging information and other details will appear on the meeting's Website soon.

The organizing committee
Geert Booij (Leiden), 
Angela Ralli (Patras), 
Sergio Scalise (Bologna)

* Patras can be reached by boat from Italy (Trieste, Venice, Ancona, Bari, Brindisi), and by train or bus (2.30 - 3.30 hours) from Athens Airport.
