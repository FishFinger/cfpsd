Meeting Description:

The 6th Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium
(DAARC2007)
Lagos (Algarve), Portugal
      
hosted by University of Lisbon, Faculty of Sciences
March 29 - 30, 2007
 http://daarc2007.di.fc.ul.pt/

Anaphora is a central topic in the study of natural language and has long been the object of research in a wide range of disciplines such as theoretical, corpus and computational linguistics, philosophy of language, cognitive science, psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. On the other hand, the correct interpretation of anaphora has played an increasingly vital role in real-world natural language processing applications including machine translation, automatic abstracting, information extraction and question answering. As a result, the processing of anaphora has become one of the most productive topics of multi- and inter-disciplinary research, and has enjoyed increased interest and attention in recent years.

In this context, the Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquia (DAARC) have emerged as the major regular forum for presentation and discussion of the best research results in this area. Initiated in 1996 at Lancaster University and taken over in 2002 by the University of Lisbon, the DAARC series established itself as a specialised and competitive forum for the presentation of the latest results on anaphora processing, ranging from theoretical linguistic approaches through psycholinguistic and cognitive work to corpus studies and computational modelling.

The sixth Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium (DAARC'2007) will take place in Lagos (Algarve), Portugal, in March 29-30, 2007. We would like to invite anyone currently researching in the areas of discourse anaphora and anaphor resolution, from any methodological perspective or framework, to submit a paper to DAARC'2007.

The closing date for submission is <deadline>October 16, 2006</deadline>. Notification of acceptance will be sent by December 15, 2006. Final versions of selected papers to be included in the proceedingsare expected by <deadline>January 19, 2007</deadline>.

Submissions (extended abstracts) must be anonymous and at most 3 pages in length. For further details on the submission procedure, and other relevant info on the colloquium visit its website at:

One-day Workshop on Contexualism 

We are pleased to announce a one-day workshop on:

Contextualims

Fuji Women's University (Sapporo)
September 16, 2006 (Sat) 

Keynote Speaker: Marina Sbisa (Keynote Speech: 'Contextualism: cognitive and objective')

We invite papers for talks of 25 minutes + 15 minutes discussion on any topic related to the workshop topic, 'Contextualisms'. 

Contextualisms

The fact that the truth of various kinds of sentences appears to vary with context has been explained, or explained away, in diverse ways, ranging from moderate to radical semantic contextualism, from speech act pluralism to rejection of the notion of semantic content. In this workshop, we propose to focus on contextualist explanations and on the questions, of interest for both philosophers and linguists, that stem from their critical consideration, such as:

Is there convincing evidence for semantic contextualism?
Is any non-contextualist explanation of the data more adequate than contextualist ones?
Are there substantial differences or not among contextualist approaches to semantics?
How do contextualist approaches affect the received truth-conditional and compositional view of meaning?
How is the context-sensitivity of lexical meaning to be dealt with in lexical semantics?
What relationship there is in contextualist approaches, between linguistic meaning and thought?
Do contextualist approaches to semantics entail relativism?
How should context be defined and delimited?

Authors should submit an anonymous abstract of 2 pages together with a separate page specifying the authors' name, affiliation, address, and e-mail address. Submissions must be in English, which is the workshop language. We will accept e-mail submissions in Word, rtf, or pdf, or plain paper abstracts (three copies). Electronic submission is greatly encouraged. The deadline for submissions is <deadline>July 20, 2006</deadline>, and notification of acceptance can be expected around August 1, 2006. 

Abstracts should be sent to:  
engdept@fujijoshi.ac.jp
(your message title should be 'workshop on contextualisms') 

or to: 

Department of English Language and Culture, Fuji Women's University, 
Kita 16 Nishi 2, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 001-0016.
