10th International Pragmatics Conference
July 9-14, 2007
Göteborg, Sweden

Special theme: Language data, corpora, and computational pragmatics

Chaired by: Olga Zayts & M. Agnes Kang (University of Hong Kong)
Discussant: Paul Drew (York)

Panel Theme: 

Meeting medical and patient concerns in prenatal consultations: evidence
from multicultural contexts

We would like to propose a panel on the above theme for the next
International Pragmatics Conference in Göteborg, Sweden, and we would be
interested in hearing from researchers working on the topic of prenatal
consultations who may wish to participate in the panel. We are especially
interested in bringing together researchers working in various countries
and cultural contexts who use a qualitative data-based approach to prenatal
consultation data. 

The field of research in medical interaction and communication has grown
significantly in the past several decades. One trend that has been
particularly influential in increasing awareness of the need for better
communication in the medical field has been the focus on patient-centered
health care. Mishler's (1984) now classic study of the tensions between the
'voice of medicine' and the 'voice of the lifeworld' has laid the
groundwork for recognizing that health care providers and patients are not
always working in cooperation when attending to health care issues. This
finding has served as an important insight into primary and secondary care
consultations. 

Prenatal consultations differ from primary and other secondary care
consultations in significant ways. For example, these do not generally
involve a patient complaint regarding pain or injury, and patients are all
female and fall within a certain age range. It is hoped that by bringing
researchers together working on prenatal consultations, we may be able to
address various issues, including but limited to:

-How can prenatal consultations be characterized with respect to other
health care encounters?
-What are the medical concerns and patient concerns that may be particular
to the prenatal context, and how are these evidenced in interaction?
-What linguistic and interactional features may contribute to a
patient-centered approach to prenatal consultations?
-How do prenatal consultations compare across geographic and cultural
contexts and how do they differ?

We look forward to meeting other researchers working in this area, and hope
to collaborate with authors to publish the papers from the panel after the
conference. 

The organizers of this panel have been working on videotaped data of
prenatal consultations in Hong Kong; specifically, consultations with older
mothers at higher risk for Down Syndrome. We have been struck by the
various means by which both medical concerns and patient concerns are
addressed in the consultations and wish to explore the linguistic and
interactional means by which these concerns are addressed. 

We would like to invite those interested in participating to send a
350-word abstract describing their data, approach, and research focus to:
zayts@hkucc.hku.hk and makang@hkucc.hku.hk by <deadline>25th August 2006</deadline>. Please
include: title of paper, author name and affiliation, and contact details.
