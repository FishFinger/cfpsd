Second call for abstracts:
RaAM 8 conference: Metaphor and Domains of Discourse
http://raam8.let.vu.nl/

We are pleased to announce the 8th conference of the Researching and
Applying Metaphor International Association (RaAM), which will be held at VU
University (Vrije Universiteit), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 30 June
through 3 July 2010.

As an association, RaAM strives to advance the study of metaphor, metonymy
and other aspects of figurative language, with a commitment to the
application of metaphor research to 'real world' issues. In light of this,
the theme of the upcoming international conference will be 'metaphor and
domains of discourse'. The theme is intended to highlight the socio-cultural
as well as the situational diversity of metaphor as manifested in, for
example:
-- government and politics;
-- religion and ethics;
-- education;
-- science and healthcare;
-- business and organizations;
-- mass media and journalism; and
-- literature and the arts.

The conference will feature plenary lectures by:
- Paul Chilton
 Dept. of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, UK
- Dedre Gentner =

 Dept. of Psychology and School of Education and Social Policy, =

 Northwestern University, USA
and an address by the outgoing Chair of the RaAM Executive Committee:
- Lynne Cameron =

 Faculty of Education and Language Studies, Open University, UK

We are soliciting abstracts for 20-minute papers and for poster
presentations. Abstracts should be no more than 500 words (excluding
references), and should be submitted via the conference web site at
http://raam8.let.vu.nl/abstractsubmission.html . The deadline for abstracts
is <deadline>31 December 2009</deadline>. Notification of acceptance decisions will be sent by 1
March 2010. Early registration will be open between 1 March and 30 April
2010.

The conference will also include a new way of linking basic and applied
research: in addition to regular papers and a poster session, a selection of
'real world workshops' will be offered. The workshops will involve
demonstrations for, and with, conference participants on how metaphor can be
used as an intervention or tool to change people's way of thinking and
reasoning. 'Real world workshops' will be offered on:
-- Metaphor in communicating public interest issues
 (Joseph Grady, Cultural Logic, USA)
-- Metaphor in business organizations
 (Joep Cornelissen, Leeds University Business School, UK)
-- Metaphor in education professionals' discourse
 (Graham Low, University of York, UK)
-- Metaphor in knowledge management
 (Daan Andriessen, INHolland University of Applied Sciences, NL)
-- Metaphor and metonymy in painting
 (Irene Mittelberg, RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
- Metaphor in product design
 (Paul Hekkert, Technical University Delft, NL).

A limited number of travel bursaries/stipends will be available for PhD
students from the RaAM Executive Committee and the local organising
committee. In addition, an Early Career Prize and a prize for the best
presentation by a PhD student will be awarded during the conference, and
there will also be a raffle for book vouchers for PhD students attending a
RaAM conference for the first time. Details are available at
http://raam8.let.vu.nl/phdforum.html .

Several tutorials geared toward PhD students will also be offered on 30 June
before the conference begins. The topics include:
- Identification of figurative networks in multimodal discourse
- The use of dictionaries and WordSmith Tools with the Pragglejaz MIP
- Metonymy as a research tool
- How to make an effective conference presentation.
Descriptions can be found on the conference website at
