Meeting Description:

Intercultural communication: From the streets to the Internet

Some decades ago, the phrase 'intercultural communication' would have conjured
up references to specific contexts (such as the workplace) in multilingual/
multicultural societies such as Australia, the USA, and Britain. Today, however,
processes such as globalisation, global mobility, and new technologies have made
intercultural communication part of almost everybody's life, in a variety of
contexts as well as across various channels. Contacts between people from
various backgrounds have also led to the emergence of new 'cultural groups',
such as virtual communities on the Internet. Such developments have provided new
opportunities, as well as challenges, for the study of intercultural
communication and its increasingly complex nature in the early 21st century. 

Call for Papers

The Second Annual Roundtable of Language and Society Centre (LASC) will provide
an opportunity for researchers working in the general area of intercultural
communication to share their research with each other. This roundtable aims to
draw on recent approaches to the study of intercultural communication in a
multitude of contexts (for example, from the streets to the internet) to enable
a collective effort towards advancements in the area. 

Key Themes:
- Technologically-mediated intercultural communication
- Intercultural discourse in academia
- English as a Lingua Franca
- Multilingual communication
- Institutional discourse
- And other aspects of intercultural competence

Those interested in presenting at the roundtable should send an abstract
(around 250-300 words) to Melanie Burns (Melanie.Burns@arts.monash.edu.au) by
<deadline>11th December, 2009</deadline>. Notification of acceptance of proposals will be by 15th
January, 2010.
