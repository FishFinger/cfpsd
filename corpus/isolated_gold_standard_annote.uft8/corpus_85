**The Fourth Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (TLT 2005)**
Barcelona, 9-10 December 2005

URL: http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html

WORKSHOP MOTIVATION AND AIMS

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural=20
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase=20
level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of=20
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important for=
=20
the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing,=20
human language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in=
=20
general. There are a number of on-going projects on compilation of=20
representative treebanks for languages that still lack them (Bulgarian,=20
Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a number of on-going=20
projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for languages th=
at=20
already have them (English). In addition, there are projects that go beyond=
=20
syntactic analysis to include different kinds of semantic and pragmatic=20
annotation.
The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved that=
=20
aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and more=20
theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other dependency-based=20
treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the Italian treebank (TUT=
),=20
and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG Treebanks, Polish HPSG=20
Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank, etc.). Therefore the development o=
f=20
treebanks and formal linguistic theories need to be more tightly connected =
in=20
order to ensure the necessary information flow between them.
This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced=
=20
students working in these areas. The fourth workshop will be held in=20
Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December 2005. (The first was held in Sozopol,=20
Bulgaria in September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html=
),=20
the second one in V=E4xj=F6, Sweden in November 2003=20
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/ and the third one in T=FCbingen, Germa=
ny=20
in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/).

TOPICS OF INTEREST
We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and linguist=
ic=20
theories, including but not limited to:

    design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;
    applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and NLP;
    the role of linguistic theories in treebank development;
    treebanks as a basis for linguistic research;
    semantically annotated treebanks;
    evaluation of treebanks;
    tools for creation and management of treebanks;
    standards for treebanks.

Workshop

    9-10 December 2005


SUBMISSIONS
We invite extended abstracts (maximum 1500 words) describing existing resea=
rch=20
connected to the topics of the workshop. Please note that as reviewing will=
=20
be blind, the abstract should not include the authors' names and=20
affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identit=
y,=20
e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead,=
=20
use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991)...". Electroni=
c=20
submission (ps or pdf) is strongly encouraged.
Each submission should additionally include in the accompanying email: titl=
e;=20
author(s); affiliation(s); and contact author's e-mail address, postal=20
address, telephone and fax numbers.

    Abstracts should be sent to: mcivit@ub.edu clearly indicating in the=20
subject line: "TLT05 submission"

The presentation at the workshop will be 25 minutes long (20 minutes for=20
presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion). The final version=
=20
of the accepted papers may not exceed 12 A4 pages.
