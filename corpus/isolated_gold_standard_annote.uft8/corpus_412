Linguistic Field(s): Discourse Analysis; Pragmatics; Semantics; Syntax 

Call Deadline: <deadline>15-Jul-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The main purpose of this conference is to bring together descriptive and formal approaches (quantitative or qualitative, synchronic or diachronic) to connectives and discourse markers. It is concerned with some theoretical issues on syntactic, semantic and pragmatical analysis, especially six main topics, primarily in Portuguese but also in contrast with other languages. 

The sub-unit 3 'Semantics', project Grammar and Enunciation, of the Centro de Linguística da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (www.fcsh.unl.pt/clunl) is organising an international conference on ''CONECTIVES AND DISCOURSE MARKERS'' on the 2nd and 3rd November 2006 at the Linguistic  Studies Department (Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Humanas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa - FCSH-UNL), 26C avenida de Berna,  1069-061 Lisboa (Portugal).

The main purpose of this conference is to bring together descriptive and formal approaches (quantitative or qualitative, synchronic or diachronic) to connectives and discourse markers. It is concerned with some theoretical issues on syntactic, semantic and pragmatical analysis, especially six main topics, primarily in Portuguese but also in contrast with other languages. Those topics are the following: 

(1) The contribution of connectives and discourse markers to utterance interpretation 

(2) Characterisation of the semantic identity (core meaning) of a unit and description of the variation in relation to its distribution 

(3) The scope, the position and the prosody of a discourse particle

(4) The role (The semantic contribution) of discourse connectives and discourse markers in text or discourse structuring

(5) The polysemy and multifunctionality of a unit (e.g. ''mal'' in Portuguese, as a qualitative or a quantitative adverb, as a discourse or a connective marker) 

(6) The meaning and the functions of a unit based on a comparative linguistic study of translation (or its equivalents in two or more languages)
