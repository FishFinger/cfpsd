Meeting Description:

Linguistic Data Consortium for Indian Languages (LDC-IL) is established to
provide annotated, quality language data in Indian Languages for Research &
Development. India has a wide repertoire of languages and many initiatives have
been taken in the field of Text. Speech is still a new venture in the field of
NLP. We target to:
- Accelerate the development of large scale spoken language corpora for Indian
Languages.
- Provide Speech Resources related to fundamental technologies such as 
- Speech Synthesis
- Multi-lingual Speech Translation 
- Multi-lingual Information Retrieval
- Speaker Identification
- Verification for Forensic Applications
- Speech Translation Trial service

Keeping into consideration the earnest need of quality data in Indian Languages
for the research in the above mentioned fields, the idea to conduct an Event on
'Creation of Multilingual Speech Resources' came into existence.

Event Aims:
- Establish a National research initiative group which may lead to an
International community working on Indian Languages.
- Create a knowledge group to cater with issues of Building large scale speech
corpora and technologies in Indian Languages.
- To explore methodologies, new R&D information and emerging trends.
- To exchange information regarding Indian Language Speech Resources and their
applications and evaluation ongoing and planned activities.
- To explore the industrial exercises and needs, requirements coming from the
e-society, both with respect to policy issues and to technological and
organizational entities.

applications like: information extraction, information retrieval, speech
dictation, mobile communication, summarization, semantic search, text mining,
inferencing, reasoning, etc  In different types of interfaces: (speech-based)
dialogue systems, natural language and multimodal interactions, voice activated
services, cognitive systems, etc  communication with neighboring fields of
applications, eg e-government, e-culture, e-health, e-participation,  etc 
- Industrial language resources requirements.
- Organizational, economical, legal and general issues regarding language
resources & evaluation.
- User needs usability and user satisfaction evaluation.
