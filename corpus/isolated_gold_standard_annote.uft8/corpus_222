Call for Papers

The deadline for abstract submission for GLOW 33 has been extended until <deadline>1
December 2009</deadline>.

Abstracts are invited on any topic in generative grammar (phonology, morphology,
syntax, or semantics). 

Abstracts for the Colloquium (PDF only) should be submitted electronically at:
https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=glow33

In order to submit you will be asked to create an account. Since the page uses
encription you may need to accept the certificate/add an exception in order to
complete the registration. Please direct all the questions related to the
submission procedure to: bartosz.bachurski@gmail.com.  Only electronic
submissions will be considered. Deadline for submissions: <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline>.

Abstracts may not exceed two pages of text with at least a one-inch margin on
all four sides (measured on A4 paper) and must employ a font not smaller than 12
point. Each page may include a maximum of 50 lines of text. An additional page
with references may be included.

Submitters whose computers are not envisioning A4 paper should adjust their
margin sizes in order to achieve a text box similar to that on A4 with 1"
margins (e.g. those using the American 8 1/2" x 11" size should use wider left
and right margins (1.13" or 2.85 cm), and may use smaller top and bottom margins
(0.6" or 1.5 cm)). This is especially important for the printing of the spring
newsletter. 

If you wish you may use abstract templates available at:
http://glow.uit.no/GLOWXXX/templates/templates.htm

For the Colloquium, you may submit one single-authored and one co-authored
abstract, or two co-authored abstracts but not with the same co-authors. You may
NOT submit the same abstract to the Colloquium and to one of the workshops.
