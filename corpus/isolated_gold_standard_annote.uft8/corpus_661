Contact Person: Sven Mattys

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Phonetics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: <deadline>30-Nov-2009</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Speech recognition in 'adverse conditions' has been a familiar area of research
in computer science, engineering, and hearing sciences for several decades. In
contrast, most psycholinguistic theories of speech recognition are built upon
evidence gathered from tasks performed by healthy listeners on carefully
recorded speech, in a quiet environment, and under conditions of undivided
attention. 

Call for Papers

The workshop aims to gather academics from various fields in order to discuss
the benefits, prospects, and limitations of considering adverse conditions in
models of speech recognition. The adverse conditions we will consider include
extrinsic signal distortions (e.g., speech in noise, vocoded speech), intrinsic
distortions (e.g., accented speech, conversational speech, dysarthric speech,
Lombard speech), listener-specific limitations (e.g., non-native listeners,
older individuals), and cognitive load (e.g., speech recognition under an
attentional or memory load, multi-tasking).

Reminder: abstract submission deadline is <deadline>November 30, 2009</deadline>
