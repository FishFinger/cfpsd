Do historical periods make their mark on law? How does law impact on the spirit of the times?
 
How does time signify law? How does law read, recognise or represent the signs of the times?
 
How does law signify time? In what tense is it written, pronounced or lived?

Conference Theme : The Function of Mother Tongue Literature in Mother Tongue Education

Purpose : Literature education has been laid great emphasis upon in compulsory education of every advanced country around the world. Mother tongue Literature in mother tongue education should certainly play a very important role in Taiwan as well. Mother tongue education in Taiwan has been practiced for more than four years. Has mother tongue literature played an important role the way as it has been expected? Has its function been elaborated? How have the mother tongue literature and mother tongue education been carried into practice in other countries? Can we learn from the experience from them so that we could practice our mother tongue education more smoothly?
