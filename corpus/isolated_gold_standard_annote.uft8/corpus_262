CALL FOR PAPERS

6th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence - SETN'10
Athens, Greece, 5-7 May, 2010, http://www.setn2010.gr


Scope and Aims
==============

The Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence is organised
biannually by the Hellenic Artificial Intelligence Society (EETN). It
has already been established as one of the most prominent forums for
Greek and International AI scientists to present original and
high-quality research on emergent topics of Artificial Intelligence.

SETN 2010 highly encourages international participation and the
language of the conference is English.

The 6th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SETN'10) will
be held in Athens, Greece, 5-7 May 2010. SETN'10 is organised by EETN,

Informatics and Telecommunications at NCSR "Demokritos".

The conference aims:

 - to bring together researchers who work actively on the field of 
   Artificial Intelligence, to support the exchange of opinions and the
   formation of new research groups and collaborations,

 - to disseminate original and highly-qualitative results of the Greek
   AI community and Greek research labs, fostering international
   collaborations,

 - to inform undergraduate and postgraduate students about the current
   state of affairs of AI research as conducted by scientists in
   Greece and worldwide,

 - to promote research results to companies and facilitate the
   development of innovative products.

A second keynote speaker will be announced when confirmed.



Venue
=====

SETN-10 will be held at the conference centre of the
Eugenides Foundation, Athens.
See also http://www.eugenfound.edu.gr/

All areas of the conference centre are fully accessible.


Submission Instructions
=======================

Papers must be in English and present original, previously unpublished
work. Papers will submitted only electronically, through a
submission service to be announced in subsequent calls. Note that the
submission of an abstract one week week before the full-text
submission is obligatory (see also "Important Dates" below).

Submissions will be subject to single-blind review, and author
information should be included in the submission.

The layout of the papers must be prepared according to the
Instructions for the Preparation of Camera-Ready Contribution to
LNAI/LNCS Proceedings. Papers must not exceed 10 pages in the LNCS
format.

For each accepted paper, at least one author will be required to
register by the camera-ready submission date. Authors are expected to
present the paper at the conference in order to be included in the
proceedings.


Special Sessions
================


EETN member papers:

Selected past papers of EETN members will be presented in a Special
Session of SETN'10. Submissions must include the full text of the
paper, abstract, and bibliographic reference of the original
publication. Only the abstract and bibliographic reference will appear
in the companion volume of the SETN-10 proceedings.


Intelligent system demonstrations:

SETN-10 invites demonstrations of state-of-the-art AI implementations,
providing researchers the opportunity to show their research in action
and interact with the audience. We invite the submissions of
demonstration proposals from both commercial organizations and
research groups. We encourage the presentation of research prototypes,
interesting mature systems, as well as commercial products.

Submissions should focus on the content of the demonstration, rather
than technical details about the system itself, make reference to
relevant technical papers (including papers submitted to SETN-10), and
must not exceed 4 pages in the LNAI/LNCS format. The inclusion of
screenshots in encouraged.


Best Student Paper Award:

The conference will award the best student paper. A paper is eligible
for the award if it is (a) a regular submission and the primary author is
a full-time student at the time of submission, or (b) an unpublished MSc
thesis. After a pre-selection round, the twelve top submissions will
be presented at a special session of SETN-10 in front of the public
and a committee that will award the best work.

MSc theses to be considered for the award should be registered by the
thesis supervisor, providing a short description of the work and
emphasising its strong points. A copy of the full text of the thesis
should be attached.


Submissions:

Specific instructions will be included in subsequent calls and
also posted on the conference web site.
