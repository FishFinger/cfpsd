Meeting Description:

109th Annual Meeting, American Anthropological Association: Circulation
New Orleans, LA
November 17-21, 2010

Monica Heller
2010 Executive Program Chair

In 2010, the AAA will meet in New Orleans, where the river meets the sea. New
Orleans channels flows into the heart of a continent, and out across oceans,
around the globe. The boundary between river and sea, between water and earth,
is shifting and unclear. The circulation of people and other living organisms,
of material things, and of ideas in such zones of passage constitutes some of
the central social and physical processes of concern to all kinds of
anthropologists, historically and in the present. 

Call for Papers

New Orleans has inspired the theme of the 2010 AAA Annual Meeting:
"Circulation." This theme is meant to encourage us to think about what happens
when movement is the organizing trope of our questions, methodologies, analyses
and accounts. We can think in terms of circulation across time as well as space,
through different organizing principles, and in a variety of shapes and forms. 

The idea of circulation invites us to consider what triggers, facilitates,
constrains, disrupts or stops flows; what is at stake in these processes, and
for whom; and what their consequences might be for humans and for the
environment. It opens up questions about what exactly circulates: signs, objects
or bodies. Do different things circulate in different ways? Do they change or
remain constant? What new phenomena, arrangements and inequalities does
circulation produce? How are resources and ways of understanding them
identified, made sense of, produced and distributed in the process? How and why
do rates and types of circulation vary across time and space? What crystallizes
and what continues to flow and reshape? 

"Circulation" also invites us to think across boundaries, whether those are
boundaries organizing phenomena we seek to describe and explain, boundaries
within and across disciplines, or boundaries among anthropologists or other
social groups. It asks us to turn our attention to zones of encounter,
conjunctions and liminal passages. It also requires us to ask whether
"circulation" is a helpful trope for the production of anthropological
knowledge. What light does it shed on the (increasingly widely circulating)
concept of "culture"- arguably the central organizing construct of anthropology-
and on anthropology itself?

We are interested in bringing together papers reflecting the perspectives of all
subfields and forms of anthropological practice, or across them, investigating
this theme with data, method and theory oriented to all temporal and spatial
horizons. Come and participate in the circulation of ideas.

Please refer to www.aaanet.org for complete submission guidelines. Dates vary
depending on format of submission.
