Dear Corpora-L,

The Dictionary Society of North America is planning its sixteenth 
biennial meeting in Chicago, at the University of Chicago, June 13-16 2007.

We would very much like to have a special session on corpora and the use 
of dictionaries in corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and NLP.

Below is our call for papers; we would be especially interested in the 
following topics:

--building corpora for dictionary-making
--problems in using commercial dictionaries for research
--what do NLP and CL researchers want in a dictionary?

etc.

Please do not hesitate to email me if you have any questions. The 
conference is a small (~125) and highly congenial one, and includes 
commercial lexicographers, scholarly lexicographers, academics, and more 
than a few just plain enthusiasts.

Abstracts are due <deadline>Jan 2, 2007</deadline>.

Erin McKean
