Dear Colleague,


Let me kindly inform you that the CSEDU 2010, to be held in Valencia, Spain (7 - 10 April, 2010) is now welcoming the submission of position papers.

A position paper presents an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and worth listening to, without the need to present completed research work and/or validated results. It is, nevertheless, important to support your argument with evidence to ensure the validity of your claims. A position paper may be a short report and discussion of ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research (bibliographic, experimental, theoretical, or other) focused on one of the conference topic areas. The acceptance of a position paper is restricted to the categories of "short paper" or "poster", i.e. a position paper is not a candidate to acceptance as "full paper". 

Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and CD-ROM support. The proceedings will be indexed by several major international indexers, including INSPEC, DBLP and we are awaiting the confirmation of indexation by EI and Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

All published papers will be also available at the INSTICC's Digital Library, which will be made available shortly.

Best paper awards will be distributed during the conference closing session.

The conference program will include a number of Keynote Lectures delivered by distinguished world-class researchers. Their names are announced at the conference website and available below.

Please check further details at the CSEDU 2010 conference web site (http://www.csedu.org). There you will find detailed information about the conference structure and its main topic areas. This conference is co-located with WEBIST 2010 (6th International Conference on Web Information System and Technologies - http://www.webist.org/).

Should you have any question or suggestion please don't hesitate to contact me.


Kind regards,
Bruno Encarnacao
