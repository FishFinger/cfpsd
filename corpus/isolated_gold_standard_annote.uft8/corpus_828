Hello Emad,

I wonder which tool you used to extract this list. Also from where did
you extract it ?

Thanks in advance !

>> Hosted by University College Ghent (Belgium)
>> January 8 and 9, 2010
>>
>> Conference URL: http://veto.hogent.be/actua/mats2010/
>>
>>
>> The symposium focuses on:
>>
>> - The relationship between non-translated texts and translated texts in
>> one language
>> - The relationship between source texts and target texts
>> - Innovative methods and techniques for collecting and analysing data in
>> Translation Studies
>>
>>
>> Plenary speakers

>> More information about registration, social programme, venue on the MATS
>> 2010 website: http://veto.hogent.be/acorpctua/mats2010/
>>
>>
>> Background
>>
>> The introduction of a corpus-based methodology in the field of
>> Translation Studies (Baker 1993) gave rise to a large number of
>> empirical studies that investigate the fundamental characteristics of
>> translated texts and their relationship to their source texts and
>> non-translated texts. These studies have yielded interesting insights
>> into the nature of translated language and the translation process, such
>> as the so-called translation universals, the ideology of translation and
>> stylistic differences between translators.
>>
>> Nevertheless, important methodological and conceptual challenges lie
>> ahead. Some languages, for instance, are less well-studied within
>> corpus-based Translation Studies. Obviously, in order to empirically
>> verify general hypotheses about translation products and processes, as
>> many languages as possible have to be studied.
>>
>> In addition, some general hypotheses, like the explicitation
>> hypothesis, need conceptual refinement: to what extent, for instance, is
>> explicitation at syntactic level identical to explicitation at
>> discursive level? Most importantly, how can general hypotheses be put to
>> the test or, in other words, how do we 'translate? (operationalise)
>> hypotheses so that they are empirically testable in a corpus?
>> The two-day symposium therefore wants to encourage corpus-based work on
>> translations in less well-studied languages as well as corpus-based work
>> that pushes methodological and conceptual frontiers in Translation
>> Studies. Possible questions / hypotheses include (but are not limited
>> to) untranslatability or implicitation, deictic shifts in translation,
>> information structure asymmetries between source and target texts,
>> register differences within translated language. More information can be
>> found on the conference website.

>> In recent years, automatic ontology learning from text has provided

ng

>> The main objective of this book is to provide relevant theoretical
>> foundations, and disseminate new research findings and expert views on t=
he
>> remaining challenges in ontology learning. In particular, the book focus=
es
>> on the following questions:
>> # Can ontology learning continue to rely on techniques borrowed from
>> related
>> areas that were conceived for other purposes? Has the time arrived for us
>> to
>> look at certain peculiar requirements of ontology learning and develop
>> specific techniques to meet these requirements?
>> # Lightweight ontologies are the most common type of ontologies in a
>> variety
>> of existing Semantic Web applications (e.g. knowledge management, docume=
nt
>> retrieval, communities of practice, data integration). Can these
>> lightweight
>> ontologies be easily extended to formal ones? If so, how?
>> # The poor coverage, rarity and maintenance cost related to
>> manually-created
>> resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS) and text corpora
>> (e.g. BNC, GENIA corpus) have prompted an increasing number of researche=
rs
>> to turn to dynamic Web data for ontology learning. There is currently a
>> lack
>> of study concentrating on the systematic use of Web data as background
>> knowledge for all phases of ontology learning. How do we know if we have
>> the
>> necessary background knowledge to carry out all our ontology learning
>> tasks?
>> Where do we look for more background knowledge if we know that what we
>> have
>> is inadequate?
>> # More and more practitioners in the domain of biology, health care,
>> chemistry, manufacturing, etc are looking up to ontology learning
>> techniques
>> for solutions to their knowledge sharing and reusability needs. How much
>> more difficult is it to automatically learn ontologies from news article=
s,
>> as compared to clinical notes or biomedical literature? To what extent c=
an
>> the current techniques meet the requirements of learning from texts acro=
ss
>> different domains? Is the field of automatic ontology learning from text
>> ready for the industry?
