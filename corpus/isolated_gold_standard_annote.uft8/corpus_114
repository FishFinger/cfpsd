Call for participation for the


        Symposium on Dialogue Modelling and Generation
           http://lubitsch.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/DMG


                    held on occasion of
      Annual meeting of the Society for Text & Discourse
        Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                  July 7, 2005 (New Date!)

The symposium is held as part of the Annual meeting of the the Society
for Text & Discourse (ST&D), July 6-9 2005.

This symposium is intended to tackle issues in the semantics and
pragmatics of dialogue and dialogue generation. It aims at bringing
together the dialogue modelling and language generation/production
communities and will provide an opportunity for researchers from a
variety of disciplines, including linguistics, computer science and
psycholinguistics, to exchange ideas.

We invited talks elaborating on important theoretical notions in
dialogue modelling -such as constraints (Asher & Lascarides, 2003, and
many other recent papers), the role of domain knowledge (e.g., Ludwig,
2003, and, again, many more) and the influence of social relations
between interlocutors on dialogue behaviour (going back to the seminal
work by Brown and Levinson, 1978)- and asked presenters to shed light
on these or other theoretically fruitful notions in dialogue modelling
by:

- relating them to issues in language generation/production or

- drawing out similarities and differences between applications of
  such notions in discourse generation versus interpretation or

- describing computational/implemented models, in particular, for
  generation/production or

- comparing psycholinguistic with linguistic or engineering approaches
  to dialogue modelling.

The symposium will thus be a natural complement to ones
that deal with natural language interpretation or structural properties of
discourse.

See the schedule at
http://lubitsch.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/DMG/schedule.html

The Symposium is endorsed by SIGGen as well as by SIGDial
