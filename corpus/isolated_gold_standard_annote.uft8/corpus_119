=09=09    6th International Workshop on
=09    Linguistically Interpreted Corpora (LINC-2005)

=09       http://www.delph-in.net/events/05/linc/


=09=09  A workshop to be held at IJCNLP05

=09=09    http://www.afnlp.org/IJCNLP05/


=09=09 Jeju Island, Korea, 15 October 2005


=09=09  Submission Deadline: <deadline>June 7, 2005</deadline>

ORGANIZED BY:

Stephan Oepen (University of Oslo & CSLI, Stanford University)
Kyonghee Paik (ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories)
Francis Bond (NTT Communication Science Laboratories)

TOPIC AND MOTIVATION:

Large linguistically interpreted corpora play an increasingly
important role for machine learning, evaluation, psycholinguistics as
well as theoretical linguistics. Many research groups are engaged in
the creation of corpus resources annotated with morphological,
syntactic, semantic and discourse information for a variety of
languages. We aim to bring together these activities in order to
identify and disseminate best practice in the development and
utilization of linguistically interpreted corpora.

The aim of the workshop is to exchange and propagate research results
with respect to the annotation, conversion and exploitation of corpora
taking into account different applications and theoretical
investigations in the field of language technology and research. We
invite submissions of papers constituting substantial, original, and
unpublished work on all aspects of linguistically interpreted corpora,
including, but not limited to:
 - creation of practical annotation schemes
 - efficient annotation techniques=20
 - automation of corpus annotation
 - tools supporting corpus conversions
 - validation including consistency checking of corpora
 - browsing corpora and searching for instances of linguistic phenomena
 - interpretation of quantitative results
 - automatic induction of linguistic competence through machine
 learning techniques. =20

As this is the first time the workshop will be held outside Europe, we
particularly welcome work on non-European languages and the problems
associated with them --- segmentation, spelling variation, different
encodings and so forth.
