INTRODUCTION

The International Conference on the Computer Processing of Oriental
Languages (ICCPOL) series is a regular international conference supported by
the Chinese and Oriental Languages Society (COLCS), an international society
founded in 1975. 

 

Recent ICCPOLs have been held in Hong Kong (1997), Tokushima, Japan (1999),
Seoul, Korea (2001) and Shenyang, China (2003). The 2006 Conference will be
the 21st gathering. 

 

The conference serves as an international forum for linguists, computer
scientists, information engineers and system users with interests in the
computer processing and understanding of Oriental languages. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to

 

*	Cross- and multilingual information processing 

*	Text input methods 

*	Document analysis and character recognition 

*	Natural language processing 

*	Machine translation 

*	Information retrieval and extraction 

*	Question Answering 

*	Text Summarization 

*	Multilingual computing 

*	Speech recognition and synthesis 

*	Language resources and evaluation 

*	Web-based applications 

*	E-commerce, education and entertainment 

 

High quality papers presenting innovative ideas, design principles,
theoretical analysis, implementation techniques, programming concepts, and
experimental results are solicited.
