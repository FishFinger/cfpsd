OTM 2005 Federated Conferences - Call For Papers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

"On the Move -OTM- to Meaningful Internet Systems and Ubiquitous 
Computing"  2005 consisting of:

- International Symposium on Distributed Objects and Applications (DOA'05)
   http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/doa2005cfp.html

- International Conference on Ontologies, Databases and Applications of
  Semantics (ODBASE'05)  http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/odbase2005cfp.html

- International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems (CoopIS'05)
  http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/coopis2005cfp.html
                       
                         Agia Napa, Cyprus
                    October 31 - November 4, 2005
                http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/fedconf/

BRIEF OVERVIEW: The current and future software needs are towards the
development of large and complex Intelligent Networked Information
Systems, covering a wide range of issues (such as Data and Web
Semantics, Distributed Objects, Web Services, Databases, Workflow,
Cooperation, Interoperability, Mobility) as required for the
deployment of Internet- and Intranet-based systems in organizations
and for e-business. This federated event is unique at providing an
opportunity for researchers and practitioners to understand the recent
developments in ubiquitous computing. It co-locates three related and
complementary successful conferences (DOA = infrastructure, ODBASE =
meaning of data, CoopIS = application in organizations). Each of these
conferences covers different aspects: theory (i.e. underlying
theoretical solutions), conceptual (e.g. technical and conceptual
solutions) and applications (e.g. case studies and industrial solutions).

SCOPE. All three conferences are about the distributed and ubiquity
aspects of modern computing systems, and the resulting
application-pull created by the Internet and the so-called "Semantic
Web". For DOA'05, the primary emphasis is on the distributed object
infrastructure; for ODBASE'05, it is on the knowledge bases and
methods required for enabling semantical use; and for CoopIS'05, it is
on the interaction of such technology and methods within an
organization or network of organizations. As they must, these subject
areas overlap and, in fact, the organizers specifically welcome
submissions in any of the areas that also emphasize the envisaged
impact on or from relevant issues in the others. To stimulate this
"cross-pollination", a common program of representative keynote
speakers, a joint tutorial program, and a common Industry Track that
runs parallel with the entire event are being assembled.
