Call for Papers:

The Challenge of Arabic for NLP/MT

The Machine Translation SIG of the British Computer Society requests papers for
presentation at a one day Conference in London, UK, on Monday 23 October 2006 on
the subject of the challenge of the Arabic language for Natural Language
Processing and Machine Translation in particular. This includes a wide range of
possible topics such as electronic dictionaries and corpus linguistics.
 
The Conference will be held in the excellent meeting facilities of the British
Computer Society in central London.
 
If you would like to present a paper, please submit a 200-400 word abstract of
your proposed paper by <deadline>15 July</deadline>. Please send them to me, wiggjd@bcs.org.uk with
copies to r.mitkov@wlv.ac.uk and d.r.lewis@exeter.ac.uk. The Conference language
will be English.
 
We will accept or reject the abstract by the 15 August. After acceptance we will
require your paper to be supplied in hardcopy and electronic form (MS Word only
with Arabic capability) by <deadline>15 September</deadline> for inclusion in the Proceedings which
will be published under the auspices of the British Computer Society.
 
We are looking for papers to be delivered in 30 to 40 minutes with each being
followed immediately by 5 to 10 minutes of question and answer time.
 
Facilities are available for the display of computer information for
illustration purposes during the presentation.
 
We will also be able to provide separate facilities for the demonstration of
software without the presentation of a paper.
 
We have tentatively divided up the day under the following headings, but this is
flexible:
 
Morning:
 
(i)  Introduction: talks on the Arabic language
(ii) The challenges of Arabic for language processing
 
Afternoon:
 
(iii) Concrete applications I: NLP tasks and applications for Arabic
(iv) Concrete applications II: MT between English and Arabic in focus
 
With reference to expenses for attending and presenting your paper at the
Conference I regret we are not in a position to pay for any expenses outside
this country. Within the UK we may be able to pay some expenses on an individual
basis. As soon as you like, please let me know what you need, if anything. We
may be able to arrange reasonably priced (for London) hotel accommodation for
you if you need it. Please let me know by 15 July as well.
 
Please see our website at http://www.bcs-mt.org.uk for the latest information
about the Conference.
 
Finally, I would be grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible of any
e-mail lists which you think we should address in order to advertise this
Conference more widely.
 
Thank you for your interest in our Conference.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
David Wigg
