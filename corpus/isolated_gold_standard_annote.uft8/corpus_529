Journal of Natural Language Engineering

*** Call for special issue proposals ***


The area of Natural Language Engineering is following the trend of 
many other areas, becoming highly specialised with a number of 
application-orientated and narrow-domain topics emerging or growing 
in importance. These developments, often coincident with a lack of 
related literature, necessitates and warrants the publication of 
specialised volumes focusing on a specific topic of interest to the 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research community.

The Journal of Natural Language Engineering invites proposals for 
special issues on a competitive basis on any topics of applied NLP 
which have emerged as important developments in Natural Language 
Engineering and which have attracted the attention of a number of 
researchers or research groups.

Topics could cover a variety of NLP methods, tasks and resources as 
well as NLP-related applications but should focus on the practical 
implications of operation on the large scale. Topics covering NLP 
methods, tasks and resources could include but are not limited to POS 
tagging, parsing, semantic role labelling, word sense disambiguation, 
anaphora and coreference resolution, named entity recognition, 
natural language generation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, 
multimodal processing, statistical methods in Natural Language 
Engineering, machine learning, evaluation methodologies, corpora and 
ontologies. Topics covering NLP applications could include but are 
not limited to machine translation, translation memory, translation 
tools, summarisation, information retrieval, information extraction, 
alignment, term extraction, question answering and CALL.

Calls for special issue proposals may be based on a successful 
workshop or a body of work associated with a particular group or 
section of the community. In all cases, however, the reviewing 
process of the accepted proposals will be rigorous and all 
submissions must be be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Guest 
Editorial Board or other suitable reviewers agreed by the NLE 
Editors. In the case of papers previously submitted to workshops, the 
Guest Editors will not be able to re-use previous workshop reviews. 
In addition, the call for papers of the accepted proposals must be 
open to all interested parties and all authors will be given equal 
treatment; in the case of proposals based on previous workshops, 
submissions cannot be limited to workshop participants only.

Interested editors have the option of preliminary feedback should by 
emailing expressions of interest accompanied by a brief description 
of the intended special issue to the Executive Editor 
(<mailto:John.Tait@sunderland.ac.uk>John.Tait@sunderland.ac.uk). He 
will give a brief indication of whether the topic is appropriate to 
Natural Language Engineering.  In the case of initial positive 
feedback, the prospective Guest Editors will be asked to submit a 
proposal for a special issue which will be reviewed by the Editors of 
the journal and where appropriate, by other members of the Journal 
Editorial Board. One proposal will be selected on a competitive basis 
for each call with the envisaged publication date for the successful 
proposal from this call on or after June 2008.

The proposal for a special issue should include a brief outline of 
the field and rationale as to why it is important to launch a special 
issue on the particular topic of interest. It should include a 
relevant literature survey (related previous special issues, volumes, 
workshop and conference proceedings) and should explain the added 
value of the proposed special issue against the background of other 
relevant publications and volumes (if applicable). The proposals 
should also include a tentative Guest Editorial Board, tentative 
time-scale for the production of the special issue and information 
about the prospective Guest Editors (relevant experience, publications etc.).
