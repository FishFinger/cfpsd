Meeting Description:

The theme of Georgetown University Round Table 2010 centers on the Arabic
language. Arabic is one of the official languages of the United Nations, spoken
by more than half a billion people around the world, and is of increasing
importance in political and economic spheres. 

The study of the Arabic language has a long and rich history: Earliest
grammatical accounts date from the 8th century, and included full syntactic,
morphological and phonological analyses of the vernaculars and of Classical and
Modern Standard Arabic -- the religious language of the Quran and the language
of poetry. In recent years the academic study of Arabic has become increasingly
sophisticated and broad. 

GURT 2010 seeks to explore the Arabic language from a variety of perspectives
including research from the following linguistic subfields: Syntax, Semantics,
Morphology, Phonology and Phonetics, Computational linguistics, Historical
linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Anthropological linguistics.
