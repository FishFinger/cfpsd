ACL-05 will include a special session for interactive posters and demos.
The topics of interest cover all aspects of computational linguistics, as
outlined in the CFP for the Main Technical Session.

We will be experimenting with a new definition of interactive poster this
year, making them more like demos in some respects. Our goal is to have a
program made up of "implemented systems", where those systems may
reflect previously unpublished work (poster) or previously published but
somehow modified existing work (demos).

Interactive posters should feature work in progress (possibly late
breaking) that can be effectively presented via a combination of system
demonstration and a more traditional poster. The criteria for acceptance
of an interactive poster are the novel scientific contributions and the
effectiveness of the proposed presentation in making those points.

Demos should feature mature systems or prototypes that show how NLP
technologies are used to solve practically important problems. The
criteria for acceptance of a demo is that it must already be described  in
the published literature in sufficient detail to allow replication, or
the submitted paper should provide this level of detail. In addition, the
demo should address an application of broad interest in such a way that
it can be appreciated by a diverse audience.

If you have an implemented system that you would like to submit at this
event, but feel that it is not practical to have your system  running on
site in Ann Arbor, please contact the demo co-chairs by <deadline>March 1, 2005</deadline> to
work out alternative arrangements. Examples of such situations might be
if you have very specialized hardware that can not be moved or accessed
via the web, or if you require a particular environment for your system
that can not be easily replicated as the conference site. In such cases
video presentations or other types of presenatations can be arranged.

Systems that are deployed commercial products and not described in the
published literature should not be submitted as Interactive Posters or
Demos but rather be presented as exhibits (contact the Exhibits Chair).

Authors of interactive posters and demos should submit an original paper
(of no more than 4 pages in ACL format). For interactive posters, the
paper should describe and emphasize the research problem and the novelty
of the methods or theories being used. For demonstration systems, the
paper should summarize and provide references to previously published
work, or provide sufficient details regarding the underlying technologies
to allow replication of the system. In either case, demo papers should
describe how the system is used to solve practically important problems,
and may contain discussion of system implementation, deployment, or
case studies of use in the field.

In addition, authors of interactive posters and demos should submit a
short (1-2 page) description of their proposed presentation. Please
describe what attendees will be able to see or do during your interactive
poster or demo. For interactive posters, include specific examples of how
you will show the scientific merit of your approach via the combination of
poster and demonstration. For demos, include specific examples of what
features of your system the attendee will be able to see or use. Please
provide any URLs that link to screen-shots, live demos, or related
information. Finally, please itemize any equipment or facilities that
you will require for your interactive poster or system demonstration.

Submission Procedure
--------------------

All submissions must be made through the START system, which is now up
and accepting submissions:

http://www.softconf.com/start/ACL05PostersDemos/submit.html

Authors must indicate if their submission is an Interactive Poster or
Demonstration system. In either case, authors must submit :

1) a 4 page paper in standard ACL format (see http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles)
AND
2) a 1-2 page description of the proposed presentation.

These submissions will not be anonymous, since self-identifying
information such as system URLs and info about previous publications has
been requested.

Each submission will be evaluated by 2-3 members of the Program Committee.

Submissions that are accepted will be allocated 4 pages in the (TBD:
Proceedings or Companion Volume.)

Deadlines:
----------

Paper submission deadline: <deadline>March 15, 2005</deadline> (11:59 pm your local time)
Notification of acceptance: April 21, 2005
Camera ready copy due: <deadline>May 2, 2005</deadline>
