other disciplines.

an International Language (EIL)/English as a Lingua Franca (ELF);

methodologies, e.g. Discourse Analysis, Conversation Analysis, Critical
Discourse Analysis; using CL to look at language in specific contexts, e.g.
Media Discourse, Classroom Discourse, Workplace Discourse, Academic Discourse)
- Corpus Linguistics and Literature (including Corpus Stylistics; CL and
Translation Studies)
- Corpus Linguistics and Forensic Linguistics
- Corpus Linguistics and Pragmatics
- Corpus Linguistics and Speech Technology

Papers focusing on languages other than English, and non-native varieties of
