5th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION

Motivations and aim
Originating in 2000 through a visionary initiative by Atanas Kiryakov =20=

and Kiril Simov, and hosted twice by LREC (2002 and 2004), OntoLex =20
has recently turned into a yearly meeting (IJCNLP workshop in 2005) =20
for a growing interdisciplinary community of lexicographers, =20
ontologists and computational linguists.

In this 2006 edition we will have a special focus on the integration =20
of ontologies and lexical resources for =93Semantic Web=94 technologies. =
=20
The challenging idea of building a Semantic Web, i.e. an extended web =20=

of machine-readable information and automated services where contents =20=

can be accessed and shared by both human and artificial agents is a =20
growing and very active field of research. This new framework is =20
deeply influencing also emergent research on the integration of =20
computational ontologies and lexicons, since the mutual relations =20
between these two different types of resources are key components for =20=

semantic specification and interoperability.



Topics of interests:

- Design principles and methodologies for interfacing ontologies and =20
lexical resources
- RDFS/OWL-based integration of task/domain ontologies and lexical =20
resources
- Use of ontologies and lexical resources in Semantic Web applications
- Ontologies and lexical resources for meaning negotiation
- Lexical resources and ontology learning
- Ontologies and multi-lingual lexical resources


Reasons of interest
OntoLex 2006 aims at establishing itself as the central meeting point =20=

for researchers involved in building, integrating and exploiting =20
lexical resources and ontologies. We are strongly convinced that =20
adding an explicit semantic web =93direction=94 to this year=92s edition =
=20
will help to address multidisciplinary aspects and will stimulate new =20=

directions of inquiry.

Panel (1 hour) on Approaches for Semantic Interoperability:
In the domain of Language Resource Management two questions are =20
frequently raised: (1) What is the most promising framework in which =20
to represent knowledge about linguistic concepts? (2) Should one =20
construct an instance of the framework =91top-down=92, based on =20
theoretical concerns, or =91bottom-up=92, based on practical =20
applications? Opinions differ on both questions. Four panelists will =20
discuss the pros and cons of the different approaches, focusing on =20
their relevance for the research process and for achieving =20
interoperability. Afterwards the floor will be open for discussion. =20
The goal of the panel is to obtain a deeper understanding of the =20
different approaches and to help in setting priorities.

Important dates
=B7       <deadline>10 February 2006</deadline>: Deadline for extended abstract submission
=B7       10 March 2006: Acceptance notifications and preliminary =
program
=B7       <deadline>31 March 2006</deadline>: Camera-ready papers deadline
=B7       27 May 2006: Workshop


Submissions
Participants are invited to submit an extended abstract of max 1000 =20
words related to one or more topics of interest to the following =20
address: oltramari@loa-cnr.it.

The final paper should not exceed 5000 words. Each accepted paper =20
will receive a slot of 40 minutes for presentation (30 minutes talk =20
and 10 minutes for discussion).
