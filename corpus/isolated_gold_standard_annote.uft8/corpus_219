                   APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

        Special Issue on Applications of Grammatical Inference

                http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~menno/AAI06/

                         Call for Submissions


AIMS AND SCOPE

The purpose of the planned special issue is to present a
representative cross-section of the exciting work that is going on in
this area.

Authors are invited to submit articles on substantial work that
combines grammatical inference with applications.  We place no
restrictions on the type of applications, the way grammatical
inference is used.  Some topics that are of interest are:

   * Robotics: map learning, language learning
   * Computational linguistics: parsing, natural language processing,
     language modelling
   * Information extraction (IE): world wide web IE, wrapper
     induction, DTD learning
   * User modelling: web usage mining, web personalisation
   * Semantic modelling: ontology learning
   * Computational biology: biological sequence analysis, motif
     extraction, structure predictions
   * Machine translation: transducer learning, language alignment,
     bi-language modelling
   * Music modelling: musical style classification, automatic
     composition

Note that this is not an exhaustive list and non-classical
applications such as animal language modelling, strategy learning,
etc. are strongly encouraged.

The main criterion is substance and quality.  All submissions will be
peer reviewed.


IMPORTANT DATES

   Deadline for submissions:               <deadline>1 May, 2006</deadline>
   Notification to authors:                1 October, 2006
   Final versions of accepted papers due:  <deadline>1 December, 2006</deadline>
   Publication (paper):                    Second half of 2007


GUEST EDITORS
   # Colin de la Higuera (Universite de Saint-Etienne, France),
   # Tim Oates (University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA),
   # Menno van Zaanen (Macquarie University, Australia).


PAPERS PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN CONFERENCES/WORKSHOPS:

Authors of papers that appeared previously in refereed conferences and
workshops (e.g. in the 2005 IJCAI workshop on Grammatical Inference
Applications: Successes and Future Challenges -
http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~menno/IJCAI05/) are encouraged to submit
extended versions of their papers.  Such extended papers must be
significantly different from the conference version, as well as
accessible to the broad readership of the journal, not just to
researchers in Grammatical Inference.

More generally, authors submitting extended versions of previously
published conference/workshop papers are strongly encouraged to expand
on the material that was included in the original paper, e.g., to
provide more details, to give greater, more in-depth, discussion of
the results and related work, to expand upon the experimental results,
and to give a more thorough and scholarly treatment of the material
(than was possible in a conference paper).  Submissions must not have
appeared in, nor be under consideration by, other journals.  Authors
of papers whose previous versions appeared in refereed conferences and
workshops are requested to provide the previously published version of
their papers, as well as to include in their submission a brief letter
stating the differences between the prior published version and this
AAI Special Issue submission.


DETAILED SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Papers must be sent to Colin de la Higuera (cdlh@univ-st-etienne.fr).

Authors should consult the Instructions for Authors provided by Taylor
& Francis:
   http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/authors/uaaiauth.asp

If you have any further questions or require more detailed information
about the Special Issue and the submission procedure and requirements,
please contact the guest editors.
