Meeting Description:

The 12th annual Graduate Student Conference of the German and Dutch Graduate
Student Association at the University of Wisconsin-Madison entitled 'What is a
German Department?' will take place on March 19 and 20, 2010. 

Keynote speaker to be announced. 

Call for Papers

What constitutes a German department varies widely not only from institution to
institution but also within individual departments. Many German departments are
entirely German in their name only, and many others share their space (both
physically and in the constructed space of academia) with other languages,
disciplines and cultures. Germanists working in linguistics, applied
linguistics, literature and all related sub-categories and fields may seem to
have more in common with their peers in sciences, letters and humanities than
with their colleagues in their own German department. Still, it is the German
language that structures the myriad disciplines into one department. 

What is our common ground?  In what direction does our own research take us? How
is what we do located within German Studies? What is a German department and
what will we emerging Germanists make of it? 

This conference will illustrate and celebrate the diverse work done by scholars
who intersect at the term German. In order to address the question posed in the
title, the conference committee cordially invites abstracts on any aspect of
German, Austrian, or Swiss Studies including (but not at all limited to):
linguistics, applied linguistics, literature, philosophy, film, art history,
history, political science, musicology, sociology, minority studies, global
studies and cultural studies.

The conference committee will host a pre-conference panel discussion with
UW-Madison faculty members on the importance, marketability and reality of
taking an interdisciplinary approach in academia. 

Please submit your abstracts (approx. 250 words) to Joshua Bousquette
(bousquette@wisc.edu) by no later than <deadline>January 1, 2010</deadline>. The primary language of
the conference will be English, however papers in German are also welcome.
Submissions should not bear the author's name. Include the following information
as a separate attachment: name, title of paper, department and university
affiliation, address, phone number and e-mail address.  Please contact any of
the committee members with potential questions or concerns:
