SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

Cognitive-linguistic approaches: what can we gain by computational
treatment of data?

Association), Munich, Germany, 5-7 October 2006

!!! NEW DEADLINE EXTENSION for abstract submission: <deadline>31st May 2006</deadline> !!!

Work with empirical data is important, if not essential, to cognitive
linguistics. Electronic corpora of written texts or transcriptions of
speech are increasingly used and sometimes purposefully collected by
linguists in their investigations of phenomena such as metaphor,
metonymy, idioms, and frames. During their work, some linguists also
compile - more or less private - electronic archives of phenomena
studied in cognitive linguistics: searchable lists, classifications,
databases. Moreover, they have to deal with these phenomena - usually
in cooperation with computational linguists and computer scientists -
when building general lexicon resources for the automatic treatment of
language.

Problems that arise when working with corpora are connected to the way
they are prepared for and processed by the corpus tools (concordancers,
corpus managers). For example, in spite of some attempts in
computational linguistics to detect metaphors in running texts, no
corpus manager disposes of a ''Show all metaphors'' function. Rather, in
order to search a corpus for metaphors, linguists will devise their own
methods, be they theory-based or data-driven.

Other problems arise when creating project-specific as well as more
general archives of language usage examples classified by cognitive
linguistic criteria. Here, linguists decide which criteria they use in
their classifications and which features of the archived data they
annotate. These decisions are often made at a project-specific basis
and therefore different classifications might be difficult to compare.

At a larger scale, this also applies to general linguistic resources
developed for Human Language Technology applications. The decisions
taken during linguistic resource-building may then be evaluated - by
the resource developers or others -, based on large quantities of data
encoded in the resources themselves. Evaluations of this kind are at
the same time test-beds for theories put forth in cognitive
linguistics, and their results provide valuable feedback for theory
development.

In this theme session, we would like to discuss methods of exploiting
electronic corpora for any cognitive linguistic research, not
restricted to the phenomena mentioned above, as well as practical
experiences with resource building in cognitive linguistics. We also
invite contributions that evaluate the implications of data encoded in
computational resources, from the viewpoint of cognitive linguistic
theory.

Please send only detailed abstracts (2 pages), in which you make clear
how your study is related to the topics indicated.

The deadline for abstract submission is <deadline>31st May 2006</deadline>. Participants
will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by 1st July 2006.

Please send your abstracts exclusively as email attachments (pdf- or
rtf-files) to:

Meeting Description:

LANGUAGES OF (EX)CHANGE: A Symposium of Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Literature,
Linguistics, and Visual Culture 

The Georgetown University graduate students in the Department of Spanish and
Portuguese invite all interested graduate students to the second annual Graduate
Portuguese and Hispanic Symposium (GRAPHSY), which will be held on Friday,
September 29 and Saturday, September 30 , 2006. 

The organizing committee will consider papers related to Hispanic and
Luso-Brazilian Literature, Linguistics, and Cultural Studies, as well as
requests for the formation of special sessions organized around a specific
topic, author or work. These sessions are limited to three papers. 

Papers may examine the conference topic from a variety of perspectives,
including linguistic, social, psychological, cultural, theoretical, political,
ideological, and/or artistic. 

Possible panel topics and papers might include, but are not limited to:

Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Literature and Cultural Studies - 
Trans-Atlantic voyages, pilgrimages, and shipwrecks 
National and post-national utopias(Mis)representations in performance and visual
culture 
North/ South Dialogues: US Latino Studies
Intertextuality and tales of exchange
Migrations, exile, and new frontiers and spaces
With(in) and beyond the body: gender identities and politics 
Ethnographic writing
Representations of violence 
Politics of the memory: trauma and turmoil 

Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Linguistics - 
Language(s) of exclusion: social hierarchies and languages
Innovative research methodologies in second language acquisition (SLA )
Language learning context 
Language acquisition (first, second, and subsequent)
Language and cognition 
Language contact: Bilingualism in Latin America, the Peninsula , and the US
Code-switching and division of private and public spheres   
Language policies, practices, and political systems
Endangered languages: Interaction with the dominant faction 
Language revival
Theoretical Approaches in Linguistics (Syntax, Phonology, Semantics, Pragmatics)

Please submit by <deadline>July 1st, 2006</deadline> two separate 250-word abstracts in Portuguese,
English or Spanish. 
We only accept electronic submissions to GRAPHSY2006@gmail.com 

-- On one abstract, please include the title of proposed paper, name, academic
affiliation, current address, telephone, and e-mail address of each presenter. 
-- The second abstract should be anonymous. 

The paper presentation is limited to 20 minutes (8-10 double-spaced pages).

Registration:
General registration fee for all presenters is $40 (late or on-site official
attendance registration is $50).   This fee includes the cost of all food and
beverages provided only to conference participants.
