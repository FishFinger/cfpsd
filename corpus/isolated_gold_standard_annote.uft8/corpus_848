1st Workshop on Natural Language Processing Tools Applied to Discourse Anal=
ysis in Psychology

    Instituto de Altos Estudios en Psicologia y Ciencias Sociales
	        Buenos Aires, Argentina
		 May 10th - 14th, 2010


Call for Abstracts for a special session on NLP for the Social Sciences



In recent  years, the field  of natural language processing  (NLP) has
experienced  a  renewed interest  in  the  analysis  of non  "factual"
discourse,  which  is  characterised  by  the  presence  of  affective
language, sentiments, opinions, feelings, believes, and manifestations
of emotional states, and which is charged with subjectivity. There are
not only interesting theoretical issues which deserve scientific study
such  as what  makes a  discourse subjective,  or how  to discriminate
between  emotional  states  in  text  or speech,  but  also  practical
applications    (e.g.,   dialogue    systems,    question   answering,
summarization, extraction)  may benefit  from those studies.  Thus, we
are calling for  contributions which will bring together  the areas of
Natural Language Processing and the Social Sciences.

Main Topics:


* Natural Language Processing in Psychology

* Electronic Language Resources for the Social Sciences (e.g., dictionaries=
, lexicons, grammars)  =


* Natural Language Processing of non-factual Discourse

* Natural Language Processing in the analysis of Political Discourse =


* Automatic Analysis of Emotional Discourse

* Automatic Detection of Sentiments and Opinions

* Other topics related to the study and application of NLP to psychology and
 more generally the social sciences



Format of submission:

At this stage we are soliciting abstracts (in pdf)  of between 1000-1500 wo=
rds.
The abstract should include:

* Title
* Authors and affiliations
* Contact e-mail
