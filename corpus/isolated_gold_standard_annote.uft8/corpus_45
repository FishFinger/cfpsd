                      *** CALL FOR PAPERS ***


                    6th International Workshop on
            Linguistically Interpreted Corpora (LINC-2005)

                http://www.delph-in.net/events/05/linc/

                  A workshop to be held at IJCNLP05
                    http://www.afnlp.org/IJCNLP05/

                     Jeju Island, 15 October 2005


                  Submission Deadline: <deadline>June 7, 2005</deadline>


ORGANIZED BY:

  Stephan Oepen (University of Oslo & Stanford University)
  Kyonghee Paik (ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories)
  Francis Bond (NTT Communication Science Laboratories)


TOPIC AND MOTIVATION:

  Large linguistically interpreted corpora play an increasingly
  important role for machine learning, evaluation, psycholinguistics as
  well as theoretical linguistics.  Many research groups are engaged in
  the creation of corpus resources annotated with morphological,
  syntactic, semantic and discourse information for a variety of
  languages.  We aim to bring together these activities in order to
  identify and disseminate best practice in the development and
  utilization of linguistically interpreted corpora.

  The aim of the workshop is to exchange and propagate research results
  with respect to the annotation, conversion and exploitation of
  corpora taking into account different applications and theoretical
  investigations in the field of language technology and research.  We  
  invite submissions of papers constituting substantial, original, and
  unpublished work on all aspects of linguistically interpreted corpora,
  including, but not limited to:

  - creation of practical annotation schemes
  - efficient annotation techniques 
  - automation of corpus annotation
  - tools supporting corpus conversions
  - validation including consistency checking of corpora
  - browsing corpora and searching for instances of linguistic phenomena
  - interpretation of quantitative results
  - induction of linguistic competence through machine learning.

  As this is the first time the workshop will be held outside Europe,
  we particularly welcome work on non-European languages and the
  problems associated with them---segmentation, spelling variation,
  different encodings and so forth.


SCHEDULE:  

  Paper submission deadline:        <deadline>June 7, 2005</deadline>
  Notification of acceptance:       July 18, 2005
  Camera ready manuscripts due:     <deadline>August 5, 2005</deadline>
  Workshop date:                    October 14, 2005


SUBMISSIONS:

  Paper submissions must be anonymous and are limited to at most 8
  pages including references, figures etc.  Authors are required to 
  follow the guidelines of IJCNLP-05 conference workshop style, by
  using either the LaTeX style file or the MS Word document template
  from the IJCNLP-05 page:

     http://www.afnlp.org/IJCNLP05/archives4.html. 

  Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Please email your
  submission in PDF (preferred), PostScript, or MS Word to the
  following address:

  Each submission should also specify the author's name, affiliation,
  postal address, email address and title in the body of the email
  message.  For more information, please make contact with the workshop 
  co-chairs by using the same e-mail address above.
