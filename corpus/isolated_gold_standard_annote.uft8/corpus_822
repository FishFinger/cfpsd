Meeting Description:

RaAM 8 conference: Metaphor and Domains of Discourse
http://raam8.let.vu.nl/

We are pleased to announce the 8th conference of the Researching and Applying
Metaphor International Association (RaAM), which will be held at VU University
(Vrije Universiteit), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 30 June through 3 July 2010. 

As an association, RaAM strives to advance the study of metaphor, metonymy and
other aspects of figurative language, with a commitment to the application of
metaphor research to 'real world' issues. In light of this, the theme of the
upcoming conference will be 'Metaphor and Domains of Discourse'. The theme is
intended to highlight the socio-cultural as well as the situational diversity of
metaphor as manifested in, for example: 
- government and politics;
- religion and ethics;
- education;
- science and healthcare;
- business and organizations;
- mass media and journalism; and
- literature and the arts.

The conference will also include a new way of linking basic and applied
research: in addition to regular papers and a poster session, a selection of
'real world workshops' will be offered. The workshops will involve
demonstrations for, and with, conference participants on how metaphor can be
used as an intervention or tool to change people's way of thinking and
reasoning. 'Real world workshops' will be offered on:

- Metaphor in communicating public interest issues
(Joseph Grady, Cultural Logic, USA)
- Metaphor in business organizations
(Joep Cornelissen, Leeds University Business School, UK)
- Metaphor in education professionals' discourse
(Graham Low, University of York, UK)
- Metaphor in knowledge management
(Daan Andriessen, INHolland University of Applied Sciences, NL)
- Metaphor and metonymy in painting
(Irene Mittelberg, RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
- Metaphor in product design
(Paul Hekkert, Technical University Delft, NL).

The conference will feature plenary lectures by:
- Paul Chilton
Dept. of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, UK
http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/profiles/Paul-Chilton/ 
- Dedre Gentner
Dept. of Psychology and School of Education and Social Policy,
Northwestern University, USA
http://www.psych.northwestern.edu/psych/people/faculty/gentner/ 
and an address by the outgoing Chair of the RaAM Executive Committee:
- Lynne Cameron
Faculty of Education and Language Studies, Open University, UK
