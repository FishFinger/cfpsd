countries and their colleagues in other parts of the world.  Papers presented at ISMIL are 
concerned with the Malay/Indonesian language in any of its varieties. In addition to the 
standardized versions of Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia, papers are particularly 
welcome dealing with non-canonical isolects such as regional dialects of Malay and 
Indonesian, contact varieties, and other closely related Malayic languages. Papers may be in 
any of the subfields of linguistics, and may represent variegated approaches and diverse 
theoretical persuasions. Presentations at ISMIL are delivered in English, as is befitting an 
international symposium.
