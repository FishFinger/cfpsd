CALL FOR PAPERS

*************************************************************
MERGING AND LAYERING LINGUISTIC INFORMATION
*************************************************************

To be held in conjunction with
The 5th International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference
Magazzini del Cotone Conference Centre
Genoa, Italy
May 23, 2006

http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/events/MERGING-LREC2006/

ORGANIZERS
Erhard Hinrichs, University of Tuebingen, Germany
Nancy Ide, Vassar College, USA
Martha Palmer, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA
James Pustejovsky, Brandeis University, USA

Treebanks and other theme-specific annotation schemes, together with
stand-alone resources such as syntactic and semantic lexicons, wordnets,
and framenets, enable annotation of natural language at different
structural levels. These resources have become crucially important for
the development of data-driven approaches to NLP, human language
technologies, grammar extraction, and linguistic research in general.
However, most of these resources and schemes have been developed by
different groups working at different sites around the world, and their
design is often driven by different linguistic theories and/or
application requirements. Efforts to merge resources and annotations in
order to exploit the information in all of them have shown how difficult
the problem of mapping categories and features reflecting a particular
conceptual design can be.

This workshop is designed to bring together researchers involved in the
development and/or use of theme-specific annotation schemes and
supporting language resources to share experiences and methodologies, in
order to provide a basis for addressing the obstacles to future resource
and annotation development efforts. Another goal of the workshop is to
move towards agreement on linguistic annotation standards for different
levels of representation; that is, frameworks that will allow (a)
individual annotations to cohabit with one another (providing
consistency), (b) specification components from different annotation
schemas to communicate with one another, in order to refer to merged
information (creating integration), (c) underspecification of annotation
information at all levels (enabling incremental addition of information
over the processing history), (d) maintenance of individual annotations
as separate schemas for development, acquisition, and processing
purposes; and (e) annotation of multi-lingual and multi-modal data.
Finally, the workshop is intended to promote collaboration within the
international research community on the harmonization of representations
for linguistic information for use in both language resources and
annotations.

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to resource and
annotation formalisms, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for theme-specific =20
annotations
   and resources such as treebanks, lexicons, etc.
- experiences with and methods for merging information in existing
   resources, including both resources of the same type (e.g. lexical/=20=

semantic
   resources) and those containing linguistic information of =20
different types
   (e.g., syntax, co-reference, discourse, etc.)
- experiences with and methods for merging annotations for different
   linguistic phenomena;
- the role of linguistic theories in annotation development;
- representation frameworks for multi-layered linguistic annotations;
- methods for and results of evaluation of annotation standards;
- tools for creation and management of integrated annotation schemas;
- applications of resources and theme-specific annotations in acquiring
   linguistic knowledge for NLP.
