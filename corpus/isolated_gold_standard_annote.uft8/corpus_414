Meeting Description:

The 'Décembrettes' is an annual conference which is organized by the Morphology
group within the ERSS. It brings together a number of French and foreign
scholars working in the field of morphology in Toulouse, on the first week in
December. The 2006 edition is organized in parallel with the Forum de
Morphologie, a morphology conference organized in France since 1997. 

UPDATE: DEADLINE EXTENDED TO <deadline>JUNE 18, 2006</deadline>

International Morphology Conference
Forum de Morphologie - 5e Décembrettes

Toulouse, December 7-8, 2006
Université de Toulouse - le Mirail

Analogy and lexical pressure in morphology

- Call for papers -

Note: The deadline for submission has been extended to <deadline>June 18, 2006
</deadline>

The Forum de Morphologie originated from the collaboration of a group of French
researchers in the domain. In 1997 it organized in Lille its first international
morphology conference, which was followed by a second edition in Toulouse in
1999, and a third edition in Lille in 2002. The proceedings of these conferences
were published in the Silexicales series at the University of Lille III.

In parallel, the morphology component of the ERSS (UMR 5610) research unit
organizes since 2002 the ''Décembrettes'', a morphology conference which takes
place every year in Toulouse at the beginning of December, and which regularly
gathers French and foreign researchers.

In 2006 the two conferences will join to begin a single event called Forum de
Morphologie / 5e Décembrettes, which will take place in Toulouse on December, 7-8.

One of the two days of the conference will be devoted to a thematic session on
''Analogy and lexical pressure in morphology'', a topic both theoretically and
descriptively crucial for our scientific community. The second day there will be
a general session devoted to communications on any aspect of morphological research.

The organizers invite contribution proposals for 20 minutes talks on any domain
of morphological analysis; all theoretical perspectives are welcome.

Method of submission:
Abstracts, in English or in French, should be strictly anonymous and should
contain no more than 1.000 words. On a separate sheet, contributors should
indicate their name, affiliation and the e-mail address at which they wish to be
contacted. Abstracts should be sent by e-mail (preferably in PDF format, or in
RTF) to the following address: decembrettes@univ-tlse2.fr before <deadline>May 31, 2006</deadline>.
