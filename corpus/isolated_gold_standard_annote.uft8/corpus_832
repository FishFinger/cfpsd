Hi,

  Regarding the following post, deadline for paper submission to the special
issue on Computational Models of First Language Acquisition is extended to
<deadline>December 15, 2009</deadline>.
But on your website (
http://www.springer.com/linguistics/computational+linguistics/journal/11168)
it is announced January 15, 2009!
  Is it extended from about one year ago to now, or the date on the website
is a typo? Or as I guess the correct submission due is extended to January
15, 2010?

Regards,
Fatemeh Torabi Asr

<br>
Background<br>
<br>
Language acquisition has for a long time stood as one of the most<br>
fundamental,<br>
beguiling, and surprisingly open questions of modern science. =A0Recent<br>
advances in<br>
natural language processing, statistical parsing and machine learning,<br>
together<br>
with the availability of large corpora of child directed speech and other<b=
r>
corpora,<br>
make a wide range of computationally-oriented approaches to the study of<br=
>
this<br>
problem available. In this special issue, we will provide a forum for the f=
ull<br>
range<br>
of current approaches to this important field.<br>
<br>
Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular<br>
interest in<br>
light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest that very<=
br>
young<br>
infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an audible input str=
eam.<br>
Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical &#39;machinery&#39; =
to the<br>
task of<br>
grammar acquisition, with or without an innate language component,<br>
remains an<br>
open and important question. One effective line of investigation is to<br>
computationally model the acquisition process, through simulation,<br>
mathematically, the statistical analysis of corpora, etc., and determine<br=
>
interrelationships between a model and linguistic or psycholinguistic theor=
y,<br>
and/or correlations between a model&#39;s performance and data from<br>
linguistic<br>
environments that children are<br>
exposed to.<br>
<br>
Topics<br>
<br>
We aim to publish papers that describe state of the art techniques in<br>
computational models of language acquisition. These should be<br>
computationally<br>
explicit but not necessarily implemented and these could be evaluated<br>
empirically, theoretically or on the basis of a detailed case study.<br>
This special issue should provide an interdisciplinary forum where<br>
researchers in<br>
theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, natural language processing,<br=
>
grammatical<br>
inference, machine learning and cognitive science can present research on<b=
r>
the<br>
computational modelling of first language acquisition.<br>
<br>
We welcome papers from any of the current models of linguistic theorising:<=
br>
standard and enriched context free models, Principles and Parameters<br>
models,<br>
Optimiality theory and reseachers working within the Minimalist Program,<br=
>
and<br>
other approaches.<br>
<br>
Topics include but are not limited to:<br>
<br>
* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;<br>
* Models that combine parsing and learning<br>
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that use<br>
 =A0 psychologically plausible models of the information available to the<b=
r>
learner<br>
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported studies<br>
* =A0Models that address learning bias in terms of innate linguistic knowle=
dge<br>
 =A0 versus statistical regularity in the input<br>
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics<b=
r>
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning<br>
* Models of language change and its effect on language acquisition or vice<=
br>
versa<br>
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars<br>
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or<=
br>
 =A0 developmental theories (e.g., principles &amp; parameters, optimality =
