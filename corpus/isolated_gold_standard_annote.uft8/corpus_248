Meeting Description:

The last 20 years have seen a flowering of approaches to the semantics of
predicates that describe different sorts of eventualities, including states=
,
processes, and more complex events (hereafter 'event predicates', for short=
).
The complexity of these semantics has developed in two directions. On the o=
ne
hand, increasingly greater richness of detail has been provided in the logi=
cal
representations for event predicates, from Davidson's 1967 use of event
arguments, to so-called neo-Davidsonian representations (e.g. Krifka 1989,
Parsons 1990) which represent the entailments associated with event partici=
pants
separately, to representations which focus on the relation between events a=
nd
their parts - often referred to in terms of 'event structure' (e.g. Pustejo=
vsky
1995). On the other hand, the models for event semantics have been enriched=
, for
example, by imposing a mereological structure on the models for the eventua=
lity
domain (e.g. Lasersohn 1988), or by proposals to expand or restrict the bas=
ic
ontological inventory of eventualities (e.g. Pi=F1=F3n 1997 and Katz 1995,
respectively).

In contrast, comparatively less attention has been devoted to an equally
important aspect of the semantics of event predicates, namely the specific =
sets
of entailments that support a theory of the typology of event predicates. S=
ince
the seminal work of Dowty (1979), in which a small set of primitive predica=
tes
were defined to characterize the so-called aspectual classes of verbs, litt=
le
work on event semantics has explicitly addressed questions such as whether
Dowty's primitives are empirically adequate, particularly cross-linguistica=
lly,
or what a typology of the lexical entailments that support aspectual
classifications across languages might consist in and in what ways it might=
 be
parameterized.=20

Final Call for Papers

The goal of this one-day workshop is to address this latter aspect of the
semantics of event predicates - to borrow a term from Terence Parsons, thei=
r
subatomic semantics. Specifically, we invite proposals for 30-minute
presentations (+ 10 minutes' discussion) on any topic which contributes to =
our
understanding of this subatomic semantics, including (though not limited to=
):

- Alternative means of precisely modeling notions such as change, inchoativ=
ity,
causation, resultativity, telicity, dynamicity, and other commonly-assumed
components of event descriptions.
- Descriptions and analyses of cross-linguistic differences in the ways suc=
h
notions are morphosyntactically manifest.
- Precise characterizations of systematic relations between entailments
associated with events and those associated with their participants.
- Proposals which address the problem of determining when a predicate refer=
s to
an eventuality with a complex structure (e.g. a change and its result) as
opposed to a simple eventuality pragmatically related to other eventualitie=
s
(e.g. a change which simply entails a result).
- Reports on experimental work which contributes to our understanding of th=
is
subatomic semantics and its psychological underpinnings

We invite abstracts for 40 minute papers (including 10 minutes for discussi=
on).
Authors are asked to submit their abstracts to the following site:
https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=3Devents2010.
If you do not have an EasyChair account, please follow the instructions pro=
vided
and create one.

Abstracts should be anonymous and at most 2 pages in length, including
references, using a 12 pt. font with 2,5 cm margins on all sides.
