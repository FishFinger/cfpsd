Multilingual Summarization Evaluation
http://research.microsoft.com/~lucyv/MSE2006.htm

Workshop Description

This one-day workshop will focus on the challenges that the Summarization and QA
communities face in developing useful systems and in developing evaluation
measures.  Our aim is to bring these two communities together to discuss the
current challenges and to learn from each other's approaches, following the
success of a similar workshop held at ACL-05, which brought together the Machine
Translation and Summarization communities.

A previous summarization workshop (Text Summarization Branches Out, ACL-04)
targeted the exploration of different scenarios for summarization, such as small
mobile devices, legal texts, speech, dialog, email and other genres. We
encourage a deeper analysis of these, and other, user scenarios, focusing on the
utility of summarization and question answering for such scenarios and genres,
including cross-lingual ones.

By focusing on the measurable benefits that summarization and question answering
has for users, we hope one of the outcomes of this workshop will be to better
motivate research and focus areas for summarization and question answering, and
to establish task-appropriate evaluation methods. Given a user scenario, it
would ideally be possible to demonstrate that a given evaluation method predicts
greater/lesser utility for users.  We especially encourage papers describing
intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics in the context of these user scenarios.

Both summarization and QA have a long history of evaluations: Summarization
since 1998 (SUMMAC) and QA since 1999 (TREC). The importance of summarization
evaluation is evidenced by the many DUC workshops; in DUC-05, extensive
discussions were held regarding the use of ROUGE, ROUGE-BE, and the pyramid
method, a semantic-unit based approach, for evaluating summarization systems.
The QA  community has related evaluation issues for answers to complex questions
such as the TREC definition questions.  Some common considerations in both
communities include what constitutes a good answer/response to an information
request, and how does one determine whether a ''complex'' answer is sufficient?
In both communities, as well as in the distillation component of the 2005 DARPA
program GALE, researchers are exploring how to capture semantic equivalence
among components of different answers (nuggets, factoids or SCUs). There also
have been efforts to design new automatic scoring measures, such as ROUGE-BE and
POURPRE.  We encourage papers discussing these and other metrics that report on
how well the metric correlates with human judgments and/or predicts
effectiveness in task-focused scenarios for summarization and QA.

This workshop is a continuation of ACL 2005 for the summarization community, In
which those interested in evaluation measures participated in a joint Workshop
on evaluation for summarization and MT. As a sequel to the ACL 2005 workshop, in
which the results of the first Multilingual multi-document summarization
evaluation (MSE) were presented
(http://www.isi.edu/~cyl/MTSE2005/MLSummEval.html), we plan to report and
discuss the results of the 2006 MSE evaluation.

In summary, we solicit papers on any or all of the following three
topics:

- Task-based user scenarios requiring question answering
(beyond factoids/lists) and/or summarization, across genres and
languages
- Extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations, correlating extrinsic measures
with
outcome of task completion and/or intrinsic measures with human
judgments
previously obtained.
- The 2006 Multilingual Multi-document Summarization Evaluation

Anyone with an interest in summarization, QA and/or evaluation is encouraged to
participate in the workshop.  We are looking for research papers in the
aforementioned topics, as well as position papers that identify limitations in
current approaches and describe promising future research directions.

*Second Announcement*

7th SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue
Sydney, July, 15-16, 2006

Continuing with a series of successful workshops in Hong Kong,
Aalborg, Philadelphia, Sapporo and Lisboa this workshop spans the ACL
and ISCA SIGdial interest area of discourse and dialogue. This series
provides a regular forum for the presentation of research in this area
to both the larger SIGdial community as well as researchers outside
this community. The workshop is organized by SIGdial, which is
sponsored jointly by ACL and ISCA.

Topics of Interest

We welcome formal, corpus-based, implementational or analytical work
on discourse and dialogue including but not restricted to the
following three themes:

1. Discourse Processing and Dialogue Systems

Discourse semantic and pragmatic issues in NLP applications such as
text summarization, question answering, information retrieval
including topics like:

    * Discourse structure, temporal structure, information structure
    * Discourse markers, cues and particles and their use
    * (Co-)Reference and anaphora resolution, metonymy and bridging
      resolution
    * Subjectivity, opinions and semantic orientation

Spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems including
topics such as:

    * Dialogue management models;
    * Speech and gesture, text and graphics integration;
    * Strategies for preventing, detecting or handling
      miscommunication (repair and correction types, clarification and
      under-specificity, grounding and feedback strategies);
    * Utilizing prosodic information for understanding and for
      disambiguation;

2. Corpora, Tools and Methodology

Corpus-based work on discourse and spoken, text-based and multi-modal
dialogue including its support, in particular:

    * Annotation tools and coding schemes;
    * Data resources for discourse and dialogue studies;
    * Corpus-based techniques and analysis (including machine
      learning);
    * Evaluation of systems and components, including methodology,
      metrics and case studies;

3. Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modeling

The pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (i.e. beyond
a single sentence) including the following issues:

    * The semantics/pragmatics of dialogue acts (including those which
      are less studied in the semantics/pragmatics framework);
    * Models of discourse/dialogue structure and their relation to
      referential and relational structure;
    * Prosody in discourse and dialogue;
    * Models of presupposition and accommodation; operational models
      of conversational implicature.

Submission of Papers and Abstracts

The program committee welcomes the submission of long papers for full
plenary presentation as well as short papers and demonstrations. Short
papers and demo descriptions will be featured in short plenary
presentations, followed by posters and demonstrations.

    * Long papers must be no longer than 8 pages, including title,
      examples, references, etc. In addition to this, two additional
      pages are allowed as an appendix which may include extended
      example discourses or dialogues, algorithms, graphical
      representations, etc.
    * Short papers and demo descriptions should aim to be 4 pages or
      less (including title, examples, references, etc.)

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information (see submission
format). SIGdial 06 cannot accept for publication or presentation work
that will be (or has been) published elsewhere.

Authors are encouraged to make illustrative materials available, on
the web or otherwise. For example, excerpts of recorded conversations,
recordings of human-computer dialogues, interfaces to working systems,
etc.

Fifth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
COLING/ACL 2006 Workshop
July 22-23, 2006
http://www.sighan.org/swclp5/

Sydney, Australia

Background and Goals

Growing interest in Chinese language processing is leading to the development of
resources such as annotated corpora, word segmenters, part-of-speech taggers,
and parsers. As more resources have become available recently, it is crucial to
create a platform that allows easy exchange of information and data and the
comparison of different approaches to various NLP tasks. The SIGHAN workshops
provide a forum where the latest research in these areas can be shared.

Past SIGHAN workshops included the organization of the First and Second
International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, where many word segmentation
systems from academia and industry were evaluated. The evaluations conducted
have proven to be influential, and the evaluation data set has become the
benchmark for Chinese word segmentation in the Chinese language processing
community.

COLING/ACL 2006 in Sydney will provide an ideal opportunity to bring together
again influential as well as aspiring researchers from Hong Kong, Mainland
China, Singapore, and Taiwan and other interested Chinese language processing
researchers from around the world, to deliberate and interact on a range of NLP
issues.

The first day of the workshop (July 22) will consist of papers on all aspects of
Chinese language processing, including but not limited to:

word segmentation
part-of-speech tagging
parsing
lexical semantics
word sense disambiguation
lexicon acquisition
corpus development
discourse processing
generation
cross-lingual information retrieval
machine translation

The second half-day of the workshop (July 23) will present results from a
bakeoff. A SIGHAN business meeting will discuss lessons learned and future
plans. This year's third SIGHAN bakeoff will be held during the Spring of 2006.
This year, in addition to the standard Chinese word segmentation task, we also
plan a new track on named entity recognition and tagging from unsegmented
Chinese text. Training and testing resources will be provided in both
traditional and simplified character sets from a range of institutions including
Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing group of Academia Sinica, City
University of Hong Kong, Microsoft Research Asia, Peking University, and the
Universities of Pennsylvania and Colorado.

Submission Method

Papers should be written in English and may not exceed 8 pages (including all
illustrations, references and appendices, and using 11pt for the main text).  We
strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or MS Word document template
provided by COLING/ACL 2006, available at http://www.acl2006.org/program/style.
 Since reviewing will be blind, manuscripts should not include authors' names
and affiliations.  Papers should be submitted via START, for which more detail
will be available in due course.

ACL-COLING 2006 Workshop on ''Linguistic Distances''
July 23, 2006
Sydney, Australia

Background

In many theoretical and applied areas of computational linguistics
researchers operate with a notion of linguistic distance or,
conversely, linguistic similarity, which is the focus of the present
workshop.  While many CL areas make frequent use of such notions, it
has received little focused attention, an honorable exception being
Lebart & Rajman (2000).

In information retrieval (IR), also the focus of Lebart & Rajman's
work, similarity is at heart of most techniques seeking an optimal
match between query and document.  Techniques in vector space models
operationalize this via (weighted) cosine measures, but older tf/idf
models were also arguably aiming at a notion of similarity.

Word sense disambiguation models often work with a notion of
similarity among the contexts within which word (senses) appear, and
MT identifies candidate lexical translation equivalents via a
comparable measure of similarity.  Many learning algorithms currently
popular in CL, including not only supervised techniqes such as memory-
based learning (k-nn) and support-vector machines, but also
unsupervised techniques such as Kohonen maps and clustering, rely
essentially on measures of similarity for their processing.

Notions of similarity are often invoked in linguistic areas such as
dialectology, historical linguistics, stylometry, second-language
learning (as a measure of learners' proficiency), psycholinguistics
(acounting for lexical ''neighborhood'' effects, where neighborhoods are
defined by similarity) and even in theoretical linguistics (novel
accounts of the phonological constraints on semitic roots).

The workshop aims to bring together researchers employing various
measures of linguistic distance or similarity, including novel
proposals, especially to demonstrate the importance of the abstract
properties of such measures (validity, stability over corpus size,
computability, fidelity to the mathematical distance axioms), but
also to exchange information on how to analyze distance information
further.  We assume that there is a ''hidden variable'' in the
similarity relation, so that we should always speak of similarity with
respect to some property, and we suspect that there is such a plethora
of measures in part because researchers are often inexplicit on this
point.  It will useful to tease the different notions apart.  Finally,
it is most intriguing if we might make a start on understanding how
some of the different notions might construed as alternative
realizations of a single abstract notion.

Traditional approaches to the development and evaluation of
Information Extraction (IE) systems have relied on relatively small
collections of up to a few hundred documents tagged with detailed
semantic annotations.  While this paradigm has enabled rapid advances
in IE technology, it remains constrained by a dependence on annotated
documents and does not make use of the information available in large
corpora.  Alternative approaches, which make use of large text
collections and inter-document information, are now beginning to
emerge -- as evidenced by a parallel emergence of interest in learning
>From unlabelled data in AI in general.  For example, some systems
learn extraction patterns by exploiting information about their
distribution across corpora; others exploit the redundancy of the
internet by assuming that facts with multiple mentions are more
reliable.  These approaches require large amounts of unannotated text,
which is generally easy to obtain, and employ unsupervised or
minimally supervised learning algorithms, as well as related
techniques such as co-training and active learning.  These alternative
approaches are complementary to the established IE paradigm based on
supervised training, and are now forming a cohesive emergent trend in
recent research. They will constitute the focus of this workshop.

There are several advantages to employing large text collections for
IE.
They provide enormous amounts of training data, albeit mostly
unannotated.  Facts can be extracted from, or verified across,
multiple documents.  Large text collections often contain vast amounts of
redundancy in  the form of multiple references to or mentions of
closely related facts.   Redundancy can be exploited in the IE setting to
identify trends and patterns  within the text, e.g., by means of Data
Mining techniques.

This workshop invites new, original work on learning extraction rules
or identifying facts across document boundaries while exploiting
sizable amounts of unlabelled text in the training stage, in the
extraction stage, or both. The workshop hopes to bring together
researchers from the various related areas, such as Information
Extraction, Data Mining, biomedical text processing, Question
Answering, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, identification of
lexical relations (hyponymy, meronymy etc.), multi-lingual text
processing and the Semantic Web.  This workshop solicits papers on all
relevant aspects, including algorithms, techniques and applications.

Topics of particular interest include:
- Extraction of information described across documents
- Integration and mutual benefits of IE and Data Mining
- Extraction of information from massive corpora (such as the
Internet)
- Mutual applications and interaction between Information Extraction
  and the Semantic Web
- Verification of information using external sources
- Exploiting cross-lingual and multi-lingual approaches for improving
  performance in IE

MLRI06: Multilingual Language Resources and Interoperability

In an ever-expanding information society, most information systems are now
facing the ''multilingual challenge''. Lexical resources play an essential role
in these information systems. Such lexical resources need to provide information
on many languages in a common framework and should be (re)usable in many
applications (for automatic or human use).

This workshop aims at bringing together research on using and building different
language resources, such as lexicons, (Semantic Web) ontologies, tagsets,
annotation schemes etc., to achieve multilingual interoperation.

We welcome submissions on recent and innovative work involving such multilingual
ressources. Submissions should focus on any of the following topics:

    -     models for language/application-independent linguistic data,
    -     multilingual linguistic data acquisition and maintenance,
    -     interaction between different kinds of resources (lexicons,
          corpora, ontologies, etc.) for different languages,
    -     lexical architectures to link data between languages
    -     Internationalization of annotations and representations
    -     use of linguistic resources for applications in a
    -     multilingual
          context
    -     reuse of existing lexical resources in a specific
    -     multilingual
          application
    -     human use of lexical resources in a multilingual context
    -     quality evaluation of multilingual data
    -     standardization issues

We welcome submissions concerning multilingual language resources of ANY kind.
However, special attention will be given to submissions presenting uses of XML
to achieve multilingual interoperability. Moreover, as the workshop takes place
in Australia, special attention will also be given to submissions on resources
involving Asian or Australian lesser-used languages.

The intent of the workshop is not only to review academic developments but also
to hear from industry, how these resources are used in new technology
developments and what the current needs are in the field. Presentations, project
notes and position papers are welcome.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and should
not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly recommend the use
of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document template that will be made
available on the COLING/ACL onference Web site. A description of the required
format will be made available to those who are unable to make direct use of

First Call for Papers

OLP2 - 2nd Workshop on Ontology Learning and Population -- Bridging
the Gap between Text and Knowledge

Workshop at COLING/ACL 2006

July 22nd, 2006
Sydney, Australia

Supported By SmartWeb (http://www.smartweb-projekt.de/)

Topic and Motivation

An ontology is an explicit and formal specification of a shared
conceptualization of a domain of interest. Ontologies formalize the intensional
aspects of a domain, whereas the extensional part is provided by a knowledge
base that contains assertions about instances of concepts and relations as
defined by the ontology. The process of defining and instantiating a knowledge
base is referred to as knowledge markup or ontology population, whereas
(semi-)automatic support in ontology development is usually referred to as
ontology learning.

Ontologies have been broadly used in knowledge management applications,
including Semantic Web applications and research. In recent years, ontologies
have regained interest also within the NLP community, specifically in such
applications as information extraction, text mining and question answering.
However, as ontology development is a tedious and costly process there has been
an equally growing interest in the automatic learning of ontologies. Much of
this work has been focused on textual data as human language is a primary mode
of knowledge transfer. In this way, textual data provide both a resource for the
ontology learning process as well as an application medium for developed ontologies.

Automatic methods for text-based ontology learning and population have developed
over recent years, but it is difficult to compare approaches and results. In the
1st Workshop on Ontology Learning and Population (at ECAI 2004, Spain) we
addressed this issue through an emphasis on the evaluation aspects of the
reported work. In the context of the 2nd workshop we intend to continue this
emphasis by providing a common data set for participants to work with,
consisting of an ontology and document collection in the football (soccer)
domain and a corresponding automatically extracted knowledge base. Participants
will be free to use this or other data, but are encouraged to use the common
data set for their experiments in order to better compare results with other
participants. Please notify the organizers your interest in this.

    An additional topic we intend to address at this workshop is the
    relation between NLP and ontology development, the communities of
    which are working on similar topics but using different
    terminology. As this leads to a confound communication, the
    potential for interdisciplinary work becomes much less
    pronounced. We therefore intend the workshop to contribute to an
    enhanced interdisciplinary understanding of tasks, methods and
    evaluations.

Areas of Interest

To provide a clear focus we request novel work on:

- Concept formation on the basis of text
- Learning concept hierarchies / non-taxonomic relations / rules /
- axioms from text
- Named-Entity Recognition with respect to an ontology
- Ontology-based information extraction
- Ontology learning for IE, IR, MT, QA
- Gold standard and task-based evaluation of ontology learning,
- e.g. in IE, IR, MT, QA

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

We are pleased to announce the First Newcastle Postgraduate Conference in
Theoretical and Applied Linguistics in association with the University of
Durham, sponsored by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The conference
will take place on Friday 23rd June at the University of Newcastle.

The success of the Durham Postgraduate Linguistics Conference over the past
decade, and the recent amalgamation of Durham's linguistics department with
Newcastle University's School of English, has led to the creation of a new
conference based in Newcastle. This one-day conference is designed to give
linguistics postgraduates an opportunity to present and discuss their research
in an informal and intellectually stimulating setting.

Professor Bernard Comrie (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology)
will be giving a guest lecture at this year's conference on 'Language and Genes'.

We invite postgraduate students to submit abstracts for oral and poster
presentations on ANY area of linguistics, theoretical or applied. This is a
great opportunity for postgraduates to present and get constructive feedback on
either work in progress or completed research.

Full abstract submission guidelines are available at
pglinguistics2006.ncl.ac.uk. Please read the guidelines carefully before
submitting your abstract. Abstracts should be sent to pgconfling@ncl.ac.uk with
the subject line: ''Abstract Submission''. Email submissions only, please
(Microsoft Word/PDF format only).

Accepted abstracts will be allotted 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes
for discussion. There will be two poster sessions on the day of the conference,
but posters will be on display all day. Speakers will also be invited to submit
their paper for publication in the Newcastle & Durham Working Papers in Linguistics.

More information can be found at the conference website:
pglinguistics2006.ncl.ac.uk. If you have any queries, please email:
pgconfling@ncl.ac.uk.

Workshop Description and Motivation

Eighth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology

The workshop will be devoted to all areas of computation, as applied to
contemporary phonology and morphology. Papers will be on substantial, original,
and unpublished research on any aspect of computational phonology and
computational morphology.

Preference will be given to high-quality papers which address the role of
computational morphology and phonology in NLP.  In particular, we looking for
work which shows how (or if) morphology and phonology are useful in larger
problems such as machine translation, speech recognition, OCR, or sentence-level
parsing.

Other topics include, but are not limited to, those listed below, focusing on
recent developments since our last meeting at ACL (Barcelona) in 2004.

* Speech technologies relating to phonology
* Unsupervised learning of phonotactics, morphology, and phonology
* Stochastic or probabilistic phonology
* Computational evolutionary modeling of phonological systems
* Language-independent learning algorithms relating to computational phonology
* Finite-state formalizations of phonology
* Computational morphology and morphological modeling
* Speech generation
* Assistive learning tools for second language speakers

One of the missions of SIGPHON is to encourage interaction between work in
computational linguistics and work in theoretical phonology, in the hope that
both fields profit from the interaction.  In addition, SIGPHON continues to
promote work in computational morphology, seeking to fill in for the absence of
an analogous SIGMORPH group.  Our recent meetings have been successful in both
regards, and we hope to see this continue in 2006.  Many mainstream phonologists
are employing computational tools and models that are of considerable interest
to computational linguists more generally, and our intention is that this
workshop should be a forum to bring this work to the attention of a wider range
of computational linguists.

This workshop will be the eighth meeting of SIGPHON, the ACL Special Interest
Group in Computational Phonology. We will hold a full-day workshop consisting of
approximately 12 half-hour presentations plus an invited speaker.

The principal goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in the area
of computational phonology. Computational phonology is an important and
recognized subfield of computational linguistics, but has received little
attention at recent ACL meetings. We expect the workshop to facilitate
interactions among computational phonologists who are attending ACL, and to
attract more attendance by computational phonologists.

The workshop will be held on June 8, immediately after the HLT-NAACL 2006
meetings in New York City.
