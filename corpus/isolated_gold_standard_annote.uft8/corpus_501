EMCL 3: Developing an experiment: from conception to implementation
Date: October 17-18 , 2006
Place: University of Murcia (Spain)

(To precede the conference of the Spanish Cognitive Lingusitics Association
(AELCO-SCOLA) as a satellite event)

  The last few years have yielded promising experimental evidence for an
embodied view of language. The work of researchers such as Bergen,
Boroditsky, Matlock, Santiago, and Richardson, among others, has provided
glimpses of the intricate cross-buttressing between language and other
cognitive processes. In order for the promise of these finding to come to
fruition, many more researchers will have to join the ranks of the field's
leaders. The interdisciplinary training required to advance Experimental
Cognitive Linguistics remains, unfortunately, scarce at most universities.
As such, the focus for 'EMCL III' will be 'Developing an experiment: from
conception to implementation.' The goal will be to gather gifted cognitive
linguists lacking experimental training, with experienced researchers who
will guide them in the development and implementation of an experiment.

EMCL 3: Developing an experiment: from conception to implementation

-Deadline extended to: <deadline>July 15</deadline> -

The last few years have yielded promising experimental evidence for an
embodied view of language. The work of researchers such as Bergen,
Boroditsky, Matlock, Santiago, Majid, and Feist, among others, has provided
glimpses of the intricate cross-buttressing between language and other
cognitive processes. In order for the promise of these findings to come to
fruition, many more researchers will have to join the ranks of the field's
leaders. The interdisciplinary training required to advance Experimental
Cognitive Linguistics remains, unfortunately, scarce at most universities.
This makes the transition from one way of looking at language to another
often overwhelming and intimidating. Most beginners never get started
because they don't know who to ask for help, how to begin, what questions
to ask, what to read. As such, the focus for 'EMCL III' will be 'Developing
an experiment: from conception to implementation.' The goal will be to
unite gifted cognitive linguists lacking experimental training, with
experienced researchers who will guide them in the development and
implementation of an experiment. The workshop will also serve to introduce
new researchers to the community of active experimentalists, to whom they
will be able to look to for guidance long after the workshop is over.

Audience:

This workshop is aimed specifically at scholars with sound theoretical
knowledge in their field though lacking in experimental training.
Participants are not expected to have any background at all in
experimentation. Candidates should at least have completed initial
university training in theoretical linguistics, or a similar program and be
familiar with cognitive linguistics (this familiarity need not have
occurred in a formal university setting.) Graduate students (post-grads,
pre-doctoral, etc.), as well as post-doctoral researchers and junior
faculty are also invited to apply. The only real prerequisite is a
background in cognitive linguistics, and no experimental background.

Format: See website for details.

Topics:
-Deciding on a research topic
-Transforming the research topic into a research question
-Developing experimental hypotheses and designing an experiment
-Data collection
-Statistical analysis and interpretation
-Presentation of findings to an audience

Cost: 120 Euros

Student grants possible. Details TBA.

Accommodation: TBA

Application:

To apply, please send the following by July 15, 2006. All materials must be
submitted electronically to Monica Gonzalez-Marquez at
mg246@cornell.edu. Accepted applicants will be notified by August 1, 2006.

1. A maximum of two (2) pages, (1000 words), describing
- your background and reasons for wanting to participate
- the researcher you would like to work with and why
- a description of at least one research question you want to
explore. This need not be a detailed research plan. All you need to do is
tell us about what you would like to work on so that the researcher you
will work with can be better prepared. 

2. C.V.

3. One letter of recommendation from someone who can evaluate your
potential. Have this person submit the letter directly to mg246@cornell.edu

Faculty:

Benjamin Bergen (University of Manoa at Hawaii)
Asifa Majid (Max Planck Institute, Nijmegen, Holland)
Julio Santiago (University of Barcelona)
Michelle Feist (University of Louisiana at Lafayette)

Call Deadline: <deadline>15-Sep-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The Ph. D. Colloquium on Diversity is intended to be a forum for scientific meetings and exchanges between doctoral students and researchers from both sides of the Atlantic.  Its main purpose is two-fold: on the one hand, to encourage exchanges between Québec-based researchers and those in France on topics related to language and communication in French and other international languages and on the other hand, to allow researchers to present an overview of their work in progress and to showcase the types of projects undertaken in their respective universities.

The Colloquium Committee will identify those doctoral candidates who will be invited to present their on-going work during the Ph. D. Colloquium on Diversity.  The Colloquium will focus more specifically on research in bilingual and multilingual communication. Presentations will be limited to one half-hour each followed by a discussion with the Colloquium Committee. 

Ph.D. Colloquium on Diversity: Languages, Translation
and Communication in the French-Speaking World
 
Every year, dozens of doctoral students defend their theses in languages, translation and communications in both France and Québec.  Under the influence of globalization and the widespread use of the Internet, issues of linguistic and cultural diversity have given rise to research studies on both sides of the Atlantic.  Many of these studies carried out in either English or French have focused on the information society, its social impact and its political and cultural challenges. 
 
Most unfortunately, there are few opportunities for doctoral students and researchers, each working in his/her own corner of the ''global village'', to meet and exchange views.  Consequently, people tend all too often to work in isolation whether in France or Québec. 
 
The Ph. D. Colloquium on Diversity is intended to be a forum for scientific meetings and exchanges between doctoral students and researchers from both sides of the Atlantic.  Its main purpose is two-fold: on the one hand, to encourage exchanges between Québec-based researchers and those in France on topics related to language and communication in French and other international languages and on the other hand, to allow researchers to present an overview of their work in progress and to showcase the types of projects undertaken in their respective universities.
 
The Colloquium Committee will identify those doctoral candidates who will be invited to present their on-going work during the Ph. D. Colloquium on Diversity.  The Colloquium will focus more specifically on research in bilingual and multilingual communication. Presentations will be limited to one half-hour each followed by a discussion with the Colloquium Committee. 
 
The Committee will be comprised of specialists in multilingual communication from Québec-based and French institutions including among others: McGill University, l'Université du Québec, l'Université Lumière-Lyon 2 and l'Université de Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle; academics from these universities will sit on the Committee.  The overall impact will serve to bring some research projects more into focus, to allow researchers to go into greater depth in their work and to identify areas of overlap and areas of possible future cooperation between Québec-based and French institutions.

Call for papers:

If you are interested in presenting your research project to the Ph. D. Colloquium on Diversity, please send in your proposal before <deadline>15 September 2006</deadline>.  Acceptance letters will be sent out by 27 October 2006 at the latest.

In the case of each paper, presenters will have thirty minutes speaking time followed by ten minutes for questions and answers.  Papers may be presented in either English or French.

Date and place:

5 and 6 December 2006, McGill University, MONTREAL (Québec), Canada
