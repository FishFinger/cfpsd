Meeting Description:

Interest in the topic of stem allomorphy has been renewed by Mark Aronoff's
(1994) work on Latin conjugation, which, by highlighting the theoretical
importance of ancient observations, led to novel descriptions of inflection=
al
and derivational phenomena in work by Boy=E9 & colleagues, Brown, Maiden, P=
irelli
& Battista, Sadler, Spencer & Zaretskaya, Stump, Thornton, and others. Cent=
ral
to Aronoff's work and later developments is the notion that the signifiant =
of a
lexeme is not a single phonological representation, but an array of indexed
stems, which may stand in relations going from identity through (semi)-regu=
lar
phonological alternation to full suppletion. This shared structure accounts=
 for
the observation that regular and irregular inflection give rise to the same
paradigm shapes.=20

Call for Papers

Despite a period of 15 years of fruitful work, many conceptual, theoretical=
, and
empirical issues of stem allomorphy remain unsolved. The aim of this worksh=
op is
to showcase work that addresses any of these issues, including:

- What heuristics or principles can be used to distinguish stem alternants =
from
exponents? Should the peripherality of formatives be used as a criterion? S=
hould
stem size be maximized or minimized?
- How morphomic is stem allomorphy? Stem alternations are best motivated wh=
en
the different stems do not correspond to a morphosyntactically coherent set=
 of
paradigm cells. Yet suppletion, another typical motivation for the postulat=
ion
of distinct stems, typically affects coherent sets of cells (Veselinova 200=
6).
- What is the relationship between stem allomorphy and implicative morpholo=
gy?
Morphomic stems, by their nature, can only be related by implicational
relations. But if implicational relations sometimes need to be stated betwe=
en
words (e.g. Blevins 2006), could we perhaps dispense with stems altogether =
as an
analytical tool?
- What is the relationship between stem allomorphy and inflectional regular=
ity?
Tradition and naive functional motivation would suggest that a regular lexe=
me
should have a single stem; this view has been challenged both from the poin=
t of
view of synchronic description (Boy=E9 2000 and subsequent work) and from t=
he
point of view of language change (Maiden 1992 and subsequent work).
- What is the role of stem allomorphy in lexeme formation? Can the analysis=
 of
derived lexemes reveal the existence of stems that are invisible in inflect=
ion
('hidden stems')? How is the emergence of allomorphic stems influenced by t=
he
global structure of the lexicon?

Abstracts must be strictly anonymous and no more than 2 pages long (bibliog=
raphy

eir
name(s), affiliation(s) and the e-mail address at which they wish to be
contacted. Abstracts should be sent by e-mail in PDF (preferably) or RTF fo=
rmat
to: decembrettes@univ-tlse2.fr.
