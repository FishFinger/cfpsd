Meeting Description:

Founded in 1980, the Spanish in the US Conference brings together researchers from various disciplines - such as linguistics, sociology, anthropology, education, and legal studies - investigating a wide range of topics related to Spanish and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. Since 1991, the Spanish in the US Conference has been held in conjunction with the Spanish in Contact with Other Languages Conference, allowing productive connections between researchers focusing on the US context and researchers investigating the entire Spanish-speaking world.  In recent years, interest and participation have increased dramatically, thanks to both the growing public and scholarly recognition of Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. 

Plenary speakers
Carol Klee, University of Minnesota
Luis Moll, University of Arizona
Rachel Moran, University of California-Berkeley
Alejandro Portes, Princeton University

Roundtables

Papers may be given in Spanish or English, with papers in Spanish especially encouraged. Papers will be 20 minutes long followed by a 10 minute question period. Authors may submit a total of two abstracts, one individual and one joint. The publication of a volume of selected papers is planned.
