The 13th International Conference on HPSG will take place in Varna on
July 24 -27, 2006, hosted by the Linguistic Modelling Laboratory, IPP,
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
The conference will include a tutorial day (July 24):
    Semantics within and beyond HPSG: LRS and LTAG
        (Frank Richter and Laura Kallmeyer)
    Construction-Based Grammar
        (Ivan Sag)
    HPSG meets Categorial Grammar
        (Carl Pollard)
    Implementation: Recent developments in LKB and TRALE
        (Berthold Crysmann and Gerald Penn)
and a workshop on "Regularity and Irregularity in Grammar and Language"
(July 25).

 Main Conference
July 26 - 27

Abstracts are solicited for 20 minute presentations (followed by 10
minutes of discussion) which address linguistic, foundational, or
computational issues relating to the framework of Head-Driven Phrase
Structure Grammar.

 Invited Speakers

Workshop:
Frank van Eynde (Leuven)

Main conference:
Stefan Mueller (Bremen)
Shravan Vasishth (Potsdam)

 Workshop

"Regularity and Irregularity in Grammar and Language"
(announcement)
July 25

The workshops associated with HPSG conferences typically address topics
that are relevant to any grammatical framework. Contributions to the
workshop from other frameworks are as welcome as abstract submissions
from the HPSG community!

The relationship between regularity and irregularity in language has
always been a central research theme in linguistic theorizing.
Contemporary grammatical frameworks in the generative tradition are no
exception in this regard, with research dating back at least as far as
George Lakoff's 1967 dissertation.

Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar is particularly well-suited to
address such issues, due to its lexicalist orientation and to its
extensive use of types and inheritance hierarchies.  Consequently,
HPSG researchers have made significant contributions to the study of
regularity and irregularity in the areas of morphology, syntax and
semantics.  To name only a few examples:

Morphology and morphology-syntax interface: Flickinger's dissertation
on lexical rules and the structure of the lexicon (Flickinger 1987);
Nerbonne and Krieger's work on the organization of the lexicon and on
inflectional morphology (Nerbonne and Krieger 1993); Riehemann's
corpus-based study of derivational morphology (Riehemann 1998);
Malouf's constructional approach to English gerunds.

Syntax and syntax-semantics interface: Przepiorkowski's account of
case assigmnment in Polish (Przepiorkowski 1999); Sag's papers on
assignment rules and exceptions in the English auxiliary system (Sag 2001);
Ginzburg and Sag's constructional approach to the syntax and semantics
of questions (Ginzburg and Sag 2001).

Semantics: research on licensing of special elements, including idioms
(Riehemann 2001, Soehn 2006), n-words and negative polarity items
(Przepiorkowski and Kupsc 1999; Sailer/Richter 1999; De Swart and Sag
2002).

We invite contributions that address issues related to the above
research topics, that discuss theoretical issues in the treatment of
regularity and irregularity in language, or that present empirical
studies that pose interesting challenges to existing accounts.

The format of submission and the deadlines for the workshop will be
identical to that of the main conference.

 Submission Details

For both the main conference and the workshop, we invite online
submissions of abstracts for presentations which should consist of two
parts:

  1. a separate information page in plain text format, containing
      - author name(s)
      - affiliation(s)
      - e-mail and postal address(es)
      - title of paper

  2. an extended abstract of not more than 5 (five) pages, including all
figures and references. Abstracts should be in PDF format.

We use an online subscription system. All abstracts should be
submitted via http://www.easychair.org/HPSG2006
(If you have any questions: jp.soehn@uni-tuebingen.de).

Abstracts for the main conference should mention 'HPSG-06' and
abstracts for the workshop should mention 'Workshop-06' in the
subject line. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by at least
two reviewers. Authors are asked to avoid self-references in the
abstracts.

 Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: <deadline>March 15, 2006</deadline>
Notification of acceptance: May 15, 2005
Tutorial, Workshop, and Conference: July 24 - 27, 2006

 Publication

The proceedings of the conference will be published on-line by CSLI
publications. A call for papers for contributions will be issued after
the conference. On-line proceedings of previous conferences are
