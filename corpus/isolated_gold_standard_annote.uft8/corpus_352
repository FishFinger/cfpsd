19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 
(ESSLLI 2007)
Dublin, Ireland
06-Aug-2007 - 17-Aug-2007

CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
                 
The ESSLLI 2007 Program Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 19th
annual Summer School on a wide range of timely topics that have
demonstrated their relevance in the following fields:
   - Logic and Language  
   - Logic and Computation
   - Language and Computation    

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals should be submitted through a web form
available at http://www.folli.org/submission.php

All proposals should be submitted no later than 
 
                ******* Thursday <deadline>June 15, 2006</deadline>. *******

Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision by
October 2006.  Proposers should follow the guidelines below while
preparing their submissions; proposals that deviate can not be
considered.

GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION: Anyone interested in lecturing or
organizing a workshop during ESSLLI-2007, please read the following
information carefully.

ALL COURSES: Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers. They
consist of five sessions (a one-week course), each session lasting 90
minutes.  Lecturers who want to offer a long, two-week course should
structure it as two independent one week courses (ideally, with an
introductory part in the first week of ESSLLI, and a more advanced part
during the second).  The ESSLLI program committee has the right to
select only one of the two proposed courses.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submission:
   <deadline>Jun 15, 2006</deadline>: Proposal Submission Deadline
   Sep 15, 2006: Notification
   <deadline>Jun  1, 2007</deadline>: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course 
                 material (by ESSLLI Local Organizers) 

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are strictly elementary courses not
assuming any background knowledge.  They are intended for people to
get acquainted with the problems and techniques of areas new to them.
Ideally, they should allow researchers from other fields to acquire
the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus encouraging the
development of a truly interdisciplinary research community.
Foundational courses may presuppose some experience with scientific
methods in general, so as to be able to concentrate on the issues that
are germane to the area of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the
activities of the Summer School.  They are intended to equip students
and young researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic
methods and techniques.  Introductory courses in, for instance,
Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component
fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational linguistics
should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of
linguistics and computation.  Proposals for introductory courses should
indicate the level of the course as compared to standard texts in the
area (if available).

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students.  Proposals for advanced courses
should specify the prerequisites in detail.

WORKSHOPS: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced
Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their
work.  Workshops should have a well defined theme, and workshop
organizers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop. It is a
strict requirement that organizers give a general introduction during the first
session of the workshop.  They are also responsible for the organization and
program of the workshop including inviting the submission of papers, reviewing,
expenses of invited speakers, etc. Each workshop organizer will be responsible
for producing the 1st Call for Papers in December, 2006.  The call must make it
clear that the workshop is open to all members of the LLI community.  It should
also note that all workshop contributors must register for the Summer School.

TIMETABLE for Workshop Proposal Submissions
   <deadline>Jun 15, 2006</deadline>: Proposal Submission Deadline
   Sep 15, 2006: Notification
   <deadline>Nov 15, 2005</deadline>: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers 
                 (by ESSLLI PC chair)
   Dec  1, 2006: Workshop organizers send out (First) Call for Papers
   <deadline>Feb 15, 2007</deadline>: Deadline for Papers (suggested)
   May  1, 2007: Notification of Workshop Contributors (suggested)
   <deadline>Jun  1, 2007</deadline>: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of Workshop
                 Proceedings (by ESSLLI Local Organizers) 

Notice that workshop speakers will be required to register for the
Summer School; however, they will be able to register at a reduced
rate to be determined by the Local Organizers.

FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: The web-based form for submitting course and
workshop proposals will be accessible at
http://www.folli.org/submission.php.  You will be required to submit
the following information:

   * Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer)

   * Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organizer;
     where possible, please include phone and fax numbers)

   * Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

   * Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory
     course, or an advanced course?)

   * Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation,
     Language & Logic or Logic & Computation? name only one)

   * Description (in at most 150 words, describe the proposed contents and
     substantiate timeliness and relevance to ESSLLI)

   * External funding (will you be able to find external funding to
     help fund your travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

   * Further particulars (any further information that is required by
     the above guidelines should be included here; in particular, indicate 
     here your teaching experience in an interdisciplinary field as the 
     one addressed by ESSLLI.)

FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organizers
should be aware that all teaching and organizing at the summer schools
is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as
low as possible. Lecturers and organizers are not paid for their
contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation (up to a
fixed, maximum amount that will be notified to lecturers when courses
are accepted).  It should be stressed that while proposals from all
over the world are welcomed, the Summer School cannot guarantee full
reimbursement of travel costs, especially from destinations outside
Europe.

Please note the following: In case a course is to be taught by two
lecturers, a lump sum is reimbursed to cover travel and accommodation
expenses for one lecturer. The splitting of the sum is up to the
lecturers.

The local organizers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organizers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses, and such issues might be taken 
into account when selecting courses.
