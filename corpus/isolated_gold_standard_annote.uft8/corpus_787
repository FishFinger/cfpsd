been
the focal point for three postgraduate conferences in Cardiff 2004, Twicken=
ham

The 2010 FLaRN conference will be a full conference which addresses
postgraduates and professionals alike. We invite professional and student
academic researchers working on topics associated with formulaic language s=
uch

k and

on/
learning/teaching, language disorders, etc).
