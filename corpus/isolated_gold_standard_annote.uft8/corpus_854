Meeting Description:

It is a fact that the law pervades many aspects of our lives and the use an=
d
function of its language constitute the essentials on which the precepts of=
 law
itself are established. The interconnection between law and language provid=
es a
continuous source of analytical insights for researchers working in a varie=
ty of
disciplines. It also gives us an opportunity to refine our current understa=
nding
of language and law from an interdisciplinary perspective.=20

As part of its commitment to research in the field of language and law, the
Faculty of Law of the Seconda Universit=E0 degli Studi di Napoli (Universit=

age
of Law - pulling together different strands and disciplines, to be held in =
