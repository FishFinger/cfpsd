Call for Papers: Workshop on Computational Modeling of Lexical 
Acquisition - The Split Meeting -

http://www.ohz.unist.hr/cpala/

Time: 25.-28. July 2005
Location: University of Split, Croatia

Abstract submission deadline: <deadline>March 15th 2005</deadline>

The Croatian Language Technologies Society (CLTS) and the University of 
Split are pleased to sponsor the inaugural meeting of the Workshop on 
Computational Linguistics held in Split, Croatia, focusing on the topic 
of "Computational Modeling of Lexical Acquisition". We will build on 
the topics in formal-theoretical and computational linguistics, in 
particular on issues in learnability, complexity and modeling of 
lexical knowledge.

This workshop is especially intended to provide a forum for the 
presentation of unique and original research on computational 
linguistic topics in the domain of learning of lexical properties, i.e. 
lexical acquisition, including but not limited to the following topics:

a. machine learning methods for lexical acquisition
- speech and language segmentation into lexical units
- induction and learning of phonological and morphological structure
- inducing formal grammars from discovered structural properties
- learning lexical semantic properties and lexical disambiguation
- computational models of psycholinguistic aspects of lexical 
acquisition

b. corpora, evaluation and applications
- induction of part-of-speech information for tagging and automatic 
annotation (via e.g. clustering and classification, using Vector Space 
Modeling or other strategies)
- corpora for learning phonological and morphological regularities and 
a common gold standard
- applications using machine learning and automatic lexical acquisition 
(e.g. tagger, ontologies, textmining)
- evaluation strategies and methods for learning approaches

This workshop will expand into a fixed annual event organized by the 
Croatian Language Technologies Society (CLTS) to be hosted, in turn, 
and shared among all interested and committed Croatian Universities.
