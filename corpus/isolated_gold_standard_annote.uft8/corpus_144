Vocabularies, ontologies and rules are key components of a model-driven =
approach to enterprise computing in a networked economy. VORTE is the =
first of what=20
we hope will be many workshops that bring together researchers and =
practitioners in areas such as philosophical ontology, enterprise =
modeling, information=20
systems, semantic web, MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) and business =
rules to discuss the role of foundational and lightweight ontologies in =
the development=20
of conceptual tools for enterprise computing.=20
=20
The Workshop Encourages Submissions on topics including=20
(but not limited to) the following:=20

* Business Vocabularies
* Business Rules
* Enterprise Integration and Interoperability
* Ontological Foundations for Conceptual Modeling and Metamodeling
* Vocabularies and Foundational Ontologies for Enterprise Information =
