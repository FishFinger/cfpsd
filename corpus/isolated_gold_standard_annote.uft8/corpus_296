</div>
<p><strong>Background and Goals</strong><br>
The Places &amp; Spaces:
Mapping Science exhibit was created to inspire cross-disciplinary
discussion on how to best track and communicate human activity and
scientific progress on a global scale. It has two components: physical
exhibits enable the close inspection of high quality reproductions of
maps for display at conferences and education centers; the online
counterpart (<a href="http://scimaps.org/">http://scimaps.org</a>)
provides links to a selected series of maps and their makers along with
detailed explanations of how these maps work. </p>
<p>Places &amp; Spaces is a 10-year effort. Each year, 10 new maps are
added, which will result in 100 maps total in 2014. Each iteration of
the exhibit attempts to learn from the best examples of visualization
design in existence. To accomplish this goal, each iteration compares
and contrasts four existing maps with six new maps of science. Themes
for the different iterations/years are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>1st Iteration (2005): The Power of Maps</li>
  <li>2nd Iteration (2006): The Power of Reference Systems<br>
  </li>
  <li>3rd Iteration (2007): The Power of Forecasts<br>
  </li>
  <li>4th Iteration (2008): Science Maps for Economic Decision Makers<br>
  </li>
  <li>5th Iteration (2009): Science Maps for Science Policy Makers</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>6th Iteration (2010): Science Maps for Scholars</li>
  <li>7th Iteration (2011): Science Maps as Visual Interfaces to
Digital Libraries<br>
  </li>
  <li>8th Iteration (2012): Science Maps for Kids<br>
  </li>
  <li>9th Iteration (2013): Science Maps for Daily Science Forecasts<br>
  </li>
  <li>10th Iteration (2014): Telling Lies With Science Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Places &amp; Spaces was first shown at the Annual Meeting of the
Association of American Geographers in April 2005. Since then, the
physical exhibit has been displayed at more than 175 venues in over 15
countries, including eleven in Europe, plus Japan, China, Brazil,
Canada, and the United States. A schedule of all display locations can
be found at <a href="http://scimaps.org/flat/exhibitions/">http://scimaps.org/flat/exhibitions/</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Submission Details</strong><br>
The 6th iteration of the Mapping Science exhibit is devoted to science
maps that address the needs of scholars. Among others, scholars are
researchers, authors, editors, reviewers, teachers, inventors,
investigators, team leaders, and science administrators. To fulfill
these roles, scholars benefit from a deeper understanding of and more
global perspective on science. As science becomes more
interdisciplinary and international, scholars must become
sciencetrotters as well as globetrotters, crossing existing
boundaries with ease. They must be fluent in multiple science languages
and cultures to harvest the best data resources, theory, tools, and
expertise independent of their origin. Maps of science can guide
scholars in knowledge access and management activities as well as their
evaluation of certifiable novelty and impact. </p>
<p>We
invite maps that show a visual rendering of a dataset together with a
legend, textual description, and acknowledgements as required to
interpret the map. Science map dimensions can be abstract,
geographical, or feature-based, but are typically richer than simple x,
y plots. Scientific knowledge can be used to generate a reference
system over which other data, e.g., funding opportunities or job
openings, are overlaid or be projected onto another reference system,
e.g., a map of the world, but must be prominently featured. See <strong><a
 href="http://scimaps.org/static/docs/all-maps.pdf">http://scimaps.org/static/docs/all-maps.pdf</a></strong>
for an overview of all 50 existing maps.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Each <b>initial entry</b> must be submitted by <deadline>Jan 9th, 2010</deadline> and
needs to
include: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Low resolution version of map</li>
  <li>Title of work</li>
  <li>Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address</li>
  <li>Copyright holder (if different from authors)</li>
  <li>Description
of work: Science policy maker needs addressed, data used, data
analysis, visualization techniques applied, and main insights gained
(100-300 words)</li>
  <li>References to publications in which the map appeared</li>
  <li>Links to related projects/works</li>
</ul>
<p>Entries should be submitted via email to the curators of the
exhibit: Katy Börner (<a href="mailto:katy@indiana.edu">katy@indiana.edu</a>)
and Elisha F. Hardy (<a href="mailto:efhardy@indiana.edu">efhardy@indiana.edu</a>)
using the email subject header Mapping Science Entry.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Review Process</strong><br>
All submissions will be reviewed by the exhibit advisory board and
invited scholars from academia, industry, and government. Submissions
will be judged in terms of </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><em><strong>Scientific value</strong></em>
 quality of data collection, analysis, result communication.
Appropriate (innovative?) application of existing algorithms and/or
development of new approaches.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Value for scholars</strong></em>
 what major insight does the map provide and why does it matter?  Is
the map easy to understand by scholars and the exhibit audience?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Submission</strong><br>
Authors of winning entries will be contacted end of January and invited
to submit<b> final entries</b> by <deadline>March 31st, 2010</deadline>. Each final entry
comprises: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Title of Work </li>
  <li>Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address </li>
  <li>24 x 30 inch, 300 dpi, landscape version of map </li>
  <li>Official map description (200 words) </li>
  <li>Biographies and photos of all authors (100 words each) </li>
  <li>Signed copyright and reproduction agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>Map
makers are welcome to use the expertise and resources of the exhibit
curators when designing their final maps. The layout and production of
the 6th iteration maps are expected to be ready for display by April
30th, 2010.</p>
