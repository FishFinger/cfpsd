Call for Papers

Deadline: <deadline>15 December 2009</deadline>

We invite papers or posters for a two-day symposium which will focus on
corpus-based work in the field of Translation Studies. Areas of interest in=
clude:
- The relationship between non-translated texts and translated texts in one=
 language
- The relationship between source texts and target texts
- Innovative methods and techniques for collecting and analyzing data in
Translation Studies

Plenary Speakers
- Silvia Bernardini (University of Bologna at Forl=EC)
- Andrew Chesterman (University of Helsinki)
- J=F6rg Tiedemann (Uppsala University)

Background
The introduction of a corpus-based methodology in the field of Translation
Studies (Baker 1993) gave rise to a large number of empirical studies that
investigate the fundamental characteristics of  translated texts and their
relationship to their source texts and non-translated texts. These studies =
have
yielded interesting insights into the nature of translated language and the
translation process, such as the so-called translation universals, the ideo=
logy
of translation and stylistic differences between translators.

Nevertheless, important methodological and conceptual challenges lie ahead.=
 Some
languages, for instance, are less well-studied within corpus-based Translat=
ion
Studies. Obviously, in order to empirically verify general hypotheses about
translation products and processes, as many languages as possible have to b=
e
studied.

In addition, some general hypotheses, like the explicitation hypothesis, ne=
ed
conceptual refinement: to what extent, for instance, is explicitation at
syntactic level identical to explicitation at discursive level? Most
importantly, how can general hypotheses be put to the test or, in other wor=
ds,
how do we 'translate? (operationalise) hypotheses so that they are empirica=
lly
testable in a corpus?=20

The two-day symposium therefore wants to encourage corpus-based work on
translations in less well-studied languages as well as corpus-based work
that pushes methodological and conceptual frontiers in Translation Studies.
Possible questions / hypotheses include (but are not limited to)
untranslatability or implicitation, deictic shifts in translation, informat=
ion
structure asymmetries between source and target texts, register differences
within translated language.
