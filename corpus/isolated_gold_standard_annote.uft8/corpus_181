        Second Call For Papers

        International Workshop on


    MULTIMODAL CORPORA:
    FROM MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOUR THEORIES
    TO USABLE MODELS


        Saturday 27 May 2006
        Full day workshop

        ** Submission deadline: postponed to <deadline>12th February</deadline> **

        http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mmc06/

**********************************************

In Association with LREC2006 (the 5th International Conference on 
Language Resources and Evaluation)
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2006/
Main Conference 24-25-26 May 2006
Magazzini del Cotone Conference Center
Genoa - Italy

-------------------------
MOTIVATIONS
-------------------------

'Multimodal Corpora' target the recording and annotation of several 
communication modalities
such as speech, hand gesture, facial expression, body posture, etc.
Theoretical issues are also addressed, given their importance to the 
design of multimodal corpora.

This workshop follows similar events held at LREC'2000, LREC'2002 and 
LREC'2004.
There is an increasing interest in multimodal communication and 
multimodal corpora
as visible by recently launched European Networks of Excellence
and integrated projects such as HUMAINE, SIMILAR, CHIL and AMI,
and similar efforts in the USA and in Asia.
Furthermore, the success of recent conferences dedicated to multimodal
communication (ICMI'2005, IVA'2005, Interacting Bodies'2005,
Nordic Symposium on Multimodal Communication 2005) also testifies the 
growing interest in this area,
and the general need for data on multimodal behaviours.

The focus of this LREC'2006 workshop on multimodal corpora will be on 
non-verbal communication studies
and their contribution to the definition of collection protocols, coding 
schemes,
inter-coder agreement measures and reliable models of multimodal 
behaviour that can be built
from corpora and compared to results that can be found in the literature.

Topics to be addressed in the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Studies of multimodal behaviour
- Multimodal interaction in groups and meetings
- Building models of behaviour from multiple sources of knowledge : 
manual annotation, image processing, motion capture, literature studies
- Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal video corpora
- Validation of multimodal annotations
- Exploitation of multimodal corpora in different types of applications 
(information extraction, information retrieval, meeting transcription, 
multi-modal interfaces, translation, summarisation, www services, 
communication and clinical studies, HCI design)
- Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition, creation, 
management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and multimodal 
corpora
- Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora
- Benchmarking of systems and products; use of multimodal corpora for 
the evaluation of real systems
- Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated 
speech, gaze, gesture, facial expressions)

We expect the output of this one day workshop to be:
1) a deeper understanding of the theoretical issues and research questions
related to verbal and non-verbal communication that multimodal corpora 
should address,
2) how such corpora should be built in order to provide useful and 
usable answers
to research questions,
and 3) an updated view of state-of-the-art research on multimodal corpora.

SUBMISSIONS
---------------
The workshop will consist primarily of paper presentations and 
discussion/working sessions.
Submissions should be 4 pages long, must be in English, and follow the
submission guidelines at
http://www.chi2006.org/docs/chi2006pubsformat.doc

The preferred format is MS word.
The .doc file should be submitted via email to LREC-MM@LIMSI.FR

Demonstrations of multimodal corpora and related tools are encouraged as
well (a demonstration outline of 2 pages can be submitted).

As soon as possible, authors are encouraged to send to LREC-MM@LIMSI.FR
a brief email indicating their intention to participate, including their
contact information and the topic they intend to address in their 
submissions.
Submitted papers will be blind reviewed,
i.e., they must not contain explicit hints at the authors and
the files may not consist of names or affiliations etc.

Proceedings of the workshop will be printed by the LREC Local Organising 
Committee.
