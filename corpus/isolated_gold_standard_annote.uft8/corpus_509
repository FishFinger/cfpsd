of new technologies for intercultural communication.  Demonstration proposals
should be no more than four pages in length. They should clearly describe the
motivation for the tool and how it will be demonstrated at the workshop.

the workshop.  Poster proposals should be no more than four pages in length and
summarize the poster content.  Poster descriptions will not be archival;

communication.
