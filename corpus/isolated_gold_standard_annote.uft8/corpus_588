E-Cohesion: Multimodality and Interactivity in CMC

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) has unquestionably grown into one of the most appealing innovative and challenging fields of research across the humanities. From a linguistic point of view, CMC research not only raises new questions about new topics but also offers a fresh look at established views on old topics held, inter alia, in discourse analysis and pragmatics. Prominent among them is cohesion, a key concept in any kind of text or discourse related analysis, which, however, defies easy explanation even in traditional types of communication, because it appears to rely strongly on the particular mode used: speech or writing or, indeed, CMC.  

Regular users of the Web and, in particular, CMC recipients are familiar with the problems of scanning the screen for signs and signals that help to relate textual and audio-visual nodes to each other (and thus, with the cognitively demanding process of coherence creation). While we are accustomed to the linguistic, non-linguistic and cognitive ways of establishing cohesion in non-electronic spoken or written communication, newcomers to the Web have to learn what (other) means and strategies are used in CMC to relate current items or nodes to preceding or prospective other items or nodes. Thus, it seems safe to argue that cohesion in electronic, digital and computer mediated communication, i.e. electronic cohesion (e-cohesion), is (at least partly) different from cohesion in non-electronic, analogue, non-computer mediated spoken or written communication.

The key differences between e-cohesion and traditional concepts of cohesion are an immediate consequence of the constitutive features of CMC, viz. interactivity, multimodality, fragmentation, multilinearity and incompleteness. Central to e-cohesion are the two concepts of multimodality and interactivity, which delineate electronic (digital) 'text' composition. Both involve fragmentary text clustering and multilinear ways of reading, which often induces some kind of incompleteness. 

Interactivity is a scalar feature, which appears in various degrees in different types of CMC. While it is reduced to a minimum in asynchronous e-documents, it is much more pronounced in synchronous CMC (e.g. in chatroom communication), where the user can obviously choose from a much wider range of options to participate in the production, alignment and negotiation of content. Between these two extremes, there are intermediary types of interactivity, among them purely physical acts (in which the user connects self-contained 'text' units by, e.g., simply clicking hyperlinks) and purely cognitive acts (in which the user relates textual and audio-visual 'text' units to each other across the screen). Such connections may be indicated by e-cohesive means across different modes, which points to the second key feature of e-cohesion, its multimodality. 

Multimodality in CMC is likewise a scalar feature, reaching from mono-modality (e.g. in text-only CMC) to multi-modality, which may comprise textual, visual and audio modes. In our panel we aim to explore the cohesive effects caused by the interplay of various modes of presentation. For example, the reiteration of pictorial elements can support semantic connectivity proposed by the verbal structures in the text. 

Both interactivity and multimodality are based on the fragmentary assemblage of different text clusters. In hypertexts, for example, textual units are interactively aligned across different nodes (internodal), while multimodality is mirrored in the fragmentary combination of text units within one and the same node (intranodal). Fragmentation in chats is of a somewhat different kind. Here, comments are broken down into smaller bits of incomplete information, which have to be linked up by users with the help of e-cohesive means (such as types of address, backchannels, turn-taking signals, cross-turn references). These CMC invoked features simultaneously enhance and restrict both the production and reception of CMC. They also account for its hybrid status as a new type of 'text' which exhibits various degrees of orality and literacy, thus bridging the gap between print and face-to-face communication (cf. Herring 1996, 2005, Storrer 2000). To capture the hybrid character and the!
  diverse ways of presenting information (text, picture, video, sound etc), interdisciplinary approaches are called for to ensure a wide semiotic focus. 

To conclude, with e-cohesion we refer to the specific item-connecting means that reflect the interactive, multimodal and fragmentation related properties of electronic media. While this panel will focus on cohesion, coherence in CMC (which, after all, is dependent on or, indeed, decisive for cohesion) shall not totally be neglected

Panel presenters are encouraged to discuss the various means of e-cohesion and the complex ways in which it depends on and reflects interactivity, multimodality, fragmentation and related phenomena. Explorations of different types of CMC, i.e. of e-cohesion in hypertexts, SMS and MMS, weblogs and vlogs, chats and forum communication, etc., are also conceivable.

Call Deadline: <deadline>08-Sep-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general. This series of workshops 
aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working 
in these areas. 

Treebanks and Linguistic Theories 2006
5th International Workshop

Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

http://www.tlt2006.org

3rd [Final] Call for Papers 

This the final call for paper submission to the Treebanks and Linguistic Theories '06 conference. We remind you there is about two weeks remaining to polish and send off your submission!

The Guidelines for paper submission are available at http://www.tlt2006.org, link ''Instructions for Authors'' (or directly at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tlt2006/auth.html). The deadline for submitting your papers is <deadline>Sept. 8, 2006</deadline>, as previously announced.

Workshop motivation and aims:

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for languages that already have them (English). In addition, there are projects that go beyond syntactic analysis to include different kinds of semantic and pragmatic annotation. We specifically encourage submissions that discuss the relations and links between, and possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and contents/pragma!
 tic annotation; also, submissions describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation schemas, theories and applications are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank,etc.). Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of co-located events surrounding it (for more information see www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol, Bulgaria in September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003 (http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen, Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/). 
Topics of interest:

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development;
