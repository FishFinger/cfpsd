1st Call For Papers

Multimodal Corpora for Modelling Human Multimodal Behavior

Special issue of the International Journal of Language Resources and Evaluation

Deadline for paper submission : <deadline>15th November 2006</deadline>

This special issue is concerned with behavioral models built from Multimodal Corpora.
'Multimodal Corpora' target the recording and annotation of several communication modalities such as speech, hand gesture, facial expression, body posture, etc.

There is an increasing interest in multimodal communication and multimodal corpora as visible by recently launched European Networks of Excellence and integrated projects such as HUMAINE, SIMILAR, CHIL and AMI, and similar efforts in the USA and in Asia.

Furthermore, the success of recent conferences related to multimodal communication (ICMI'2005, IVA'2005, Interacting Bodies'2005, Nordic Symposium on Multimodal Communication 2005) as well as a series of dedicated workshops at LREC' 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006 also testifies the growing interest in this area, and the general need for data on multimodal behaviours.

The focus of this special issue is on multimodal corpora and their use for representing and modelling human behaviors.
This include non-verbal communication studies and their contribution to the definition of collection protocols, coding schemes, and reliable models of multimodal human behaviour that can be built from corpora and compared to results that can be found in
the literature.

Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:
- Studies of multimodal behaviour
- Multimodal interaction in groups and meetings
- Building models of behaviour from multiple sources of knowledge: manual annotation, image processing, motion capture, literature studies
- Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal video corpora
- Validation of multimodal annotations
- Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal video corpora
- Validation of multimodal annotations
- Exploitation of multimodal corpora in different types of applications (meeting transcription, Embodied Conversational Agent,
multi-modal interfaces, communication and clinical studies, edutainment)
- Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition, creation, management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and multimodal corpora
- Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora
- Benchmarking of systems and products; use of multimodal corpora for the evaluation of real systems
- Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated speech, gaze, gesture, facial expressions)

The submitted papers might adress human-computer interaction if it concerns human modalities(e.g. 3D conversational gestures rathers than 2D pen based interaction).
