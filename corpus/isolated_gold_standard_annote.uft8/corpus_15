===========================================
                SECOND
    CALL FOR PAPERS for the Workshop

    NLP for Under-Resourced Languages

          Friday, 10 June 2005

         in Dourdan, near Paris
============================================

Held in conjunction with the conference
TALN 2005 (6-10 June 2005)
http://www.limsi.fr/TALN05

Many languages have little or no information technology available: they have no substantial
presence on the Internet, and existing software has not been adapted for their use.  These
are languages of countries in the developing world (e.g. Wolof in Senegal), or
regional languages in countries where the first language is a global one (e.g. Breton in France).

Linguistic work on these languages is often lacking, and
must overcome a number of difficulties:
- the presence of many lexical alternatives
- multiple spellings for the same word,
- the lack of exhaustive lexicons,
- non-standardized transcription methods
- etc.

This is why we describe these languages as "under-resourced" or
"pi-languages": for political and economic reasons they lack
sufficient resources in terms of both linguistic study and
information
technology.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a progress report  on
techniques being used for Natural Language Processing of under-resourced languages.

THEMES

Researchers are invited to present work  related to any of the
following topics:

- Methods for measuring the level of technology available for a
  given language
- Assessment of resources for basic computerization, and standardization
  of these resources (editors, virtual keyboards, printing, sorting, etc.)
- Collection of corpora and other linguistic resources (lexicons,
  grammars); the role of the Internet, diasporas, unsupervised
  training algorithms
- Methodologies for computerization of under-resourced languages
  (details of techniques)
- Specific technologies (OCR, PDA)
- Encoding of linguistic data (lexicons, morphology, syntax, and
  semantics) and genericity of formats.
- Reports concerning the computerization of a particular language or
  group of pi-languages.
- Architectures for NLP technologies : adaptation of existing
  technologies to pi-languages.
- Surveys of major problems encountered in this area.

SELECTION CRITERIA
------------------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers concerning original  research. All submissions will be
examined by at least two specialists in the area. Particular attention will be paid to:

- appropriateness for the themes of the workshop
- importance and originality of the contribution
- validity of the technical and scientific content
- critical discussion of the results, in particular as they
  relate to other work in the field
- organization and clarity of the presentation

The selected articles will be published in the conference
proceedings.

METHODS OF SUBMISSION
------------------------------
* Submitted articles may not exceed 10 pages in Times 12,
  single-spaced (about 3000 words), figures, examples, and
