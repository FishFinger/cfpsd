 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
                   Uppsala, Sweden, July 11-16, 2010
                     http://acl2010.org/papers.html

        * * * Paper Submission Deadline: <deadline>February 15, 2010</deadline> * * *

The Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(ACL) is the flagship conference for research on language and
computation. The 48th Annual Meeting of the ACL (ACL 2010) seeks
submission of papers on original and unpublished research in all areas
of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include areas such
as psycholinguistics, speech, information retrieval, multimodal
language processing, and language issues in emerging domains such as
bioinformatics. In addition, we want to stress that both theoretical,
as well as practical and empirical papers, are sought for the
conference.

ACL 2010 has the goal of a broad technical program. Thus, ACL 2010
invites papers in the following categories:
   Research papers =

     - theoretical computational linguistics
     - empirical/data-driven approaches
     - paradigms/techniques/strategies
     - resources and evaluation
     - applications/systems
     - negative result (report of a sensible experiment or approach
                        that failed to achieve the desired results)
   Survey papers (new emerging area, field relevant to computational
                  linguistics, etc.)
   Position papers (we are particularly soliciting papers co-authored
                    by two individuals with opposing positions, though
                    single-authored papers are welcome)
   Challenge papers (a challenge to the field in terms of setting out
                     a goal for the next 5/10/20 years)

The above categories include types of papers that have not typically
been part of the ACL conference program. Since the appropriate
criteria for evaluating papers is not identical for the above
categories (and subcategories), ACL 2010 will use a different review
form for each category of paper, with the review form tailored to the
type of submission. For example, the review criteria for an
applications/systems research paper will include whether a substantive
evaluation or user experiments are reported and whether a demo will be
available at the conference, whereas the review form for a theoretical
computational linguistics research paper will include a different set
of review criteria. The review forms will shortly be available on the
conference web site. At the time of submission, authors will be asked
to designate the category under which they believe that their paper
should be evaluated. However, the program committee chairs reserve the
right to change the selected category if they feel that the submission
falls into a different category of paper.

If you are unsure about whether your submission is appropriate for ACL
2010 please email the program chairs at program@acl2010.org.

LONG VERSUS SHORT PAPERS:
The submission deadlines for long and for short papers are identical.
Long papers are appropriate for:
1) reporting substantial, completed, and previously unpublished research;
2) presenting a survey of a subfield that would be of interest to =

   computational linguists;
3) a two-author position paper in which the co-authors take
   opposing positions.
Short papers typically constitute more focused contributions. Thus =

they are appropriate for:
1) reporting smaller experiments;
2) describing work-in-progress;
3) single-author position papers; =

4) challenge papers;
5) descriptions of new language resources or evaluation methodologies
   (although these could be long papers);
6) presenting negative results.

Long papers will be allocated 8 pages of content in the
conference proceedings, and short papers will be allocated 4 pages
of content. Both long and short papers may have any number of
pages consisting solely of references. Long papers will generally be
presented as 20-minute talks plus questions (although authors will be
given the option of instead selecting a poster presentation or a
10-minute oral presentation followed by a poster); short papers will
be presented either as a poster or as a 10-minute talk followed by a
poster session. There will be no distinction in the conference
proceedings between papers that are assigned different presentation
modes (such as oral versus poster).

SUBMISSIONS:
The deadline for both long and short papers is 11:59pm (Pacific =

Standard Time) <deadline>February 15, 2010</deadline>.  Submission will be electronic =

in PDF format through the conference website.

Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content (excluding
references), and short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content
(excluding references). Both long and short papers may include any
additional number of pages consisting solely of references. Both long
and short paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL
2010 proceedings. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style
files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for this year's
conference, which will be available on the conference website. All
submissions must conform to the official ACL 2010 style guidelines to
be announced on the conference website.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must
not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do
not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

MULTIPLE SUBMISSION POLICY: =

The same paper cannot be submitted to ACL 2010 in both long and short
format --- that is, short paper submissions must not be shortened
versions of submitted long papers that present the same work.  ACL
2010 will not accept for publication or presentation work that will be
(or has been) published at other meetings or in other
publications. However, papers that have been or will be submitted
elsewhere may be submitted to ACL 2010 provided that this fact is
stated at the time of submission. If the paper is accepted by both ACL
2010 and another meeting or publication, it must be withdrawn from one
of them; furthermore, its authors must notify the program chairs,
within two days of receiving the ACL acceptance notification,
indicating which meeting or publication they choose for presentation
of their work.

MENTORING SERVICE: ACL is providing a mentoring (coaching) service for
authors from regions of the world where English is less emphasized as
a language of scientific exchange. Many authors from these regions,
although able to read the scientific literature in English, have
little or no experience in writing papers in English for conferences
such as the ACL meetings. If you would like to take advantage of the
service, please upload your paper in PDF format by January 1, 2010
using the paper submission software for the mentoring service which
will be available at the conference website.  Questions about the
mentoring service should be referred to mentoring@acl2010.org
