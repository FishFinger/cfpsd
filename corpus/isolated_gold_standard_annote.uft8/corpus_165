Meeting Description:

The fifth international conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2006, is organised by ELRA in cooperation with a wide range of international associations and organisations. 

CALL FOR PAPERS

SECOND WORKSHOP ON THE REPRESENTATION AND PROCESSING OF SIGN LANGUAGES
Lexicographic matters and didactic scenarios. 

Workshop on the occasion of the 5th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC2006).

Date: - May 2006 (to be announced by LREC organisers)
Location: Genoa, Italy
	  Magazzini del Cotone Conference Center

Linguistic sub-fields: General Linguistics, Applied Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Corpus Linguistics, Lexicography, Language Didactics

Meeting background

On the occasion of LREC2004, the first workshop on the Representation and Processing of Sign Languages was held with good attendance. A great variety of topics and approaches was discussed, but since this field is considerably younger than the processing of spoken and written languages, a vast number of important questions still remain to be answered.

The workshop will centre on the crucial question of representing a sign language electronically and, in this perspective, it will serve to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in sign language research, thus stimulating the exchange of information and resources. In particular, we would like to pay specific attention to the lexicographic treatment of sign languages, thus hinting at the problem of collecting sign language corpora and of describing sign languages through a (new?) metalinguistic code that really suits them.
Besides the lexicographic questions, we would also like to discuss possible interactive didactic scenarios (i.e. e-learning modules) that will promote sign language learning on the one hand, and support deaf people in their learning path on the other. The discussion will possibly cover topics which act at the boundary of these two research fields such as the question of the articulation between the different layers of a sign language (lexical, textual etc.) and the related question of how to conceive didactic tools to illustrate and teach this articulation.

Meeting Description:

CoNLL-X is the tenth annual conference of ACL's Special Interest Group on
Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL). 

CoNLL-X
The Tenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning
New York City, June 8-9, 2006

First Call for Papers

CoNLL is the yearly conference organized by SIGNLL (the ACL Special
Interest Group on Natural Language Learning). Previous CoNLL meetings
were held in Madrid (1997), Sydney (1998), Bergen (1999), Lisbon
(2000), Toulouse (2001), Taipei (2002), Edmonton (2003), Boston
(2004), and Ann Arbor (2005). This year, CoNLL will be collocated with
HLT-NAACL in New York City.

See http://staff.science.uva.nl/~erikt/signll/ and 
http://staff.science.uva.nl/~erikt/signll/conll/ for more 
information about SIGNLL and CoNLL. The official Web of CoNLL-X 
can be found at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll/

CoNLL is an international conference for research on natural language
learning. We invite submission of papers about natural language
learning topics, including, but not limited to:

 - Computational models of human language acquisition
 - Computational models of the evolution of language  
 - Machine learning methods applied to natural language 
   processing tasks (speech processing, phonology, morphology, 
   syntax, semantics, discourse processing, language 
   engineering applications)
 - Statistical methods (Bayesian learning, graphical models, 
   kernel methods, statistical models for structured problems)
 - Symbolic learning methods (rule induction and decision
   tree learning, lazy learning, inductive logic programming, 
   analytical learning, transformation-based error-driven learning)
 - Biologically-inspired methods (Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computing)
 - Reinforcement learning
 - Active learning, ensemble methods, meta-learning
 - Learning architectures for structural and relational NLP tasks
 - Computational learning theory analysis of language learning
 - Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods
 - Models of induction and analogy in linguistics 


Special Topic of Interest

Apart from the topics listed above, this year we wish to encourage the
submission of papers that propose learning theories, architectures,
algorithms, methods, or techniques for improving the robustness of
learning-based NLP systems.

One important type of brittleness in current learning-based NLP
systems is domain dependence. Since learning is mainly performed in a
supervised setting, even slight differences between training corpora
and test corpora (text genre, style, new vocabulary, etc.) may cause
substantial degradation in the performance of a system. This fact has
been widely reported in the NLP literature and also was clearly
observed in the CoNLL-2005 shared task evaluation on Semantic Role
Labeling.

In this direction, we encourage the submission of papers addressing
the portability and adaptation of learning-based systems to changing
application domains. Transfer learning, domain adaptation,
bootstrapping, semi-supervised learning, active learning, etc. are
some keywords that might apply here.

Moreover, the traditional decomposition of natural language processing
into a pipeline of specialized linguistic analyzers can also make
end-to-end systems fragile. The assumption that each level can be
satisfactory resolved before advancing to the following processor is
clearly false given the current state-of-the-art for most
tasks. Experience suggests that error propagation through cascades of
processors may in aggregate severely degrade performance on the final
task. One obvious and appealing solution (but also more complex) is to
try to jointly model several subtasks at the same time, both at the
learning and inference stages. This can allow systems to capture
correlations between stages, searching for global solutions, rather
than greedily maximizing local quality. However, practical constraints
argue that some decomposition is necessary for efficient learning and
inference. Thus, papers addressing the issues involved in processing
across multiple linguistic layers will be also welcome.

Shared Task: Multilingual Dependency Parsing

The shared task of CoNLL-X will be multi-lingual grammatical relation
finding (dependency parsing). Following previous CoNLL shared tasks
(NP bracketing, chunking, clause identification, language independent
named-entity recognition, and semantic role labeling), this task aims
to define and extend the current state of the art in dependency
parsing - a technology which complements the previous tasks by
producing a different kind of syntactic description of input text.

Ideally, a parser should be trainable for any language, possibly by
adjusting a small number of hyperparameters. The CoNLL-X shared task
will provide the community with a benchmark for evaluating their
parsers across different languages. Because of the variety of
languages and the interest in parser performance across languages, the
focus of the CoNLL-X shared task will be on qualitative evaluation
(along with the quantitative scores as before). We will require the
participants to provide an informative error analysis and will
ourselves perform a cross-system comparison. This, we expect, will
result in a clear picture of the problems that lie ahead for
multilingual parsing and the kind of work necessary for adapting
existing parsing architectures across languages.

A detailed description of the shared task and further information
regarding scheduling, datasets, paper submission, etc. are available
from http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll/st.html

Invited Speakers
(to be announced)


Main Session Submissions

A paper submitted to CoNLL-X must describe original, unpublished
work. Submit a full paper of no more than 8 pages in PDF format by
<deadline>March 5 2006</deadline>, electronically through the web form at:
http://www.softconf.com/start/CoNLL06/submit.html

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. The submitted paper
should be in two column format and follow the HLT-NAACL style (see
http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/hlt-naacl06/cfp.html). Authors who cannot submit
a PDF file electronically should contact the program co-chairs.

Since reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the
authors' names and affiliations, and there should be no
self-references that reveal the authors' identity. In the submission
form, you will be asked for the following information: paper title,
authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses, contact author's
email address, a list of keywords, abstract, and an indication of
whether the paper has been simultaneously submitted to other
conferences (and if so which conferences). The contact author of an
accepted paper under multiple submissions should inform the program
co-chairs immediately whether he or she intends the accepted paper to
appear in CoNLL-X. A paper that appears in CoNLL-X must be withdrawn
from other conferences.

Authors of accepted submissions are to produce a final paper to be
published in the proceedings of the conference, which will be
available at the conference for participants, and distributed
afterwards by ACL. Final papers must follow the HLT-NAACL style and
are due <deadline>April 21, 2006</deadline>.

Meeting Description:

Aims 

The Information Technology Enabled Services - ITES - Industry is the fastest growing user of English language training in the world. The two major destinations for outsourced processing and call centres are India and the Philippines, with China becoming ever more important. It is thus timely to hold the inaugural ITES English Skills Conference in Manila. 

This conference will bring together ITES industry practitioners in outsourcing destinations in Asia with international English language teachers and applied linguistic academics and researchers. At this conference we hope to generate new ideas, cross disciplinary boundaries, and share research and practice about English language in all areas of the ITES industry. It will be a unique opportunity for academics and business to share experience and learn from each other. 

Specifically, this conference will address the following language issues which are critical for ensuring appropriate English language skills in non-English speaking countries.

How do we make English language training relevant for companies and participants in the call centre and ITES industries? 

What is the value of English language communication for a company? 
How do we measure English language skill levels accurately for recruitment and training needs? 

What are the issues in developing Quality scorecards that reflect quality targets, communication needs and training agendas? 

What is an industry language audit? 

What are the current best practices in English language communication, assessment and training, and trainer education for the ITES Industry? 

Papers from academics and industry practitioners will cover the following sectors: 

Call centre operations and communication 
ITES English Curriculum 
ITES English Assessment 
Trainer/coach education and support 
Applied linguistics 
Discourse analysis

Meeting Description:

The Department of Classics of the University of Groningen is pleased to announce the organization of the 6th International Colloquium on Ancient Greek Linguistics, which will take place from the 27th - 29th of June 2007. This colloquium aims to continue the trend set by other editions in the series that began in Amsterdam 1986 and whose last edition till now took place in Madrid in 2003. 

CONFERENCE TOPIC: (Phenomena of) Discourse Cohesion in Ancient Greek.
The term 'phenomena of discourse cohesion' may be taken in a broad sense, so as to range from the use of, for instance, particles, the article or the demonstrative pronoun to word order phenomena, to the use of tense and aspect or to ring compositions or other argumentative structures. 

The organizing committee invites all Greek linguists (both senior and junior researchers) to submit an abstract on any aspect related to this topic. 

ABSTRACT GUIDELINES
The abstract should contain at least the following items: a clearly defined and well-motivated research question; the crucial example(s) illustrating the relevance of the research question; and the (supposed) main conclusions the paper arrives at. Abstracts should have a length of approximately 350-400 words, i.e. roughly 1 page. References to the literature cited should be given.

PRESENTATION	
As compared with the previous edition, the character of this colloquium will be slightly altered. We expect the speakers to submit a written paper in advance. All papers will be sent to the participants a month before the colloquium, so that all participants can read them. At the colloquium, after a short introduction (about 10 min.) the paper will be open for discussion (about 20 minutes, including one reaction prepared in advance by one of the other participants). Conference languages will be English, French and German.


ABSTRACT SUBMISSION DEADLINE: <deadline>May 15, 2006</deadline>

NOTIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE: June 15,  2006	

ADDRESS FOR SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS: g.c.wakker@rug.nl


We will request funding from our university and other public and private institutions in the hope that we will be able to finance at least (part of ) board and lodging, and, if possible, also (part of the) travel expenses of those participants who present a paper.

Meeting Description:

The E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data) Project is a five-year project funded by the National Science Foundation with a dual objective: to aid in the preservation of endangered languages data and documentation and to aid in the development of the infrastructure necessary for effective collaboration among electronic archives. As part of the effort to promote consensus on best practices in digital language documentation, E-MELD is hosting its 2006 workshop from June 20-22, 2006 in East Lansing, Michigan. The E-MELD workshop will be held just before the 2006 LSA Summer Meeting. 

The 2006 E-MELD (Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data, http://emeld.org) workshop on digital language documentation, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, is entitled 'Tools and Standards--the State of the Art.'  

This annual E-MELD workshop marks the culmination of the 5-year E-MELD project; thus one goal of the workshop is to review digital standards ratified by the community in prior workshops (on text, lexicons, databases, and annotation).   However, the focus of the workshop is broader than a single project.  We invite community participation in assessing existing digital support for language documentation, in identifying gaps and prioritizing needs, and in planning for continued development of both tools and standards.  We extend a special invitation to two groups:  (a) developers of tools, archiving standards, and workflow procedures, and (b) documentary linguists with ideas for enhanced digital tools and standards.  The workshop will include a demonstration session where new tools, corpora, and Internet facilities can be introduced.

Prior E-MELD workshops have focused on schemas and metaschemas for text and lexicons, selecting and using linguistic databases, and developing a common vocabulary for linguistic annotation.  Tools demonstrated in past workshops have included software for transcription and annotation, lexicon creation, search (including corpus and metadata search), and database applications.  In the upcoming workshop we will take a retrospective look at the progress made thus far, at the same time as we attempt to identify promising new tools and directions in digital language archiving.  The workshop will consist of invited papers, general sessions, and working group sessions in which the workshop participants will provide input on various technical and non-technical topics (to be announced).

If you would like to present a 20 minute paper or to participate in the demonstration session, please send an abstract in Word, pdf, or plain text format to the organizing committee.

ADDRESS FOR SUBMISSIONS: workshop@linguistlist.org
LENGTH: 500 words maximum.
DEADLINE: <deadline>Mar 26, 2006</deadline>.

Authors whose presentations are selected will be required to submit the full text of the paper by <deadline>May 7, 2006</deadline>, so that it can be published on the workshop website prior to the workshop itself.  Developers whose tools are selected for the demo session will be asked to submit a descriptive handout by <deadline>May 15</deadline> in a format suitable for display on the conference website.

2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

The use of language in academic contexts is a rapidly growing research field.
The aim of the present PhD workshop is to bring together PhD candidates working
on different aspects of academic discourse in order to provide a forum for
discussing theoretical issues as well as methodological approaches to research
on academic discourse. The workshop will precede the international symposium on
academic discourse which is organized by the KIAP project
(http://kiap.aksis.uib.no) and which will take place on May 4-6.  Attending the
workshop is thus not only an opportunity to discuss with other PhD candidates
working in the same field, but also a great opportunity to hear some of the
field's most distinguished scholars present their ideas and research in this
area. Please visit the following website for more information about the
work-shop and the symposium: 

http://www.kongress.no/index_eget.php3?knapp=vel_eng_on&mytable=kongresser&myid=32&myrow=velkommen

We welcome abstracts on all aspects of academic discourse. Relevant issues
include for example:
- different theoretical and methodological approaches to academic discourse
- differences and similarities in academic discourse practices and traditions
across languages and disciplines
- rhetorical devices and argumentative structure in academic texts
- close analyses of textual features or lexemes frequently used in academic texts

Abstracts
Abstracts should be written in English and should not exceed 300 words. Send the
abstract as an attachment to eva.vold@roman.uib.no no later than January 1,

Abstract:

Functional Dimensions of Ape-Human Discourse asks the question 'what do
interactions between apes and humans mediated by language tell us?'.  In
order to answer this question the authors explore language-in-context,
drawing on a multi-leveled, multi-functional linguistics. The levels are
context of culture, context of situation, semantics, lexicogrammar, and
phonology; and the functions are ideational, interpersonal, and textual.

Chapter 1 discusses a negotiation between the bonobo Kanzi and Sue
Savage-Rumbaugh in terms of discourse-semantics, lexicogrammar, and the
ideational and interpersonal metafunctions of language.  Chapter 2
reinterprets Sue Savage-Rumbaugh et. al. Language Comprehension in Ape and
Child (1993) in terms of the ideational metafunction, and provides
corroborative evidence for Kanzi's symbolic processing abilities, opening a
window into the consciousness of at least one non-human primate. Chapter 3
compares three snapshots from comprehensive studies based on large amounts
of data (monkey calls, language development in a human child, and a
dialogue between Kanzi's sibling Panbanisha and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh) from
an evolutionary perspective, showing different ways in which the level of
grammar comes to be wedged in between semantics and expression.  Chapter 4
articulates a methodology incorporating public domain software for the
comprehensive analysis of ape-human interaction. Although bonobo-human
interaction is used as an example, the methodology could be utilized for
studies of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.

One award of £500 is available for the MRes in Speech, Language and Cognition
administered by the UCL Department of Phonetics and Linguistics on behalf of the
Centre for Human Communication.

The interdisciplinary MRes in Speech, Language and Cognition is aimed at
applicants whose interest in language spans more than one discipline. Building
on a first degree in linguistics, speech sciences, psychology, cognitive
science, or a cognate discipline, students plan their own course of study (with
the guidance of an advisor), selecting from a range of courses in several
different UCL departments. The degree is a stand-alone 12-month Masters, but is
also excellent preparation for PhD research in a language-related field of study.

Application Procedure: 
Applicants should write indicating their intention to compete for the bursary to

3-year PhD Scholarship in Computer Science (Focus: Text Mining)

The University of Luxembourg, Faculty of Sciences, Technology and Communication,
is inviting applications for a 3-year PhD scholarship in Computer Science at the
Interdisciplinary Lab for Intelligent and Adaptive Systems (ILIAS). The PhD
project will focus on extracting meta-information from scientific articles
through text mining.

The monthly allowance is around 1500 Euro (taxfree). While the student is
expected to do his/her research mainly in Luxembourg, co-supervision and a
bi-institutional degree may be considered. The student can also profit from our
close links with other nearby research institutes, e.g. in Saarbruecken.

We are looking for highly engaged researchers with an above average MSc or
Diploma degree in computer science or computational linguistics. In particular,
the ideal candidate should have a strong background in

- language-oriented artificial intelligence/computational linguistics,
- machine learning/data mining, especially text mining,
- probabilistic and statistical techniques, and
- logic.

We also expect solid programming skills and a very good knowledge of English
(oral and written).

Applications should include an introduction letter indicating their motivation,
a detailed CV including copies of the BSc, MSc diploma and grade information, a
publication list, and the names and the coordinates of two referees. We strongly
prefer electronic submissions, which must have reached us until <deadline>December 18,
2005</deadline> (extended deadline).

More information can be obtained from Prof. Christoph Schommer.
