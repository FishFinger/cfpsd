********************************************************************

ICWS 2010 organizing committee invites you to participate in the eighth
edition of ICWS, to be held in Miami, FL, USA.

ICWS has been a prime international forum for both researchers and industry
practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of
the art and practice of Web services, identify emerging research topics, and
define the future of Web-based services. ICWS 2010 is sponsored by IEEE
Computer Society. It is the eighth year of gathering to formally explore
"Services" Science and Technology in the field of Services Computing, which
was formally promoted by IEEE Computer Society since 2003.

ICWS 2010 will be co-located with the 6th IEEE 2010 World Congress on
Services (SERVICES 2010), the 3rd IEEE 2010 International Conference on
Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2010), and the 7th IEEE 2010 International Conference
on Services Computing (SCC 2010) to grow itself to continute to be the most
prestigious professional conference dedicated to Web services.

The technical program of ICWS 2010 will include a refereed research track,
an application and industry track, a work-in-progress track, and a poster
track. The research track will highlight foundational work that strives to
push beyond the limits of existing Web services platforms and products,
including experimental efforts, innovative systems and investigations that
identify weaknesses in the existing Web services models.

The ICWS 2010 research track seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers
reporting substantive new work in various aspects of Web services. Research
papers must properly cite related work and clearly indicate their
contributions to the field of Web services. All topics relevant to Web
services are of interest, but the conference program committee particularly
encourages submissions related to the following aspects of Web services:

Foundations of Web Services

        * Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Evolutions
        * Models, methodologies, and tools (including analysis, design,
modeling, and composition)
        * Publishing, discovery, and selection (including in mobile
settings)
        * Validation and testing (including risk assessment and tracking)
        * Management and governance (including monitoring, QoS, privacy,
trust) 
        * Formal methods (including modeling and specification, data and
process semantics, type systems, security, QoS, and other properties)
        * Standards and implementation and deployment technologies
   
Web-based Services
        
        * Web 2.0 and Web X.0 concepts in Web services settings 
        * Software as a Service (SaaS)
        * Service As Software
        * Cloud Computing
        * Technologies for building and operating massive data centers
(including middleware)

Web Services Applications beyond Web

        * Applications (including mobile, scientific, Grid and utility,
autonomic, and embedded computing)
        * Business process management (including business protocols,
business intelligence, service level agreements, and business licensing
models)

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program
committee members. Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Extended versions of selected
papers published in the ICWS 2010 will be invited through a fast review
channel for potential publication in the IEEE Transactions on Services
Computing (TSC), International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR) and
the International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management
(IJBPIM). Both the ICWS Proceedings and JWSR are included in EI Compendex.
JWSR is also indexed in SCI-E.

Submitted manuscripts will be limited to 10 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages
and REQUIRED to be formatted using the IEEE Proceedings template.
Unformatted papers and papers beyond 10 pages will not be reviewed.
Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required.
Detailed instructions for electronic paper preparation and submission, panel
proposals, tutorial proposals, workshop proposals, and review process can be
found at http://conferences.computer.org/icws/2010/. At least one author of
each accepted paper is required to register to the conference and present
the paper. One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be
granted at ICWS 2010. The first author of the best student paper must be a
full-time student.
If your paper is application or solution oriented, you can consider
submitting it to ICWS 2010 Applications and Industry Track. Manuscripts
submitted to the Research Track focusing on application or solution
descriptions may be recommended to the Applications and Industry Track for
further consideration if the session slots are available. Submitted papers
with novel ideas but not accepted by the Research Track and Applications and
Industry Track may also be recommended for potential consideration by the
chairs of the Work-in-Progress Track and Poster Track of ICWS 2010, and
other tracks and workshops of SERVICES 2010.

ICWS Program Committee requires that authors adopt the keywords and index
terms in Services Computing "M" from the IEEE CS taxonomy
(computer.org/tsc).

Important Dates:
==============
Abstract Submission Deadline: <deadline>Feb. 15, 2010</deadline>
Paper Submission Due Date:  <deadline>Feb. 15, 2010</deadline>
Decision Notification (Electronic): April 15, 2010
Camera-Ready Copy Due Date & Pre-registration Due:  April 30, 2010 


Review Policy
=============
IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents
of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to
others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper
under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge that
access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program
committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same
manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere
to this practice.

Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum
for the oral presentations and discussions of all accepted papers. An
author, in offering a paper for presentation at an IEEE conference, or
accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the
meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the
time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the
program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute
arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for
the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission
of the final manuscript.
