contribution on naming will be considered.

The provisional deadline for paper proposals is <deadline>28 February 2010</deadline>. The proposal
should be in the form of an abstract of 200-300 words. Such proposals can be
forwarded to Bertie Neethling at the following e-mail address: bneethling@uwc.ac.za

Follow-up communication will be sent to all those who respond. Any early queries
around any aspect of the congress, e.g. travelling, accommodation, attractions
in the area and also in Cape Town, can be directed to Bertie Neethling at the
same e-mail address above. These queries will be responded to immediately.

We look forward to welcome you at the Congress and also in the Western Cape, an
exceptionally beautiful part of the world! 

Bertie Neethling
Vice-President (NSA) and Main Organiser (on behalf of NSA Executive)
