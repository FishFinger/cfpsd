Meeting Description:

ILLS2 (28-30 May 2010) is a student-run conference at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign.  The theme for this year's conference is Novel Technologies
and Methodologies in Linguistics Research. The purpose of this theme is to
inspire ideas and create enthusiasm for the ways in which we pursue research in
Linguistics. Talks will involve the creation of new tools for Linguistic
research, the novel use of old tools, experimental methods, studies of validity
or authenticity, and, otherwise, studies that cause reflection in Linguistic
research.

Talks from all subfields of Linguistics are welcome.

Invited Speakers:
Wayne Cowart (University of Southern Maine)
Bryan Gick (University of British Columbia)
Tania Ionin (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)
Richard Sproat (Oregon Health and Science University)
Tandy Warnow (University of Texas at Austin)

Conference Chairs:
Tim Mahrt (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)
Megan Osfar (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) 

Call for Papers

The online submission form can be found on the conference website:
http://ills.linguistics.illinois.edu/

ILLS welcomes the submission of general empirical and theoretical papers
relevant to the field of linguistics and the language sciences. Special
consideration will be given to applicants whose research fits within the
conference theme of Novel Technologies and Methodologies in Linguistics
Research. Relevant talks for this theme would involve at least one of the
following: the use of new tools for Linguistic research, the novel use of old
tools, experimental methods, studies of validity or authenticity, and,
otherwise, studies that cause reflection.

ILLS requests the submission of abstracts summarizing the main points of the
research paper, including hypotheses, methods, and conclusions.

ILLS also welcomes the submission of workshop proposals on advanced, emerging,
or domain-specific applications, particularly where there is little available
existing documentation. Where applicable, we invite those with a related paper
to consider submitting a workshop proposal--however, independent workshops are
just as welcome.

Suitable topics could involve technologies such as PRATT, eyetrackers, or EMA. 

Abstracts are to be submitted in PDF format, and should be no more than 500
words in length, including examples (encouraged) and in-text citations. Full
references are not necessary; please use the (Author, Year) format.

See the LSA model abstracts page for guidance in building an acceptable abstract.

You may submit at most: one single-author abstract and one multi-author
abstract, or two multi-author abstracts. Additionally you may submit one
workshop proposal. For abstracts co-authored with a faculty member, the student
should be the primary author and should have carried out the bulk of the
research and analysis. In addition, the student will be responsible for the
presentation of the paper at the conference.

Abstracts are to be uploaded through the conference interface on the Abstract
page (coming in November).
