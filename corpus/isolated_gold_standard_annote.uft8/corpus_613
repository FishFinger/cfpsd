******JEAP: Call for proposals******

Special Issue on 'Corpus-based EAP pedagogy'

The Journal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP) is now soliciting 
manuscript proposals (500 words) for a special issue entitled 
'Corpus-based EAP pedagogy'.

In 2000, the editors of the /English for Specific Purposes Journal/ 
(Volume 19, Issue 2) predicted that, 'although the successful use of 
corpora in classroom teaching of ESP work has been reported, it may well 
turn out that the most extensive and valuable use of computer-based 
corpora will be for ESP research purposes rather than for teaching 
purposes' (p. 98). The use of corpora in EAP research, as a source of 
texts for analysis, and of insights into language patterning in academic 
discourse certainly has grown steadily in the last two decades; in five 
issues of JEAP in 2005Ã¯Â¿Â½6, for example, forty percent of the articles 
reported research that was largely corpus-based. The use of corpora in 
EAP pedagogy, however, has increased at a slower rate, and it may well 
be that the prediction of the ESPJ editors will prove true. The purpose 
of this special issue of JEAP is to assess the development of 
corpus-informed and corpus-based approaches to EAP pedagogies, and to 
highlight both issues and practice in the exploitation of corpora, by 
teachers and students, in EAP contexts.

This issue will encompass a range of papers relating to the uses of 
language corpora in EAP teaching, research and materials development, 
with the emphasis on applications to pedagogy. Possible topics include, 
but are not limited to:
* the development of new resources for exploitation in EAP teaching, 
either in the form of data (corpora) or tools (query interfaces), at 
local, national or international levels;
* survey of corpus-based research and pedagogic practice in a variety of 
EAP contexts;
* the creation and investigation of small corpora by learners in EAP 
contexts;
* empirical research into the contribution of corpora in direct teaching;
* the uses of corpus findings in the development of EAP teaching materials.

Expected timeline for the special issue:

By <deadline>27 October, 2006</deadline>: Five hundred-word proposals for articles to be 
submitted by email to the guest editor Paul Thompson 
(p.a.thompson@reading.ac.uk)
1 December, 2006: Responses to prospective authors to be provided
<deadline>16 March, 2007</deadline>: Completed articles should be submitted to guest editor
18 May, 2007: Decisions for acceptance by guest editor to be determined
Final manuscript preparations/revisions to take place between mid-May 
and mid-June 2007

Submission guidelines are available from the Journal of English for 
Academic Purposes (JEAP) website: http://www.elsevier.com/locate/jeap

For additional information, please contact Paul Thompson 
(p.a.thompson@reading.ac.uk).
