Journal of Natural Language Engineering

SPECIAL ISSUE ON EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS

OBJECTIVE OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE
Educational applications that make use of natural language processing
methods are deployed for both large-scale assessment and classroom
instruction. These applications include automated scoring of essays and
short-answer responses, and qualitative feedback for essays --  evaluation
of grammar, usage, mechanics, style, and high-level discourse analysis. It
is critical that we continue to show progress not only with regard to the
amount of feedback that an application can provide, but also with regard to
the level of sophistication of the feedback. Additionally, there needs to be
meaningful links between the feedback related to students' writing quality
and the corresponding instruction. This special issue is devoted to advances
in capabilities that evaluate and provide feedback related student writing.
We are especially interested in submissions including, but not limited to:

*	Speech-based tools for educational technology
*	Innovative text analysis for evaluation of student writing with
regard to: a) general writing quality, or b) accuracy of content for
domain-specific responses
*	Text analysis methods to handle particular writing genres, such as
legal or business writing, or creative aspects of writing
*	Intelligent tutoring systems that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP
methods to evaluate response content, using either text- or speech-based
analyses
*	Dialogue systems in education
*	understanding student input
*	generating the tutors' feedback
*	evaluation
*	Evaluation of NLP-based tools for education
*	Use of student response databases (text or speech) for tool building
*	Content-based scoring

While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics, or related
issues, we particularly welcome submissions that describe deployed
applications. Further, since most of the deployed work in NLP-based
educational applications is text-based, we are especially interested in any
work of this type that incorporates speech processing and other input/output
modalities.  


SUBMISSION FORMAT

We are expecting full papers to describe original, previously unpublished
research, addressing issues related to the use of natural language
processing methods for the development of educational technology
applications.

Papers should be formatted according to the NLE journal instructions,
and should not exceed 15 pages. The preferred formatting system is
LaTeX, which can be used for direct typesetting, and a style file is
available through anonymous ftp from the following  address:
ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk/pub/texarchive/journals/latex/nle-sty/. In case of
difficulty there is a helpline available on e-mail:
texline@cup.cam.ac.uk.

Send your submission (a PostScript or PDF file), prepared for anonymous
review, to both: Jill Burstein, Educational Testing Service,
jburstein@ets.org <mailto:jburstein@ets.org>, and Claudia Leacock, Pearson
Knowledge Technologies, claudia.leacock@k-a-t.com

Paper submissions:		<deadline>May 1, 2005</deadline>
Notification of acceptance:	August 30, 2005
Final versions due:		<deadline>November 30, 2005</deadline>
Journal publication:		June 2006

ABOUT THE JOURNAL

Natural Language Engineering is an international journal designed to
meet the needs of professionals and researchers working in all areas of
computerized language processing, whether from the perspective of
theoretical or descriptive linguistics, lexicology, computer science or
engineering. Its principal aim is to bridge the gap between traditional
computational linguistics research and the implementation of practical
applications with potential real-world use. As well as publishing
research articles on a broad range of topics from text analysis, machine
translation and speech generation and synthesis to integrated systems and
multi modal interfaces the journal also publishes book reviews. Its aim is
to provide the essential link between industry and the academic community.  

Natural Language Engineering encourages papers reporting research with a
clear potential for practical application. Theoretical papers that
consider techniques in sufficient detail to provide for practical
implementation are also welcomed, as are shorter reports of on-going
research, conference  reports, comparative discussions of NLE products,
and policy-oriented papers examining e.g. funding programs or market
opportunities. All contributions are peer reviewed.
