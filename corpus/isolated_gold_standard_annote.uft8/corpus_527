Established late 2005, Arena Romanistica aims to be a refereed and

linguistic, literary and cultural studies.
We hereby invite people to submit papers to the first issue of Arena
Romanistica. The papers should reflect upon current research in the field
of corpus and text linguistics in Romance languages. 
The tools of corpus linguistics represent a growing field in linguistics.
Not only do they offer insights of the current state of the Romance
languages but also valuable methodological and theoretical advances for
linguistics in general. 
Papers should preferably be written in French although we will consider
Spanish and English submissions. 
Deadline for submission of papers:  <deadline>1st October 2006</deadline>.

Papers will be reviewed anonymously by a panel of peer reviewers and will
be accepted on the basis of their academic quality.
