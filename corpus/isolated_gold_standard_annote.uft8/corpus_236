divide.

in
developing and using machine translation technology and tools for translati=
on

There will be two categories of papers:
(R) Research papers: Submissions are invited for reports of significant
     research results in any aspect of machine translation and related area=
s.
     Such reports should include a substantial evaluation component.
(U) User studies: Submissions are invited for reports on users' experiences
  with using MT.
