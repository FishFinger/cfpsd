Ethnographic Perspectives on Writing Practices.


Dear colleagues,
 
We are proposing a panel for the 10th International Pragmatics Conference
(July 9-14, 2007, GÃ¯Â¿Â½teborg, Sweden), titled: ''Ethnographic Perspectives on
Writing Practices''. The panel will be chaired by Chaim Noy (Hebrew
University) and Brenda Danet (Hebrew University/Yale University), and will
focus on different types of inscriptions and writing, in a variety of
communicative media, including handwriting in museums' visitors' books and
keyboarding in a bilingual Internet interface, viewed through historical,
political-ideological, cultural, sociolinguistic, and social-psychological
prisms. We are seeking additional contributors to this panel on
''Ethnographic Perspectives on Writing Practices,'' broadly defined. A
paper with a historical focus would be a nice addition, since our own
contributions deal with contemporary material. If interested, kindly send
an email with a short description of relevant research and potential
contribution to the panel, to chaimnoy@mscc.huji.ac.il. Please note that
the deadline for panel proposals, <deadline>September 15</deadline>, is rapidly approaching.
