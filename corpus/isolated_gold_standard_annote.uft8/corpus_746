Meeting Description:

Utrecht University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are organising a two-day 
symposium on the pronunciation of English in the Netherlands. The symposium is
intended for all language users, including those in the corporate and public 
sectors, teachers, students and researchers.

The symposium will be held on 24-25 June 2010 at the Vrije Universiteit 
Amsterdam. The symposium is organised by Rias van den Doel (UU) and Laura Rupp
(VU). 

Call for Papers

All over the world, proficiency in spoken English is playing an increasingly 
important role. Within a European context, considerably more emphasis is now
being placed on effective pronunciation training - one example being the Common
European Framework (CEF) for Languages. Nevertheless, very little attention is
being paid to pronunciation training in the Netherlands, something which could
have an adverse effect on professional and international interaction in English. 

In the "Dutch Accents in English" symposium, all involved language users in the
Netherlands will be gathered together for the first time to explore the relevant
issues and propose realistic solutions. 

Keynote Speakers:
Beverley Collins and Inger Mees
Priorities for pronunciation training in the Netherlands
Leiden University Centre for Linguistics and Copenhagen Business School

Jo Kim
Pronunciation advice for companies and private individuals
BBC Pronunciation Unit

Pamela Rogerson-Revell
Research into Business English
University of Leicester

Contributions will be welcomed on any one of the following topics: 

1. What is the role of English pronunciation in the Netherlands, both in 
professional and international exchanges, in the media, and in education? 
2. Which English pronunciation models (American, British, Dutch, EIL) are 
relevant in a Dutch context? How can these various models be evaluated? 
3. What is the best way to conduct pronunciation training? What areas need to be
prioritised? 
4. Are there any groups of users with specific requirements and priorities? 

Contributions may be based either on research or on practical experience and may
be presented in English or in Dutch.

Each contribution will be allocated a 30-minute slot: a 20-minute presentation 
followed by a 10-minute Q&A session. Abstracts (max. 500 words) should be 
submitted to uiteng@uu.nl (using MS Word). Please attach two copies of your
abstract, one being an anonymous version and one stating the title of the
presentation, your name, affiliation, and email address. 

Registration will start on 24 May 2010. The conference fee will be 50 euros 
(including coffee and lunch).
