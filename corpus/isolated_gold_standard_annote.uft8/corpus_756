Meeting Description:

The 5th Workshop on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational 
Applications (co-located with NAACL-HLT 2010)

The Innovative Use of NLP in Educational Applications workshops have fostered
interaction and collaboration among researchers in intelligent tutoring systems
(ITS) using text and speech, scoring of free-response assessments and
proofreading tools. The 5th edition of this workshop (co-located with NAACL-HLT
2010)will continue to explore NLP technologies with the goal of identifying
novel use of NLP techniques and tools for the development of educational
applications. 

Call for Papers

Workshop Description 
 
NLP-based applications in educational environments continue to develop at a fast
pace. Initial work began as early as the 1960s on evaluating open-ended
assessments, text-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and proofreading
tools. These fields continue to progress using innovative NLP techniques
-statistical, rule-based, or some combination of the two. More recently, new
technologies have made it possible to include speech in both assessment and ITS.
From a somewhat different angle, NLP techniques are also being used to generate
assessments and tools for curriculum development as well as tools to support
assessment development. As a community we are improving existing capabilities,
and identifying and generating innovative ways to use NLP in applications for
writing, reading, speaking, critical thinking, and assessment development.

The need for, and the rapid development of, language-based capabilities have
been driven by increased requirements for state and national assessments, and a
growing population of foreign and second language learners. In the past ten
years, steady growth in the area of NLP-based applications for education has
prompted an increased number of workshops which typically focus on one specific
aspect of NLP-based educational applications. In this workshop, we solicit
papers from all subfields. 

The workshops on the Innovative Use of NLP in Building Educational Applications
have continued to bring together all these subfields to foster interaction and
collaboration among researchers in both academic institutions and industry.  

Last year's workshop (NAACL/HLT 2009) was a banner year with a record number of
submissions and attendees.  The 2010 workshop (consistent with previous
workshops at ACL 1997, NAACL/HLT 2003, ACL 2005, ACL 2008, and NAACL/HLT 2009)
will continue to expose the NLP research community to these technologies with
the hope that they will continue to identify novel opportunities for the use of
NLP techniques and tools in educational applications.   

The workshop will include a demo session for accepted papers that involve a 
system. 

Full paper and short paper topics will include, but will not be limited to, the 
following: 

1) Automated scoring/evaluation for oral and written student responses
-  Content analysis for scoring/assessment
-  Grammatical error detection and correction
-  Discourse and stylistic analysis
-  Plagiarism detection     
-  Machine translation for assessment, instruction and curriculum development
 
2) Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods   
-  Dialogue systems in education
-  Hypothesis formation and testing
-  Multi-modal communication between students and computers
-  Generation of tutorial responses
-  Knowledge representation in learning systems
-  Concept visualization in learning systems 

3) Learner cognition
-  Assessment of learners' language and cognitive skill levels
-  Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional states
-  Tools for learners with special needs 

4) Use of corpora in educational tools
-  Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
-  Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement 

5) Tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers
-  NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
-  Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify appropriate texts
-  Tools that automatically generate test questions such as multiple choice or
short answer
-  Processing of and access to lecture materials across topics and genres
-  Adaptation of instructional text to individual learners' grade levels 
-  E-learning tools for personalized course content
-  Language-based educational games 
 
6)Issues concerning the evaluation of NLP-based educational tools

7) Descriptions of implemented systems 

Submission Information 
Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, PDF 
format (with up to 1 additional page for references).This year, we also invite
short papers of up to 4 pages (including references). Papers which describe
systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like to
present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, please make sure to select
either "full paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" in the START submission process.

Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be 
reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure
that papers are anonymous.  Self-references that reveal the author's identity,
e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".  

Please use the 2010 NAACL-HLT style sheet for composing your paper:
http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html

And use the following START conference page to submit your paper (link 
forthcoming, see website).

Important Dates 
Submission deadline: <deadline>March 01, 2010</deadline> 
Notification of acceptance: March 30, 2010 
Camera-ready papers due: to be determined 
Workshop: June 05 or 06, 2010
