Meeting Description:

The workshop topic is the role of linguistic variation for the cultural
evolution of language. It will bring together researchers from various areas
(historical linguistics, creolistics, computational linguistics, ...) that are
interested in the application of evolutionary concepts to natural language.

The workshop is part of the annual meeting of the DGfS (German Linguistic Society). 

The role of variation in language evolution

Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the 
German Association for Linguistics (DGfS).

Siegen, 28 February - 2 March, 2007

Organized by Regine Eckardt (Göttingen) & Gerhard Jäger (Bielefeld) 

Theme:

It is a basic assumption of functional linguistics that the language system is
the result of adaptation to the pressure of language usage. This has succinctly
been expressed by Du Bois' (1987) dictum ''Languages code best what speakers do
most.'' Formal linguists have largely remained skeptical towards the functional
approach because of its teleological flavor. Prima facie, there is no causal
mechanism linking the cognitively founded properties of the language system to
the properties of language use.

This predicament is reminiscent to the issue of adaptation in biology, and it is
well-known that evolutionary theory offers a non-teleological, causal
explanation there. In the past ten years or so, various authors (Nowak, Hurford,
Kirby, Croft, Haspelmath inter alia) have proposed to apply evolutionary
concepts to language. Under this conception, variation is essential to establish
the link between language usage and language system. Among extant theories of
(cultural) language evolution, there is disagreement though about the precise
nature of this link. Some authors (like Haspelmath) propose a quasi-Lamarckian
view of language evolution. This means that variation itself is adaptive. There
are also arguments for a quasi-Darwinian view whereas variation itself is
non-adaptive (i.e. random, as far as the language system is concerned).
Adaptation of the system to usage is achieved via a process of selection,
because some linguistic variants are more apt to be acquired by infants and to
be imitated by adults than others (cf. for instance Kirby 1999).
Invited speakers

-Olga Fischer (Amsterdam)
-Andrew Wedel (Tucson)

Topics:

The workshop will explore the precise role of linguistic variation in language
evolution. We invite submissions to the following (and related) topics: 

-Empirical studies of language variation that are relevant for language
evolution. This includes experimental psycholinguistic studies as well as corpus
investigations 
    
-Computer simulations of language evolution 

-Formal and computational models of the micro-dynamics of language evolution,
like stochastic, exemplar based or memory based approaches 

-Studies of grammaticalization phenomena (and language change phenomena in
general) that relate diachronic change to synchronic variation 

-The role of variation in creolization 

-Mathematical models of language evolution 

Call for papers:

Submissions are invited for 60-minutes presentations (45 minutes + 15 minutes
discussion). Send your two-page abstract to Gerhard Jäger at the address below,
either by email (in plain text or in PDF format) or as hard copy, to arrive no
later than <deadline>August 6, 2006</deadline>. Notification of acceptance is by September 15, 2006.

final program is intended to represent a broad range of approaches to Greek
Linguistics including but not limited to: phonetics, phonology, morphology,
syntax, semantics, pragmatics, Greek dialects, sociolinguistics,
psycholinguistics, historical, computational, and applied linguistics. 

LOCATION: Department of Linguistics, University of Ioannina, Greece
