                       SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

               Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
                    in Natural Language Processing

                  Workshop at the Annual Meeting of
       the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2005)

  http://research.microsoft.com/~ringger/FeatureEngineeringWorkshop/

              ** SUBMISSION DEADLINE: <deadline>April 20, 2005</deadline> **

As experience with machine learning for solving natural language =
processing tasks accumulates in the field, practitioners are finding =
that feature engineering is as critical as the choice of machine =
learning algorithm, if not more so.  Feature design, feature selection, =
and feature impact (through ablation studies and the like) significantly =
affect the performance of systems and deserve greater attention.  In the =
wake of the shift away from knowledge engineering and of the successes =
of data-driven and statistical methods, researchers in the field of NLP =
are likely to make further progress by incorporating additional, =
sometimes familiar, sources of knowledge as features.  Although some =
experience in the area of feature engineering is to be found in the =
theoretical machine learning community, the particular demands of =
natural language processing leave much to be discovered.

This workshop aims to bring together practitioners of NLP, machine =
learning, information extraction, speech processing, and related fields =
with the intention of sharing experimental evidence for successful =
approaches to feature engineering, including feature design and feature =
selection.  We welcome papers that address these goals.  We also seek to =
distill best practices and to discover new sources of knowledge and =
features previously untapped.

Submissions are invited on all aspects of feature engineering for =
machine learning in NLP.  Topics may include, but are not necessarily =
limited to:

- Novel methods for discovering or inducing features, such as mining the =
web=20
  for closed classes, useful for indicator features.

- Comparative studies of different feature selection algorithms for NLP=20
  tasks.

- Interactive tools that help researchers to identify ambiguous cases =
that=20
  could be disambiguated by the addition of features.

- Error analysis of various aspects of feature induction, selection,=20
  representation.

- Issues with representation, e.g., strategies for handling hierarchical =

  representations, including decomposing to atomic features or by =
employing=20
  statistical relational learning.

- Techniques used in fields outside NLP that prove useful in NLP.

- The impact of feature selection and feature design on such practical=20
  considerations as training time, experimental design, domain =
independence,=20
  and evaluation.

- Analysis of feature engineering and its interaction with specific =
machine=20
  learning methods commonly used in NLP.

- Combining classifiers that employ diverse types of features.

- Studies of methods for defining a feature set,=A0for example=A0by =
iteratively=20
  expanding a base feature set.

- Issues with representing and combining real-valued and categorical=20
  features for NLP tasks.


INVITED TALK

The workshop will include an invited talk by Andrew McCallum of the =
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

The language of the workshop is English.  Submitted papers should be =
prepared in PDF format (all fonts included) or Microsoft Word .doc =
format and not longer than 8 pages following the ACL style.  More =
detailed information about the format of submissions can be found here: =
http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles =20

Submissions should be sent as an attachment to the following email =
address:  ringger AT microsoft DOT com .  In the body of the submission =
email, please include the following identification information:

   * Title
   * Author(s) name(s), affiliation(s), and e-mail address(es)
   * Abstract: short summary (up to 5 lines)

The papers themselves should contain no identifying information, and =
reviewing will be conducted in a blind fashion.

All accepted papers will be presented in during the workshop and =
collected in the printed proceedings.
