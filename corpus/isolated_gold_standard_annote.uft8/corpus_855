Meeting Description:

The MT Marathon 2010, organized by the National Centre for Language Technology
and the Centre for Next Generation Localisation at Dublin City University on
behalf of the EuroMatrixPlus Consortium, is the fourth in a series of MT
Marathons organised by the EU EuroMatrix and EuroMatrixPlus research projects on
Machine Translation. The EuroMatrixPlus consortium invites researchers,
developers, students, and users of machine translation for participation.

Participants are encouraged to propose projects that could be carried out in
small groups within the six days of Marathon. The main developers of the Moses
and Joshua tool kits will attend the workshop, organise projects, and assist
with extending these tool kits. 

Call for Papers

Open Source Tools for Machine Translation

The Fourth Machine Translation Marathon, which will take place January 25-30 in
Dublin, Ireland, is hosting an Open Source Convention to advance the state of
the art in machine translation. The MT Marathon is organised by the National
Centre for Language Technology and the Centre for Next Generation Localisation
at Dublin City University on behalf of the EuroMatrixPlus Consortium.

We invite developers of open source tools to present their work and submit a
paper of up to 10 pages that (a) describes the underlying methodology and (b)
includes instructions how to use the tools.

We are looking for stand-alone tools and extensions of existing tools, such as
the Moses open source systems. Accepted papers will be presented during the MT
Marathon and published as a special issue of the Prague Bulletin of Mathematical
Linguistics (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml).

Possible Topics:
- training of machine translation models
- machine translation decoders
- tuning of machine translation systems
- evaluation of machine translation
- visualization, annotation or debugging tools
- tools for human translators
- interfaces for web-based services or APIs
- extensions of existing tools
- other tools for machine translation

This is the second time that the MT Marathon will host the Open Source
Convention. The papers from last year are available online:
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml-91-100.html

Papers will be reviewed by two reviewers appointed by the program committee.

Important Dates:
Deadline for paper submission: <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline>
Notification of acceptance: December 7, 2009
Camera-ready paper due: <deadline>December 14, 2009</deadline>
Presentations: January 25-30, 2009 (at the MT Marathon in Dublin)

Please send non-anonymized full-version submissions in .pdf format to Philipp
Koehn (pkoehn@inf.ed.ac.uk). Please use the PBML style files from
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml-instructions.html (follow the "short paper" track
instructions) or download the style package directly from
