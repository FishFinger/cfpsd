Meeting Description:

The international conference 'Diachronic Perspectives on Genre in Specializ=
ed=20
Communication' will focus on the evolution of genres in specialized
communication under the pressure of technological innovations and the profo=
und
social changes triggered by globalization. It will also look at the possibl=
e
implications of these evolutions for the methodology used in the analysis o=
f
specialized genres and its updating about three decades after the emergence=
 of
genre analysis.

The conference will be residential and will take place in the historic Pala=
zzo
Feltrinelli at Gargnano on Lake Garda, Italy, on June 24 - 26, 2010.=20

Call for Papers

The main reason for devoting special attention to genre evolution is the
recognition that over the last few years rapid and wide-ranging changes in
communicative practices, patterns and technologies have deeply affected the
generic configuration of professional and disciplinary domains, bringing ab=
out
novel scenarios which call for new theoretical and analytical approaches. I=
f
some existing genres have survived the global digital revolution relatively
unscathed (although frequently in a re-mediated form), others have undergon=
e
drastic changes and others still have declined, while new ones have emerged=
.=20

These developments call for a reconsideration of the repertoires of convent=
ions
traditionally identified in each specific genre as well as for a reassessme=
nt of
the analytical tools used to investigate them. In particular, the conferenc=
e
will provide a forum for the discussion of genre evolution in domain-specif=
ic
discourses in a short-term diachronic perspective (1945-2009).

We invite abstracts on all aspects of genre evolution and genre theory in t=
he
following domains:
- corporate
- professional
- institutional
- legal=20
- scientific and technological.

Especially welcome are contributions focusing on the diachronic analysis of
genres associated with communication about food, nutrition and health. Thes=
e
will be discussed in a special panel which aims at providing preliminary
insights into the topics which have been chosen as themes for the Milan 201=
5 Expo.

Plenary speakers that have already accepted to participate are Vijay K. Bha=
tia,
Christopher N. Candlin and Inger Askehave.

Paper sessions will be 20 minute slots with 10 minutes for questions/discus=
sion.
The working language of the conference is English.

Submissions are to be sent to the conference mailbox genre2010@unimi.it by =
20
January 2010. The required format for submissions is an abstract of 300 wor=
ds
outlining the main thrust and conclusions of the paper, to be attached to a=
n
e-mail message including the author's full name, affiliation, address, phon=
e
number (for urgent contacts only), fax number and e-mail address. The outco=
me of
submissions will be notified by <deadline>10 February 2010</deadline>.=20

The Conference is organized by the English and Linguistics Group of the
Dipartimento di Lingue e Culture Contemporanee, Universit=E0 degli Studi di
Milano, Piazza Indro Montanelli 1, 20099 Sesto San Giovanni (Milan).
