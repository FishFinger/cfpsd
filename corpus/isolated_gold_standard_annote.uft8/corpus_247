Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics; Writing Systems 

Call Deadline: <deadline>08-Nov-2009</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The 36th annual meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society will take place at
the University of California, Berkeley on February 6-7, 2010. The meeting will
consist of a General Session, a Parasession, and a Special Session. Invited
speakers will be announced as they accept.

General Session:
The General Session will cover all areas of linguistic interest. We encourage
proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks and also welcome papers on
language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology, cognitive
science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology.

Invited Speaker:  
John J. Mccarthy, University of Massachusetts, Amherst

Parasession: Writing Systems and Orthography
The Parasession invites papers on all aspects of writing systems and
orthography. We welcome submissions from diverse theoretical perspectives in any
linguistic subfield (phonology, syntax, morphology, semantics, historical
linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics, etc.). Areas of
discussion might include: the interaction between written and spoken (or signed)
language, the development of orthographies, and the relationship between
cognition and writing.

Invited Speakers:
Richard Sproat, Oregon Health and Science University & University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign
Peter T. Daniels, Co-editor of The World's Writing Systems

Special Session: Language Isolates and Orphans
As the last remaining members of their families, language isolates and orphans
provide data relevant to both linguistic theory and typology. We invite papers
on any aspect of these languages in the hope of encouraging research on their
diverse and often unique properties. We also welcome submissions on
near-isolates and languages whose genetic affiliation is uncertain.

Invited Speakers:
Lyle Campbell, University of Utah
Jean-Marie Hombert, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) 

Second Call for Papers

We invite abstracts for the general session, the parasession on writing systems
and orthography, and the special session on language isolates and orphans. 

Please note two new invited speakers have been confirmed:
General session: John J. Mccarthy, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
Parasession: Peter T. Daniels, Co-editor of The World's Writing Systems

Presentation and Publication:
Presentations are allotted 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions. Presented
papers are published in the BLS Proceedings. Authors agree to provide
camera-ready copy (up to 12 pages) by <deadline>15 May 2010</deadline>. In order to expedite
publication of papers, BLS will begin publishing digitally with the proceedings
from this 36th Annual Meeting.

Abstract Submission:
Abstracts must be received electronically at bls_submissions@berkeley.edu by
11:59 PM, Pacific Standard Time (PST) Sunday, <deadline>8 November 2009</deadline>

No late submissions can be accepted. Authors will be notified of decisions
regarding abstracts by mid-December.

Submission Guidelines:
An author may submit at most one single and one joint abstract. In the case of
joint authorship, one address should be designated for official communication
with BLS.

Abstracts must clearly present a specific thesis statement and include a
description of topic, approach, and conclusions.

Abstracts must fit on one page in 12-point font with 1" margins. Data and
examples must be given within the body of the text, but references may be
included on a separate page if necessary. To preserve anonymity during the
review process, authors should not include their names or otherwise reveal their
identity anywhere in the abstract.

Abstracts that do not fit these specifications will not be considered.

All abstracts must be submitted electronically, formatted as Adobe Acrobat PDF
files with the author's name as the filename. The body of the e-mail message
must contain the following information:

1. Paper title
2. Session (General Session, Parasession, or Special Session) *
3. Name(s) of author(s)
4. Affiliation(s) of author(s)
5. E-mail address for each author
- Designation of email address for official communication in the case of joint
authorship
6. Phone number for each author
7. Please list up to three subfields (in decreasing order of relevance) from
among the following as possible categories for your submission:

- Phonetics
- Phonology
- Morphology
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics
- Historical linguistics
- Sociolinguistics
- Cognitive linguistics
- Psycholinguistics

Send electronic submissions to bls_submissions@berkeley.edu, with the subject
