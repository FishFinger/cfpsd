Meeting Description:

The organizing committee of the 3rd International ELT conference "Telling ELT
Tales out of School" would like to invite practicing teachers, teacher educators
and teacher researchers to share their tales about learners, learning, teachers,
teaching, and innovative practices in their contexts.

Since ELT has been one of the major concerns of Applied Linguistics, we believe
that our conference, specifically its subthemes related to learner language,
teacher language and multiple literacies, will be of particular interest to
linguists, who have much to say to language teachers.

- Learning Process
- Learning Outcomes

Exploiting Resources:

Fostering Cultural Awareness:

- English as a Lingua Franca
- Cross-cultural Awareness
- Critical Thinking Skills
- Multiple Literacies

On behalf of the ELT Department of Education Faculty at the Eastern
Mediterranean University, we would like to invite you to tell ELT "tales out of 
your school", to share tales from different settings, learners and teachers, as 
well as e-tales about innovative practice in your context. We genuinely believe 
that at our convention we will all learn lessons from these tales about
maximizing learning, empowering teaching, exploiting resources and fostering
cultural awareness.
