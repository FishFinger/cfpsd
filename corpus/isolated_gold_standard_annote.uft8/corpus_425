CALL FOR PAPERS
Music as Human Communication: An HCSNet Workshop on the
Science of Music Perception, Performance and Cognition
 =

Monday July 17 =AD Tuesday July 18, 2006
MARCS Auditory Laboratories
University of Western Sydney (Bankstown =AD Milperra campus)
Convenors: Kate Stevens, UWS and Emery Schubert, UNSW
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/node/913

ABSTRACTS DUE: <deadline>June 28, 2006</deadline>

The aim of this two-day national workshop is to present and discuss the
latest research that investigates human communication in the form of music
perception, performance and cognition. The theme is deliberately
interdisciplinary to bring together established, early career, and student
researchers from psychology, music, acoustics, computer science,
linguistics, and speech science.

Topics for discussion might include:
* performance and musical acoustics;
* the development of musical expectancies;
* affect expression and recognition in music;
* near-universal features of music and cross-cultural issues;
* the modularity debate regarding music and language.

Two keynote speakers (Prof Barbara Tillmann from CNRS, France and Prof
Laurel Trainor from McMaster University, Canada) and student and staff
researchers from around Australia will present their research and discuss
methods for rigorous investigation of the arts and consider current
knowledge of non-verbal cues to affect such as intensity, tempo, timing and
rhythm, phrasing, intonation and prosody. The workshop will also be relevant
to those interested in music information retrieval.

Day 2 of the workshop will have a more specific focus on applications of
music perception and cognition to issues of intonation in text-to-speech
(TTS) synthesis systems and naturalness of automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems. The papers and brainstorming sessions on Day 2 will
contribute to the HCSNet Priority Areas Effective Interfaces and Human and
Machine Speech being designed to stimulate discussion of a new
Art-Meets-Science approach to automated speech systems. See:
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/priorityareas

Day 1, Monday July 17: Music Perception, Performance & Cognition
Keynote speakers:
* Submitted papers from around Australia
* Professor Barbara Tillmann, Neurosciences & Syst=E8mes Sensoriels, CNRS,
France http://olfac.univ-lyon1.fr/unite/equipe-02/tillmann/tillmann-e.html
* Professor Laurel; Trainor, McMaster University, Auditory Development
Laboratory, Canada http://www.psychology.mcmaster.ca/ljt/

Day 2, Tuesday July 18: Music, Communication and Speech Technology
Day 2 will consist of a combination of submitted papers and workshop
discussion concerning ways in which knowledge from music psychology, affect
and music, and music theory might inform: improved intonation and
naturalness of text-to-speech (TTS), and increased adaptability of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) systems. Provocative, whimsical or risky abstracts
for Day 2 welcome!!

Registration Fee
Nil =AD the workshop is supported by HCSnet and designed to encourage
interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration.
Support is also available for airfares and accommodation for graduate
student and staff travel (where needed) from interstate.

Further Information and Abstract Submission
If you would like to receive updates about the workshop, please send an
email message to Clare Howell at MARCS Auditory Labs over the next week
(c.howell@uws.edu.au).

If you would like to submit an abstract for Day 1 and/or Day 2 of the
workshop, please complete the ABSTRACT SUBMISSION FORM, including a 300-word
abstract, and submit it to Clare Howell (c.howell@uws.edu.au) by <deadline>June 28,
2006</deadline>. The Abstract Submission Form may be downloaded from:
http://www.hcsnet.edu.au/node/913

Speed papers =AD short, provocative, risky 4-slide papers for Day 2 of the
