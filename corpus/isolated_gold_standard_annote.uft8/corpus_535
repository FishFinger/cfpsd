                  5th International Workshop

           Prague, Czech Republic, December 1-2, 2006

                    http://www.tlt2006.org

                     2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

The Guidelines for paper submission are now available at
http://www.tlt2006.org, link "Instructions for Authors" (or directly at
http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tlt2006/auth.html). The deadline for submitting
your papers is <deadline>Sept. 8, 2006</deadline>, as previously announced.

Workshop motivation and aims
----------------------------

Treebanks are a language resource that provides annotations of natural
languages at various levels of structure: at the word level, the phrase
level, the sentence level, and sometimes also at the level of
function-argument structure. Treebanks have become crucially important
for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language
processing, human language technologies, grammar extraction and
linguistic research in general. There are a number of on-going projects
on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack
them (Bulgarian, Catalan, Danish, Portugese, Spanish, Turkish) and a
number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific
purposes for languages that already have them (English). In addition,
there are projects that go beyond syntactic analysis to include
different kinds of semantic and pragmatic annotation. We specifically
encourage submissions that discuss the relations and links between, and
possibly merging of, various aspects of morphological, syntactic,
semantic, and contents/pragmatic annotation; also, submissions
describing work on parallel treebanks and/or cross-language annotation
schemas, theories and applications are more than encouraged as well.

The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved
that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and
more theory-dependent (Prague Dependency Treebank and other
dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependency treebank, the
Italian treebank (TUT), and the Turkish treebank (METU); Verbmobil HPSG
Treebanks, Polish HPSG Treebank, Bulgarian HPSG-based Treebank, etc.).
Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories
need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary
information flow between them.

This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and
advanced students working in these areas. The fifth workshop will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, 1-2 December 2006, with a number of
co-located events surrounding it (for more information see
www.tlt2006.org). (The first TLT workshop was held in Sozopol, Bulgaria
 in September 2002; see http://www.bultreebank.org/Proceedings.html), the
second one in Vaxjo, Sweden in November 2003
(http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~rics/TLT2003/, the third one in Tuebingen,
Germany in December 2004 (http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tlt04/) and
the fourth workshop was held in Barcelona, Spain, 9-10 December 2005
(http://clic.fil.ub.es/personal/civit/tlt05cfp.html).

Topics of interest
------------------

We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and
linguistic theories, including but not limited to:

- design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks;
- applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and in NLP;
- the role of linguistic theories in treebank development;
- treebanks as a basis for linguistic research;
- semantically annotated treebanks;
- evaluation and quality control of treebanks;
- tools for creation and management of treebanks;
- standards for treebanks.
