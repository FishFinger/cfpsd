Final Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2010

http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/

June 1 - June 6, 2010, Los Angeles, California

*Important Dates*:

* Deadline for BOTH FULL and SHORT paper submission: Tuesday, <deadline>December 1, 2=
009</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
* NEW: Author Response period: January 12-14, 2010 =

* Notification to Authors: Monday, January 25, 2010
* Final, camera-ready papers due: Mar 31, 2010

***IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION***: Please DO NOT submit the same paper in long =
and short paper form (also See *Multiple Submission* policy section)

NAACL is pleased to announce the North American Chapter of the Association =
for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT) 201=
0 conference.  The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines workin=
g towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natura=
l language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through service=
s such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval,=
 text summarization, and information extraction. ***This year, we are espec=
ially interested in papers discussing research with noisy data, including d=
ata from informal communications (such as, Twitter, Blogs, Email, SMS) and =
processed data (such as, Speech, OCR, Historical Data, and Machine Translat=
ion).***  NAACL HLT 2010 will feature full papers, short papers, demonstrat=
ions, and a doctoral consortium, as well as pre-conference tutorials and po=
st-conference workshops.  The conference invites the submission of full and=
 short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in discipl=
ines that could impact human language processing systems. We also encourage=
 the submission of short papers that can be characterized as a small, focus=
ed contribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or=
 an interesting application note.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are unders=
tood to be applied to speech and/or text: =


* Phonology
* Morphology (including word segmentation)
* Part of speech tagging
* Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms) =

* Grammar Engineering
* Word sense disambiguation
* Lexical semantics
* Formal semantics and logic
* Mathematical Linguistics
* Textual entailment and paraphrasing
* Discourse and pragmatics
* Knowledge acquisition and representation
* Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing =

* Multilingual processing
* Noisy data analysis
* Large-scale language processing
* Machine translation
* Language generation
* Summarization
* Question answering
* Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
* Information extraction
* Topic classification and information filtering
* Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/ genre analysis) =

* Topic clustering
* Text and speech mining
* Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
* Speech indexing and retrieval
* Speech analysis and recognition
* Speech synthesis
* Speech understanding
* Dialog(ue) systems
* Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human- robot interact=
ion, education and  learning systems, assistive technologies, digital enter=
tainment) =

* Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
* Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, annotated =
corpora) =

* Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information  structure and so=
urces in speech) =

* Multimodal representations and processing, including speech, gaze, gestur=
e, and other sensory inputs

*Submissions*:

*Full papers*: NAACL HLT 2010 submissions must describe substantial, origin=
al, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluati=
on and analysis should be included.  The long paper deadline is <deadline>December 1,=
 2010</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8).  Submissions will be judged=
 on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/sound=
ness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to r=
esearch resources, and replicability.  Each submission will be reviewed by =
at least three program committee members. Full papers may consist of up to =
eight (8) pages of content, plus one extra page for references, and will be=
 presented orally *OR* as a poster presentation as determined by the progra=
m committee.  The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and=
 which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than on t=
he quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings bet=
ween full papers presented orally and those presented as poster presentatio=
ns.   =


*Short papers*: NAACL HLT 2010 also solicits short papers. Short paper subm=
issions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadli=
ne this year is also <deadline>December 1, 2010</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT=
-8).  Characteristics of past short papers include:

* A small, focused contribution
* Work in progress
* A negative result
* An opinion piece
* An interesting application nugget

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and =
will be given four (4) pages including references in the proceedings. While=
 short papers will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, th=
ere will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presente=
d orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper subm=
ission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.  =


*Submission Deadline*: The deadline for both full and short papers is <deadline>Decem=
ber 1, 2010</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8). =

 =

*Electronic Submission*: Submission is electronic using paper submission so=
ftware at: https://www.softconf.com/naaclhlt2010/HLT2010/ =


*Format*: Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAA=
CL HLT 2010 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus o=
ne extra page for references.  Short paper submissions should also follow t=
he two-column format of NAACL HLT 2010 proceedings, and should not exceed f=
our (4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL La=
TeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conf=
erence, which will be available on the conference website under http://naac=
lhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html.  Submissions must conform to the official st=
yle guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be el=
ectronic in PDF.

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' nam=
es and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's =
identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. I=
nstead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..."  =
Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without r=
eview.  In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until a=
fter the review process is complete.  =


*Multiple-submission policy*: Papers that have been or will be submitted to=
 other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time.  Aut=
hors submitting multiple papers to NAACL HLT may not submit papers that ove=
rlap significantly (> 50%) with each other in content or results.  Authors =
SHOULD NOT submit a short and long version of the same paper.  Authors of p=
apers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2010 must notify the program c=
hairs by February 15, 2010 as to whether the paper will be presented.  All =
accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the procee=
dings.  We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that over=
lap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have b=
een) published elsewhere.
