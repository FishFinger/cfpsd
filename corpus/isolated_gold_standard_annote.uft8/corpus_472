Meeting Description:

The Sixth Conference on Language Engineering is a good opportunity for gathering
researchers interested in language engineering topics. The Egyptian Soceity of
Language Engineering, the organizer of this conference encourages research and
development of products that help in man/machine communication in natural
language. Although most of the presented papers in the previous five conferences
dealt with Arabic Language, many were treating bilingual ones, e.g. machine
translation, natural language processing, information retrieval. Speech coders,
recognizers, synthesizers find interest from many researchers. Optical character
recognition in Arabic and latin languages are treated too.  We encourage
researchers from all institutions to participate in this conference. 

Scope of Conference:
1. Language analysis and comprehension
2. Language generation
3. Spoken language understanding
4. Discourse & dialogue systems
5. Evaluation of natural language processing systems
6. Large corpora
7. Speech recognition and synthesis
8. Natural language processing for information retrieval
9. Machine translation
10. Language engineering frameworks & methodologies
11. Language engineering & artificial intelligence
12. Character recognition
13. Semantic Web and Ontology Languages

Papers are to be submitted in PDF or Word 2000 to
