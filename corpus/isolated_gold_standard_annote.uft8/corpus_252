Full Title: SLA Graduate Student Symposium 2010

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition 

Call Deadline: <deadline>30-Dec-2009</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The UW-Madison SLA Graduate Student Organization, in collaboration with the 
University of Iowa SLA student organization (FLARES), is organizing a graduate
student symposium entitled 'Who are we?: SLA in a Global Society' for April
16-17, 2010 at the UW-Madison. 

Call for Papers

The field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) continues to develop by drawing 
on theory and research from both its founding fields and newly contributing
areas of study. This wide variety of perspectives contributes to a flow of ideas
across disciplinary, geographical, and linguistic boundaries, describing a
myriad of linguistic situations, from lingua franca communication to language
maintenance, acquisition, and loss. From this multi-faceted research base SLA
addresses a diverse range of linguistic and social ideas relevant to
multilingual classroom, community, and workplace settings and explores a view of
identity, both of researcher and researched, as fluid, multiple and increasingly
trans-national and transcultural.

We seek proposals from graduate students of their research that reflects the
interdisciplinary and globally expanding nature of the field of SLA. The
graduate students at the University of Iowa and the University of Wisconsin-
Madison have formed a partnership to host this annual conference, with
organization and hosting of the conference alternating between the universities.
Our purpose is to provide an opportunity for graduate students in SLA and
related disciplines to present their work and meet distinguished researchers in
their field.

Keynote Speaker
Bonny Norton (University of British Columbia): 
http://www.lerc.educ.ubc.ca/fac/norton/
Invited Speakers from the Sponsoring Institutions
Richard Young (UW-Madison): http://www.english.wisc.edu/rfyoung/
Michael Everson (U of Iowa): 
http://www.education.uiowa.edu/people/facstaffs/meverson.htm

A panel of professors and graduate students from the University of Iowa and the 
UW-Madison will address how identity in SLA work is explored through different 
methodologies, discussing the variety of ways identity can be investigated and
unraveled within SLA research.

Submission Guidelines
We invite proposals for papers and posters from graduate students at any level
of graduate study. Paper presentations will be 20 minutes followed by a
10-minute discussion period. Posters will be displayed on Saturday, April 17.
Poster presenters will be expected to stand by their posters to discuss their
work during a 1-hour session.

Areas of particular interest include, but are not limited to, those related to
the symposium theme and/or any of the following areas:
- Formal approaches to language learning
- Generative second language acquisition (syntax, phonology, semantics)
- Heritage language acquisition
- Identity and language learning
- Language testing and assessment
- Learner corpora and SLA
- Second and foreign language pedagogy
- Second and foreign language policy
- Second language analysis and use
- Second language and cultural socialization
- Second language learning and technology
- Second language pragmatics
- Second language processes and learning
- Socio-cultural approaches to language learning

Please use the accompanying submission form to submit abstracts by December 30,
2009 to: slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu
Notification of acceptance will be sent by January 29, 2010.
Please use the attached form for all submissions. You will be asked to provide 
the following information: presenter name(s), affiliations, mailing addresses,
email addresses, and phone numbers, AV needs, and summary (50 words), title, and
abstract (300 words) of the presentation.

You will also be asked to indicate if you would like your abstract considered
for presentation as a paper or as a poster. You may also indicate whether or not
you would like your abstract to be considered for presentation as a poster, if
it is not selected for a paper presentation.

Evaluation of Proposals:
Reviewers will take into consideration these criteria when evaluating proposals:
I. Choice and clarity of topic, perspective, and/or method
II. Quality of research (literature, methods, and conclusions)
III. Contribution to field, originality
IV. Relevance to current issues in SLA

Please contact slagrads@languageinstitute.wisc.edu with questions.
