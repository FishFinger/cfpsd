			 2nd Call for Papers

	    COLING-ACL Workshop on Multiword Expressions:
	       Identifying and Exploiting Underlying Properties

			 (Endorsed by SIGLEX)


		   July 23, 2006, Sydney, Australia




	       ** Submission Deadline: <deadline>April 12 2006</deadline> **


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop Description:

There has been a growing awareness in the NLP community of the
problems that Multiword Expressions (MWEs) pose.  Given all the
progress that has been made, it is now the time to ask some
fundamental questions on the nature of MWEs. A better understanding of
the underlying linguistic properties that define MWEs as well as their
cognitive aspects can be used to inform their computational
treatment. These combinations of research will help to provide a more
complete picture of the nature of MWEs, which can be used to advance
NLP methods for capturing them.
			     
This workshop continues a tradition of ACL workshops on Collocations
(2001) and Multiword Expressions (2003 and 2004). Its specific
objective is to focus on the underlying properties of MWEs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions:

We welcome papers describing original work on MWEs, and this includes
(but is not limited to) research on:

(1) Linguistic, Empirical and Cognitive Properties of MWEs: research
    into the definitions and properties of MWEs and the impact that
    such information has on NLP applications.  We will also welcome
    studies which investigate cross-linguistic properties or
    which identify variation across languages (or families of
    languages). This includes research on how to identify and
    handle parallel constructions in different languages: how easily
    can techniques developed for one language be transferred to
    another and how can cues in one language help in another?

(2) Classes of MWEs: investigating the representation of classes of
    MWEs and the extent to which classes of MWEs can be treated with
    common methods, to help assess how much we can expect
    computational techniques to transfer across classes. What methods
    are there for identifying variability in MWEs and how reliable are
    these?

(3) Linguistic and Psycholinguistic Theories of MWEs: combining the
    computational treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic
    and/or psycholinguistic analysis.

(4) Evaluation: addressing how to overcome the limitations that the
    lack of gold standards brings on the evaluation of techniques for
    automatic extraction, representation, and use of information about
    MWEs. What techniques are best for establishing standards - web
    experiments, expert judgements, etc. - and how can we best
    contribute to available resources?

(5) Compositionality: assessing how humans and computers can make
    reliable judgements on compositionality for the different
    categories of MWE and to what extent non-compositionality is
    important for determining whether a given candidate is a MWE.


Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings and
should not exceed eight (8) pages, including references. We strongly
recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word document
template that will be made available on the COLING-ACL main conference
Web site (http://www.acl2006.mq.edu.au/).

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Submission will be electronic using the paper submission START system,
and they must be in Adobe PDF format. The papers must be submitted no
later than <deadline>April 12, 2006</deadline>. Papers submitted after that time will not
be reviewed. For details of the submission procedure, please consult
the submission webpage reachable via the workshop website.
