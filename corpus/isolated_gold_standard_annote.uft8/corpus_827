Dear Lisa,
a few months ago, I extracted a list of Arabic plurals, but never had the
time to clean it. It has over 7000 nouns and their plurals. The list is
available here:

http://jones.ling.indiana.edu/~emadnawfal/arabicPlural.txt

Hope you find it useful.

Hello Hamed and all,<br>
<br>
Here is a voice chat application that we can use, not sure if this is<br>
the best or there is something better. Also we can consider skype<br>
since it is a free option.<br>

&gt; Hello Hamed,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can answer this from a technology point of view. In the longer term,=
 I suggest moving this conversation off the &quot;corpora&quot; mailing lis=
t and setting up a dedicated e-mail list for this project. However, in the =
short term, it is quite important to get things moving (and simply!), as a =
lot of interest has been expressed. Setting up a group to study Arabic, and=
 especially Quranic Arabic sounds like a positive project which would benef=
it a great many people.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Some things I would suggest:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1) Keep things simple at the start. A good idea might be a message boa=
rd where people can start to have discussions. However, this does require p=
eople to log in / log out. Ideally a mailing list is required, and also a w=
ebsite. Wordpress might be a good place to start, at least initially.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; 2) For more long term, given that from what I understand there will be=
 a computational aspect to this, I would suggest hosting any code on a wide=
ly accessible code repository. Both sourceforge or google code seem to be p=
opular choices for this.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; 3) From a technical point of view, here is what would be needed long t=
erm:<br>
&gt; - a mailing list<br>
&gt; - a website<br>
&gt; - a code repository<br>
&gt; - possibly a message board where anyone can post<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; With regards to what actual technology is required for a language rese=
arch website ... I would think that would depend on the skill set of those =
developing and maintaining it! Many good open source web projects use PHP, =
which is pretty popular these days as a web platform. However, I think give=
n that this is all very early days, probably what might be a good idea woul=
d be as you suggest to hold an initial online meeting off the corpora maili=
ng list where things like this can be discussed further. Another thing to t=
hink about is private vs public hosting. If you are putting together a lang=
uage website, this could either be hosted privately (e.g. a at University) =
or else publically (such as part of google code or sourceforge). Public hos=
ting is cheap, easy and fast to set up, and they give you a platform / infr=
astructure for e-mail lists, discussion groups, code hosting etc. However, =
you do have more control if you are affiliated with a University of<br>

=A0example and host this yourself.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Feel free to take the rest of this discussion offline with me, as it d=
oes sound its starting to get a bit off topic for the corpora mailing list =
:-)<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I am working on the &quot;Quranic Arabic Corpus&quot;, a research proj=
ect at the University of Leeds where we are mapping the morphology, syntax =
and Arabic grammar of the Quran (<a href=3D"http://quran.uk.net" target=3D"=

king on a dependency treebank of the Quran using traditional Arabic syntax =
(i&#39;rab).<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;From what I understand, as part of your proposal you mention the a=

&gt; Dear All,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank you for responding, however many issues have been raised and I&#=
39;ll discuss them one by one.<br>
&gt; 1- why Islamic tending?<br>
&gt; As I mentioned and Dr.Nizar declared there are tow directions for stan=
darizing =A0Arabic nowadays, the modern standard Arabic VS the Quranic stan=
dard Arabic.<br>
&gt; Both are not spoken widely and the modern standard Arabic still not ye=
t completed, in spite of some proposals for regional dialects to became an =
independent languages the standard Arabic is the only written and widely do=
minated the culture and formal usage.<br>

&gt; non Muslim Arabs writings are the only non Quranic Arabic writing till=
 the end of 19th century, when some Arabic Muslims nationalists start writi=
ng without the restrict Arabic linguistic rules, which lead after a century=
 to non restricted Arabic language we called modern Arabic.<br>

&gt; because of Quran the modern Arabic can&#39;t eleminate the standard Na=
ho (syntax) or Sarf (etymological system), and it still leak of precise or =
standards.<br>
&gt; Thou my proposal centralized by the hold on with well standarized Qura=
nic Arabic and completion of its missing modern &quot;computational, etymol=
ogical and semantic&quot; standarizations.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2-The proposal definitely not limited or restricted to Muslims.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3- The fund and the Full outlines of the establishment:<br>
&gt; let&#39;s take the thing step by step, we need [1]enough enthusiasm pr=
ofessional founders and [2]temporary online platform [3] arranging an appoi=
ntment for first meeting [4]proposing outlines and manager(s) for the meeti=
ng.<br>

&gt; I can offer the temporary online platform<br>
&gt; and we are discussing the other requirements.<br>

<br>
<br>
Background<br>
<br>
The introduction of a corpus-based methodology in the field of<br>
Translation Studies (Baker 1993) gave rise to a large number of<br>
empirical studies that investigate the fundamental characteristics of<br>
translated texts and their relationship to their source texts and<br>
non-translated texts. These studies have yielded interesting insights<br>
into the nature of translated language and the translation process, such<br=
>
as the so-called translation universals, the ideology of translation and<br=
>
stylistic differences between translators.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, important methodological and conceptual challenges lie<br>
ahead. Some languages, for instance, are less well-studied within<br>
corpus-based Translation Studies. Obviously, in order to empirically<br>
verify general hypotheses about translation products and processes, as<br>
many languages as possible have to be studied.<br>
<br>
In addition, some general hypotheses, like the explicitation<br>
hypothesis, need conceptual refinement: to what extent, for instance, is<br=
>
explicitation at syntactic level identical to explicitation at<br>
discursive level? Most importantly, how can general hypotheses be put to<br=
>
the test or, in other words, how do we &#39;translate? (operationalise)<br>
hypotheses so that they are empirically testable in a corpus?<br>
The two-day symposium therefore wants to encourage corpus-based work on<br>
translations in less well-studied languages as well as corpus-based work<br=
>
that pushes methodological and conceptual frontiers in Translation<br>
Studies. Possible questions / hypotheses include (but are not limited<br>
to) untranslatability or implicitation, deictic shifts in translation,<br>
information structure asymmetries between source and target texts,<br>
register differences within translated language. More information can be<br=
>
found on the conference website.<br>

Ontologies provide formal specifications of what might exist in a domain to=
<br>
ensure reusability and interoperability of multiple heterogeneous systems.<=
br>
Ontologies form an indispensable part of the Semantic Web standard stack.<b=
r>
While the Semantic Web is still our vision into the future, ontologies have=
<br>
already found a myriad of applications such as document retrieval, question=
<br>
answering, image retrieval, agent interoperability and document annotation.=
<br>
In recent years, automatic ontology learning from text has provided support=
<br>
and relief for knowledge engineers from the labourious task of manually<br>
engineering of ontologies. Ontology learning research, an area integrating<=
br>
advances from information retrieval, text mining, data mining, machine<br>
learning and natural language processing, has attracted increasing interest=
s<br>
from a wide spectrum of application domains (e.g. bioinformatics,<br>
manufacturing). Being a rapidly growing area, it is crucial to collect the<=
br>
recent advances in tools and technologies in ontology learning and related<=
br>
areas.<br>

The main objective of this book is to provide relevant theoretical<br>
foundations, and disseminate new research findings and expert views on the<=
br>
remaining challenges in ontology learning. In particular, the book focuses<=
br>
on the following questions:<br>
# Can ontology learning continue to rely on techniques borrowed from relate=
d<br>
areas that were conceived for other purposes? Has the time arrived for us t=
o<br>
look at certain peculiar requirements of ontology learning and develop<br>
specific techniques to meet these requirements?<br>
# Lightweight ontologies are the most common type of ontologies in a variet=
y<br>
of existing Semantic Web applications (e.g. knowledge management, document<=
br>
retrieval, communities of practice, data integration). Can these lightweigh=
t<br>
ontologies be easily extended to formal ones? If so, how?<br>
# The poor coverage, rarity and maintenance cost related to manually-create=
d<br>
resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS) and text corpora<b=
r>
(e.g. BNC, GENIA corpus) have prompted an increasing number of researchers<=
br>
to turn to dynamic Web data for ontology learning. There is currently a lac=
k<br>
of study concentrating on the systematic use of Web data as background<br>
knowledge for all phases of ontology learning. How do we know if we have th=
e<br>
necessary background knowledge to carry out all our ontology learning tasks=
?<br>
Where do we look for more background knowledge if we know that what we have=
<br>
is inadequate?<br>
# More and more practitioners in the domain of biology, health care,<br>
chemistry, manufacturing, etc are looking up to ontology learning technique=
s<br>
for solutions to their knowledge sharing and reusability needs. How much<br=
>
more difficult is it to automatically learn ontologies from news articles,<=
br>
as compared to clinical notes or biomedical literature? To what extent can<=
br>
the current techniques meet the requirements of learning from texts across<=
br>
different domains? Is the field of automatic ontology learning from text<br=
>
ready for the industry?<br>

This proposed book will be an invaluable resource as a library or personal<=

reference for a wide range of audience, including, graduate students,<br>
researchers and industrial practitioners. Postgraduate students who are in<=
br>
the process of looking for future research directions, and carving out thei=
r<br>
own niche area will find this book particularly useful. Due to the detailed=
<br>
scope and wide coverage of the book, it also has the potential of being an<=

upper-level course supplement for senior undergraduate students in<br>
Artificial Intelligence, and a resource for lecturers in Knowledge<br>
