Meeting Description:

Call for Papers: papers are still invited; abstracts of 150-500 words by <deadline>9 May 2006</deadline> to John Kirk j.m.kirk@qub.ac.uk 

The Forum for Research on the Languages of Scotland and Ulster wishes, firstly, to thank all those who responded to the First Circular with expressions of interest in the Conference and offers of papers.  Plans for what promises to be an excellent Conference are now well advanced, and full details of the programme will be announced in the Third Circular.

The academic programme will include plenary papers on the Gaelic of South Argyll (George Jones), the place-names of Islay (Margaret Storrie), the language of radical poets in the 1790s (Andrew Noble), the Islay poet William Livingstone (Donald Meek and Christopher Whyte) and Orwell and Jura (Christopher Small): the last mentioned will be presented during the conference trip, which will include a bus tour of Jura and if possible a visit to Orwell's house.  

Shorter presentations will be given in parallel sessions: to whet your appetite, the topics so far offered include ''Scottish 'clan' history and place-names in Ulster'', ''George Campbell Hay as a Scots Renaissance poet'', ''John Jamieson, father of Scottish lexicography'', ''Shetlanders speak -- Orcadians sing'', ''A universalist perspective on the Scottish varieties of English'' and ''Bilingualism and Modern Scottish Poetry''.  The Seanchas Íle project being conducted at the Columba Centre will also be the subject of a presentation. There is still room on the programme for more papers, and the Committee would warmly encourage anyone who has not yet proposed a paper to consider doing so, using the attached form. 

The provisional programme is as follows:

Tues 4 July:     Arrivals and informal reception from 7.00 p.m.
Wed 5 July:     Morning and afternoon papers; conference dinner.
Thurs 6 July:   Whole-day excursion to Jura via Finlaggan and return via Distillery, with plenary papers en route.
Fri 7 July:        Morning and afternoon papers; evening concert.
Sat 8 July:       Morning and afternoon papers; final ceilidh.
Sun 9 July:      Departure.
 
           The conference fee is £100 (£80 for Forum members paid up for 2006, students and unwaged).  This will cover all the academic sessions, the Tuesday evening reception, and morning and afternoon coffees on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; and will also entitle delegates to full membership of the Forum for Research on the Languages of Scotland and Ulster for 2007.  Separate charges will be made for lunches and the other social events (conference dinner, excursion, concert and ceilidh) and there will be a reduced fee for accompanying persons participating only in the social programme: the figures will be announced in the Third Circular, and collected from delegates at registration.    

  Only those who respond to this call  will receive the Third Circular.  Full and final payment for the social events will be due by 15 June 2006. Advance payment is necessary because of the logistics involved and because we are organising the event from a distance; we hope you will be understanding and not too inconvenienced. 

As noted in the First Circular, delegates must make their own arrangements for accommodation; and those who have not yet attended to this are now urged to do so as soon as possible, as accommodation is limited, especially in Bowmore.  Details from http://www.isle-of-islay.com/
            
We look forward to hearing from you.

Call Deadline: <deadline>01-Jul-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The goal of this conference is to identify key challenges for the discipline of linguistics as a whole as well as ways that we can work in an integrated fashion to meet these challenges. The conference has been designed to foster discussion and the exchange of ideas and the sharing of practical information among linguists and those in related fields who approach the study of language from a variety of perspectives. 

Over the course of the last century linguistics, like other disciplines, has become specialized and rather fragmented. Practically speaking, such specialization is necessary given the vast amount of concerns that the study of language entails. On the other hand, it might be considered that all of the approaches to the discipline are inherently interconnected. It seems a worthwhile enterprise, therefore, for the members of the discipline to take a step back and consider the levels on which the various perspectives taken may intersect and share mutually beneficial methodologies, information and concerns. As such, this conference has been designed to foster discussion and the exchange of ideas and the sharing of practical information among linguists and those in related fields who approach the study of language from a variety of perspectives. We hope that in doing so we can identify key challenges for the discipline as a whole as well as ways that we can work in an integrated f!
 ashion to meet these challenges.
