Meeting Description:

A theme session at DGKL-06 (Meeting of the German Cognitive Linguistics
Association), Munich, Germany, 5-7 October 2006 

Work with empirical data is important, if not essential, to cognitive
linguistics. Electronic corpora of written texts or transcriptions of
speech are increasingly used and sometimes purposefully collected by
linguists in their investigations of phenomena such as metaphor,
metonymy, idioms, and frames. During their work, some linguists also
compile - more or less private - electronic archives of phenomena
studied in cognitive linguistics: searchable lists, classifications,
databases. Moreover, they have to deal with these phenomena - usually
in cooperation with computational linguists and computer scientists -
when building general lexicon resources for the automatic treatment of
language.

Problems that arise when working with corpora are connected to the way
they are prepared for and processed by the corpus tools (concordancers,
corpus managers). For example, in spite of some attempts in
computational linguistics to detect metaphors in running texts, no
corpus manager disposes of a ''Show all metaphors'' function. Rather, in
order to search a corpus for metaphors, linguists will devise their own
methods, be they theory-based or data-driven.

Other problems arise when creating project-specific as well as more
general archives of language usage examples classified by cognitive
linguistic criteria. Here, linguists decide which criteria they use in
their classifications and which features of the archived data they
annotate. These decisions are often made at a project-specific basis
and therefore different classifications might be difficult to compare.

At a larger scale, this also applies to general linguistic resources
developed for Human Language Technology applications. The decisions
taken during linguistic resource-building may then be evaluated - by
the resource developers or others -, based on large quantities of data
encoded in the resources themselves. Evaluations of this kind are at
the same time test-beds for theories put forth in cognitive
linguistics, and their results provide valuable feedback for theory
development.

In this theme session, we would like to discuss methods of exploiting
electronic corpora for any cognitive linguistic research, not
restricted to the phenomena mentioned above, as well as practical
experiences with resource building in cognitive linguistics. We also
invite contributions that evaluate the implications of data encoded in
computational resources, from the viewpoint of cognitive linguistic
theory.

Please send only detailed abstracts (2 pages), in which you make clear
how your study is related to the topics indicated.

The deadline for abstract submission is <deadline>15th May 2006</deadline>. Participants
will be notified of the acceptance of their papers by 1st July 2006.

Please send your abstracts exclusively as email attachments (pdf- or
rtf-files) to:
