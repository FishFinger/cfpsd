After the successful LR4Trans-I (28 May 2002, Las Palmas) and
LR4TRans-II (28 August 2004, Geneva) Workshops, we would now like

translation and localisation technologies, from practicing translators to
translator trainers, going through researchers in various
interdisciplinary fields, ranging from computational linguistics,
translation to corpus linguistics, terminology and multilingual technical
documentation. We would be happy to have a more significant representation
of industry and government agencies handling electronic language resources
(LRs) to satisfy their multilingual needs.

2) Important dates (subject to slight changes):
- Deadline for workshop paper submission: <deadline>3rd February 2006</deadline>
- Notification of Acceptance: 15th March 2006
- Paper Final Version for Workshop Proceedings: <deadline>3rd April 2006</deadline>.
