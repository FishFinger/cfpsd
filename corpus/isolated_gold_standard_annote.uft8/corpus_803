Call for Papers

Special Issue of Dialogue & Discourse on Incremental Processing in Dialogue
This is the 2nd call for papers. There is only one addendum compared to the
first call: if you are thinking of submitting an article, we would
appreciate if you could let us know by email so that we can organise the
review panel in a timely manner.


Guest Editors

Hannes Rieser, University of Bielefeld, Germany
David Schlangen, University of Potsdam, Germany


Background

The topic of the special issue is 'incremental processing in dialogue', by
which we mean, very broadly, the successive processing of input (or
generation of output) in increments smaller than whole utterances.

This is a topic that has been of interest in many different communities,
with different foci: conversation analysis, psycholinguistics, and
computational linguistics. [See
http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org/special_issues/incr_cfp.txt for full
background section.]

The purpose of this special issue is to bring together work from
researchers from the different fields where incrementality of language
processing, in particular in relation to dialogue, is an issue. Our aim is
to take stock of the current state of the art as well as to represent
current, cutting edge research. We are seeking contributions from people
from a range of disciplines including, but not limited to
psycholinguistics, computational dialogue modelling and more traditional
linguistics.


Topics of Interest

We seek submission on topics including, but not limited to, the following
(see http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org/special_issues/incr_cfp.txt for
a full description of the topics):

  Incrementality and Dialogue Structure
  The Time-Course of Interpretation Processes
  Accounts of Incremental Information from Different Strata of Dialogue
  Computational Models of Incremental Processing
  Theoretical Models of Incrementality
  Repercussions of the Incrementality Concept on Traditional Topics of
Dialogue Theory


About the Journal

'Dialogue and Discourse' (http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org) is the
first international journal dedicated exclusively to work that deals with
language 'beyond the single sentence', in discourse (i.e., text, monologue)
and dialogue, from a theoretical as well as an experimental and technical
perspective.


Practical Information

Submission deadline is <deadline>December 31st, 2009</deadline>. Manuscripts need to be
formatted according to 'Dialogue and Discourse' author guidelines, and
submitted using the journal's online manuscript submission system (see
http://www.dialogue-and-discourse.org/). As a guideline, full articles
should be around 30 pages, but if justified, significantly shorter or
longer papers will be considered as well. Publication of this special issue
will be in 2010.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if your have any practical questions
or are unsure about whether a possible topic you would like to write about
would fall under this call.
