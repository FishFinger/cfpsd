Aim of the Workshop
The aim of this workshop is to foster interactions among researchers and
practitioners in Natural Language Processing (NLP) working within the parad=
igm
of Cognitive Science.  Research into NLP involves concepts and methods from=
 many
fields including artificial intelligence, linguistics, computational
linguistics, statistics, computer science, and most importantly cognitive
science. Because it is impossible to cover all aspects of NLP this workshop
emphasises the contribution of cognitive science to language processing,
including conceptualisation, representation, discourse processing, meaning
construction, ontology building, and text mining.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
- Computational Models of NLP=20
- Evolutionary NLP=20
- Situated (embodied) NLP=20
- Multimodality in speech / text processing=20
- Text Summarization and Information Extraction=20
- Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems=20
- Multi-Lingual Processing
- Pragmatics and NLP
- Speech Processing=20
- Tools and Resources in NLP=20
- Ontologies=20
- Text Mining
- Electronic Dictionaries
- Evaluation of NLP Systems

These topics can be addressed from any of the following perspectives: full
automation by machines for machine (traditional NLP or HLT), semi- automate=
d
processing, i.e. machine-mediated processing (programs assisting people in =
their
tasks), simulation of human cognitive process.

Important Dates:
Regular Paper Submission: <deadline>March 8, 2010</deadline>
Authors Notification: April 6, 2010
Final Paper Submission and Registration: <deadline>April 21, 2010</deadline>

Submission of Papers:
Prospective authors are invited to submit papers for oral presentation in a=
ny of
the areas listed above. Only full papers in English will be accepted, and t=
he
length of the paper should not exceed 12 pages (7000 words). Instructions f=
or
preparing the manuscript (in Word and Latex format) are available at the IC=
EIS
web site http://www.iceis.org/Submission_Guidelines.htm.=20

Postscript/RTF versions of the manuscript should be submitted through ICEIS
web-based paper submission procedure.

Keynote Speaker
Professor Patrick W. Hanks

Workshop Format
The workshop will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations. The
proceedings of the workshop will be published in the form of a book.=20
