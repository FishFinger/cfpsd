Call for Papers

The 6th International ELT Research Conference aims to provide the highest
calibre of ELT research through our keynote speakers, a large number of sch=
olars
and presenters, and scientific and cultural exchange within a friendly,
informative and stimulating atmosphere. This year we are honoured to have
distinguished scholars as our keynote speakers:

Ay?e Akyel (Yeditepe University, Turkey);
Bob Burden (University of Exeter, UK);
Cem Alptekin (Bo?azi=E7i University, Turkey);
Nick Ellis (Michigan University, USA); and
Tony Lynch (Edinburgh University, UK).

We believe our invited speakers will turn the event into a truly learning
experience. We also expect many international ELT researchers to choose our
biannual event as an outlet for their research findings.

Postgraduate student stipends will be available as attending conferences ca=
n
cost more than some of us can afford. So far we have managed to raise enoug=
h
money to finance three postgraduate presenters. However, we are constantly
seeking to raise more money. We really hope to make this event possible for
those who really deserve.

The conference is also supported by two international journals, Internation=
al
Journal of Research in ELT and Journal of Theory and Practice in Education.
Selected papers will be considered and given priority for publication in th=
ese
journals. International Journal of Research in ELT is a newly established
research journal to be published by Educational Research Association, Turke=
y,
http://eab.org.tr/  and will be first launched in January 2011 with selecte=
d
papers/articles from the conference programme while Journal of Theory and
Practice in Education http://eku.comu.edu.tr  will publish a special issue =
on
SLA research and language teaching in 2010.

Language Learning and Acquisition=20
Teacher Training and Education=20
