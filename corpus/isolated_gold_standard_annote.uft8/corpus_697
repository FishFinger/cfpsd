Full Title: Topics in Cognitive Science 


Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science 

Call Deadline: <deadline>01-Feb-2010</deadline> 

Second and Updated Call for Papers - for the journal Topics in Cognitive Science (topiCS) 

(http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121673067/home)

Production of Referring Expressions: Bridging the gap between computational and empirical approaches to reference

Deadline for intention to submit (by email to pre.topics@googlemail.com): 
<deadline>February 1, 2010</deadline>

Deadline for submission of full papers (using the journal's submission system): 
<deadline>March 1, 2010</deadline>

We invite substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all topics related to the production of referring expressions. Contributions may focus on computational, experimental, or theoretical approaches to reference. 
Papers bridging two or more of these fields are especially encouraged.  
Papers should not normally exceed 8,000 words, though this limit may be extended in exceptional cases.

Editors for this topic are Kees van Deemter (University of Aberdeen, UK), Albert Gatt (University of Malta, Malta), Roger van Gompel (University of Dundee, UK) and Emiel Krahmer (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). 

If prospective authors have any questions, they should contact the TopiCS editors at 
pre.topics@googlemail.com.

Specific topics of interest include computational and/or experimental approaches to:
- different kinds of referring expressions; when are which types of reference (pronouns, descriptions, etc.) most appropriate?
- plural and quantified references
- vagueness: the use of vague (e.g. gradable) predicates in referring expressions
- referential overspecification: why and how do speakers overspecify?
- referential underspecification: production of descriptions which do not uniquely identify a referent
- referring expressions in interactive settings; audience design, adaptation and alignment
- ambiguity avoidance in references
- common ground, cooperativeness and shared/private information in reference
- realization of referring expressions (including speech and gesture)
- visual scene perception and its influence on the production of referring expressions
- social and contextual factors in reference
- data-collection and experimental evaluation methods

Paper Submission: Manuscripts should follow the APA guidelines. Each submission will be sent for review to three reviewers, including at least one psycholinguist and one computational linguist. The only accepted format for submitted abstracts is Adobe PDF. A two-stage process is used, whereby authors first send an *intention to submit* to precogsci2009@googlemail.com by <deadline>February 1, 2010</deadline>. Intentions to submit should contain a provisional title, author name(s), and an abstract of about 200 words.

Actual submission of papers will be done using the journal's submission system (see http://www.editorialmanager.com/topics/) by <deadline>March 1, 2010</deadline>.
