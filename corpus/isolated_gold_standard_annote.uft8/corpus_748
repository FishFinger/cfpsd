 			 FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

 			    NAACL-HLT 2010

      The 5th Workshop on the Innovative Use of NLP for Building
 		       Educational Applications

 		Los Angeles, California, USA; June 05 or 06, 2010

 	http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/naacl-bea5.html

 		 Submission Deadline: <deadline>March 01, 2010</deadline>




WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

NLP-based applications in educational environments continue to develop at a 
fast pace. Initial work began as early as the 1960s on evaluating open-ended 
assessments, text-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and proofreading 
tools. These fields continue to progress using innovative NLP techniques - 
statistical, rule-based, or some combination of the two. More recently, new 
technologies have made it possible to include speech in both assessment and 
ITS. From a somewhat different angle, NLP techniques are also being used to 
generate assessments and tools for curriculum development as well as tools to 
support assessment development. As a community we are improving existing 
capabilities, and identifying and generating innovative ways to use NLP in 
applications for writing, reading, speaking, critical thinking, and assessment 
development.

The need for, and the rapid development of, language-based capabilities have 
been driven by increased requirements for state and national assessments, and a 
growing population of foreign and second language learners. In the past ten 
years, steady growth in the area of NLP-based applications for education has 
prompted an increased number of workshops which typically focus on one specific 
aspect of NLP-based educational applications. In this workshop, we solicit 
papers from all subfields.

The workshops on the Innovative Use of NLP in Building Educational Applications 
have continued to bring together all these subfields to foster interaction and 
collaboration among researchers in both academic institutions and industry. 
Last year's workshop (NAACL/HLT 2009) was a banner year with a record number of 
submissions and attendees.  The 2010 workshop (consistent with previous 
workshops at ACL 1997, NAACL/HLT 2003, ACL 2005, ACL 2008, and NAACL/HLT 2009) 
will continue to expose the NLP research community to these technologies with 
the hope that they will continue to identify novel opportunities for the use of 
NLP techniques and tools in educational applications.

The workshop will include a demo session for accepted papers that involve a 
system.

Full paper and short paper topics will include, but will not be limited to, the 
following:

1) Automated scoring/evaluation for oral and written student responses
       * Content analysis for scoring/assessment
       * Grammatical error detection and correction
       * Discourse and stylistic analysis
       * Plagiarism detection
       * Machine translation for assessment, instruction and curriculum
         development


2) Intelligent Tutoring (IT) that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP methods
       * Dialogue systems in education
       * Hypothesis formation and testing
       * Multi-modal communication between students and computers
       * Generation of tutorial responses
       * Knowledge representation in learning systems
       * Concept visualization in learning systems

3) Learner cognition
       * Assessment of learnersÃ¢â¬â¢ language and cognitive skill levels
       * Systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or emotional
 	states
       * Tools for learners with special needs

4) Use of corpora in educational tools
       * Data mining of learner and other corpora for tool building
       * Annotation standards and schemas / annotator agreement

5) Tools for classroom teachers and/or test developers
       * NLP tools for second and foreign language learners
       * Semantic-based access to instructional materials to identify
         appropriate texts
       * Tools that automatically generate test questions Ã¢â¬â such as
 	multiple
         choice or short answer
       * Processing of and access to lecture materials across topics and
 	genres
       * Adaptation of instructional text to individual learners' grade
 	levels
       * E-learning tools for personalized course content
       * Language-based educational games

6) Issues concerning the evaluation of NLP-based educational tools


7) Descriptions of implemented systems


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of up to 8 pages in electronic, PDF 
format (with up to 1 additional page for references). This year, we also invite 
short papers of up to 4 pages (including references).  Papers which describe 
systems are also invited to give a demo of their system. If you would like to 
present a demo in addition to presenting the paper, please make sure to select 
either "full paper + demo" or "short paper + demo" in the START submission 
process.

Previously published papers cannot be accepted. The submissions will be
reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure 
that papers are anonymous.  Self-references that reveal the author's identity, 
e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use 
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

Please use the 2010 NAACL-HLT style sheet for composing your paper:
http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html

And use the following START conference page to submit your paper (link 
forthcoming, see website).
