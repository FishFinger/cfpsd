Our project is focused on the development of a typology of languages in
terms of their word-formation characteristics. We are looking for
morphologists who are willing to co-operate with us by completing a
questionnaire identifying typical features of a particular language.
Replies from experts in both well-known and exotic languages will be
appreciated.

Our questionnaire will be mailed to you by return.

Those who are interested in the project can contact Prof. Dr. Pavol

Meeting Description:

Call for Papers

Goal
The track on Trends in Natural Language Processing is a forum for researchers
working in natural language processing(NLP)/computational linguistics(CL) and
related areas. The rapid pace of development of online materials, most of them
in textual form or text combined with other media (visual, audio), has led to a
revived interest for tools capable to understand, organize and mine those
materials. Novel human-computer interfaces, for instance talking heads, can
benefit from language understanding and generation techniques with big impact on
user satisfaction. Moreover, language can facilitate human-computer interaction
for people with disabilities (no typing needed) and elderly leading to an ever
increasing user base for computer systems.

While papers and contributions on traditional basic and applied language
processing issues are welcome, the 2006 track will emphasize novel challenges to
the NLP/CL community: multilingual processing, learning environments, multimodal
communication, bioNLP, spam filtering, security, etc. We also encourage papers
in information retrieval, speech processing and machine learning that present
novel approaches that can benefit from or have an impact on NLP/CL.

Topics

We invite highly original papers that describe work in, but not limited to, the
following areas:

   1. NL-based Knowledge Representations and systems
   2. Lexical Semantics
   3. Syntax
   4. Semantics
   5. Coreference Resolution
   6. Word Sense Disambiguation
   7. Text Cohesion and Coherence
   8. Dialogue Management and Systems
   9. Language Generation
  10. Language Models
  11. Human Computer Interfaces - in particular multimodal human-computer
communication and language as the only acceptable human-computer communication
channel for handicapped and elderly
  12. Machine Learning applied to NL problems
  13. Multilingual Processing
  14. Standardization, Language Resources, Corpora Building and Annotation Languages
  15. NL in Learning Environments
  16. Semantic Web, Ontologies, Reasoning
  17. Applications: Machine Translation, Summarization, Intelligent Tutoring,
Question Answering, Information Extraction, etc.
  18. others

Submission Guidelines

INTRODUCTION

This volume is a series of articles focusing on theoretically defining how=
=20
output forms can be remodeled based on a paradigm within the Optimality=20
Theory model. Linguists working with morphologically complex languages,=20
especially their historical aspects, are all familiar with changes in word=
=20
forms showing the effects of "paradigm leveling" or "analogy" in=20
Neogramammarian terms. The challenge for modern theoretical linguists=20
has been how to consistently model these changes so that the data can be=20
accounted for without necessarily resorting to a series of ad hoc accounts.

One of the appeals of Optimality Theoretical accounts of=20
morphophonological phenomena is that it postulates that grammars include=20
a variety of competing constraints which, depending on which constraint=20
has priority, causes different output forms to be realized. An account of=
=20
paradigm leveling can be devised by invoking the notion of paradigm=20
identity constraints requiring forms to have similar forms outranking=20
competing phonological or phonetic constraints or outranking constraints=20
on preserving underlying original lexical input forms.

As this collection of papers show though, formulating the constraints so=20
that correct output forms are produced is still a complex task. Linguists=
=20
interested in the nature of morphological paradigms and issues of how=20
morphology and phonology interact will find in-depth discussions of a=20
variety of issues including how paradigms are defined, how base forms are=
=20
determined and how different constraint rankings change which output=20
forms win. These articles cover a wide range of languages including=20
Hebrew, Latin, Jita, English, Hungarian, Spanish and others. This volume=20
also includes theoretical articles by McCarthy and Kenstowicz.

SUMMARY (WITH SOME DISCUSSION)

The first article is the introduction by editors Laura Downing, T. Alan=20
Hall and Renate Raffelsieffen. The article provides an overview of how=20
paradigms in were analyzed in linguistic theory from 19th century on. For=
=20
much of the time, paradigms were viewed as peripheral or an=20
epiphenomenon in phonological analyses. Morphology was not ignored=20
altogether, as can be seen in the theory of lexical phonology, but some=20
paradigmatic effects were attributed to cyclic application of some=20
phonological rules interleaved with affixation. With the advent of Optimali=
ty=20
Theory, the relation of morphology and phonology was reevaluated and=20
Downing, Hall and Raffelsieffen identify several theoretical proposals. To=
=20
account for "cyclic effects", phonologists including Benua's=20
Transderivational Correspondence Theory (1997) proposed that=20
constraints could be evaluated recursively, thus replicating the interleavi=
ng=20
of phonology and affixation. Candidates showing cyclicity or paradigm=20
effects are said to be obeying a high order Output-Output Identity=20
constraint (O-O-Ident) requiring the base form to be the same in both=20
derived forms and underived forms. However this approach is questioned=20
by some, including McCarthy (Chapter 8, this volume) because rankings=20
must change between recursions to account for the forms, this diverging=20
from the OT parallelism requirement.

Another approach discussed in the introduction is a non-recursive Base-
Priority approach in which a morphologically complex form is evaluated=20
with one set of constraints, including one of a family of Output-Output (O-
O) identity constraints. Most of the papers in this volume use the Base=20
Priority approach in which individual forms are evaluated individually=20
against a base, or the related Symmetric approach (Kenstowicz, McCarthy=20
this volume) in which entire paradigms are evaluated together.=20
Interestingly, Base-Priority approaches do not require the output=20
correspondences to be always between a "non-derived" and "derived", but=20
can be between two derived forms such as a future and imperative form=20
(Bat El, Chapter 3, this volume). Thus , Downing et. al. note that more=20
leveling phenomena can be accounted for. A major theme, therefore, is=20
determining which form is the base used to evaluate other members of the=20
paradigm.

The second article "The Morphological Basis of Paradigm Leveling" Adam=20
Albright discusses paradigm leveling within one class of Latin nominal=20
declensions as exemplified in the change of /hono:s/ 'honor-NOM'=20
to /hono:r/, to be more consistent with oblique forms such=20
as /hono:ris/ 'honor-GEN'. Historically, the root for 'honor' was s-
final /hono:s-/  resulting in older forms like /hono:sis/ 'honor-GEN'. At=
=20
some point, Latin /s/ surfaced as /r/ in intervocalic position, causing=20
forms like /hono:sis/ to surface as /hono:ris/, while /hono:s/ 'honor-NOM'=
=20
remained unaffected. Thus this noun had two forms of a root in its=20
paradigm -- /hono:s/ (nominative) and /hon:or/ -- (all other forms). This=
=20
was leveled in favor of the -r form via a O-O-Ident constraint. The=20
question Albright asks is why the oblique -r form was chosen as a=20
candidate base. Intuitively, it has been known that oblique forms=20
(genitive, dative, etc) should be treated as the base form over nominative=
=20
forms; hence Albright notes that Latin paradigm leveling effects should=20
favor oblique forms. As evidence for favoring the oblique as the base over=
=20
the nominative, Albright provides statistical evidence from corpus studies=
=20
showing that oblique forms are more often written in texts than the=20
nominative. In addition, Albright points out that later Romance borrowings=
=20
like Spanish "noche" 'night', French "nuit" 'night' and Italian "notte" 'ni=
ght'=20
are descendents of the Latin oblique root  for night , "nocte" /nokte/ with=
=20
a /t/,  not the nominative "nox" /noks/ with no /t/. Finally, Albright note=
s, that=20
there are a variety of nouns in Latin where the oblique form cannot be=20
predicted from the nominative. As a minimal set, he mentions four=20
nominatives ending with -us which have differently formed obliques=20
("populus, populi" 'people', "corpus, corporis" 'body', /manus,=20
manu:s/ 'hand', "genus, generis" 'kind'). Based on statistical frequency an=
d=20
predictability across paradigms, Albright argues that Latin speakers=20
considered the oblique to be the true base, and favored for leveling effect=
s.

In the third article, "Competing Principles of Paradigm Uniformity:=20
Evidence From the Hebrew Imperative Paradigm," author Outi Bat-El=20
discusses the forms of modern Colloquial Hebrew imperatives in relation to=
=20
other members of the verb paradigm, in particular the future. Like other=20
Semitic languages, Hebrew verbal morphology is characterized by=20
combinations of a series of consonantal roots representing the verb lexeme=
=20
combined with different templates of vowels, affixes and truncations for=20
each verb form. Bat-El argues that the Hebrew imperatives are formed by=20
truncating the initial segments of a future form where ranked markedness=20
constraints determine how much is deleted. Hebrew verb tenses are=20
marked for gender, so the masculine future is truncated to form a=20
masculine imperative, while feminine futures are truncated to form a=20
feminine imperative. In some cases though, Bat-El argues that the=20
constraint hierarchy does not allow a winning candidate to surface from=20
truncation of the future. In these cases, if a masculine imperative can be=
=20
formed, then the feminine imperative will be formed from the masculine=20
future base plus a feminine marker. Therefore, there is competition in whic=
h=20
form will be used as a base. In Optimality terms, Bat-El analyzes this as=
=20
Existence (a form must be realized) outranking Structural  Identity (a form=
=20
uses the same base). However, if not even a masculine can be formed,=20
then no imperatives will be formed; that is Structural Identity out ranks=
=20
Existence in this case. To account for this paradoxical change in=20
ordering, Bat-El proposes that the future-imperative is a "sub-paradigm".=
=20
As long as one imperative can surface based on the future, then the=20
constraints allow both imperatives to be formed. Bat-El contrasts the=20
formation of the imperative in Colloquial Hebrew with Tiberian Hebrew. At=
=20
that stage, a number of markedness constraints prevent the imperative and=
=20
future form from surfacing with identical bases, However there are no gaps=
=20
in the Imperative, meaning Existence is respected throughout the entire=20
paradigm. In Colloquial Hebrew, Output-Output constraints prevent=20
alternate bases from surfacing, even if gaps are formed.

The next article is Luigi Burzio's "Sources of Paradigm Uniformity" which=
=20
focuses on the relationship on "closeness" of two related forms and the=20
tendency for paradigm leveling to occur. Bruzio gives the example of the=20
English word "larynx" /'l=E6r.Inks/ shows stress shift in the irregular=20
plural "larynges" /la.'rIn.jis/, but not in the regular plural "larynxes".=
=20
Similarly, Spanish inflected imperfect forms maintain consistent stress,=20
but exhibits stress shift in the infinitive (1). Note that in the case=20
of "am=E1bamus" 'we loved', the effects of paradigm levelling have caused=
=20
the stress to shift from the original position it had in Latin.

a'ma-bas 'you loved
a'm=E1-bamos 'we loved' < ama'ba:mus (Latin)
a'mar 'to love' < a'ma:re (Latin)
a'mable 'loveable'

The intuition is that forms which are semantically and=20
morphologically "closer" are more likely to show effects of paradigm=20
leveling. Burzio proposes that "closeness" can be calculated as a gradient=
=20
using Hebb's (1949) notion of entailment relationships between two items.=
=20
Criteria for determining whether entailments exist between forms are=20
closeness in meaning and sharing phonological (segmental/metrical)=20
material. Forms sharing a number of entailments, may be "attracted"=20
enough, in some cases the attraction is "strong" enough that paradigm=20
leveling may cause paradigm leveling where phonological information in=20
forms is made to be closer or even identical.

The next section is an OT account of English "Level 1" affixes (e.g. -ive)=
=20
differ from "Level 2" (e.g. -ness) affixes. I had some issues with this=20
portion of the discussion that I will discuss in the following paragraph.=
=20
The final section of the article returns to the issue of morphological=20
parameters for determining closeness. Burzio's view is that if forms are=20
close enough semantically, and share some phonological material, then=20
they may be attracted enough to cause paradigm leveling effects. One=20
criteria is whether two forms share the same part of speech. For instance,=
=20
the Spanish forms "amabas" 'you loved' and "am=E1bamu" " we loved' are=20
both imperfect inflected finite verbs, while the infinitive "amar" is a non=
-
finite verb and the related adjective "amable" 'loveable' are different=20
parts of speech. Therefore the attraction between finite verb forms would=
=20
be stronger, and more subject to paradigm leveling than between a non-
finite verb and an infinitive or adjective. Burzio also proposes that=20
marked categories may be more subject to paradigm leveling because they=20
contain more entailments that must be satisfied. As an example, Burzio=20
considers an Old English subjunctive paradigm that would [+subjunctive]=20
entailment links missing indicative paradigm. As a result, Burzio a=20
subjunctive form might be more liable to paradigm leveling, and that does=
=20
appear to be a general linguistic trend.

As mentioned before, the middle portion of Burzio's article is an analysis=
=20
of English Level 1 affixes that cause vowel changes and stress shifts=20
versus Level 2 affixes which do not change the stem. His basic analysis is=
=20
that because words ending with Level 1 affixes are semantically irregular,=
=20
the entailments between forms are weakened to the point where additional=20
phonological processes and alternate roots can override an OO constraint=20
for stems. A corollary that Burzio proposes that "Level 1" affixes which=20
cause stem changes change the stem to a less phonologically marked=20
form. An example cited by Burzio is that a regular past tense=20
like "weeped" /wi:pt/ contains a marked combinationo of /i/ plus /pt/=20
which are normally found ONLY in derived roots. This -ipt cluster is=20
allowed only because OO constraints or entailments between "weep"=20
and "weeped" force the root to be the same. In contrast, the irregular=20
plural "wept" /wEpt/ contains the less marked /Ept/ cluster (also found in=
=20
underived "sept"). As I interpret this article, Burzio is predicting that=
=20
Level 1 rules cause forms to surface in a less marked form than a Level 2=
=20
affix would.

Yet there are counterexamples of "Level 1" (or irregular) affixes creating=
=20
more marked clusters, not less marked. For instance, Welsh has a number=20
of plural affixes, the most regular of which is probably "-(i)au" as in the=
=20
English borrowing "iard" /yard/, plural "iardiau" /yardye/. Welsh also=20
contains a number of stem changing plurals where vowels change between=20
the singular and plural. One pattern is a change of  the diphthong "ia" /ya=
/=20
in the singular to the triphthong "iei" /yey/ in the plural as in=20
Welsh "iarll" /yarL/ 'earl' to plural "ieirll" /yeyrL/. Historically, this=
=20
is a preservation of a fronting rule triggered by Proto Celtic plural /i/=
=20
which was deleted in later states, The synchronic result is a cluster=20
which is marked because it is a triphthong closed by two liquids. Note=20
that all other derived forms of "iarll" (iarlles 'countess', pl. iarllesau,=
=20
iarllwaed 'noble blood', show the same stem as singular "iarll." In additio=
n,=20
there are very few cases of "ieir"clusters in underived forms; most are=20
derived from "iar" singulars=20
(e.g. "patriarch" 'patriarch', "patrieruch" 'patriarchs'=20
(regular "patriarchau" is also attested). Whatever analysis is given to=20
this plural formation, it would be difficult to argue that the "iei"=20
cluster is less marked than "ia". These facts suggest that "Level 1"=20
alternations effects cannot all be derived  from phonological markedness=20
constraints within the synchronic grammar. Note that all Welsh data is=20
available in the Concise Welsh Language Dictionary/Geriadur Prifysgol=20
Cymru (2004).

Another question I had with the article was that I was not able to=20
determine a reliable method for predicting "closeness". For instance,=20
how "close" would two forms have to be in order for paradigm leveling=20
effects to occur? It seems reasonable that a verb and a nominal=20
(e.g. "compel/compulsive") would have enough semantic distance to not be=20
subject to paradigm leveling, but what about irregular inflected forms=20
such as "keep/kept"). Burzio's article did not appear to have any kind of=
=20
principle predicting the maintenance of irregular inflected forms (other=20
than possible cases of phonological markedness). If anything, one might=20
predict that common verbs and nouns are LESS likely to be irregular=20
because of semantic closeness. Instead they are MORE likely to be=20
irregular. One criterion could be that irregulars have different=20
phonological roots, and therefore are not as "close," but this to means=20
seems circular. Irregulars are not as close because they are irregular=20
forms. I feel this is an interesting conceptualization, but I was not sure=
=20
how to apply it to other data.

The next article, Start Davis's "Capitalistic" vs "Militaristic": The=20
paradigm Uniformity Effect Reconsidered" is an extensive review of=20
Steriade (2000) in which she notes that "militaristic" has an aspirated=20
[th] in he stem while "capitalistic" has a flap [D]. Steriade originally=20
argues that "capitalistic" is regular and that "militaristic" preserves=20
the [th] due to paradigm optimization with "military". However, Davis=20
examines other English data and argues that "militaristic" is actually the=
=20
regular form, while "capitalistic" is preserving the foot structure=20
of "capital". Davis presents a series of words in which the voiceless=20
stops are aspirated despite that fact that they are non-word initial, not=
=20
the beginning of a foot and in stressless syllables. Some of these include=
=20
(2):

(2) English words with aspirated stops in unstressed syllables.
Medi[th]erranan
Winne[ph]egosis
Nebu[kh]adnezzar

Since these are underived words, a paradigm leveling account could not=20
account for the aspirated vowels. Instead Davis argues that these weak=20
syllables are adjoined to the following two-syllable foot to create=20
a "super foot" of three syllables. He uses data for expletive insertion to=
=20
show that "fucking" can be inserted before or after the target syllables.=
=20
According to this analysis, the initial /t/ "mili[th]aristic" is aspirated=
=20
by regular phonology. However, "capi[D]alistic" (derived "capital") does=20
not show aspiration. Davis notes that the /t/ in "capital" cannot be=20
adjoined into a super foot because only syllable follows it; therefore=20
the /t/ is a flap. In "capi[D]alistic", Davis argues that this foot=20
structure is preserved, causing a flap to surface. The analysis of=20
aspiration does seem to match both the data and my native speaker=20
intuition, but interestingly, this is one case where a traditional cyclic=
=20
analysis might work. It's also striking that Davis argues for a paradigm=20
relationship between "capital" and "capitalistic" (with a Level 1 affix)=20
whereas Burzio would argue that the relationship would be more distant so=
=20
that paradigm leveling might not be predicted.

In the sixth article, "Jita Causative Doubling Provides Optimal=20
Paradigms"., Laura J. Downing discusses a phenomenon in the Bantu=20
language Jita where the causative marker /y/ is attached to all affixes as=
=20
in "oku-gus-i:s-y-an-y-a" "to sell to each other" (lit: cause each other to=
=20
buy) where /y/ appears after the root "gus" (as /i:/) and again before the=
=20
reciprocative and benefactive suffixes. Downing examines older cyclic=20
analyses and autosegmental floating analyses before arguing that=20
causative /y/ can be displaced via special alignment constraints and that=
=20
doubling is a way to optimize the output of causative forms.

Article seven, "Paradigmatic Uniformity and Contrast" by Michael=20
Kenstowicz gives an overview of different types of paradigm leveling=20
effects that can be found in data from a variety of languages. In=20
particular, he distinguishes paradigm effects which cause forms to surface=
=20
in a more phonologically similar manner, and paradigm effects which=20
ensure that different members of a paradigm have distinct forms. An=20
example of paradigm effects making forms more similar can be found in=20
Spanish diminutive formation. Spanish diminutives are typically formed with=
=20
the ending "-it(o/a)" (3a), but the ending surfaces as -"cit(o/a)" when the=
=20
root ends with a consonant. (3b)

(3a)
libro    'book'             librito    'little book'
lavadora 'washing machine'  lavadorita 'little washing machine'.

(3b)
balcon 'balcony'  balconcito 'little balcony'
amor   'love'     amorcito   'little love'

For some nouns though, if the masculine ends in a consonant, both the=20
masculine and feminine counterparts surface with "-cit(o/a)" even if the=20
feminine ends with a vowel. For instance masculine "ladron" 'thief' has a=
=20
diminutive "ladroncito", but the feminine "ladrona" also has=20
diminutive "ladroncita" instead of predicted "ladronita." Kenstowicz=20
proposes that a high ranking ParadigmUniformity constraint forces=20
feminine "ladroncita" to surface in parallel to masculine "ladroncito".=20
The paradigm effects forces the forms to be more similar.

In contrast, Kenstowicz presents a number of cases from Slavic=20
declensions where paradigm effects appear to block cases where two=20
forms would surface in the same form. An example is the Trigad dialect of=
=20
Bulgarian where unstressed /o/ is normally reduced to /a/ (4a). However,=20
this is blocked in the neuter singular /o/ whenever the counterpart plural=
=20
ends with unstressed /a/ (4b).

(4a) d[=F3]zhd ~ d[a]zhd=F3m
(4b)=20
z=F3rn-o  (*z=F3rna) 'seed.sg' ~ z=F3rn-a 'seeds'
bl=E1g-o (*bl=E1ga) 'blessing' ~ bl=E1ga 'blessings'

Kenstowicz proposes that a high ranking Paradigm Contrast constraint=20
keeps these two forms apart. If the /o/ to /a/ reduction had applied as=20
expected, the singular and plural of "zorno/zorna" 'seed' would have=20
merged into one form "zorna". This is an excellent article, and in some=20
ways I wish it had been the first. It clearly lays out what kinds of=20
paradigm effects can be found and what some of the theoretical=20
implications might be. The article also notes that much more work in this=
=20
area of analysis is needed.

The eighth article, "Optimal Paradigms," by John McCarthy is a theoretical=
=20
article in which McCarthy proposes an Optimal Paradigm (OP) algorithm in=20
which all members of a paradigm are evaluated jointly for faithfulness=20
with each other. McCarthy first reviews other approaches and presents=20
theoretical arguments  for rejecting them. For instance. McCarthy argues=20
that  base priority approach like Transderivational Correspondence Theory=
=20
(TCT) (Benua 1997) cannot work for consonantal root languages like=20
Arabic because no "root" can be identified, yet he argues that paradigm=20
effects can still be found McCarthy also rejects Universal Exponence  (UE)=
=20
(Kenstowicz 1996), because it overpredicts that derived forms can affect=20
base forms (and McCarthy notes that there is little evidence for this=20
occurring in linguistic data).

Instead McCarthy hopes to combine the best of both approaches into his=20
Optimal Paradigm (OP) approach by evaluating all candidates of a=20
paradigm together for Input-Output and Output- Output constraints. That is,=
=20
candidates would consist of entire hypothetical paradigms where OP=20
violations would be counted as one violation per form (5).

(5) Arabic Verbal Paradigm Candidates (@ =3D schwa, sh =3D alvelo-palatal=
=20
fricative)
UR: /sh@erb/+ {t,na,ti,tu,u,@t}

Candidate 1: sh@rbt, shr@bt, shr@bna, shr@bti, shr@btu, sh@rbu,=20
sh@rb@t
Candidate 2: sh@rbt, shr@bt, shr@bna, shr@bti, shr@btu, shr@bu,=20
shr@b@t

McCarthy defines an inflectional paradigm as containing "all and only the=
=20
words based on a single lexeme" and specifically assumes they are "flat"=20
although does allow for the possibility of "subparadigms." perhaps similar=
=20
to those argued for in Hebrew by Bat El (same volume). Other factors=20
proposed by McCarthy include "majority rules" and attraction to the=20
unmarked favoring leveling in favor of less marked segments. To provide=20
empirical examples, McCarthy discusses several cases from Arabic verbal=20
morphology.

In the ninth article, "Paradigm Uniformity Effects Versus Boundary
Effects", Renate Raffelsiefen reviews English data where morphologically
complex words may have different phonological properties and phonotactic
constraints than those of simple words. The goal of this article is to=20
distinguish boundary effects from paradigm uniformity effects and propose=
=20
a set of criteria for distinguishing between boundary effects and paradigm=
=20
leveling.

Article Ten, "Uniformity and Contrast in the Hungarian Verbal paradigm" by=
=20
Peter Rebrus and Miklos Torkenczy discusses the relation of two families=20
of paradigm constraints and how they interact in some Hungarian verbal=20
paradigms. The first, PAR, is a constraint specifying that the forms of=20
stems and endings remain constant throughout a paradigm; the second,=20
CON specifies that each member of the paradigm be phonologically=20
distinct. One phenomenon discussed by the authors are "anti-harmony"=20
effects in Hungarian suffixes. Hungarian suffixes normally harmonize with=
=20
the stem vowel in terms of backness, but the harmony appears to be=20
blocked in some cases. Rebrus and Torkenczy argue that anti-harmony=20
occurs because harmonic affixes might create homophonous forms in some=20
paradigms; thus harmony is blocked when contrast in person and number=20
might be lost.

The other phenomenon Rebrus and Torkenczy discuss the definite versus=20
indefinite contrast in the Hungarian present indicative which disappears=20
in the past (i.e. only forms corresponding to the definite surface, but=20
can be either definite or indefinite). To account for this, the authors=20
propose that the CON(Person/Number) (Contrast in person and number) is=20
ranked higher than CON(Definiteness). In cases where homophony might=20
occur, such as in the past tense, the definiteness distinction is lost so=
=20
that PAR(Person/Number) and CON (Person/Number) can be satisfied.=20
Although this analysis is consistent, I wonder if another analysis for the =
loss=20
of the definiteness distinction might also be valid. The Distributed=20
Morphology framework (Halle and Marantz 1994) proposes=20
that "peripheral" features may be deleted when the feature bundles=20
become too complex; this process is called Impoverishment. For instance,=20
many Indo-European languages like English show gender in third person=20
singular pronouns (he/she/it), but lose gender in plurals (they) and non-
third person forms (I/you/we). The Hungarian case where a peripheral=20
feature of definiteness is lost in non-present tenses could be a similar=20
phenomenon.

The final article is "A Note on Paradigm Uniformity and Priority of the=20
Root," by Suzanne Urbanczyk which analyzes data from verb paradigms in=20
Halkomelem, a Salish language of British Columbia using McCarthy's (this=20
volume) mechanism of comparing outputs across a paradigm. Like other=20
Salish languages, the root vowel of Halkomelem verb stems is reduced to=20
schwa, particularly in cases where a CVC root is followed by a CVC suffix.=
=20
In perfective stems though, all forms surface with a schwa, even if the=20
ending is not CVC. Urbanczyk argues that this pattern of overapplication=20
is a result of a high ranking identity constraint requiring all members of=
=20
a paradigm to have the same base form, even if results in marked reduced=20
vowels in the stem. Urbanczyk also discusses the formation of the=20
imperfective root from the perfective via reduplication. In other Salish=20
languages, the imperfective reduplication preserves any schwa from the=20
perfective, but in Halkomelem, the reduplicated syllable surfaces with the=
=20
underlying root vowel. Urbanczyk's proposes that the root vowel is allowed=
=20
to surface as phonologically expected because the imperfective paradigm=20
is distinct from the perfective, so the paradigm uniformity constraint does=
=20
not apply in this case.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

This volume is a valuable addition to the research into the morphology-
phonology interface. The data comes from a wide range of languages and=20
all of them present serious challenges to any standard derivational theory.=
=20
Paradigm effects appear to be a major family of constraints much like=20
faithfulness and markedness. But as most authors of this volume would=20
admit, the challenge is to provide a consistent account across all=20
languages. One issue is determining the "scope" of paradigm effects. Do=20
they apply only within inflectional paradigms (McCarthy) or across=20
derivational forms (Davis)? Do complex inflectional paradigms have an=20
internal structure (Burzio, BatEl) or are they flat (McCarthy)? With=20
questions like these, future researchers will have plenty of analytical=20
articles to write.

INTRODUCTION

Aspect in Mandarin Chinese (henceforth AMC) is a corpus-based investigation
of both situation and viewpoint aspects in Mandarin Chinese. In addition to
theoretical considerations of a broad variety of issues related to aspect
in Mandarin, it provides many examples and descriptive statistics about the
use of aspect in Mandarin Chinese. This work is based on the Ph.D. thesis
of the first author, supervised by the second author from Lancaster
University (defended in 2002). It is composed of seven chapters. In this
review, summaries of each chapter are given in section 2, followed by my
comments and evaluations in section 3.

CHAPTER SUMMARIES

Chapter 1 Introduction: Chapter One, as an introduction, reviews the notion
"aspect" in the literature and discusses previous approaches to it. Xiao
and McEnery (henceforth X&M) explicates the methodology undertaken in this
monograph--to complement traditional intuition-based approaches with a
corpus-based approach. The authors used The Weekly Corpus (comprised of
texts from a Chinese newspaper published in the year of 1995 in Southern
China). This corpus is small in size, containing 125,825 Chinese characters
(p.6). They also used the Freiburg-LOB Corpus of British English for
English data, and the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese for the
English-Chinese translation data. X&M provide a "two-component model of
aspect in Mandarin Chinese (p.10)." The two components refer to situation
aspect (e.g. event types and telicity) and viewpoint aspect (e.g.
perfectives, imperfectives, etc.). This model summarizes the structure of
the rest of the book. Chapter 2 discusses the model; Chapter 3 discusses
situation aspect; Chapters 4 and 5 discuss viewpoint aspect. Chapter 6
contrasts between aspect in Chinese and English. Chapter 7 is a summary of
the findings.

Chapter 2 Two-Component Aspect Theory: Chapter Two discusses definitional
problems to the notion of aspect in previous research. X&M follow Smith
(1991, 1997) distinguishing situation and viewpoint aspects as two separate
notions to be studied. Situation aspect refers to "the classification of
verbs and situations according to their temporal features" including
"dynamicity", "durativity" and "telicity" (p.21). Viewpoint aspect refers
to the perfective/imperfective distinction, which is usually imposed on top
of verbs. 

Chapter 3 Situation Aspect: This chapter discusses the event construction
that is inherent to the verbs. Eventuality is suggested to compose in two
levels: the lexical level and the sentential level. The lexical level is
further decomposed into three layers--"nucleus, core, and clause" based on
van Valin's proposal in Role and Reference Grammar. It is proposed that the
aspectuality classification system applies to both levels, and that there
are "rules that map verb classes at the lexical level onto situation types
at the sentential level (p.33)."

This chapter has detailed discussion of the descriptive system for
situation aspect including features such as [+/-dynamic], [+/-durative],
[+/-telic], [+/-result], and [+/-bounded]. These features are used to
describe traditional verbal classes such as accomplishments, achievements,
activities, states (individual and stage levels) and semelfactives. The
authors also look into the implications among the features regarding
unattested gaps.

In sections 3.4 and 3.5, the authors discuss different levels of event
composition, including the lexical level and the sentential level. The
lexical level is divided into the nucleus level (similar to the predicate
level), the core level (predicates plus arguments), and the clause level
(predicates plus arguments and non-arguments). Twelve rules are proposed to
derive eventuality from a core verb to a clause. Then the authors describe
how different situation types at the sentential level can be distinguished
using the feature system.

Chapter 4 The Perfective Aspects in Chinese: This chapter discusses the
perfectivity of four constructions in Mandarin: actual aspect with LE,
experiential aspect with GUO, delimitative aspect with REDuplication, and
completive aspect with Resultative Verb Compounds (RVCs). The two LEs (the
actual LE and the change-of-state LE) are first distinguished. Each
subsection discusses the perfective aspects regarding how they interact
with verbs of different situation types, and their properties of
holisticity and dynamicity. Corpus frequencies of different verb classes
and perfective markers are provided in each subsection of the chapter.

Chapter 5 The Imperfective Aspects in Chinese: This chapter discusses four
imperfective markers in Mandarin--ZHE, ZAI, QILAI and XIAQU. They are
discussed in terms of holisticity and dynamicity. ZHE is described as a
durative marker; ZAI, a progressive marker; QILAI, an inceptive marker, and
XIAQU, a continuative marker. Frequencies of different situation types that
take these markers in the corpus are provided.

Chapter 6 Aspect Marking in English and Chinese: This chapter is a
crosslinguistic comparison of aspect uses in English and Chinese. The
authors consider situation aspect to be universal, and therefore focus on
the language-specificity of VIEWPOINT aspect in different languages. The
approach adopted is to look at aspect uses in English texts and their
Chinese translations. Frequency counts and examples of corresponding
translations are provided in each section. Different text types are also
shown to demonstrate distinct uses of aspectual expressions.

Chapter 7 From the Study of Aspect to Contrastive Grammar: This chapter is
a summary of the major findings. It emphasizes the methodological advantage
of the corpus-based approach, and its contributions to Chinese linguistics
and aspect theory in general.

EVALUATION

RECAPITULATION OF THE MAJOR CLAIMS
This work aims at being the first attempt to study aspect from both a
theory-driven approach and a corpus-driven approach. The corpus evaluations
of theoretical claims are suggested to make the accounts more "realistic."
It proposes a two-component model, looking at both situation and viewpoint
aspects in Chinese. It provides detailed descriptions of event composition
at different levels. After presenting data of both levels and from English
and Chinese, it is suggested that situation aspect is a semantic notion,
while viewpoint aspect is a grammatical notion. The former is more
universal while the latter is language-specific.

STRENGTHS AND MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS
This is a work with great ambitions. The attempt to marry the theoretical,
intuition-based approaches with corpus data is respectable. The scope of
discussion on Chinese aspect is comprehensive. It proposes a model of
aspect as a route map for the whole book, then explores each component of
the model in great detail. This proposed model covers both situation aspect
and viewpoint aspect, which in previous literature have often been treated
separately. The authors provide detailed reviews and discussions of the
semantic features (such as dynamicity, result, boundedness, etc.) they
adopted to describe events. They have also provided detailed frequency
distributions obtained from corpora regarding what situation types co-occur
with which viewpoint aspects. It is worth noting that statives are divided
into individual-levels and stage-levels and discussed separately
throughout. This uncovers the many distinct behaviors of the two kinds of
statives and is a great contribution. The coverage of different viewpoint
aspects in Mandarin Chinese is very extensive. In addition to the
frequently discussed aspect markers such as LE, GUO, ZHE, ZAI, it includes
verbal reduplication and resultative compounds in the perfective section,
and QILAI and XIAQU in the imperfective section. This book-length study of
Chinese aspect has extended the scope of our knowledge. The use of corpus
data is a worthy attempt.

CRITICAL COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS
While X&M's work is extensive in demonstrating realistic data from the
corpus to verify previous theoretical claims, they have not provided a work
that is ambitious on the theoretical side. The two-level model seems more
like a classification system than a theory of aspect that has predictive
power. With interesting data presented, the readers are left with a desire
to know more about WHY. Why do certain semantic features compose into
certain situation types? Why do we arrive at a certain event when certain
viewpoint aspects are added? Why does the same aspect marker (LE for
example) arrive at different eventuality when it occurs with verbs of
different situation types? Is there a unified explanation for the different
semantic compositions? It would be nice if X&M had dug further to make
their descriptions more explanatory.

In this book, the authors often give more descriptions than explanations.
The twelve rules provided in the section on situation aspect (3.4) are
purely descriptive. For example, Rule 4 in the core-level composition is a
descriptive translation of the facts, with a flat syntactic structure:

Rule 4: NP + Verb[-telic] + NP => Core[-telic] (p.64)

The event compositions with different arguments are represented as
independent rules (e.g. rules 3, 4, & 5). These rules have not captured the
fact that event composition is hierarchically structured. Compositionality
works by first computing the telicity of the verb and its internal
argument(s), and then the external arguments, and then the adjuncts. This
negligence has led to the rules being flat and not capturing the patterns
of compositionality level by level.

The discussion of the lexical level of situation aspect follows the three
levels proposed by van Valin (forthcoming). However, it is unclear why
these levels should be distinguished in X&M's model of aspect. A different
(and more interesting) pursuit is to look for the commonality of event
composition in these different levels and distinguish the levels only when
it is justified; that is, only when empirical data show that eventuality is
composed differently in different levels should we see them as distinct.
The same critique extends to the distinction between the lexical and
sentential levels of composition.

The crosslinguistic comparison using a translation corpus is a novel
attempt. However, that chapter (Chapter 6) is replete with numbers and
descriptions, but not enough explanations. The readers may easily get lost
without seeing the big picture.

In addition to the explanatory inadequacies, certain typological
generalizations that the authors made were not justified. X&M claims that
"situation aspect is basically a cognitive-semantic concept while viewpoint
aspect is a grammatical concept (p.30)." This claim, though repeated
several times in the monograph (e.g. in Chapter 6--p.245), has not been
clearly justified. Both situation and viewpoint aspects have their semantic
and syntactic dimensions. If we look at the composition of situation aspect
at the level of the verb and its arguments, it is syntactic.
(Compositionality is itself syntactic in nature.) The viewpoint aspect,
though overtly indicated by aspect markers, also has to be interpreted
semantically. The semantic vs. grammatical distinction of situation and
viewpoint aspects is the result of the authors using more semantic notions
to describe situation aspect and more syntactic notions for the viewpoint
aspect. This is the result of their methodological artifact rather than of
any inherent differences between the two.

SOME MINOR COMMENTS
1. The features chosen to distinguish different situation types are not of
the same nature. Why are these features chosen (apart from the fact that
they were often mentioned in previous literature)? Does the inclusion of
these features of very different natures in one theory unnecessarily
complicate the explanation? For instance, [result] is inherently a
causative notion which is very different from [dynamic]. Should they be
discussed in one single account?

2. In 3.4.2, the discussion of event composition of verbs and their nominal
arguments, the NPs were only considered on the basis of [+/-count]. In
fact, the plurality of the NPs can also affect the telicity of the
predicates. For example, "I ate a cookie" sounds more telic than "I ate 60
cookies" since you can more easily add "for 10 minutes" to the latter than
to the former. This [plurality] dimension is missing in the discussion,
since the NPs are both [+count].

3. Some of the rules discussed in 3.4 involve coercion (Rule 8 & Rule 10).
Coercion is a different semantic process, and should be treated separately
from the other rules which are purely based on syntactic-semantic composition.

4. In Chapter 3, a general theory on the different functions of LE is still
missing. Why does LE mean differently in different cases? Is there a
unified account?

5. On p.200, the authors discussed the interchangeability of ZHE and LE. In
fact, these cases do not show that ZHE and LE are interchangeable. They
just show that ZHE and LE can both be used to describe different aspects of
the same event. We use different linguistic devices to describe the same
scenes all the time. This does not mean these devices should have anything
in common. Therefore, the discussion in 5.1.7 does not seem necessary.

OVERALL EVALUATION
This work contributes to our understanding of Chinese aspect by providing
abundant corpus data, comprehensive reviews and discussions of various
issues related to aspect and eventuality. Students of Chinese aspect and
eventuality will be inspired by this contribution.

The present volume on standard and variation in German, with the=20
provocative subtitle of how much variation the German language can=20
tolerate is the 2004 edition of the yearbook of the 'Institut f=FCr Deutsch=
e=20
Sprache' (IDS) and was published on the occasion of its fortieth annual=20
conference. Edited by Ludwig Eichinger and Werner Kallmeyer, the book=20
amply illustrates current research paradigms in German dialectology,=20
sociolinguistics and applied linguistics from a variety of contrasting but=
=20
complementary standpoints. From conceptual approximations to historical=20
motivations, from formal linguistic categorizations to social identity=20
formations, from pedagogical deliberations to German studies abroad, the=20
collection of articles clearly demonstrates that variation has made its=20
way into the sphere of the German standard language, leaving behind its=20
formerly marginalized position of non-standard. The following paragraphs=20
aim at briefly summarizing the different contributions to this volume,=20
that is, the different answers its authors are suggesting with respect to=
=20
the overarching question of how much variation the German language can=20
accommodate.

In the first chapter, Heinrich L=F6ffler explores the various concepts=20
related to the degrees of standardization of the German language with=20
respect to their usefulness for contemporary language description.=20
Starting out from the traditionally used hierarchical=20
standard/colloquialism/dialect divide and moving on to the continuum of=20
standard/sub-standard/non-standard, he emphasizes the highly complex=20
character of the multiple, overlapping and fluctuating categories that=20
have been suggested by different contemporary linguists. Given the=20
dynamics of linguistic and societal developments with the resulting=20
impossibility of stable, unambiguous and clear-cut definitions, the author=
=20
instead proposes operational definitions for the terms of standard and=20
variation that would allow for empirically based decisions on whether=20
certain variations should be considered as falling inside or outside the=20
ever expanding scope of standard language. In this way, L=F6ffler rejects=
=20
prescriptive dogmatism in favor of a pragmatic approach to variation both=
=20
within and beyond standard German.

These terminological quagmires are also at the heart of Ulrich Ammon's=20
deliberations on the characteristics of standard and (diatopic) variation.=
=20
Presupposing the recognition of national and regional variation of the=20
German language, the author focuses on the sometimes neglected distinction=
=20
between standard and norm. He suggests four instances of normative=20
entities - model speakers, language codices, language experts and language=
=20
authorities - reminding us that the existence, validity and legitimacy of=
=20
a norm should also be viewed as separate notions. Ammon thus joins L=F6ffle=
r=20
in his emphasis on the multi-layered dimensions of the question and=20
prefers drawing a comprehensive picture to laying down hard and fast rules=
=20
for the standard-variation decision.

After these two macro perspectives on the issue, Susanne G=FCnther's=20
contribution delves into the pragmatics of grammar variation at the=20
example of two traditional verb final, i.e. subordinating conjunctions=20
that seem to be developing into verb second, i.e. coordinating=20
conjunctions in current spoken German, 'obwohl' and 'wobei'. G=FCnther make=
s=20
a case for regarding this phenomenon as an example of standard variation=20
since it entails a change in function for these conjunctions. As corpus=20
studies have demonstrated a clear increase in the use of these forms, the=
=20
author suggests a potential scenario for language change and recommends=20
them as accepted variations also within the context of teaching German as=
=20
a second language.

This pro-variation stance is also salient in the following article by=20
Stephan Elspass, who challenges traditional top-down approaches to the=20
history of the German language that are based on an unattainable, elitist,=
=20
written standard. Drawing on a wide range of examples, Elspass furthermore=
=20
questions the notion of a finished German standard of the latter 19th=20
century. Instead, he proposes a bottom-up history of the German language=20
that would be truly generalized, featuring oral regional standard=20
varieties, the notion of acceptance (Haugen, 1994), and contemporary=20
phenomena of linguistic development.

The general tendencies of a current development with a potential for=20
language change, destandardization, are discussed by Helmut Spiekerman in=
=20
the next chapter. Based on corpus data from SW Germany comparing phonetic=
=20
variation between the years of 1961 and 2001, the author describes two=20
parallel trends, regional standardization and national destandardization.=
=20
While dialectal forms seem to be decreasing, non-standard non-regional=20
variations seem to be more widely used and thus maybe gain more acceptance=
=20
in the future. While a clear-cut case for language change cannot be made=20
due to ambivalent developments for more regional variants, Spiekerman's=20
data support the general bottom-up trend of destandardization and a more=20
heterogeneous standard language.

Beyond the written-oral dichotomy of standardization, Peter Schlobinski=20
frames 'destandardization' in the context of new media. The synchronous=20
character of hypermedia together with its typical combination of image,=20
sound and text requires a new variation of communication - a hybrid that=20
is not a lesser form of standard language but a purposefully optimized=20
functional variation. At the example of internet chat and SMS=20
communication, Schlobinski describes a variety of discursive patterns that=
=20
characterize this new variation. According to the author, these phenomena=
=20
should be seen as parallel developments and not necessarily as threats to=
=20
conventional written language.

Returning to the realm of spoken German, Nina Berend charts the territory=
=20
for a new research project on the description of regional standards of=20
use. Based on phonetic, syntactic, morphological and lexical regional=20
variation from a corpus collected in the 1970s by Werner K=F6nig, Berend=20
suggests four major zones of spoken standard German: north, central, south-
east and south-west. With a learner of German in mind and in keeping with=
=20
Durrell's (1999) principles of formal vs. informal standard, the author=20
calls for a paradigm shift in the description of standard language and an=
=20
applied linguistics focus that would result in the production of=20
empirically grounded, inclusive, current works of reference.

Bottom-up language change through youth language is another path to=20
language variation compatible with a contemporary view of standard=20
language. For the purpose of documenting this process, Jannis=20
Androutsopoulos suggests a model of language change that combines an=20
accommodation and network-oriented micro approach with a media-oriented=20
macro approach developed by Kotsinas (1997). Based on a newspaper corpus,=
=20
the author illustrates his point at the example of 'cool', 'geil'=20
and 'chillen', lexical items that have made their way into main-stream=20
journalistic jargon beyond the realm of specialized genres like music,=20
sports, young people.

As with the above examples, much of lexical innovation originating in the=
=20
youth stratum,, tends to migrate over from the English speaking sphere of=
=20
influence. Within this larger scope, Ulrich Busse discusses pronunciation=
=20
dilemmas for English loan words in the German language. Depending on the=20
type of word, the speaker's linguistic background, and the context of use=
=20
(e.g., the media), a more English or more German oriented pronunciation=20
may be chosen. In this context, Busse refers the reader to the critical=20
issue of "standard" English and the need for specific inclusion of=20
phonetic variation in works of reference.

Switching back to grammatical variation, the following contribution by=20
Richard Schrodt illustrates the case of lack of subject-verb agreement.=20
While some prescriptive grammar manuals tend to be restrictive in this=20
matter, Schrodt argues that an UG-inspired approach that keeps in mind=20
thematic rather than grammatical agreement would support a speaker-
mediated decision. Term quality, subjectivity and pragmatics are key words=
=20
that help frame this discursive approach to a seemingly formal linguistic=
=20
cause. Once more we are faced with a paradigm shift in the direction of=20
greater inclusiveness bolstered by a range of examples from a variety of=20
textual sources.

In a regional study on citylects, Margret Selting examines yet another=20
potential lieu of variation, intonational contours. Comparing Berlin=20
speech with standard German intonational patterns and, furthermore,=20
variations within Berlin speech of more or less standard character,=20
Selting finds variations in the timing of pitch summit, in accent=20
contours, in the structure of intonational phrases and in salient overall=
=20
intonational contours. Even though, at this point, the study has a=20
geographically limited focus, the results from the large-scale project on=
=20
dialect intonations that is currently being undertaken should provide some=
=20
interesting comparative data.

In the following chapter, J=FCrgen Erich Schmidt examines the different=20
normative levels of the German language. Based on the premise of Standard=
=20
German as one (literary) variety with three different oral norms (Austria,=
=20
Germany, and Switzerland), Schmid suggests three levels of areality within=
=20
and across these normative boundaries: trained speaker, colloquial=20
standard and regional accent. Empirical studies seem to coincide with such=
=20
a theory-based drawing of standard boundaries due to the saliency factor=20
of areal markers. Schmid thus proposes delimiting standard German based on=
=20
this factor and the concept of full variety, coinciding at the same time=20
with the variation awareness of lay speakers.

A view from across the border, presented by Peter Bassola from the=20
Hungarian perspective, suggests a methodological approach to the teaching=
=20
of the varieties of the German language. Bassola makes a case for=20
functional inclusion of variation according to level of schooling with a=20
view to combining language and content in the pursuit of=20
bilingual/bicultural identities. Language for specific purposes with its=20
intralingual (Austria and Germany) and interlingual (Hungarian-German)=20
variation would then be embedded in a comprehensive framework of=20
variation, history and culture.

Another view from across the border, comparing approaches to variation in=
=20
German and English, has Stephen Barbour comment on communicative=20
interferences between English-speaking learners of German and German-
speaking learners of English. Different concepts of norm (prescriptive=20
versus descriptive) and new learner varieties, German English in this=20
case, that is, English words used by Germans in non-English ways, can=20
create invisible barriers in seemingly germane linguistic contexts. The=20
author thus strongly recommends a language in society approach to language=
=20
teaching from the beginning levels onwards.

In the third contribution concerning German studies abroad, Marisa Siguan=
=20
portrays the language policy interplay between Spanish and Catalan and its=
=20
effect on the teaching of German philology in Barcelona. Juxtaposing=20
Spanish as a language with a long normative history and Catalan as a=20
language which is still undergoing standardization while maintaining and=20
extraordinary openness toward variation, Siguan considers this=20
constellation fertile ground for variation awareness, particularly at a=20
higher level of competence. This state of affairs leads to a focus on=20
communication, a high degree of tolerance toward mistakes, an=20
understanding of the arbitrariness of norms and a will to compromise.

Language users at home seem less open to variation. In his article on the=
=20
prescriptive-descriptive dilemma, Matthias Wermke finds users more rule-
oriented than the general tendency toward destandardization may seem to=20
imply. Editors of normative texts are thus in a bind over what degree of=20
prescriptiveness to include into their publications. One way out of this=20
dilemma, according to the author, would be to introduce a distinction=20
between descriptive and prescriptive dictionaries and thus allow for=20
informed choices as to which manifestations of the same basic functions to=
=20
use.

As a conclusion, Ludwig M. Eichinger takes the concept of norm one step=20
further. Acknowledging the move towards more empirical research and the=20
now accepted difference in norms for written and oral language, the author=
=20
puts forward the provocative of question of whose norm is it anyway. While=
=20
talking about situative norms, expectations toward genre, and=20
appropriateness, Eichinger stresses the dynamic nature of standardization,=
=20
the interplay between the linguistic and the social. He concludes by=20
sketching the three current realms of norms to be taken into consideration=
=20
by speakers: mistakes to avoid, options to choose from and symbolic social=
=20
positionings to enact.

As can be seen from the above paragraphs, the IDS yearbook shows the=20
current state of affairs in German language standardization research from=
=20
a wide variety of standpoints. Conceptual pieces alternate with empirical=
=20
studies, general overviews with foci on a specific linguistic feature.=20
While this wide range of different subtopics among a total of 17=20
contributions has something to offer for everyone, that same diversity=20
makes a cohesive read difficult. In this respect, the collection may have=
=20
benefitted from a thematic rather than purely chronological order, maybe=20
even supported by some introductory section paragraphs. Concerning the=20
underlying frameworks of reference, a number of contributions echo recent=
=20
developments in applied linguistics from pluricentricity (Clyne, 1995) to=
=20
language awareness (Davies, 2000) and language variation as social=20
practice (Eckert, 2000), opening the field of inquiry beyond the=20
traditional dialectology focus in German sociolinguistics or combining the=
=20
two. In a future edition of the IDS yearbook, this scope may be broadened=
=20
to include other recent approaches like critical linguistics, which has a=
=20
lot to offer to the whole debate of standard, variation, and norms. Still,=
=20
as is, the present collection provides a most valuable state of the art=20
overview of conceptual, empirical, and methodological developments in the=
=20
study of the German language and should be included as a work of reference=
=20
in any German studies library both within and without the German speaking=
=20
areas.
