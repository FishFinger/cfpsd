Call for Papers

Traditionally workshop themes for GLOW, typically staged in the west of Europe,
have been dominated by issues pertinent to Germanic and Romance languages. Here
in Wroc?aw we would like to add a pinch of local colour: let's go Slavic!

This workshop centers around the issue of the theoretical description of the
syntax, morphosyntax and semantics of Slavic languages. This branch of languages
from the Indo-European Family shows a number of fascinating properties,
including among others:
- information structure-driven word order
- a rich system of nominal case
- multiple Wh-movement
- an intricate system of the aspectual marking of the verb through prefixation
- long-distance anaphoric binding
- null subjects
- determiner-less nominal phrases
- Left Branch Condition violations
- pronominal clitics/weak pronouns
- negative concord and NPIs

Numerous insightful analyses of these properties have repeatedly fuelled
agitated debates within the linguistic community and considerably contributed to
our current understanding of the mechanics of the syntactic derivation and the
logical/ semantic interpretation. However, we invite contributions dealing not
only with properties typical of Slavic languages as such but also touching upon
more general features of natural language that are exemplified by some of the
phenomena mentioned above. Abstracts should be sent in two copies: one with a
name and one without as attached files (the name(s) should also be clearly
mentioned in the e-mail) to: wjacek@amu.edu.pl in .pdf format.

Only electronic submissions will be considered.
Deadline for submissions: <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline>.
Abstracts may not exceed two pages of text with at least a one-inch margin on
all four sides (measured on A4 paper) and must employ a font not smaller than 12
point. Each page may include a maximum of 50 lines of text. An additional page
with references may be included.
