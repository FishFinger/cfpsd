The CSLP-06 workshop addresses the question of the role of constraints
in the representation and the implementation of language processing. The
workshop topic is intended to be interpreted inclusively: contributions
from linguistics, computer science, psycholinguistics, and related areas
are welcome, and an interdisciplinary perspective is of particular
interest.

Motivation
----------

Constraints are widely used in linguistics, computer science, and
psychology.  How they are used, however, varies widely according to the
research domain: knowledge representation, cognitive modelling, problem
solving mechanisms, etc. These different perspectives are complementary,
each one adding a piece to the puzzle. For example, linguistics proposes
in-depth descriptions implementing constraints in order to filter out
structures by means of description languages, constraint ranking, etc.
The constraint programming paradigm, on the other hand, shows that
constraints have to be taken as a systematic whole and can thus play a
role in building the structures (or can even replace structures).
Finally, psycholinguistics experiment the role of constraint systems for
cognitive processes in comprehension and production as well as
addressing how they can be acquired.


The purpose of this workshop is to address the question of constraints
and language processing, taking these different points of view into
consideration. The idea is to see whether a paradigm can be found,
unifying the different perspectives into a common framework capable of
explaining how constraints play a role in representing, processing and
acquiring linguistic information, and this from a formal, technical, and
cognitive perspective.

In this workshop, we particularly encourage an interdisciplinary
approach, bringing together people from different domains and their
intersections. Submissions from linguistics, computer science, and
psychology, as well as their intersections (such as natural language
processing and psycholinguistics) are encouraged. Submissions will
address the general topic "Constraints and Language Processing" and may
focus on sub-topics such as:

 . Constraints in human language comprehension and production
 . Acquisition of constraints
 . Constraints and learning
 . Cross-theoretical view of the notion of constraint
 . New advances in constraint-based linguistic theories
 . The relation of constraints to notions of markedness or defaults
 . Constraint satisfaction (CS) technologies to NLP=20
 . Linguistic analysis and linguistic theories biased towards CS or
constraint logic programming (CLP)
 . Application of CS or CLP for NLP
 . CS and CLP for other than (purely) textual or spoken languages=20
   (e.g., biological, multimodal human-computer interaction, visual)
 . Probabilistic constraint-based reasoning
 . Relaxation of linguistic constraint-solving problems
