Call Deadline: <deadline>01-Feb-2010</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The focus of Dialogue Under Occupation is the ongoing exploration of dialogue 
and discourse in areas of the world experiencing occupation.

Dialogue is presented as a complex concept, requiring 1) the participants; 2)
the conditions for dialogue to commence;and 3) the goal(s) of the dialogue-
pre-established or arrived at through the dialogue itself. Occupation, however,
is a complicating factor which creates a power differential between
participants: the occupied and the occupiers. If dialogue under occupation is to
be successful, then, the conditions must include 1) the realization that the
power differential exists; and 2) the willingness of the powerful to concede
their preconceived, often hegemonic, notions of their position. It must also be
understood by all parties that engaging in dialogue under occupation does not
mean that the less powerful or powerless are accepting the occupation in any
form, but that they are willing to confront their occupiers in an effort to be
recognized as having equal human rights, including the ability to make
autonomous decisions about how they should live and pursue their own definition
of happiness. 

Call for Papers

The goal of the conference is to provide a venue to maximize the investigation
of differing perspectives, to actively promote greater understanding of the
ideologies, issues, concerns, etc. of individuals affected through dialogue, and
to apply the outcomes to the resolution of occupation.

Scholars and professionals from various disciplines are invited to submit
proposals that address the creation, maintenance, resistance, and resolution or
occupation; the agreement to participate indicates willingness not only to
present, but also to engage in debate and discussion actively. Work relating to
hegemony, power, agency, identity, among others, will be particularly relevant.
Conference themes include the following strands:

1. Enactment: The domains wherein the politics and policies of occupation are 
enacted, realized through institutions attributed with and exercising power over
other institutions and the public (e.g., governments, religious organizations,
education departments and agencies).

2. Transaction: The domains wherein information about policies is transacted-
disseminated, endorsed, challenged - in an effort to inform (or misinform) the
occupied and the occupiers (e.g., media sources, schools, churches).

3. Reaction: The domains wherein daily life under occupation occurs (e.g., the 
community, the workplace), loci where positioning of the 'self' vs. the 'other' 
transpires, and where historical narratives of occupation are revisited.

4. Resolution: The locus of peacemakers and peacekeepers, those who would 
peaceably resist occupation and find ways to resolve conflict, as well as those 
who advocate resignation, acceptance, and coexistence.

Submission Instructions: Proposal (250-300 words) and Cover Sheet

You may submit a proposal for 1) a paper presentations - 20 minutes with 10 
minutes for questions; 2) a panel - maximum of 4 papers to a 2-hour block; or 
3) a roundtable - 1-hour with a general topic and question(s) presented as the
focus of discussion (N.B. Roundtables should not include a presentation as they
are intended to generate dialogue; "presenters" in this case are facilitators.
Alternatively, presenters who deliver a paper or are part of a panel may also
submit questions that their work generates for roundtable discussion.).

Do not include any self-identifying information on the abstract; include only
the title and the proposal itself. On a separate cover sheet, include:

1. Title
2. Strand you're submitting to - Enactment, Transaction, Reaction, Resolution 
(Identify only one as this will be used for scheduling)
3. Format (paper, panel, or roundtable)
4. Author(s)
5. Affiliation(s)
6. Postal Mailing Address (for primary presenter)
7. E-mail (for primary presenter)

N.B. Incomplete or inaccurate submissions may not be considered.

Send to: duo@dialogueunderoccupation.org

Deadline: <deadline>February 1, 2010</deadline> for a response by February 15.
