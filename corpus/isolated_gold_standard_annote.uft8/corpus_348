Meeting Description:

6th Language and Politics Symposium on the Gaeltacht and Scotstacht
 
Economic Development through Language:
The Role of Communities, the State and Enterprise Initiatives 

First Circular: 19 April 2006
 
Arts and Humanities Research Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies
 
6th Language and Politics Symposium on the Gaeltacht and Scotstacht
 
Economic Development through Language:
The Role of Communities, the State and Enterprise Initiatives
 
Organised by John M. Kirk, Dónall P. Ó Baoill and Raymond Cummings
 
Queen's University Belfast, 30 August - 1 September 2006
 
The central questions to be addressed in this symposium are the following:
* How is economic development being achieved through the language? 
* And how could it be done? 
* Are the agents at the grass roots with development being driven by communities bottom-up? 
* Or are the agents the various embodiments of the state (the Government, NGOs and Agencies, universities, the educational sector, broadcasting, and the media), driving development top-down? 
* Or is it up to laissez-faire enterpreneurism within the commercial sector to drive development through language? 
* Or are there other enterprises or initiatives which are bringing or could bring beneficial forces? For instance, Cultural tourism? Academic tourism? 
 
The symposium will also be interested in exploring the following areas: minority languages in the world of work; minority languages and the private sector; Labour Employment Law; 'the Irish language industry'; Gaelic as a language at work; the barriers to minority languages at work; the relationship between minority languages and the international economy; globalisation => monolingualism; need to consider macro-economic level as well as micro-economic and meso-economic levels; is the Gaelic economy only where Gaelic is spoken? Area economics vs. the economics of the individual as creator of wealth and payer of taxes; the minority language speaker as a fiscal unit. Are the discourses and perceptions about learning Gaelic economically-driven or economically-empowering? 
The symposium might also consider the effects of globalisation and the inhabitation of the local (language, culture, economy, work); globalisation vs. glocalisation.

Meeting Description:

The workshop on Stylistics for Text Retrieval in Practice follows four previous successful exploratory events on stylistic analysis and will focus on the practical craft of stylistic analysis in natural language texts. 

Stylistics for Text Retrieval in Practice
                       SIGIR 2006 Workshop
                     Seattle, August 10, 2006

               http://www.lingcog.iit.edu/style2006
                        style2006@sics.se

Recent years have seen an increased attention to various aspects
of automatic analysis and extraction of stylistic aspects of
natural language texts.

Style may be roughly defined as the 'manner' in which something is
expressed, as opposed to the 'content' of a message. Modelling,
representing, explaining, and utilizing variation in the manner of
expression is the business of stylistic analysis.

This workshop follows four previous successful exploratory events
on stylistic analysis and will focus on the practical craft of
stylistic analysis in natural language texts.

                     THIS YEAR: BRING A DEMO!

Potentially useful applications of stylistic analysis abound,
including systems for genre-based information retrieval,
authorship attribution, plagiarism detection, context-sensitive
text or speech generation systems, organizing and retrieving
documents based on their writing style, attitude, or sentiment,
quality or appropriateness filters for messaging systems,
detecting abusive or threatening language, and more. This year,
participants are expected to bring with them a method for applying
stylistic analysis to information access tasks.

Before lunch, methods are discussed in session; after lunch,
demonstrated in practice.

                       DISCUSSION QUESTION

Participants should address the following key challenge question
in their participation proposals:

* WHAT IS A MEANINGFUL ''KILLER APP'' FOR STYLISTIC TEXT ANALYSIS? *

and consider the following questions for discussion in session:

1. How does style relate to other forms of non-topical textual variation?
2. What features are best for different style analysis tasks?
3. Is cross-lingual or 'universal' style analysis possible, and if so, how?
4. How might we develop useful shared resources for moving style research forward?

                        SUBMISSION FORMAT

Send us a statement (in PDF) of up to five pages describing your
research or application with a short description (and screenshots
if possible) of the demonstration you plan to show. At the
workshop we will discuss and decide on an appropriate forum for a
more permanent record of the proceedings. If you would like a
speaking slot in the discussion session, you should indicate this
in your statement of interest.
