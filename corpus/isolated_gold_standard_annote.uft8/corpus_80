	(Apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement)

2005 Human Language Technology Conference and
Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing
Vancouver, B.C., Canada
Conference date: October 6-8, 2005
Submission deadline: <deadline>June 21, 2005</deadline>
Website: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/HLT-EMNLP05

The HLT/EMNLP 2005 Program Committee invites proposals for the
Demonstrations Program. This program is aimed at offering first-hand
experience with new systems, providing opportunities to exchange ideas
gained from creating systems, and collecting feedback from expert
users. It is primarily to encourage the early exhibition of research
prototypes, but interesting mature systems are also eligible.
Submission of a demonstration proposal on a particular topic does not
preclude or require a separate submission of a paper on that topic; it
is possible that some but not all of the demonstrations will
illustrate concepts that are described in companion papers.

Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the
demonstrations program, and should be arranged as part of the
HLT/EMNLP 2005 Exhibit Program.  However, this year, we are
introducing a way for companies to sponsor the demonstration program
by way of demonstration awards. Interested companies or organizations
that wish to make an award for the best demonstration, or that which
is most relevant to their roadmap, should contact their demo area
chair for more details.

Demo Co-Chairs
Donna Byron, Ohio State University
Anand Venkataraman, SRI International
Dell Zhang, National University of Singapore

Areas of Interest

We encourage the submission of proposals for demonstrations of
software and hardware related to all areas of computational
linguistics: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), etc. Areas of
interest include, but are not limited to, natural language speech and
text systems for:

- Speech recognition and generation;
- Speech retrieval and summarization;
- Rich transcription of speech;
- Interactive dialogue;
- Information retrieval, filtering and extraction;
- Document classification, clustering and summarization;
- Language modeling, text mining and question answering;
- Machine translation;
- Multilingual and cross-lingual processing;
- Multimodal user interface;
- Mobile language-enabled devices;
- Tools for Ontology, Lexicon, or other NLP resource development;
- Applications in growing domains (web-search, bioinformatics, ...)

Please be referred to the HLT/EMNLP 2005 CFP
(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/HLT-EMNLP05/cfp.html) for a more
detailed but not exhausted list of relevant topics.

Important Dates
Submission deadline:  <deadline>June 21, 2005</deadline>
Notification of acceptance: August 3, 2005
Submission of final demo related literature: <deadline>August 12, 2005</deadline>
Conference: October 6-8, 2005

Submission

Format

A demo proposal should consist of the following parts:

- An extended abstract of up to two pages, including the title,
authors, full contact information, and technical content to be demonstrated.
It should give an overview of what the demonstration aimed to achieve, how
the demonstration illustrates novel ideas or late-breaking results, and
relation to other systems or projects described in the context of other research
(i.e., references to related literature).

- A detailed requirement description of hardware, software and network
access expected to be provided by the local organizer. Demonstrators are
encouraged to be flexible in their requirements (possibly with different
demos for different logistical situations). Please state what you can bring
yourself and what you absolutely must have provided. We will do our best
to provide equipment and resources but nothing can be guaranteed at this
point beyond space and power.

- A concise script outline of the demo presentation, including accompanying
narrative, and either a web address for accessing the demo or visual aids
(e.g., screen-shots, snapshots, or sketches). The script should be no more
than 6 pages.

Demo abstracts must be submitted electronically in either Postscript
(PS) or Portable Document Format (PDF). They should follow the same
format as the main conference papers. Authors are encouraged to use
the style files provided on the HLT/EMNLP 2005 website. We strongly
prefer submissions in PS format. It is the responsibility of the
authors to ensure that their proposals use no unusual format features
and can be printed on a standard Postscript printer.

Demo requirement descriptions and script outlines can be in one of the
following formats: PS, PDF, Plain Text, HTML, Microsoft Word or
PowerPoint.

Procedure

Demo proposals should be submitted electronically to the demo
co-chairs at demos-hlt-emnlp05@speech.sri.com

Reviewing

Demo proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to the
conference, innovation, scientific contribution, presentation, and user 
friendliness, as well as potential logistical constraints.

Publication

The accepted demo abstracts will be published in the conference booklet, and 
probably in the *online*  Proceedings of the HLT/EMNLP 2005 Demonstrations as well.

Further Details

Further details on the timing and format for the demonstration sessions
will be determined and provided at a later date. Please send any inquiries
to the demo co-chairs at demos-hlt-emnlp05@speech.sri.com
