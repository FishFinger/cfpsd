SEMEVAL-1 / SENSEVAL-4

CALL FOR TASK PROPOSALS

The Senseval Committee invites proposals for tasks to be run as part
of SemEval-1 and Senseval-4. As the nature of the tasks in Senseval
has evolved to include semantic analysis tasks outside of word sense
disambiguation, the Senseval Committee is pleased to announce the
debut of "SemEval: Evaluating Semantics". In 2007, the SemEval
workshop will retain the Senseval name to help ease the transition to
the new name.

We welcome proposals for any tasks that can test an automatic system
for semantic analysis of text, be it application dependent or
independent. We especially encourage tasks for different languages,
cross-lingual tasks, and tasks that are relevant to particular NLP
applications such as machine translation, information retrieval and
information extraction.

It will help us if tasks are designed in such a way that they can be
run and scored automatically from a central website (as in
Senseval-3). We will be happy to help with task design, data
formatting, and so on.

Information on the design of tasks from Senseval-1, -2, and -3 can be
found at:
http://www.senseval.org/senseval3/
http://193.133.140.102/senseval2/
http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/events/senseval/ARCHIVE/index.html

The time period for SemEval-1/Senseval-4 has not yet been finalised,
but it will likely be held over a 45-day period sometime during the
first quarter of 2007.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tasks will ideally contain:

- A description of the task (max 1 page)
- How the training/testing data will be built and/or procured
- The evaluation methodology to be used, including clear evaluation
  criteria
- The anticipated availability of necessary resources to the
  participants (copyright, etc)
- The resources required to prepare the task (computation and annotation
  time, etc)

If you are not yet at a point to provide outlines of all of these,
that is acceptable, but please give some thought to each, and present
a sketch of your first ideas. We will gladly give feedback.

Please submit proposals as soon as possible, preferably by electronic
mail in plain ASCII text to the SemEval-1 / Senseval-4 email address:
semeval@nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu
