Meeting Description:

International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management
EKAW 2010
Lisbon, Portugal, 11th October-15th October 2010
http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt

The 17th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management is concerned with all aspects of eliciting, acquiring, modeling =
and
managing knowledge, and its role in the construction of knowledge-intensive
systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge management, e-business=
,
natural language processing, intelligent information integration, etc.

The focus of the 17th edition of EKAW will be on 'Knowledge Management and
Engineering by the Masses'.=20

As an important difference to earlier conferences, EKAW will accept differe=
nt
types of papers. The papers will all have the same status and follow the sa=
me
formatting guidelines in the proceedings but will receive special treatment
during the reviewing phase. In particular, each paper type will be subject =
to
own evaluation criteria. The PC will also make sure that there is a reasona=
ble
balance of the paper types accepted. At submission time the paper has to be
clearly identified as belonging to one of the following categories.

A) Standard Research Papers
These are "standard" papers presenting a novel method, technique or analysi=
s
with appropriate empirical or other types of evaluation as proof-of concept=
. The
main evaluation criteria here will be originality, technical soundness and
validation.

B) In-use Papers
Here we are expecting papers describing applications of knowledge managemen=
t and
engineering in real environments. Applications need to address a sufficient=
ly
interesting and challenging problem on real and large datasets, involving m=
any
users etc. The focus is less on the originality of the approach and more on
presenting real, large-scale and complex systems that solve a significant
problem. Technical details to understand how the problem is solved are requ=
ired.
Evaluations should involve real users of a system rather than representing =
a
pure academic exercise. The papers will be evaluated according to the
significance and practical relevance of the described research as well as w=
ith
respect to the technical soundness of the described solution and accompanyi=
ng
evaluation.

C) Problem Analysis Papers
We invite researchers to also publish problem analysis papers which do not
present any novel method, technique or approach to solving a problem, but h=
elp
to understand the problem itself. Understanding the characteristics of a pr=
oblem
itself is an important task in research and can benefit many people working=
 on
the same or at least similar problems. We expect in-depth discussions and
analysis of a certain phenomenon or problem, with clear definitions as well=
 as
qualitative and quantitative analyzes of the main characteristics of the
problem. We also expect a reasonable review of the state-of-the-art stating=
 in
how far current solutions fall short. Papers will mainly be evaluated with
respect to how general and technically sound their problem analysis is and =
how
useful it will be for other researchers working on the same problem. We exp=
ect
that such papers will guide future research by highlighting critical
assumptions, motivating the difficulty of a subproblem or explaining why cu=
rrent
techniques are not sufficient, all corroborated by quantitative and qualita=
tive
arguments. Evaluation criteria will also include appropriate categorization=
 of
the problem area and description of present solutions and approaches; and
appropriate description of the limitations of the present solutions and app=
roaches.

D) Validation Papers
A fundamental characteristic of research is that it should be reproducible.=
 In
some disciplines, reproduction of results by others is a basic research
activity. We would like to encourage researchers to reproduce and validate
methods, results and experiments etc. proposed by others before in a new co=
ntext
or application, on new datasets, under new assumptions etc. The goal is cle=
arly
to reach interesting and significant new conclusions about the method/appro=
ach
in question that warrant a stand-alone publication. The reproduction of res=
ults
should thus lead to new knowledge about the method in question or reveal
inherent problems in the assumptions of the original research or limitation=
s of
previous solutions. Papers will be evaluated with respect to the soundness =
of
the rationale for reproducing a certain approach as well as with respect to=
 the
new knowledge that is generated by reproducing the approach in question. A =
clear
comparison between the results obtained through the reproduction and the
original results are mandatory.
