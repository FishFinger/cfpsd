WOLFGANG BIBEL (Darmstadt),
         AI pioneer in the area of automated deduction
JOERG SIEKMANN (Saarbruecken, DFKI),
         AI pioneer in theorem proving
DON NORMAN (Northwestern U. & Nielson Norman group),
     	founder of "Cognitive Science" and author of many books
 	including "Design of Everyday Things"
