***** Final Call For Paper (Deadline <deadline>January 6th 2006</deadline>)

EACL 2006 Workshop on

RObust Methods in Analysis of Natural language Data (ROMAND 2006)

April 3rd 2006, Trento, Italy

http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~vincenzo/romand2006/

The EACL 2006 Workshop on RObust Methods in Analysis of Natural
language Data will be hosted in conjunction with the 11th
Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics that will take place April 3-7, 2006,
in Trento, Italy.


* TOPICS

Robustness in Computational Linguistics has been recognized as an
important issue for the design of Natural Language Processing
applications but is not particularly well addressed by common
evaluation procedures where test and training data are usually
obtained from the same source.  Robustness, however, can be
defined as a smooth degradation in the performance of a system
when faced with unexpected input.  Therefore, robustness is the
ability to deal with deviation from the norm and has much in
common with issues like scalability and portability.

To develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying
robust behaviour, papers are invited addressing aspects of
robustness in HLT from different perspectives including
psycho-linguistic insights.  Of particular interest are
submissions dealing with issues of robustness for a range of
challenging NLP applications such as (but not limited to) Machine
Translation, Information Extraction, Summarization,
Question-Answering, and Spoken Dialogue Systems.  Moreover, the
workshop will also make an attempt to strengthen the empirical
basis of research into issues of robustness by inviting
participants to contribute proposals for the design of Evaluation
Frameworks which would allow to measure the degree of robustness
and make it comparable, perhaps even across different Natural
Language Processing tasks.


* SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original,
unpublished work in the topic area of this workshop.  Submissions
should be formatted using the EACL 2006 stylefiles with overt
author and affiliation information and not exceeding 8 pages.
The EACL 2006 stylefiles are available at
http://eacl06.itc.it/submission/submission.htm

Please send your PDF file no later than <deadline>January 6, 2006</deadline>, to both
Vincenzo.Pallotta@unifr.ch and menzel@informatik.uni-hamburg.de

Each submission will be reviewed at least by two members of the
programme committee.  Accepted papers will be published in the
workshop proceedings.

Dual submissions to the main EACL 2006 conference and this
workshop are allowed; if you submit to the main session, do
indicate this when you submit to the workshop.  If your paper is
accepted for the main session, you should withdraw your paper
from the workshop upon notification by the main session.


* REGISTRATION

Information on registration and registration fees will be
provided at the conference web page.
