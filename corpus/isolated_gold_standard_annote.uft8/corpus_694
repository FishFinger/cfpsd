SECOND AND UPDATED CALL FOR PAPERS for the Journal Topics in Cognitive =
Science (topiCS) =
(http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121673067/home)=20

PRODUCTION OF REFERRING EXPRESSIONS: Bridging the gap between =
computational and empirical approaches to reference=20

Deadline for intention to submit (by email to =
pre.topics@googlemail.com): <deadline>1 February 2010</deadline>=20

Deadline for submission of full papers (using the journal's submission =
system): <deadline>1 March 2010</deadline>=20

We invite substantial, original, and unpublished submissions on all =
topics related to the production of referring expressions. Contributions =
may focus on computational, experimental, or theoretical approaches to =
reference. Papers bridging two or more of these fields are especially =
encouraged. Papers should not normally exceed 8000 words, though this =
limit may be extended in exceptional cases.=20

Editors for this topic are Kees van Deemter (University of Aberdeen, =
UK), Albert Gatt (University of Malta, Malta), Roger van Gompel =
(University of Dundee, UK) and Emiel Krahmer (Tilburg University, The =
Netherlands).=20

If prospective authors have any questions, they should contact the =
TopiCS editors at pre.topics@googlemail.com.=20

*********=20

Introduction of the topic: Following on from a highly successful CogSci =
workshop on the same theme (the PRE-CogSci 2009 workshop, =
http://pre2009.uvt.nl/) we are pleased to launch this open Call for =
Papers for the new journal Topics in Cognitive Sciences (topiCS). =
Participants in the PRE workshop are invited to submit, but this Call is =
in no way restricted to them. The submission procedure (in two stages) =
is specified below.=20

About the journal: Topics in Cognitive Sciences is one of the two =
official journals of the Cognitive Science Society, and is published by =
Wiley International =
(http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/topiCS/index.html). This innovative =
publication continues in the tradition of the Cognitive Science journal =
by being characterized by rigorous reviewing and high-quality papers. As =
the name suggests, topiCS features multiple scholarly papers dedicated =
to a single topic. Some of these topics will appear together in one =
issue, but other topics may appear across several issues.=20

Background about the topic: The production of referring expressions has =
been studied from many perspectives including psycholinguistics and =
computational linguistics, yet several open questions remain about how =
human speakers refer to entities. A referring expression is typically =
defined as one which is produced in order to identify an object or set =
of objects for a listener or reader, in a relevant domain of discourse.=20

In spite of several decades of research on reference, which has covered =
definite descriptions, deictic expressions, and anaphors, our =
understanding of it is still incomplete, in part due to a lack of =
communication between the various disciplines. We believe that the time =
is ripe to bridge the gap between these disciplines. Psycholinguistics =
offers important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying the =
production of referring expressions, through carefully controlled =
experiments. Computational linguistics has a well-established approach =
involving corpus analysis and computational modeling. The goal of this =
topics issue is to share results and to foster greater understanding and =
collaboration between psycholinguists, computational linguists, and =
researchers in related fields, including theoretical linguists =
interested in models of human language that are grounded in cognitive =
principles. For further information on the academic background to these =
issues, see the PRE-CogSci Workshop website (http://pre2009.uvt.nl).=20

Specific topics of interest include computational and/or experimental =
approaches to:=20

- different kinds of referring expressions; when are which types of =
reference (pronouns, descriptions, etc.) most appropriate?=20
- plural and quantified references=20
- vagueness: the use of vague (e.g. gradable) predicates in referring =
expressions=20
- referential overspecification: why and how do speakers overspecify?=20
- referential underspecification: production of descriptions which do =
not uniquely identify a referent=20
- referring expressions in interactive settings; audience design, =
adaptation and alignment=20
- ambiguity avoidance in references=20
- common ground, cooperativeness and shared/private information in =
reference=20
- realization of referring expressions (including speech and gesture)=20
- visual scene perception and its influence on the production of =
referring expressions=20
- social and contextual factors in reference=20
- data-collection and experimental evaluation methods=20

Paper submission: Manuscripts should follow the APA guidelines. Each =
submission will be sent for review to three reviewers, including at =
least one psycholinguist and one computational linguist. The only =
accepted format for submitted abstracts is Adobe PDF. A two-stage =
process is used, whereby authors first send an *intention to submit* to =
precogsci2009@googlemail.com by 1 February 2010. Intentions to submit =
should contain a provisional title, author name(s), and an abstract of =
about 200 words.=20

*Actual submission* of papers will be done using the journal's =
submission system (see http://www.editorialmanager.com/topics/ ) by <deadline>1 =
March 2010</deadline>.=20
