Full Title: Beyond the Words 

Date: 13-May-2010 - 15-May-2010
Location: Leipzig, Germany 
Contact Person: Cornelia Schulze
Meeting Email: cschulze@rz.uni-leipzig.de

Linguistic Field(s): Cognitive Science; Pragmatics; Semantics 

Call Deadline: <deadline>15-Nov-2009</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The planned international conference on pragmatics/semantics-interface is
intended to document pragmatic theorizing in the light of the present debates on
the one hand and to reveal the developing potential of future research
strategies in pragmatics on the other. It centers on the following questions:
What does it mean that something has been said? Is there literal meaning and how
does it constitute utterance meaning? What kind of pragmatic inference is
relevant for utterance understanding on different levels of utterance
interpretation? Do we need default-inferences in order to catch meaning-aspects
of utterances 'beyond the words', these inferences being cancelled in case of
purely literal meaning? How is pragmatic information processed (relation between
procedural effort and the respective communicative effect of the utterance)?
What is the pragmatic foundation of grammatical relations? 

Last Call for Papers

We invite the submission of abstracts (for paper or poster presentations)
adressing one of the above mentioned issues. Abstracts of no more than 500 words
(excluding references and tables) should be sent by email as a pdf-attchment to
cschulze@rz.uni-leipzig.de by <deadline>15 November 2009</deadline>.

The document should contain presentation title, the abstract and should indicate
your preference for paper or poster presentation. Oral presentations will last
20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion. Posters will stay up for a day; there
will be one special session dedicated to the presentation of the posters. The
language of the conference is English (preferable) or German. Informations
identifying the author(s) should be detailed in the body of the email, not in
the pdf-file.

Notification of acceptance and the final format of presentation (paper or
poster) will be communicated by January 15th 2010.

Please check our conference website
http://beyondthewordsconference.wordpress.com/ for further information
(informations will be added regularly).

The conference is organised by Prof. Frank Liedtke and Cornelia Schulze,
University of Leipzig, German Department, Pragmalinguistics.

We intend to publish selected papers in a separate proceedings volume.
