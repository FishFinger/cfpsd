Second Call for Chapters
(Proposals Submission Deadline: <deadline>15 December 2009</deadline>)

Ontology Learning and Knowledge Discovery Using the Web: Challenges and
Recent Advances

A book edited by Wilson Wong, Wei Liu, and Mohammed Bennamoun
University of Western Australia, Australia
http://explorer.csse.uwa.edu.au/editedbook=20

Introduction:
Ontologies provide formal specifications of what might exist in a domain to
ensure reusability and interoperability of multiple heterogeneous systems.
Ontologies form an indispensable part of the Semantic Web standard stack.
While the Semantic Web is still our vision into the future, ontologies have
already found a myriad of applications such as document retrieval, question
answering, image retrieval, agent interoperability and document annotation.
In recent years, automatic ontology learning from text has provided support
and relief for knowledge engineers from the labourious task of manually
engineering ontologies. Ontology learning research, an area integrating
advances from information retrieval, text mining, data mining, machine
learning and natural language processing, has attracted increasing
interests from a wide spectrum of application domains (e.g. bioinformatics,
manufacturing). Being a rapidly growing area, it is crucial to collect the
recent advances in tools and technologies in ontology learning and related
areas.

Objective of the Book:
The main objective of this book is to provide relevant theoretical
foundations, and disseminate new research findings and expert views on the
remaining challenges in ontology learning. In particular, the book focuses
on the following questions:
- Can ontology learning continue to rely on techniques borrowed from
related areas that were conceived for other purposes? Has the time arrived
for us to look at certain peculiar requirements of ontology learning and
develop specific techniques to meet these requirements?
- Lightweight ontologies are the most common type of ontologies in a
variety of existing Semantic Web applications (e.g. knowledge management,
document retrieval, communities of practice, data integration). Can these
lightweight ontologies be easily extended to formal ones? If so, how?
- The poor coverage, rarity and maintenance cost related to
manually-created resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS)
and text corpora (e.g. BNC, GENIA corpus) have prompted an increasing
number of researchers to turn to dynamic Web data for ontology learning.
There is currently a lack of study concentrating on the systematic use of
Web data as background knowledge for all phases of ontology learning. How
do we know if we have the necessary background knowledge to carry out all
our ontology learning tasks? Where do we look for more background knowledge
if we know that what we have is inadequate?
- More and more practitioners in the domain of biology, health care,
chemistry, manufacturing, etc., are looking up to ontology learning
techniques for solutions to their knowledge sharing and reusability needs.
How much more difficult is it to automatically learn ontologies from news
articles, as compared to clinical notes or biomedical literature? To what
extent can the current techniques meet the requirements of learning from
texts across different domains? Is the field of automatic ontology learning
from text ready for the industry?

Target Audience:
This proposed book will be an invaluable resource as a library or personal
reference for a wide range of audiences, including graduate students,
researchers, and industrial practitioners. Postgraduate students who are in
the process of looking for future research directions, and carving out
their own niche area will find this book particularly useful. Due to the
detailed scope and wide coverage of the book, it also has the potential of
being an upper-level course supplement for senior undergraduate students in
Artificial Intelligence, and a resource for lecturers in Knowledge
Acquisition, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Text Mining,
Information Extraction, and Ontology Learning.

Recommended Topics Include, But are not Limited to:
Area 1: Text Processing
- Web data pre-processing
- Noisy text analytics
- Text annotation/Sentence parsing

- Term recognition/term extraction/terminology mining
- Cluster analysis/term clustering
- Entity disambiguation
- Relevance/contrastive analysis
- Latent semantic analysis
- Other machine learning-based techniques
- Other corpus-based techniques

Area 3: Relation and Axiom Discovery/Ontology Languages
- Lexico-syntactic patterns
- Use of dynamic Web data (e.g. Wikipedia mining, online dictionaries)
- Sub-categorisation frames
- Association rules mining
- Inductive logic programming
- Other corpus-based techniques
- Logic-based/frame-based/markup ontology languages

Area 4: Applications of Ontologies
- Bioinformatics
- Risk management

- Health care
- Other relevant application areas

Submission Procedure:
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before <deadline>December
15, 2009</deadline>, a 2-3 page chapter proposal clearly explaining the mission and
concerns together with a tentative organisation (i.e. section titles with
section summaries) of their proposed chapter. Authors of accepted proposals
will be notified by January 15, 2010 about the status of their proposals.
Authors of accepted proposals will be sent guidelines and templates to
prepare the full chapter of 8,000 - 10,000 words. Full chapters are
expected to be submitted by March 15, 2010. All submitted full chapters
will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis. All proposals and chapters
should be typewritten in English in APA style and be submitted in Microsoft
Word=AE format to wilson@csse.uwa.edu.au. Unfortunately, LaTex files cannot
be accepted. Contributors may also be requested to serve as reviewers for
this project. This book is scheduled to be published by IGI Global
(formerly Idea Group Inc.). For additional information regarding the
publisher, please visit
http://www.igi-global.com/requests/details.asp?ID=3D724. This publication i=
s
anticipated to be released late 2010.
