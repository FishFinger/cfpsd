Dissertation Title: The Role of French-based Creole in the Acquisition of
Standard French: The case of Mauritius 

Linguistic Field(s): Language Acquisition

Subject Language(s): French (fra)


Dissertation Director(s):
Rachel Hoare

Dissertation Abstract:

This thesis investigates the acquisition of French as a second language in the multilingual environment of Mauritius.

Mauritius has been chosen because of its linguistic complexity, diversity and wealth. Whilst the indigenous language is Mauritian Creole, English has the status of written official language and French that of official spoken language. The regional French variety of Mauritius is widely spoken on the island and in fact, most of the inhabitants are fluent in it. 
 
The project explores the theoretical perspectives associated with the process of second language acquisition. The theories of language acquisition will be outlined and the various strategies language learners employ in order to facilitate the process of second language acquisition are examined. The sociolinguistic situation in Mauritius is introduced to the readers before exploring the features specific to Kréol Morisyen, the lingua franca of Mauritius.  The linguistic characteristics of Kréol Morisyen are compared to those of Standard French and sources of difficulty in French language acquisition are discussed from the perspective of the multilingual Mauritian language learner. 

The project investigates those features that make learners' language different from native speakers' production in the same language variety. To that effect, data collection was organised. The data analysis was divided into two parts. The first part focused on the particularities of learners' language, examining:
-methods of lexical selection  
-organisation of the lexico-grammatical structures of the two language systems; 
-cross-linguistic connectivity between the source language (English) and the target language (French) in the case of the French native speakers; and  
-lexical errors relating to the misconception of grammatical structures and lexico-semantic organisation. 

The second part of the data analysis focused on those linguistic features specific to the L2 and their effects on language learners' production. Inaccuracies and language learners' intentional restricted access to certain lexical items were accounted for as a learning strategy to facilitate the process of language acquisition. However, it was observed that such strategies lead to fossilization of lexical errors.  

The contrastive interlanguage analysis previously employed by Granger (1998) is the chosen approach for the data analysis. The language behaviour of the French native speakers is used as the norm against which the performance of non-native speakers is being considered. The vocabulary chosen by the learners in Mauritius is analysed and contrasted with the lexical choices of the native speakers within the same context in an attempt to identify aspects of non-nativeness in learners' production in the target language (Standard French).

English Studies (IES),University of London

SEMINAR CALL FOR PAPERS
SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE: STYLISTIC AND LINGUISTIC APPROACHES 

Despite age-old discussions, Shakespeare's ever-renewed interest in the issue of
language per se still requires investigation and new vistas of reflection. The
seminar will take a particular, but not exclusive, interest in tropes as a way
of considering Shakespeare at the intersection of stylistics and linguistics.
One of the important issues at stake will be the isolated status of metonymy as
an orphan figure too often upstaged by its eminent tropical counterpart,
metaphor. All contributions drawing on the models and terminology provided by
multifarious aspects of linguistics are relevant, e.g. discourse analysis,
pragmatics, literary semantics, stylometry, corpus/computer text analysis etc.

Convenor: Dr Mireille Ravassat (University of Valenciennes)
mireilleravassat@tele2.fr 
Co-convenor: Dr Jonathan Hope (Strathclyde University) jonathan.r.hope@strath.ac.uk 
Please send your abstracts directly to both convenors.
Deadline: <deadline>1 March 2006</deadline>

Seminar papers will not be read at the meeting but summarised in such a way as
to encourage discussion. Convenors will ask successful proposers to present
their paper as a 4-page abstract, if they have not already done so; and  to
provide a 100-word summary of the abstract to be published on the Conference
website. Each seminar will allow a maximum of six participants and will be
limited to a single two-hour session.

Meeting Description:

International Association for Dialogue Analysis
IADA 2006

General Topic: Dialogue in and between different cultures

Organisation:
-PD Dr. habil. Marion Grein
-Univ. Prof. Dr. Walter Bisang 

I. Introduction
The notion of dialogue is by no means restricted to any particular model, but covers the whole range of language in use. Yet, the following premises are considered common ground:
- Language is primarily used for communication 
- Communication is always dialogic 

Today, there are approximately 6900 languages spoken in our world. Language itself is an arbitrary system of sounds and symbols which is used for many purposes by a group of people, chiefly to communicate with each other, to express cultural identity and to convey social relationships. Yet, each of these languages has its own way of seeing the world. It is the product of its own particular history. The principles that guide communication are undoubtedly primarily based on the indidivual experiences of each human being. Individual experience in a given country is, however, culturally determined. Thus, each language is a sort of reflection of its community and culture. Dialogue und communication principles are culturally determined. Culture is an omnipresent force in every dialogue, thus the principles of i.e. an invitation, a refusal, an offer, a request etc. vary from culture to culture.

The Workshop intends to either reveal specific culturally determined influences on speech acts and dialogues or to compare them between different cultures.  

II. Call for Papers
Possible Workshop Sections
- Cultural impact on dialogues and speech acts in a specific language 
- Intercultural comparison of dialogues and speech acts 
- Translation as Cultural Dialogue

Section Workshops: 20 minutes paper + 10 minutes discussion

Conference languages
- English, French and German. The abstracts should be in English. Please indicate the language in which the paper will be given.

           5th SALTMIL Workshop on Minority Languages
                on Tuesday May 23rd 2006 (morning)
           Magazzini del Cotone Conference Centre, Genoa, Italy
                
Organised in conjunction with LREC 2006: Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, Genoa, Italy, 24-26 May 2006 

Background:

This workshop continues the series of LREC workshops organized by SALTMIL (SALTMIL is the ISCA Special Interest Group for Speech And Language Technology for Minority Languages:  http://isl.ntf.uni-lj.si/SALTMIL/ ): 

The minority or ''less resourced'' languages of the world are under increasing pressure from the major languages (especially English), and many of them lack full political recognition.  Some minority languages have been well researched linguistically, but most have not, and the vast majority do not yet possess basic speech and language resources (such as text and speech corpora, lexicons, POS taggers, etc) which would enable the commercial development of products. 

The workshop aims to share information on tools and best practice, so that isolated researchers will not need to start from nothing.  An important aspect will be the forming of personal contacts, which can minimise duplication of effort.  There will be a balance between presentations of existing language resources, and more general presentations designed to give background information needed by all researchers present.

Format:

The workshop will begin with the following talks from invited speakers:

 * Lori Levin (Carnegie Mellon University, USA):  ''Omnivorous MT: Using whatever resources are available.''
 * Anna Sågvall Hein (University of Uppsala, Sweden):  ''Approaching new languages in machine translation.''
 * Hermann Ney (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule, Aachen, Germany):  ''Statistical Machine Translation with and without a bilingual training corpus''
 * Delyth Prys (University of Wales, Bangor):  ''The BLARK matrix and its relation to the language resources situation for the Celtic languages.''
 * Daniel Yacob (Ge'ez Frontier Foundation) ''Unicode Development for Under-Resourced Languages''.
 * Mikel Forcada (Universitat d'Alacant, Spain):  ''Open source machine translation: an opportunity for minor languages''

These talks will  be followed by a poster session with contributed papers.

Papers:

Papers are invited that describe research and development in the following areas:

 * The BLARK (Basic Language Resource Kit) matrix at ELDA, and how it relates to minority languages.
 * The advantages and disadvantages of different corpus-based strategies for developing MT, with reference to a) speed of development, and b) level of researcher expertise required.

Language Disorders in Greek

to take place on June 10-11, 2006, at the Department of Speech and Language
Therapy, Technological Educational Institute of Patras, Greece.

Taking into consideration the ongoing research on impaired language and its
implications for what we know about language and the brain, as well as research
on Greek in particular, the aim of this conference is to bring together current
research on Greek as a result of language disorder(s). 

Both theoretical and experimental research is welcome on any topic of phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, or pragmatics.  

Special emphasis is given on comparative work, either between Greek and some
other language(s), or on bilingualism/multilingualism when one of the languages
is Greek.   

This year's meeting will give priority to Acquired Language Disorders 
(although work on other disorders will also be considered).

Linguistic Field(s): General Linguistics 

Call Deadline: <deadline>01-Jul-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Within language studies we are constantly confronted with boundaries and
interfaces: for example between languages, between countries, between dialect
areas, and between various aspects and components of linguistic study. This
conference aims to examine where these occur, to see whether boundaries can and
need to be drawn or grey areas declared, and to map out further areas of
investigation.

The organisation of panels will be finalised when all proposals have been received.

Keynote speaker: Marc van Oostendorp (Meertens Instituut, Amsterdam). 
Organising Committee: Sandra Döring, David Hornsby, John Partridge, Nicola
Schmidt-Renfree 

Proposals are requested for papers which look at the interplay of traditionally
identified elements of linguistic study under the general rubric of interfaces,
for example:

-	contact linguistics, centrism and language conflict
-	natural and artificial languages
-	any two or all of syntax, semantics, pragmatics 
-	phonology and morphology, e.g. Welsh mutations
-	prosody, structure, lexis and pragmatics
-	synchrony and diachrony
-	dialectology and sociolinguistics
-	written and oral registers 
-	pedagogical linguistics: the 4 skills
-	the lang./lit. divide

Please send expressions of interest as soon as possible, preferably by April 1,
2006 and abstracts of ca. 150 words by <deadline>July 1, 2006</deadline>

Abstract:

The book presents a new theory of the relationship between language and
culture in a transnational and global perspective. The fundamental view is
that languages spread across cultures, and cultures spread across
languages, or in other words, that linguistic and cultural practices flow
through social networks in the world along partially different paths and
across national structures and communities.

Abstract:

Learning new words is foundational to success in school and life.
Researchers have known for years that how many word meanings a student
knows is one of the strongest predictors of how well that student will
understand text and be able to communicate through writing. This book is
about how children learn the meanings of new words (and the concepts they
convey) and how teachers can be strategic in deciding which words to teach,
how to teach them, and which words not to teach at all.

This book offers a comprehensive approach to vocabulary instruction. It
offers not just practical classroom activities for teaching words (though
plenty of those are included), but ways that teachers can make the entire
curriculum more effective at promoting students' vocabulary growth. It
covers the 'why to' and 'when to' as well as the 'how to' of teaching word
meanings.

Abstract:

This book locates dialogic pedagogy within the history of TESOL approaches
and methods in which the communicative approach has been the dominant
paradigm. Dialogic inquiry in the form of story telling, oral histories,
and knowledge from the ground up and from the margins has much to offer the
field. In dialogic approaches, the teacher and students learn in community
and the students' home languages and cultures, their families and
communities, are seen as resources.

"Dialogic Approaches to TESOL: Where the Ginkgo Tree Grows" explores
teacher research, feminist contributions to voice, social identity and
dialogic pedagogy, and the role of teachers, students, families, and
communities as advocates and change agents. After a brief history of TESOL
methods and an introduction to dialogic pedagogy, four features of dialogic
approaches to TESOL are identified and discussed: learning in community,
problem-posing, learning by doing, and who does knowledge serve? The main
text in each chapter considers a single topic related to the concept of
dialogic pedagogy. Branching text leads to related discussions without
losing the main point of the chapter. This structure allows readers to
become well-rooted in each component of dialogic pedagogy and to "branch
out" into deeper philosophic understandings as well as actual practices
across a range of contexts.

"Dialogic Approaches to TESOL" offers a place for dialogue and reflection
on the prospects for transforming educational institutions to serve those
who have historically been excluded and marginalized. It provides
questions, frameworks, and resources for those who are just beginning in
the field and for U.S.-based educators who want to bring critical
multicultural and multilingual perspectives into language arts, reading and
literacy education.

Abstract:

This book investigates the effects of corpus work on the process of foreign
language learning in ESP settings. It suggests that observing learners at
work with corpus data can stimulate discussion and re-thinking of the
pedagogical implications of both the theoretical and empirical aspects of
corpus linguistics. The ideas presented here are developed from the
Data-Driven Learning approach introduced by Tim Johns in the early
nineties. The experience of watching students perform corpus analysis
provides the basis for the two main observations in the book: a) corpus
work provides students with a useful source of information about ESP
language features, b) the process of "search-and-discovery" implied in the
method of corpus analysis may facilitate language learning and promote
autonomy in learning language use. The discussion is carried out on the
basis of a series of corpus-based "explorations" by students and provides
suggestions for developing new tasks and tools for language learners.
