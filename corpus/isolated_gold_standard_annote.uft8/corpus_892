Meeting Description:

The vitality of research on word classes is a major aspect of current
linguistics in several of its articulations. It is likely and desirable tha=
t new
horizons open and that the various perspectives interlace to increase our
knowledge in this field of research.

In this framework, the TRIPLE Laboratory at Roma Tre University organizes a
3-day International Conference on 'Word Classes' with the following goals:

- Fostering a balanced evaluation of what is being done in the field of Wor=
d
Classes research;
- Gathering and discussing original pieces of research;
- Fostering the links between distinct disciplines concerned with the field=
.

Keynote Speakers:
- Christian Lehmann (Universit=E4t Erfurt)
- Alessandro Lenci (Universit=E0 di Pisa)
- Beth Levin (Stanford University)
- Thomas Stolz (Universit=E4t Bremen)=20

2nd Call for Papers

We invite the submission of abstracts of original papers for approx 12
presentations of 40 minutes each (30 minutes for the talk plus 10 for
discussion). Should the accepted submission exceed the indicated number of
slots, a reduction of talking time will be considered.

Abstracts are supposed to address one or more of the following topics:

- Word classes and sub-classes: particularities, criteria of definition,
exemplification
- Word classes and constructions
- Syntactic and semantic properties of word classes (e.g. external structur=
e of
words, semantic representation of word classes)
- Continua between classes (verbs with nominal features, nouns with verbal
features, adjectives and verbs, etc.)
- Neglected or scarcely studied word classes (prepositions, conjunctions, e=
tc.)
- 'Possible' and 'impossible' words
- Typological and comparative analyses of word classes and word class syste=
ms
- Computational representations and recognition algorithms for all the abov=
e topics

Abstracts must not exceed 2500 characters (short bibliography included) and
should be submitted via Easychair (starting from <deadline>September 15, 2009</deadline>):
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwc2010.

They should respect the following constraints:

- To be anonymous: information about the author(s) should be indicated in t=
he
Easychair form only.
- The associated bibliography should avoid reference to a recognizably high
number of works by the author(s).

Official conference languages are English and Italian.

Submitted abstracts will be evaluated by an international refereeing commit=
tee
on a double-blind review basis.

Important Dates/Deadlines:
- Abstracts accepted from: September 15, 2009
- Abstract submission deadline: <deadline>November 15, 2009</deadline>
- Notification of acceptance: December 15, 2010
- Definitive programme: January 10, 2010
- Registration open: January 15, 2010
- Registration deadline: March, 15, 2010
- Conference: March 24-26, 2010
