----------------------
[1] Short Description:
----------------------

In this workshop we are interested in pointing at successes and failures
of the integration of lexical cohesion in real-world IR applications
such as document and passage retrieval, question answering, topic
segmentation and text summarization. On the one hand, lexical cohesion
has received much attention in Information Retrieval research during its
more than 30-year old history, but so far with mixed results. On the
other hand, a considerable amount of research has been devoted to this
subject, both in terms of theory and practice, by the Natural Language
Processing community, but with limited evaluation in real-world
applications. This workshop is intended to bring together IR and NLP
researchers and discuss what has been achieved in this area, to
establish common themes between different approaches, and to discuss
future research directions.

--------------------
[2] Target Audience:
--------------------

This workshop is intended to bring together IR and NLP researchers
working on all areas of information retrieval and using lexical
associations in information retrieval applications. The objective is to
discuss what has been achieved in this area, to establish common
themes between different approaches, and to discuss future research
directions.

----------------------
[3] Areas of Interest:
----------------------

Papers are invited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* Efficient Techniques for Lexical Cohesion identification
* Scalable Algorithms for Lexical Cohesion identification
* Lexical Associations and Lexical Relations Resources
* Document Representation and Lexical Associations
* Document Ranking and Lexical Associations
* Single-Term and Phrase Information Retrieval
* Passage Retrieval and Lexical Cohesion
* Query Expansion and Lexical Associations
* Local and Global Context Analysis
* Ontology-based Query Expansion
* Question Answering and Lexical Relations
* Web Search and Lexical Cohesion
* Topic Segmentation and Lexical Cohesion
* Text Summarization and Lexical Cohesion
* Evaluation Standards and Benchmarks
* Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluations

Papers can cover one or more of these areas.

--------------------

Paper submission deadline: <deadline>May 22nd, 2005</deadline> <EXTENDED DEADLINE>
Notification: June 15th, 2005
Camera ready papers: <deadline>July 1st, 2005</deadline>

---------------------
[5] Paper Submission:
---------------------

Papers should follow SIGIR 2005 instructions
(http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/eventos/sigir2005/). Papers should
be submitted electronically in pdf format only to Rosie Jones
[jonesr@yahoo-inc.com]. The following URL transforms
postscript files to pdf files (http://www.ps2pdf.com/). The subject
line should be "SIGIR 2005 ELECTRA WORKSHOP PAPER SUBMISSION".

Because reviewing is blind, no author information should be included
as part of the paper (i.e. the names of the authors and references
that could identify the authors). An identification page must be sent
in a separate email with the subject line
"SIGIR 2005 ELECTRA WORKSHOP ID PAGE" and must include title, author(s),
keywords, page number and name and email of the contact author.
