Meeting Description: 

The goal of this symposium is to offer a platform for neuroimaging research and
research on bi/multilingualism and its possible implications for scientific and
educational policy. A state of the art of neurocognitive research on
bilingualism will be presented. Scientists and policy makers are given the
opportunity to enter into a debate about the subject.

Scientific fields: neuroimaging, bilingualism, language, neurocognition
Deadline abstracts posters: <deadline>September 10th 2006</deadline> 
Deadline registration participants: September 10th 2006 (25 Euro, afterwards 35
euro) 

Context:
Brussels is a multilingual region with a vibrant scientific community. The two
largest Universities - the UniversitÃ¯Â¿Â½ Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel - have collaborated successfully on innovative projects
using neuroimaging tools to investigate aspects of bilingualism.  
 
These universities jointly organize the international symposium- Multilingual
Neuroimaging Research in Brussels and Europe. State of the Art and Policy
Implications - where scientists, educationalists and policy makers can join in
debate and have the opportunity to present recent insights and developments. 

Concept:
First, a state of the art of current neuroimaging research on language and
bilingualism will be presented by Europe's leading scientists. Second, the
research carried out through the collaboration of the UniversitÃ¯Â¿Â½ Libre de
Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel will be presented.  
 
During the walking lunch and reception, there is ample opportunity to present
scientific research via a poster session.  
 
In the afternoon scientists and policy makers will shed light on the current
status, needs, and expectations of the interaction between fundamental research
and policy-driven research. Finally, these topics will be further discussed by
an interdisciplinary panel. 

Call:
Submissions for posters are welcomed from research in neuroscience,
neuroimaging, applied linguistics, cognition and bilingualism. Reference to its
importance for policy makers and/or its potential policy implications is
preferable, but not essential.
