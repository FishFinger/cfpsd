Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the Conference Organizing Committee, we would like to inform you of the:

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERDISCIPLINARY SOCIAL SCIENCES      
Cambridge University, United Kingdom
2-5 August 2010
http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com/

The International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences examines the nature of disciplinary practices, and the interdisciplinary practices that arise in the context of 'real world' applications. It also interrogates what constitutes 'science' in a social context, and the connections between the social and other sciences.

As well as an impressive line-up of international main speakers, the conference will also include numerous paper, workshop and colloquium presentations by social science researchers, practitioners and teachers. We would particularly like to invite you to respond to the conference Call-for-Papers. Presenters may choose to submit written papers for publication in the fully refereed International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences. If you are unable to attend the conference in person, virtual registrations are also available which allow you to submit a paper for refereeing and possible publication in this fully refereed academic journal, as well as the option to submit a presentation to the conference YouTube channel.

The deadline for the next round in the call for papers (a title and short abstract) is <deadline>10 December 2009</deadline>. Future deadlines will be announced on the conference website after this date. Proposals are reviewed within two weeks of submission. Full details of the conference, including an online proposal submission form, may be found at the conference website - http://www.SocialSciencesConference.com/.

We look forward to receiving your proposal and hope you will be able to join us in Cambridge in August 2010.

Yours Sincerely,

Gerassimos Kouzelis      
Professor of Philosophy of Science and Sociology of Knowledge      
Department of Political Science and Public Administration      
University of Athens, Athens, Greece      
For the Advisory Board, International Conference on Interdisciplinary Social Sciences and International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences
