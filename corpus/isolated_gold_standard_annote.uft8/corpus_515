Full Title: Standard Prosody or Prosody of Linguistic Standards? Prosodic
Variation and Grammar Writing 

Date: 28-Feb-2007 - 02-Mar-2007
Location: Siegen, Germany 
Contact Person: Joerg Peters
Meeting Email: j.peters@let.ru.nl
Web Site: http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/jp/dgfs2007/main.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Phonetics; Phonology 

Call Deadline: <deadline>15-Aug-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

This workshop focuses on the prosody of standard and non-standard varieties and
the relevance of prosodic variation for grammar writing. 

Second call for papers

With the advances of prosodic theory in the last few decades, descriptive
grammars have paid more and more attention to prosody. Encyclopedic grammars
like The Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (Quirk et al. 1985) and
the 7th edition of the Dudengrammatik (2005) even devote entire chapters to
prosody. Those grammars claim to describe national standard languages, which are
codified in written language. Prosody, however, is only partly codified, if at
all. The question arises whether there is nonetheless a standard prosody shared
by all speakers of a national standard language on which grammars can be built.
Until the mid 90s of the last century, prosodic research mainly dealt with
standard languages, using impressionistic judgments or a few speakers of the
standard language as their data source. In the last decade, prosodic variation
has become one of the fastest-growing topics, especially in Autosegmental
Phonology and in spoken language research. The findings in these research areas
challenge the view that there is a single standard prosody shared by all
speakers of a standard language. One of the tasks of prosodic research,
therefore, will be to examine how much variation is involved in the prosody used
by speakers of national standard languages, and, more generally, to examine the
implications prosodic variation has for grammatical description. 

Papers on all topics related to prosodic variation and the relevance of prosody
for grammar writing are welcome. In particular, we encourage contributions to: 
- the prosody of standard and non-standard varieties
- regional, social, and stylistic variation of prosody
- syntactic structure and prosodic variation
- the modeling of prosody as part of grammars

Presentations will be 20 minutes long followed by a 10-minute question period.
The language of the conference will be English.

The workshop will be part of the Annual Meeting of the German Society of
Linguistics (DGfS)(http://www.dgfs.de).

Invited speakers:

Caroline Féry (University of Potsdam)
Peter Gilles (University of Luxembourg)
Martine Grice (University of Cologne)
Carlos Gussenhoven (University of Nijmegen)
Klaus J. Kohler (University of Kiel)
