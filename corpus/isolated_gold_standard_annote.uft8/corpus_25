                         CALL FOR PAPERS

            BUILDING AND USING PARALLEL TEXTS: DATA-DRIVEN
                  MACHINE TRANSLATION AND BEYOND

                Workshop at the Annual Meeting of
       the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2005)

                       Ann Arbor, Michigan
                        June 29-30, 2005


                  http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers
working on problems related to the creation and use of parallel
text. Recent events have demonstrated once again the importance of
inter-language communication across a broad range of languages. This
reinforces the need for advances in machine translation (MT) and
multi-lingual processing tools, especially for languages with scarce
resources.

This is a two-day workshop featuring two tracks:

    1. Building and Using Parallel Texts for Languages
       with Scarce Resources (day 1)

    2. Exploiting Parallel Texts for Statistical Machine
       Translation (day 2)

Both tracks feature a shared task each, that allows participants to
compare their results on a common task. Although not required, we
encourage submissions to participate in the shared tasks for
bench-marking purposes.


TRACK DESCRIPTIONS

1. BUILDING AND USING PARALLEL TEXTS FOR LANGUAGES WITH SCARCE RESOURCES

The aim of this track is to bring together researchers involved in the
study of creating and using parallel corpora for minority
languages. The track will be therefore centered around issues related
to manual/automatic collection of parallel corpora, studies in the
"import" of knowledge from a well-studied language via parallel
alignments, evaluations of the quality of collected corpora or the
quality of the tools that are derived based on these corpora.

We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues:

    * Construction of parallel corpora, including the automatic
      identification and harvesting of parallel corpora from the Web
    * Tools for processing parallel corpora, including automatic
      sentence alignment, word alignment, phrase alignment, detection of
      omissions and gaps in translations, and others
    * Methods to evaluate the quality of parallel corpora and word
      alignments
    * Using parallel corpora for the derivation of language processing 
tools
      in new languages
    * Using parallel corpora for automatic corpus annotation (e.g. word
      sense disambiguation)
    * Using parallel corpora for cross-language information retrieval and
      extraction
    * The quality of language resources and systems that can be constructed
      with small amounts of parallel text and how do these scale up with 
the
      amount of text available.
    * The role of external knowledge sources (e.g. bilingual dictionaries)
      in building resources and systems relying on parallel texts.
    * Machine learning techniques for building and exploiting parallel texts
      (e.g. using small amounts of human-aligned parallel text to bootstrap
      large aligned corpora; active selection of data based on usefulness
      for different tasks)

While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics, or related
issues, we particularly welcome work involving parallel corpora addressing
languages with scarce resources.


Shared task

In addition to regular paper presentations, the track will also include
a shared task for the evaluation of various word alignment techniques.
Word alignment represents an important step in exploiting parallel corpora,
and yet there is no common evaluation framework for such systems. This
follows on the success of the word alignment task that took place as a part
of the NAACL 2003 workshop on parallel text. This year's edition will be
distinct in that it will focus on Inuktitut-English and Romanian-English
alignment. This fits into the theme of our track, since neither Inuktitut
nor Romanian is a widely studied language, and there are relatively few
online resources and tools available.

Teams that participate in the alignment exercise will be provided the
training data for each language pair and development data taken from the
gold standard data in order to build their systems. Thereafter they will
be provided the unaligned gold standard data and asked to submit their
proposed alignments in a short time frame. There will be two tracks
for each language pair, one for teams that augment the training data with
additional resources, and another for those that only use the training
data. The resulting alignments will be evaluated relative to the 
previously
mentioned gold standard data prior to the workshop. Short papers describing
systems participating in this shared task and all evaluation methodologies
employed will constitute a separate section in  the workshop proceedings.

A more detailed description, training, development, and test data, and
a number of other related resources will be made available from
http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/wpt05


2. EXPLOITING PARALLEL TEXTS FOR STATISTICAL MACHINE TRANSLATION

The focus of this track is to use parallel corpora for machine
translation.

Translating documents from foreign languages into English (or between
any two languages) by computer is one of the oldest goals in
computational linguistics. Now, armed with vast amounts of digitally
available translated text and powerful computers, we are witnessing
significant progress toward achieving that goal. Statistical methods
allow the analysis of parallel text corpora and the automatic
construction of machine translation systems. Already, for some
language pairs such as Chinese-English or Arabic-English, statistical
machine translation (SMT) systems built at research labs outperform
commercial systems.

Recent experimentation has shown that the performance of SMT systems
varies greatly with the source language. In this workshop we would
like to encourage researchers to investigate ways to improve the
performance of SMT systems for diverse languages, including
morphologically complex languages (e.g., Finnish) and languages with
partial free word order (e.g., German). These issues lie on the border
of linguistic analysis and statistical modeling, and the ACL
conference is the most appropriate forum to investigate them, as ACL
has a long tradition of hosting high-quality research in both areas.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

      * word-based, chunk-based, phrase-based, syntax-based SMT
      * using comparable corpora for SMT
      * using morphological and POS information for SMT
      * integration of rule-based MT and statistical MT
      * decoding
      * error analysis

In addition to submissions on the topics listed above, this track of
the workshop features a shared task and we encourage participants to
evaluate their approaches on that task. The shared task is to evaluate
your approach to machine translation---see the list of topics of
interests above---on the Europarl corpus.

A more detailed description of the shared task, the test and training
corpora, a freely available MT system, and a number of other resources
are available from

http://www.statmt.org/wpt05/mt-shared-task/


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Submissions will consist of regular full papers of max. 8 pages,
formatted following the ACL 2005 guidelines. Authors of regular
full papers will be required to indicate a track for their submission.
In addition, teams participating in the shared tasks will be invited
to submit short papers (max. 4 pages) describing their systems.
Both submission and review processes will be handled electronically.
