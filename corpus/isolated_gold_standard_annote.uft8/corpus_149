			CALL FOR PAPERS

Goal

The track on Trends in Natural Language Processing is a forum for
researchers working in natural language processing(NLP)/computational
linguistics(CL) and related areas. The rapid pace of development of online
materials, most of them in textual form or text combined with other media
(visual, audio), has led to a revived interest for tools capable to
understand, organize and mine those materials. Novel human-computer
interfaces, for instance talking heads, can benefit from language
understanding and generation techniques with big impact on user
satisfaction. Moreover, language can facilitate human-computer interaction
for people with disabilities (no typing needed) and elderly leading to an
ever increasing user base for computer systems.

While papers and contributions on traditional basic and applied language
processing issues are welcome, the 2006 track will emphasize novel
challenges to the NLP/CL community: multilingual processing, learning
environments, multimodal communication, bioNLP, spam filtering, security,
etc. We also encourage papers in information retrieval, speech processing
and machine learning that present novel approaches that can benefit from
or have an impact on NLP/CL.

Topics

We invite highly original papers that describe work in, but not limited
to, the following areas:

   1. NL-based Knowledge Representations and systems
   2. Lexical Semantics
   3. Syntax
   4. Semantics
   5. Coreference Resolution
   6. Word Sense Disambiguation
   7. Text Cohesion and Coherence
   8. Dialogue Management and Systems
   9. Language Generation
  10. Language Models
  11. Human Computer Interfaces - in particular multimodal human-computer
      communication and language as the only acceptable human-computer
      communication channel for handicapped and elderly
  12. Machine Learning applied to NL problems
  13. Multilingual Processing
  14. Standardization, Language Resources, Corpora Building and Annotation
      Languages
  15. NL in Learning Environments
  16. Semantic Web, Ontologies, Reasoning
  17. Applications: Machine Translation, Summarization, Intelligent
      Tutoring, Question Answering, Information Extraction, etc.
  18. others


Submission Guidelines

Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI formatting
guidelines. The papers should not exceed 6 pages and are due by

		<deadline>November 21, 2005</deadline>.

Please note the change from 5 to 6 pages from the first CFP.
Additional pages (7 and more) have to be cleared by the program chairs and
will be $100 each. The papers should not identify the author(s) in any
manner. Authors should indicate the special track if one exists that
closely matches the topic of their paper. All submissions will be done
electronically via the FLAIRS web submission system available through the
paper submission site at http://earth.cs.ccsu.edu/~flairs/submission.html.


Conference Proceedings

Papers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the
conference proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press.  Selected
authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a
special issue of the International Journal on Artificial Intelligence
Tools (IJAIT) to be published in 2007.
