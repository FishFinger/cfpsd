Meeting Description:

TOTh 2010
International Conference on Terminology & Ontology: Theories and Applicatio=
ns=20

Presentation
Knowledge engineering in general and ontologies in particular have revitali=
sed
terminology, and made it a key element for a great many applications essent=
ial
to the digital age. Terminology opens up new perspectives for a broad spect=
rum
of information processing: for terminology committees, document management,
modelling, language policy, knowledge capitalization, knowledge representat=
ion,
translation, the semantic web, etc. But all these new perspectives throw up
fresh questions as to how language and concepts interact in terminology. =
=20

Terminology, as an autonomous field of research, has become pluridisciplina=
ry
and draws on linguistics, language for special purposes (LSP), artificial
intelligence and information sciences.=20

Call for Papers

Target Audience
The TOTh conferences aim to bring together all those involved in LSP,
terminology and knowledge engineering, and more generally all persons inter=
ested
in issues related to language and knowledge, be they in research, industry =
or
other practical applications.

Training session
As from 2010, there will be a training session before the conference proper=
.
Emphasis for 2010 will be on the reciprocal enrichment of terminology and
ontology (in French).

Organization
The conference takes place every year at Annecy (France) on the first Thurs=
day
and Friday of June (3rd and 4th June 2010). A training session is organized=
 the
day before the conference proper (Wednesday 2nd June 2010). In addition to =
the
academic papers, research by advanced graduate students and industrial
applications figure prominently in the program.  A keynote speaker, usually=
 from
another subject field but specializing in issues of language and thought, o=
pens
TOTh conferences.=20

Conference Topics (non exhaustive list)=09
Papers will focus both on the linguistic dimension of terminology and knowl=
edge:
- LSPs, language planning (prescription, standardizing), usage, variation,
- glossaries, dictionaries, thesauri and other terminological products,
- multilingualism, translation, corpus processing, particularly alignment,
knowledge extraction,=20
- constructing and maintaining terminology resources, harmonizing concepts,
harmonizing terms, theories of meaning, what corpora can and cannot contrib=
ute,
and on their conceptual dimension:
- terminological principles for constructing concept systems: knowledge
representation,  knowledge management, the importance of ontologies (buildi=
ng,
maintaining, aligning, merging),
- input from artificial intelligence, linguistics, epistemology, formal sys=
tems
(description logic for example), not forgetting their applications:
- software environments; building and maintaining terminologies, thesauri,
dictionaries, ontologies,
- IT applications based on knowledge and terminology resources: information
systems, specialized digital libraries, document management, information
retrieval, classification, knowledge management, web semantics, collaborati=
ve
engineering, etc.
- assessing acquisition and manipulation tools, changing standards in the f=
ield
of language and ontology resources.

Deadlines and other important dates
Proposals for papers will be assessed by the international program committe=
e in
view to being presented orally or as a poster. Those papers accepted will b=
e
published in the proceedings as full articles and posters included as short
articles.

Deadline for submitting an article: <deadline>1st February 2010</deadline>
