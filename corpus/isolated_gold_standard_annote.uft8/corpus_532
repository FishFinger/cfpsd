CALL FOR SUBMISSION 
Asian Language Technology: Resources and Processing 
A Special Double-Issue of 
Language Resources and Evaluation 

Guest Editors: 
Tokunaga Takenobu 
Chu-Ren Huang 

Asian language technology presents an illuminating focal point in the 
emerging challenges of multilingualism and multiculturalism to our 
society. On one hand, studies on well computerized languages (such as 
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai) apply states of the art 
technology. They present new theoretical issues and attest to the 
robustness of current paradigm at the same time. On the other hand, 
studies on less computerized languages in Asia require delicate 
balancing between resource building and processing application. 
Research on Asian language technology has thrived in the past few 
years. The Asian Language Resources Workshops, sponsored by the AFNLP 
ALR Committee, started in 2001 have had over 60 papers presented in 
five workshops so far. AFNLP also sponsored two successful Asian NLP 
conferences, IJCNLP 2003 and 2005. Lastly, 39% of all submissions to 
COLING/ACL 2006 came from Asia, including to an Asian language 
processing track which accepted 16 papers. These facts clearly 
indicate the quality of available papers as well as the maturity of 
the field. 
We invite original papers on Asian Language resources and processing 
to submit to this special issue. All submission will be strictly 
reviewed by the standard LRE procedure. Instructions for authors and 
online manuscript submission links can be found on the LRE homepage: 
http://www.springer.com/west/home/linguistics?SGWID=4-40369-70-35554703-0 
    All papers must be submitted online at the LRE website. After 
electronically submitting your paper, please send an email to both 
co-editors (take@cl.cs.titech.ac.jp, churenhuang@gmail.com) with the 
subject line: "LRE submission", and with the mail body containing the 
title and authors of your submission.

Deadline for paper submission: <deadline>August 19, 2006</deadline> 
Notification of Acceptance: By October 9, 2006
