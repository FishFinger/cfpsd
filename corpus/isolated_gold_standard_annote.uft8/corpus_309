                  ACL 2010: CALL FOR SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONS

          48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics
                        July 11--16, 2010, Uppsala, Sweden

                        http://www.acl2010.org/demos.html

                 * * * Submission deadline: <deadline>February 22, 2010</deadline> * * *

Invitation of Submissions

The ACL 2010 System Demonstration Program Committee invites proposals
for the Demonstrations Program. We encourage both the submission of
early research prototypes and interesting mature systems.

PLEASE NOTE: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not
appropriate in the Demonstrations Program, and should be arranged as
part of the Exhibit Program.

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied
computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the topics
listed for conference paper submission (www.acl2010.org/papers.html)

The systems may be of the following kinds:

    * Natural Language Processing systems or system components
    * Application systems using language technology components
    * Software tools for computational linguistics research
    * Software for demonstration or evaluation
    * Development tools

We would like to strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems
as long as they prove technologically innovative given the current state
of the art of theory and applied research in computational linguistics,
and as long as they do not include sales and marketing activities.

Each demo will be complemented by a poster at the conference and will be
allocated 6 pages in the conference proceedings.

Developers should outline the design of their system and provide
sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and
relevance to computational linguistics. Pointers to web sites running a
demo preview will also be helpful.

Demo submissions should also clearly indicate if any computer equipment
is expected to be provided by the local organizer. If so, please specify
desired hardware platform, hard disk and memory capacity, operating
system and other software needed in order to run the demo.

Submission Information

Submissions may consist of 6 pages (including references) and must
conform to the official ACL 2010 style guidelines to be announced on the
conference website. Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore,
the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations.
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do
not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

The deadline for submissions is <deadline>February 22, 2010</deadline>. Submission will be
electronic in PDF format through a link on the ACL 2010 conference
website (available soon).
