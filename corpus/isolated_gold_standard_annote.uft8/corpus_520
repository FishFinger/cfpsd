1. THE SPECIAL ISSUE 

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of 
computational 
research on prepositions. Due to their importance in computational
tasks 
prepositions, as well as prepositional phrases and markers of various
sorts, 
have received a considerable amount of attention and occupied a
central 
position in research in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Language 
Technology 
(LT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
as well 
as Computational Psycholinguistics (CP).  Researchers from these
backgrounds 
and CL-related disciplines have looked at the role of prepositions in 
shallow 
and deep language processing. 

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP
tasks, 
very little progress has been made in systematically describing
preposition 
semantics. Notably, the only account of the lexical semantics of 
prepositions 
in resources such as WordNet, FrameNet and PropBank is indirect, in
that 
they 
feature in significant numbers within multiword expressions or as
frame 
elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated into such resources
as 
first-order entities, a large number of issues must be resolved such
as 
how to 
taxonomically deconstruct the spatial semantics of prepositions, how
to 
delineate preposition senses, and how to tease apart preposition and
verb 
semantics in phrasal verbs. Our expectation is that such questions
will be 
guided by careful analysis of what semantic distinctions and 
representational 
granularity are required in a range of applications, which will in
turn be 
guided by such research as the representation of prepositions within 
implemented grammars, crosslingual preposition semantics, machine
perception 
and visualisation of preposition semantics, and computational models
of the 
human processing of prepositions.

2. TOPICS OF INTEREST 

For the proposed special issue we specifically invite submissions that 
bring a 
theoretical basis to research on prepositions in lexical resources and
NLP 
tasks of the sort described above. In particular, we focus on the
syntactic 
and semantic treatment of productive and collocational uses of
prepositional 
phrases and markers in resources such as WordNet and FrameNet, and the 
utilization of such resources in NLP tasks, such as Machine
Translation, 
IE/IR and QA. 

* Extraction of Prepositions: 

  There has been considerable research into extraction of prepositions
  and 
  related constructions (e.g. phrasal verbs). Papers which describe
  the 
  extraction of these constructions, including their subcategorisation 
frames 
  and alternation patterns, as are necessary for the semi-automatic 
extension 
  of lexical resources are particularly welcome. 


* Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources: 

  We encourage papers describing the challenges of providing adequate 
  representation of prepositions and related constructions such as
  would be 
  generally applicable in NLP applications. 


* Prepositions in Applications: 

  We invite papers that discuss the role of prepositions in NLP tasks, 
  focusing specifically on what insights various applications offer
  for 
  lexical resource building, what particular needs different 
application areas 
  have (e.g. what an ideal prepositional lexical resource would be
  like), 
  necessary extensions to existing resources, and how prepositional
  lexical 
  resources of various types could enhance performance over a given 
task like 
  MT, IR, QA and multi-modal systems.
