Meeting Description:

Caribbean Linguistics at the International Conference on Caribbean Studies 

As postcolonial theory is rivaled by transnationalism and globalization, the relevance of the Caribbean persists. This interdisciplinary conference features the Caribbean as center stage for the twenty-first century's paradigmatic shift from postcolonialism to globalization. Papers and panels are invited on any aspect of Caribbean linguistics or sociolinguistics. Studies of all Caribbean languages are welcome and studies of language contact, language conflict, and creolization are particularly encouraged. In keeping with Gabriel García Marquez' theory that the Caribbean unites the Gulf of Mexico with the Mediterranean, the conference will be held on South Padre Island on the Texas Gulf coast, a modern beach resort with a varied cultural past and present. Papers in English, French and Spanish will be considered. Please send an abstract of approximately 200 words in an attached file (Word or WordPerfect) to hrromero@panam.edu by <deadline>May 1, 2006</deadline>.

Call Deadline: <deadline>15-Apr-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Among the central issues in the philosophy of language, the determination of the
content conveyed by sentences on the occasion of their utterance is certainly
one that is of major importance to linguists and cognitive scientists. Over the
years, a modicum of agreement has emerged as to what aspects of utterance
meaning pertain to the most pragmatic layers of interpretation. The focus of the
debate has now moved to issues like the literal, truth-conditional or
propositional content of utterances: is it entirely a matter for semantics to
deal with, or does pragmatics affect that content (and, if so, to what extent)?
Around these issues, several major positions have emerged, ranging from
so-called 'radical contextualism' (pragmatics massively impacts on
truth-conditional content) to equally radical 'semantic minimalism' (there is no
such pragmatic impact), through 'moderate contextualism' and 'truth relativism'.

While the debate is still raging, we have thought it useful take a step back and
look at how the various theories fit, or can be made to fit, into general models
of cognition. We have gone on the assumption that compatibility with a plausible
cognitive framework is a legitimate goal for linguistic inquiry. In other words,
we endorse the view that theories of language (and language use) should be
prepared to commit themselves to any conception of the human mind with which
they are compatible.

We hope that the Brussels workshop will offer an opportunity for language
scholars to present their views on the mechanisms underpinning the
interpretation of (certain aspects of) utterances. Our expectation is that
putting these issues in the light of broader psychological assumptions should
clarify the debate about the semantics/pragmatics distinction and provide a
fresh perspective for the evaluation of the different schools of thought that
attempt to answer the tough question: how much of the meaning of expressions
must be accounted for by semantics, and how much by pragmatics?

The following keynote speakers have confirmed their participation:
Herman Cappelen (University of Oslo)
Marc Dominicy (Université Libre De Bruxelles)
François Recanati (Institut Jean Nicod, CNRS Paris)
Deirdre Wilson (University College London) 

Abstract submissions: 

We welcome submissions of abstracts for 25-minutes papers that address the
implications of theories of utterance-content for cognitive science, or,
conversely, the implications of theories of cognition for our understanding of
utterance-content. A non-exhaustive list of topics we expect to be addressed
includes: gradable adjectives, quantified expressions, loosening/narrowing of
the meaning of predicates, ad hoc concepts, the varieties of quotation,
reference and deference. We also welcome papers from scholars who study language
development, impaired communication, non-verbal communication and non-human
communication.

Important dates
Deadline for abstracts: <deadline>15th April</deadline> 
Notification of acceptance: 25th April
Workshop: 23-24th June 

Abstract format: 
- Only electronic submissions are accepted. 
- The abstracts should be submitted to the email address:
mkissine@ulb.ac.be, with the following subject line: ''Utterance Interpretation
and Cognitive Models '' 
- The abstract should be sent as an attachment to an email message, in either MS
Word (.doc), Rich Text Format (.rtf) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf ) format 
- The length of the submissions is a maximum of two A4 sides. The abstract
should clearly indicate the title of the talk, and may include references. 
- The abstracts should be prepared for blind review, and include no indication
of the name(s) of the author(s) 
- The body of the email message should contain the following information: The
author('s) name(s), affiliation, title of the paper and contact details (postal
and email address)

Meeting URL: http://web.rll.ufl.edu/colloquium/main.html 

Linguistic Field(s): Ling & Literature 

Subject Language(s): None ()

Language Family(ies): Romance 
Meeting Description: 

Given the strategic proximity of the state of Florida to many Latin American countries and the complex demographic reconfiguration the state has undergone through several migratory flows, our colloquium intends to engage participants in critical thinking and discussion of different cultural and linguistic productions regarding the confluence of several processes such as immigration, memory recovery, unemployment, and language maintenance. 

Title of the Colloquium:

Back to the Past? Memory, Displacement, and Identity from the Perspective of Violence and its Relation to Discourse.

We hope to host 4 keynote speakers, whose expertise will be invaluable to the attendees of the colloquium. Two of them are UF researchers, Dr. Andrés Avellaneda and Dr. M.J. Hardman; other two off-campus guest speakers have already been secured: Dr. Octavio Escobar Giraldo, a Colombian writer and Dr. Andrew Lynch from the Linguistics Department at the University of Miami. 

We encourage you to submit abstracts to coloquiouf@yahoo.com
Contact us if any inquiry.

Call Deadline: <deadline>31-Mar-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The DTS-L (Digital Tools Summit for Linguistics, http://www.ku.edu/pri/DTSL/) is a workshop on digital tools and cyberinfrastructure development in linguistics, for language software engineers and computational linguists, as well as linguists. The workshop aims to facilitate new interdisciplinary collaboration to design and create digital tools specifically for linguistic analysis, and thereby stimulate new funding initiatives. 

The DTS-L (Digital Tools Summit for Linguistics, http://www.ku.edu/pri/DTSL/) is a workshop on digital tools and cyberinfrastructure development in linguistics, for language software engineers and computational linguists, as well as linguists. The workshop aims to facilitate new interdisciplinary collaboration to design and create digital tools specifically for linguistic analysis, and thereby stimulate new funding initiatives. During the workshop, participants will prioritize and draft tools and data structures. They will work largely in interest groups (e.g. in data annotation, migration, visualization, and resource interoperation) and for each interest area will prepare design sketches of and implementation plans for at least one tool. We particularly want to address the needs of non-technologically-oriented language researchers, simulating the development of truly useful, stable, cross-platform, open-source tools that are both small (e.g. Unicode conversion scripts) and !
 large (e.g. a modular suite of linguistic data-analysis tools) in scope. 

The Summit will take place June 22-23, 2006 at Michigan State University, in association with both the summer Linguistic Society of America meeting (http://www.lsadc.org/info/meet-summer06-cfp.cfm) and the E-MELD [Electronic Metastructures for Endangered Language Data] meeting (''Tools and Standards: The State of the Art,'' http://emeld.org/workshop/2006/); DTS-L and E-MELD will meet together on the morning of 22 June.

We encourage submissions from Indigenous/First Nations language workers and graduate students, for whom a limited number of travel and housing subsidies will be available, pending funding. 

Selection

Participants will not submit abstracts or make individual oral presentations of their own projects. Instead, since this summit is based on discussions in small working groups, participants are requested to submit one-page issue statements, which will form the basis for the working group themes for the first conference day. In these issue statements, we urge applicants to present one issue or idea which would serve to improve linguistic scholarship. Submissions should consider and explicate one or more of the following issues:

1. What are the most pressing needs among possible cyberinfrastructure and/or digital tools for linguistics?
2. What are some enduring challenges in creating cyberinfrastructure and/or digital tools for linguistics?
3. Which existing resources can be leveraged to create digital tools for linguistics? 
4. How can documentation tools make language resources (e.g. text, lexical or morphological corpora) more readily available for historical, typological, and other theoretical analyses?  

Each issue paper must be accompanied by a short (half page or less) biography. 

Submissions address:  	pri@ku.edu
Deadline:	                Issue statements and biographies are due on
                                                <deadline>31 March 2006</deadline>. 
Length. 	                                Issue statements: one page. Biographies: one
                                                half-page.
