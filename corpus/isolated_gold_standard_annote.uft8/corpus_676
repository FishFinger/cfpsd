Meeting Description:

The aim of ACSS 2010 is to encourage academics and scholars to meet and exchange
ideas and views in a forum encouraging respectful dialogue. This international
conference will bring together a number of university scholars working
throughout Japan, Asia, and beyond to share ideas. 

ACSS 2010 will afford the opportunity for renewing old acquaintances, making new
contacts, and networking across higher education. It is hoped that academics
working in Japan and Asia will be encouraged to forge working relationships with
each other, as well as with colleagues from Europe and the US, facilitating
partnerships across borders.

Theme: 'East Meets West in Pursuit of a Sustainable World'

The theme of the Inaugural Asian Conference on the Social Sciences is 'East
Meets West. For more than a decade, sustainability has emerged a global issue
for business and industry, government, and academia. Historically,
sustainability has been associated with environmental concerns such as the
energy crisis and global warming. Today, however, it is recognized that
social/economic justice is equally important to achieving a sustainable future.
Thus, issues such as poverty, hunger, education, health care, and access to
markets should be a part of the evolution of any comprehensive sustainability
paradigm. The conference will address these various dimensions of human
sustainability. We look forward to seeing you in Osaka in June 2010. 

Theme
The conference's theme is 'East Meets West in Pursuit of a Sustainable World'
and the organizers encourage submissions that approach this questions from a
variety of perspectives. However, the submission of other topics for
consideration is welcome and we also encourage submissions within and across a
variety of disciplines and fields related to the Social Sciences, including the
following:

- Anthropology, Archaeology, Cultural Studies and Humanities
- Media and Communications
- Economics and Management
- Education and Social Welfare
- Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Gender
- Natural, Environmental and Health Sciences
- Politics, Public Policy and Law
- Psychology, Cognitive Science and the Behavioral Sciences
- Research Methodologies, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods
- Sociology and Geography
- Technology and Applied Sciences

Other Areas of Social Sciences, including interdisciplinary research.

NB Abstracts should be 250-500 words in length and will be blind reviewed by a
voluntary team of peer reviewers. Authors are limited to one abstract
submission, whether as lead or secondary author.
