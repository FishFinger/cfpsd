1. THE SPECIAL ISSUE

The special issue will concentrate on the theoretical aspects of
computational
research on prepositions. Due to their importance in computational tasks
prepositions, as well as prepositional phrases and markers of various sorts,
have received a considerable amount of attention and occupied a central
position in research in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Language
Technology
(LT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well
as Computational Psycholinguistics (CP).  Researchers from these backgrounds
and CL-related disciplines have looked at the role of prepositions in
shallow
and deep language processing.

Despite increasing awareness of the importance of prepositions in NLP tasks,
very little progress has been made in systematically describing preposition
semantics. Notably, the only account of the lexical semantics of
prepositions
in resources such as WordNet, FrameNet and PropBank is indirect, in that
they
feature in significant numbers within multiword expressions or as frame
elements. If prepositions are to be incorporated into such resources as
first-order entities, a large number of issues must be resolved such as how
to
taxonomically deconstruct the spatial semantics of prepositions, how to
delineate preposition senses, and how to tease apart preposition and verb
semantics in phrasal verbs. Our expectation is that such questions will be
guided by careful analysis of what semantic distinctions and
representational
granularity are required in a range of applications, which will in turn be
guided by such research as the representation of prepositions within
implemented grammars, crosslingual preposition semantics, machine perception
and visualisation of preposition semantics, and computational models of the
human processing of prepositions.

2. TOPICS OF INTEREST

For the proposed special issue we specifically invite submissions that bring
a
theoretical basis to research on prepositions in lexical resources and NLP
tasks of the sort described above. In particular, we focus on the syntactic
and semantic treatment of productive and collocational uses of prepositional
phrases and markers in resources such as WordNet and FrameNet, and the
utilization of such resources in NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation,
IE/IR
and QA.

* Extraction of Prepositions:

  There has been considerable research into extraction of prepositions and
  related constructions (e.g. phrasal verbs). Papers which describe the
  extraction of these constructions, including their subcategorisation
frames
  and alternation patterns, as are necessary for the semi-automatic
extension
  of lexical resources are particularly welcome.


* Representation of Prepositions in Lexical Resources:

  We encourage papers describing the challenges of providing adequate
  representation of prepositions and related constructions such as would be
  generally applicable in NLP applications.


* Prepositions in Applications:

  We invite papers that discuss the role of prepositions in NLP tasks,
  focusing specifically on what insights various applications offer for
  lexical resource building, what particular needs different application
areas
  have (e.g. what an ideal prepositional lexical resource would be like),
  necessary extensions to existing resources, and how prepositional lexical
  resources of various types could enhance performance over a given task
like
  MT, IR, QA and multi-modal systems.
