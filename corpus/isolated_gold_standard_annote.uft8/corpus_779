                             Call for Papers
       Seventh International Workshop on Constraint Handling Rules
                                CHR 2010

               http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~petervw/CHR2010/
                   Edinburgh (Scotland), July 20, 2010
             (co-located with ICLP 2010, part of FLOC 2010)

=========================================================================


Introduction

The CHR 2010 Workshop will be held July 20, 2010 in Edinburgh (Scotland)
at the occasion of the 26th International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP 2010), the premier international venue for presenting
research in logic programming. This year, ICLP is held as part of the
Fifth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2010). More information on the
venue and co-located conferences can be found on the FLOC website
(http://www.floc-conference.org/).

The Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language has become a major declara-
tive specification formalism and implementation language for constraint
reasoning algorithms and applications. Algorithms specified using infe-
rence rules, rewrite rules, sequents, proof rules, or logical axioms can
often be directly written in CHR. Its clean semantics facilitates pro-
gram design, analysis, and transformation. For more information, please
visit the CHR website (http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/projects/CHR/).

The aim of the CHR workshop series is to stimulate and promote interna-
tional research and collaboration on topics related to the CHR language.
The workshop is a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing
new results, interesting applications, and work in progress.
Previous Workshops on Constraint Handling Rules were organized in 2004
in Ulm (Germany), in 2005 in Sitges (Spain) at ICLP, in 2006 in Venice
(Italy) at ICALP, in 2007 in Porto (Portgual) at ICLP, in 2008 in Hagen-
berg (Austria) at RTA, and in 2009 in Pasadena (California, US) at ICLP.


Topics of Interest

The workshop calls for contributions on all aspects of CHR,
including topics such as:

   - (Operational) semantics
   - Program analysis (confluence, termination, ...)
   - Comparisons with related approaches
   - Expressivity and complexity
   - Language extensions (negation, modules, ...)
   - Constraint solvers
   - Implementation and optimization
   - Concurrency & parallelism
   - Program transformation and generation
   - Programming environments (debugging, confluence checking, ...)
   - Programming pearls

Application papers that describe experience with (industrial)
applications, are especially welcome.


Important dates

   - Abstract submission deadline: April 14, 2010
   - Paper submission deadline: <deadline>April 20, 2010</deadline>
   - Notification of acceptance: May 11, 2010
   - Final version due: May 23, 2010
   - Workshop date: July 20, 2010


Submission Information

The four broad categories for submissions are:

   1. technical papers for describing technically sound, innovative
      ideas that can advance the state of the art of CHR
   2. application papers, where the emphasis will be on the use of CHR
      in the application, on the impact on the application domain, and
      the lessons learned from this application
   3. system and tool papers, empasising the novelty, practicality,
      usability and general availability of the systems and tools
      described
   4. short papers, for ongoing work not yet ready for full publication
      and research project overviews.

All papers must describe original, previously unpublished research, and
must not simultaneously be submitted for publication elsewhere.
They must be written in English. Technical papers must not exceed 15
pages. The limit for short papers is 7 pages, as is the standard page
limit for application papers, and system and tool papers. However,
particularly strong contributions in the latter two areas may be
submitted as technical paper as well.

All papers must be in the Springer LNCS format. General information
about the Springer LNCS series and the LNCS authors' instructions are
available at the Springer LNCS home page
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0).

Submissions must be made via the Easychair submission system, available
at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr10
