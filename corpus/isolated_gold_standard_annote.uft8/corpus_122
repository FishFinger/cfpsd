Workshop Description
This workshop aims at attracting quality papers on Text Mining and 
Applications. Authors are invited to submit their papers on any of the 
issues identified below.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Text Mining:
Pattern extraction methodologies for: multi-word, multi-character and 
multi-pattern
Clustering, Classification and Summarization of documents
Word Sense Disambiguation: Semantic Restrictions extraction, Ontology 
and Thesauri
Language Learning from raw text
Algorithms and Data Structures for Text Mining

Applications:
Example-Based Machine Translation
Statistical Machine Translation
Corpus-Based Natural Language Processing
Intelligent Information Retrieval
Multilingual access to multilingual information
Question-Answering Systems
E-learning of languages

Invited Speaker: Gregory Grefenstette (CEA, France)

Important Dates: Full Paper: <deadline>June 3rd 2005</deadline>
Author Notification: 15 July 2005
Deadline for Final Camera-Ready Copies: <deadline>28 July 2005</deadline>


Authors are invited to submit original research contributions or 
experience reports in English. Scientific or technical articles 
describing state-of-the-art techniques, algorithms, systems, 
environments, problems or applications relevant to the area of Text 
Mining and Applications may be submitted.

The length of submitted full papers must not exceed 12 pages.
The Springer LNCS format must be used. Authors must prepare their 
submissions according to the instructions given by Springer-Verlag 
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.htm/). You can find more 
information on the website of the Conference under the submission menu.
Submissions will be made by electronic means, in PDF format, through the 
submission page available in the EPIA 2005 website.
In order to make blind reviewing possible, submissions must be 
anonymous. This requires that authors exercise some care not to identify 
themselves in their contributions. Authors should identify themselves on 
a separate page, including the title and author affiliation. This 
information should be omitted from the paper. Also, when referring to 
one's own work, authors must use the third person rather than the first 
person. References should include all published literature relevant to 
the paper, including previous works of the authors but it should not 
include unpublished works.
In order to have papers published at least one of the authors should be 
registered in the EPIA Conference. At least two program committee 
members with recognized expertise in described field will review each 
submission.

Workshop high quality full papers will be selected for publication in 
the main volume of conference proceedings, to be published by Springer, 
in the LNAI series. Good quality papers not selected for publication in 
the main volume conference proceedings and selected extended abstracts 
will be published in local workshop proceedings, in hard-copy, in CD-ROM 
and in the web.
