Meeting Description:

The Center for Research In Syntax, Semantics & Phonology (CRISSP) in Brussels is pleased to host the 15th annual Conference of the Student Organization of Linguistics in Europe, from January 11 to 13, 2007.

ConSOLE is organized by a different European university every year and provides a forum for students of linguistics from all over the world to present their research. 

2nd Call for Papers

Abstracts are solicited from all areas of generative linguistics including but not limited to phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. ConSOLE is a conference on theoretical linguistics, so papers in fields like psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics or phonetics will also be welcome if they have a theoretical orientation. 

Guidelines for Abstracts:

Abstracts should not exceed two pages, including data, references and diagrams. Abstracts should be typed in at least 11-point font, with one-inch margins (letter-size; 8''1/2 by 11'' or A4) and a maximum of 50 lines of text per page. Abstracts must be anonymous and submissions are limited to 1 individual and 1 joint abstract per author. We will only accept abstracts by students (i.e. people not having defended a PhD. in linguistics by <deadline>September 15th</deadline>). 

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Send name, affiliation, e-mail, mailing address and title of the paper in the body of the message. The anonymous abstract should be sent as an attachment, and only abstracts in pdf format will be accepted. Abstracts should be sent to console@crissp.be.

Accepted papers are allotted 30 minutes for presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion.   

Invited Speakers:

Important Dates:

Deadline for abstracts: <deadline>September 15th</deadline> 

Notification of acceptance: November 15th 

Final program: December 1st 

Conference: January 11-13
