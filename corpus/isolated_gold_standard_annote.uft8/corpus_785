Meeting Description:

The focus of this pre-conference workshop will be on a set of topical issues
pertaining to corpus-based studies on the language of news, including both
printed and broadcast news. So far, corpus studies in this context have focused
mainly on written media and on the language of newspapers in particular. While
not disregarding these studies, the workshop is intended to also address the
interplay of different media in the actualization of news on television, radio
and on the Internet. For example, we will also look at blogs, podcasts,
vodcasts, and video sharing from a corpus-linguistic perspective. 

Call for Papers

Papers (20 mins + 10 mins discussion) are invited, mainly focusing on
methodological and theoretical issues concerning two lead questions: 
- How can corpora and corpus-linguistic methods be applied to the study of news
in old and new media, including the wide range of Internet-based communication?
- How do corpora and corpus-linguistic methods have to change to come to grips
with this new multi-modal scenario?

Deadline
The deadline for the submission of abstracts (max 400 words) is <deadline>20 December
2009</deadline>. Please indicate your name and affiliation, your snail mail and email
address on the abstract and send it as a Word document to:
roberta.facchinetti@univr.it

Notification of acceptance will be sent out by 31 January 2010.
