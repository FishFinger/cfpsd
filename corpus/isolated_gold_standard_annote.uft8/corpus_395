Full Title: DGfS Workshop: Experimental evidence for minimal structure 

Date: 28-Feb-2007 - 02-Mar-2007
Location: Siegen, Germany

Meeting Email: petra.burkhardt@staff.uni-marburg.de

Linguistic Field(s): Linguistic Theories; Neurolinguistics; Psycholinguistics 

Call Deadline: <deadline>31-Jul-2006</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

The purpose of the workshop is to present and discuss evidence for minimal structure from current psycho- and neurolinguistic research. The workshop will take place as part of the Annual Conference of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS): http://www.dgfs.de/cgi-bin/dgfs.pl/tagung 

Call for Workshop: Experimental evidence for minimal structure 

In the past decade, the notion of minimality has received a lot of attention in various linguistic domains. For instance, minimal structure plays a prominent role in syntactic theory where a crucial assumption is that phrase structure building processes follow principles of minimality. In analogy, recent morphological approaches have proposed that inflectional systems can be captured by a minimal set of morphosyntactic categories and features. In phonology, but also in other linguistic domains, optimality-theoretic analyses have been adopted to account for the occurrence of the optimal (unmarked) surface form.

It has further been proposed that principles of minimal structure are reflected in language processing and our workshop therefore aims at linking theoretical claims with experimental findings. We invite presentations from all linguistic domains (including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) that provide psycho- and neurolinguistic evidence for the validity of minimal structures. In this respect, we also invite presentations that address conflict resolution strategies that are required in cases where minimal structures from two (or more) domains clash and where as a result, the output has to violate the minimality priniciple of one of the subdomains.

Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes for discussion.

Workshop organizers:
Petra Burkhardt, Department of Germanic Linguistics, University of Marburg
Ulrike Janssen, Department of Germanic Linguistics, University of Marburg
