International Natural Language Generation Conference
INLG'2006

Sydney, Australia
15-16 July 2006

Call for Papers


The 4th International Natural Language Generation Conference
(the Biennial Meeting of the Special Interest Group in
Natural Language Generation - SIGGEN) will be held July
15 to 16, 2006 in Sydney, Australia.

INLG is the leading international conference on research
into natural language generation. It has been held at
Brockenhurst (UK) in 2004, in New York (USA) in 2002, and in
Mitzpe Ramon (Israel) in 2000. Before 2000, INLGs were
International Workshops, running every other year since 1980.
INLG provides a forum for the discussion, dissemination
and archiving of research topics and results in the field
of text generation.

INLG invites substantial, original, and unpublished
submissions on all topics related to natural language
generation.

Active topics of interest include:
* Discourse Models, Content Planning and Lexical and
            Syntactic Realization;
* Architecture of generators;
* Psychological modelling of discourse production
            and pragmatic influences on generation;
* Multilingual generation;
* Generation and summarization;
* Multimedia or Multimodal Generation;
* Applications of generation technology; and,
* Evaluation of generation results.

INLG will be held this year as a Coling/ACL workshop to take
advantage of having a large part of the Natural Language
Processing community in Sydney, and attract both NLG
specialists and researchers who may not think of themselves
as part of the NLG community (e.g., researchers in
summarisation and question/answering, or dialogue systems).

Submission Information

Requirements - A paper accepted for presentation at INLG'2006
must not have been presented at any other meeting with
publicly available proceedings. Submission to other
conferences should be clearly indicated on the paper.

Category of Papers - The conference will be organised as
a 2 day workshop, including sessions to present long
papers, short papers, a student session and a specific
session on sharing data and comparative evaluation.

Authors must designate one of these categories at submission time:

- Long papers are most appropriate for presenting
substantial research results and must not exceed
eight (8) pages, including references;

- Short papers are more appropriate for presenting an
ongoing research effort and must not exceed three (3) pages,
including references;

- Papers in the student session must not exceed eight
(8) pages, including references. The author MUST be a
student, and, when there are multiple authors, they MUST
all be students.

Special Session on Sharing Data and Comparative Evaluation:

A separate call for expressions of interest in the special
session will be distributed soon.

Important Dates

Submission of papers:    <deadline>April 19th, 2006</deadline>
Notification of acceptance or rejection: May 22nd, 2006
Submission of camera-ready copy: <deadline>June 6th, 2006</deadline>
Workshop date: July 15-16th, 2006

Paper Submission - Submission will be electronic and
the only accepted format for submitted papers will be
Adobe PDF. Submissions should follow the two-column format
of ACL proceedings (see the guidelines provided on the
Coling/ACL 2006 conference website). Submissions should
be made via the START system, in the same way as the
submissions for Coling/ACL. Details will be available
on the Coling/ACL web site (http://www.acl2006.org).

Reviewing will be blind, so you should avoid identifying
the authors within the paper. Late submissions will not
be accepted.
Note that in extreme cases, an author unable to comply
with the above submission procedure should contact the
program chairs sufficiently before the submission deadline
so alternative arrangements can be made.
