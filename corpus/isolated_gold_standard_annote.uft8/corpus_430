Date: 01-Aug-2006 - 05-Aug-2006
Location: Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria 
Contact Person: Yisa Yusuf

Linguistic Field(s): Anthropological Linguistics; Discourse Analysis; Ling & Literature; Pragmatics; Sociolinguistics

Meeting Description:

This conference is convened to examine the ubiquity, versatility and resilience of proverbs as Africa continues to strive to balance tradition with modernity. 

PROVERB CONFERENCE IN NIGERIA
 
CALL FOR PAPERS
 
Theme:
 
CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON AFRICAN PROVERBS
 
1ST - 5TH AUGUST, 2006
 
Venue:
 
Conference Centre, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria
 
As Eustace Egblewogbe puts it, ''African proverbs everywhere?are a distillation of the wisdom of the people derived over the ages from a careful observation of everyday experiences involving human beings, nature, and animals, as well as natural phenomena and social events.''  Moreover, as is asserted in the proverb about proverbs recorded by Wolfgang Mieder, ''A good maxim is never out of season.''  When radical changes occur in society, these proverbs adapt accordingly because, as Mieder further notes, due to their flexibility, proverbs can be ''intentionally changed to fit the needs and thoughts of modern people.'' It is in the light of the foregoing that this conference is convened to examine the ubiquity, versatility and resilience of proverbs as Africa continues to strive to balance tradition with modernity.  
 
The sub-themes for the conference include but are not limited to the following:
 
-Proverbs and Literature
