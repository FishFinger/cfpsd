Meeting Description:

International Conference on Language and Gender in African Contexts 
Date: 13 - 15 April, 2010
Venue: Conference Centre, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, 
Osun State, Nigeria

We are pleased to invite you to attend the International Conference on Language
and Gender in African Contexts scheduled to take place at Obafemi Awolowo
University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, from 13-15 April, 2010. Similar events have taken
place at the University of Leeds, U.K., City University, London, U.K.,
University of Botswana, Botswana, and the University of Dschang, Dschang,
Cameroon. The Obafemi Awolowo University conference is planned to be the final
in the series. 

Call for Papers

The main purpose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for those 
researching and teaching in the area of language and gender, directly or
indirectly, to share their ideas and experiences, and to build up a focus on
Africa in the field of language and gender study. We hope to enhance
participants' understanding of language and gender issues in general in terms of
language and language use in Africa. We also plan to collect some data for a
research project that may be of interest to us all. Lastly, we hope to stimulate
interdisciplinary work among linguists and other colleagues in the social sciences.

The deadline for the submission of abstracts is <deadline>12 February, 2010</deadline>.
