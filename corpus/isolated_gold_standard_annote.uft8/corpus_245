Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2010

http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/

June 1 - June 6, 2010, Los Angeles, California

Important Dates:
* Deadline for BOTH Full and Short paper submission: <deadline>Tuesday, December 1, 2=
009</deadline>
* NEW: Author Response period: January 12-14, 2010 =

* Notification to Authors: Monday, January 25, 2010
* Final, camera-ready papers due: <deadline>Mar 31, 2010</deadline>

NAACL is pleased to announce the North American Chapter of the Association =
for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT) 201=
0 conference.  The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines workin=
g towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natura=
l language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through service=
s such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval,=
 text summarization, and information extraction. This year, we are especial=
ly interested in papers discussing research with noisy data, including data=
 from informal communications (such as, Twitter, Blogs, Email, SMS) and pro=
cessed data (such as, Speech, OCR, Historical Data, and Machine Translation=
).  NAACL HLT 2010 will feature full papers, short papers, demonstrations, =
and a doctoral consortium, as well as pre-conference tutorials and post-con=
ference workshops.  The conference invites the submission of full and short=
 papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in disciplines t=
hat could impact human language processing systems. We also encourage the s=
ubmission of short papers that can be characterized as a small, focused con=
tribution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or an in=
teresting application note.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are unders=
tood to be applied to speech and/or text: =

* Phonology
* Morphology (including word segmentation)
* Part of speech tagging
* Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms) =

* Grammar Engineering
* Word sense disambiguation
* Lexical semantics
* Formal semantics and logic
* Mathematical Linguistics
* Textual entailment and paraphrasing
* Discourse and pragmatics
* Knowledge acquisition and representation
* Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing =

* Multilingual processing
* Noisy data analysis
* Large-scale language processing
* Machine translation
* Language generation
* Summarization
* Question answering
* Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
* Information extraction
* Topic classification and information filtering
* Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/ genre analysis) =

* Topic clustering
* Text and speech mining
* Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
* Speech indexing and retrieval
* Speech analysis and recognition
* Speech synthesis
* Speech understanding
* Dialog(ue) systems
* Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human- robot interact=
ion, education and  learning systems, assistive technologies, digital enter=
tainment) =

* Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
* Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, annotated =
corpora) =

* Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information  structure and so=
urces in speech) =

* Multimodal representations and processing, including speech, gaze, gestur=
e, and other sensory inputs

SUBMISSIONS

Full papers: NAACL HLT 2010 submissions must describe substantial, original=
, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation=
 and analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness=
, originality, technical strength, significance, replicability, contributio=
ns to research resources, relevance to the conference, and interest to the =
attendees. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program commi=
ttee members.
Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus one extra=
 page for references, and will be presented orally or as a poster presentat=
ion as determined by the program committee.=A0 The decisions as to which pa=
pers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be bas=
ed on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. There will be no d=
istinction in the proceedings between full papers presented orally and thos=
e presented as poster presentations.=A0=A0 =


Short papers: NAACL HLT 2010 also solicits short papers. Short paper submis=
sions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadline=
 this year is also <deadline>December 1, 2010</deadline> by 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time (GMT-8=
).  Characteristics of past short papers include:
* A small, focused contribution
* Work in progress
* A negative result
* An opinion piece
* An interesting application nugget

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and =
will be given four (4) pages including references in the proceedings. While=
 short papers will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, th=
ere will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presente=
d orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper subm=
ission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members. =


Submission Deadline: The deadline for both full and short papers is Decembe=
r 1, 2010 by 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time (GMT+8). =A0

Electronic Submission: Submission is electronic using paper submission soft=
ware at: https://www.softconf.com/naaclhlt2010/HLT2010/ =


Format: Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL=
 HLT 2010 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one=
 extra page for references.=A0 Short paper submissions should also follow t=
he two-column format of NAACL HLT 2010 proceedings, and should not exceed f=
our (4) pages including references.=A0We strongly recommend the use of ACL =
LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's co=
nference, which will be available soon on the conference website under http=
://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu/authors.html.  Submissions must conform to the offi=
cial style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they mus=
t be electronic in PDF. As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not =
include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references t=
hat reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)=
 ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously sho=
wed (Smith, 1991) ..."  Papers that do not conform to these requirements wi=
ll be rejected without review.=A0 In addition, please do not post your subm=
issions on the web until after the review process is complete.  =

Multiple-submission policy: Papers that have been or will be submitted to o=
ther meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time.  Autho=
rs submitting multiple papers to NAACL HLT may not submit papers that overl=
ap significantly (> 50%) with each other in content or results.  Authors of=
 papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2010 must notify the program=
 chairs by February 15, 2010 as to whether the paper will be presented.  Al=
l accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proc=
eedings.  We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that ov=
erlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have=
 been) published elsewhere.
