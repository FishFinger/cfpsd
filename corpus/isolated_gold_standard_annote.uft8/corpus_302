Meeting Description:

63rd Annual Kentucky Foreign Language Conference
April 15-17, 2010 - University of Kentucky - Lexington, Kentucky

The KFLC has a tradition of attracting scholars from a broad range of languages 
and specializations. This year's conference will have sessions in Arabic,
French, German, Italian, Luso-Brazilian, Russian, Hispanic Studies, and Second
Language Acquisition. We also encourage submissions that analyze data from a
variety of native and target languages to encourage cross-linguistic dialogue
for future research. 

Call for Papers

Second Language Acquisition

Deadline for submission of abstracts: November 22nd 

Kentucky Foreign Language Conference is proud to announce special sessions 
devoted to the presentation of scholarly research in the area of Second Language
Acquisition as it relates to the acquisition of languages other than English.  

Abstracts are invited in all areas and aspects of Second Language Acquisition 
including, but not limited to:
- naturalistic and classroom-based research using data from experimental, 
observational, and/or questionnaire research 
- cognitive, socio-cultural, and generative approaches to SLA
- research design in SLA/L2 pedagogy
- interlanguage development and variation
- assessment of language learning outcomes
- pedagogical research with implications for classroom-based, instructed SLA
- acquisition of L2 pragmatic, sociolinguistic, and cultural competences
- heritage language and/or second dialect acquisition and pedagogy
- corpus-based and computational approaches to the study of SLA
- research into the teaching of languages for specific purposes, e.g. language
for the professions.

Sessions are 20 minutes followed by a 10 minute questions & answer period. In 
addition to individual abstracts for paper presentations, proposals will be
considered for complete panels of five papers organized around a common theme.

Abstracts should be no more than one page in length (approx. 200-250 words) and
should include author's name, affiliation and contact coordinates. Panel
proposals are also limited to one page in length and should include the theme of
the panel, the organizer's name and contact information, and the names and
affiliations of the panel participants (all abstracts should be assembled by the
panel organizer and submitted with the panel proposal). In view of the
multi-lingual audience, the language of presentation is English. Those wishing
to submit proposals for issues relative to CALL, CMC, and other areas addressing
the intersection between SLA and technologically enhanced language learning are
encouraged to submit their proposals to the Language Technology sessions.

Deadline for submission of abstracts and panel proposals is November 22nd . 
Please visit the following website for more information and to submit: 
http://www.kflcabstracts.uky.edu/

Acceptance of a paper or complete panel implies a commitment on the part of 
participants to register and attend the conference. All presenters must pay the 
appropriate registration fee by February 15th  to be included in the program.

For more information on conference logistics and to submit your abstract/panel 
proposal, please visit http://www.as.uky.edu/kflc/. For specific questions
regarding the SLA sessions, please contact the SLA section leaders Alan Brown
(alan.brown@uky.edu), Mingzhen Bao (mingzhenbao@uky.edu ) and Stayc DuBravac
(sdubravac@uky.edu). 

We hope to see you in beautiful Lexington next spring for the Kentucky Foreign 
Language Conference!
