EPILANGUAGES. BEYOND IDIOMS AND LANGUAGES
Call for a collective volume.

In the history of scholarship, scholars daily practicing vernacular idioms have
successively been writing and/or speaking Latin and English as the vehicular
languages used to communicate texts and ideas. Somewhere between
archiphonemes/archisemes and metalanguages, which could be considered
semi-synonyms, the 'epilanguages' are the linguistic realities and results
generated by the use of a second language for scholarly and scientific purposes.
What kind of thought does a scholar produce when (s)he uses these epilanguages
(mostly Latin or English)? How does (s)he think, and what does (s)he write? How
differently does his/her thinking and writing work when (s)he uses the vehicular
(epilinguistic) tools? The contributors of this volume are invited to
investigate how in the present and in the past the conceptual and linguistic
shifting from the vernacular to the vehicular has generated what we could call
an 'epilinguistic' way of thinking. To what extent are the texts created in this
way more far-distant from their mental sources, even maybe sounding
'schizophrenic' (i. e. cut-off from reality), than the texts the same scholar
would write in his own idiom? What are the specific characteristics of these
texts: objectivity, cerebrality, artificiality, epiphenomenality, coldness,
impersonality, conventionality, formularity, stereotypicality, or other traits
we may think of? The contributors are invited to question their own experience
as much as the historical examples available at the different centuries of
history of scholarship. All the fields of science and knowledge (outside of
philology and linguistics themselves) can be explored.

The language of the volume is English. The proposals (paper titles and
abstracts) are expected to be submitted before <deadline>June 2007</deadline>, and the completed
essays due <deadline>June 2009</deadline>, for a publication planned in 2010.
