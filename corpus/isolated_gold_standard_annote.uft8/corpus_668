Reminder - Call for Abstracts

'Dynamics of First Language Attrition across the Lifespan'
Special issue of the International Journal of Bilingualism

Please be reminded of the deadline of <deadline>22 December 2009</deadline> for the call for
abstracts, as outlined below.=20


Background

Studies into the language of bilinguals have traditionally interpreted
non-linear, or even erratic, developments to be 'noise' in the system
(Herdina & Jessner, 2002, p. 78). However, in an attempt to acknowledge
such 'noise', an approach consistent with dynamic systems theory proposes
that the presence of one or more language systems influences the
development of not only the L2, 'but also the development of the overall
multilingual system' (Herdina & Jessner, 2002, p. 28). =20

In response to the recent proposal that dynamic systems theory is a
candidate for an overall theory of language development (de Bot, Lowie &
Verspoor, 2007; Herdina & Jessner, 2002), as well as an increase in
research activity in the area of first language attrition (see for example
Schmid, 2009; K=F6pke, 2007), we seek high quality abstracts contributing
theoretical and/or empirical perspectives to a special issue of the
International Journal of Bilingualism entitled 'Dynamics of First Language
Attrition across the Lifespan'. Contributions encompassing longitudinal
findings and those which not only document but explain (ir-)regularities
(Ellis, 2007, p. 23) on the basis of dynamic systems theory are
particularly welcome.
