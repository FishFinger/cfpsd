CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

HCSNet Workshop on Human and Machine Speech
Sydney
Dec. 1, 2006 (1 day)

A one-day workshop on Human and Machine Speech will be hosted by 
HCSNet. In this event the likely synergies between Human and Machine 
speech recognition will be explored. Specifically, it seems plausible 
that understanding human speech recognition will provide insights 
into how automatic speech recognition (ASR) might be improved. On the 
other hand, we know the conditions under which humans learn speech, 
but not exactly how they come to do it. Here, insights gained from 
implementing machine systems have the potential to throw light on 
constraints inherent in the development of human speech perception.

The Human and Machine Speech Workshop will be held under the umbrella 
of the HCSNet SummerFest, a multi-disciplinary event encompassing a 
number of workshops and courses held around the theme of Human 
Communication Science. The SummerFest will also include "Speed Paper" 
presentation sessions, open to researchers to present their research 
areas to the wider community. Any registrants presenting in the 
Speed Paper sessions or at an associated workshop will have their 
registration fee waived for the whole event.

There will be the possibility of poster presentations in addition to 
the regular talks, in order to encourage more interactive discussion 
of research-in-progress. In this regard, we encourage submissions 
from students describing their thesis work and any preliminary 
results. Note that both publication types will have the same status 
in the proceedings.

Topics

We invite the submission of abstracts on original and unpublished 
research on all aspects of speech processing and recognition, 
including, but not limited to:
    * Modeling human speech recognition
    * Prominence and prosody in Visual and Auditory speech
    * Infant directed speech
    * Foreigner-directed computer-directed, and exaggerated speech
    * Perceiving accented speech
    * Human speech development
    * Semantics and perceptual grounding
    * Acoustic phonetic modeling
    * Computational models of speech and/or speech development
    * Automatic Speech Recognition
    * Speech coding
    * Statistical properties of speech

We welcome submissions on any relevant topic that is of interest to 
the speech community, and particularly encourage submissions that 
broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of 
practical speech recognition applications and through 
multi-disciplinary research.

Submission

Submission is by abstract only. No full papers are required. 
Submissions of abstracts should be in a single paragraph and should 
not exceed 400 words. The preferred submission format is MSWord or 
PDF. If this introduces problems, please contact the organisers 
beforehand. The workshop will adopt a "single-blind" refereeing 
process for the abstracts: the reviewers will be made aware of the 
identity of the authors of submitted papers, but the identity of the 
reviewers will not be revealed to the authors. As such, all abstracts 
should include the full authors' names and affiliations.

Please submit your abstract via email using the following naming 
convention in the subject line of your email:

[surname]_[initial]_[event]

Where [event] is H&M (Human and Machine Speech Workshop).

For example:
    * Buckley_K_H&M = Kym Buckley's abstract for the Human and 
Machine Speech Workshop

Please mail your submissions to us at sfest06@hcsnet.edu.au by <deadline>8 September 2006</deadline>.

Important dates

    * Abstract submission: <deadline>September 8, 2006</deadline>
    * Notification of acceptance: September 29, 2006
    * Workshop: Dec 1, 2006
