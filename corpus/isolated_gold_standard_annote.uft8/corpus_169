       First Call For Papers

       International Workshop on


        MULTIMODAL CORPORA:
   FROM MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOUR THEORIES
        TO USABLE MODELS


       Saturday 27 May 2006
         1 day workshop 

    http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mmc06/
       
**********************************************

In Association with LREC2006 (the 5th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation)
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2006/
Main Conference 24-25-26 May 2006
Magazzini del Cotone Conference Center
Genoa - Italy

-------------------------
MOTIVATIONS
-------------------------

'Multimodal Corpora' target the recording and annotation of several communication modalities
such as speech, hand gesture, facial expression, body posture, etc.
Theoretical issues are also addressed, given their importance to the design of multimodal corpora.

This workshop follows similar events held at LREC'2000, LREC'2002 and LREC'2004. 
There is an increasing interest in multimodal communication and multimodal corpora 
as visible by recently launched European Networks of Excellence 
and integrated projects such as HUMAINE, SIMILAR, CHIL and AMI, 
and similar efforts in the USA and in Asia. 
Furthermore, the success of recent conferences dedicated to multimodal 
communication (ICMI'2005, IVA'2005, Interacting Bodies'2005, 
Nordic Symposium on Multimodal Communication 2005) also testifies the growing interest in this area, 
and the general need for data on multimodal behaviours.

The focus of this LREC'2006 workshop on multimodal corpora will be on non-verbal communication studies
and their contribution to the definition of collection protocols, coding schemes,
inter-coder agreement measures and reliable models of multimodal behaviour that can be built
from corpora and compared to results that can be found in the literature.

Topics to be addressed in the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Studies of multimodal behaviour 
- Multimodal interaction in groups and meetings
- Building models of behaviour from multiple sources of knowledge : manual annotation, image processing, motion capture, literature studies
- Coding schemes for the annotation of multimodal video corpora
- Validation of multimodal annotations
- Exploitation of multimodal corpora in different types of applications (information extraction, information retrieval, meeting transcription, multi-modal interfaces, translation, summarisation, www services, communication and clinical studies, HCI design)
- Methods, tools, and best practices for the acquisition, creation, management, access, distribution, and use of multimedia and multimodal corpora
- Metadata descriptions of multimodal corpora
- Benchmarking of systems and products; use of multimodal corpora for the evaluation of real systems
- Automated multimodal fusion and/or generation (e.g., coordinated speech, gaze, gesture, facial expressions)

We expect the output of this one day workshop to be:
1) a deeper understanding of the theoretical issues and research questions
related to verbal and non-verbal communication that multimodal corpora should address,
2) how such corpora should be built in order to provide useful and usable answers
to research questions,
and 3) an updated view of state-of-the-art research on multimodal corpora.
