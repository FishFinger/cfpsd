Meeting Description:

The 17th Balkan and South Slavic Linguistics, Literature and Folklore Conference
will take place at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA, April
15-18, 2010.

The conference will feature the Kenneth E. Naylor Memorial Lecture in South
Slavic Linguistics on Friday April 16. This year's Naylor Lecturer will be Eric
P. Hamp, Professor Emeritus from the University of Chicago. The conference will
also be held concurrently with the Midwest Slavic Conference.

This conference highlights research on languages, literatures and cultures of
the Southeast European region, both individually and in relation to one another.
While a venue for research on areal linguistic convergence and contact, the
scope of the conference extends to other South Slavic (but not properly Balkan)
groups, and to other types of linguistic investigation. 

Call for Papers
