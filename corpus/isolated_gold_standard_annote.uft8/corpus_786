Meeting Description:

AFLA 17
Stony Brook University
May 7-9 2010

The Department of Linguistics at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook NY, will
host the 17th annual meeting of the Austronesian Formal Linguistics 
Association. The conference dates are May 7-9, 2010. 

Call for Papers

Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (20+10) on any aspect of formal 
linguistics (morphology, phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics) of any 
Austronesian language(s). Submission limitations are one singly-authored 
abstract and one jointly-authored abstract per applicant. Abstracts should be
limited to a maximum of two pages (for text, examples, trees, tableaux, 
references), with margins of one inch and in 12 pt. type. Abstracts should be
submitted as pdf files (see conference website for further details).

A special session on the psycholinguistics (e.g., acquisition, processing) of 
Austronesian languages will be scheduled, and so we particularly encourage 
abstracts in these areas.

Invited Speakers:
Edith Aldridge, University of Washington
Peter Cole and Gabriella Hermon, University of Delaware
Abigail Cohn, Cornell University

Deadline for submission of abstracts is Monday <deadline>February 1, 2010</deadline>.  Please refer
to the AFLA17 website, www.afla17.org, for further information, or contact the
organizers at afla17@afla17.org
