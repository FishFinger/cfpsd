Subject: CFP for a Volume on Yeismo 
 

We would like to invite scholars submit papers that investigate issues 
of yeismo, or the different realizations of the palatal lateral /ll/ in 
Spanish, and / or its merge with the mid-palatal fricative /y/. The 
purpose is to compile in one volume the many works that are being 
carried out on this topic in order to have a clear picture of the status of 
this phenomenon in the different varieties of Spanish spoken in Latin 
America, Spain, and any other places where Spanish is an official 
language.
 
Some topics may include, but are not limited to: 
1. Sociolinguistic studies (age, gender, level of education, etc.)
2. Attitudes towards yeismo
3. Synchronic and Diachronic studies on yeismo
4. Mass media and yeismo, recommendations by style guides, 
prescriptive attitudes in the academic arena etc.
5. Any other topics related to the evolution of yeismo in Spanish
6. Papers must be between 6000 and 8000 words.

Please send proposals or completed papers accompanied by 
abstracts via email attachment (MSWord or RTF) <deadline>November 15, 2006</deadline>. 
Please include a short curriculum vitae and your contact information.

For more information, contact me by phone or email.
