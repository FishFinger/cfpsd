Call Deadline: <deadline>10-Dec-2009</deadline> 

Meeting Description:

Workshop at the 11th International Congress of Finno-Ugric Studies (CIFU11)
Piliscsaba, Hungary, August 9-14, 2010 

2nd Call for Papers

Deadline: <deadline>December 10</deadline>

The Uralic language family is known for its negative auxiliary verbs, but the
negation systems of the Uralic languages are interesting in many other ways as
well. All types of negative markers - negative verbs, particles, affixes- are
found, and negation interacts in intricate ways with phenomena such as focus,
quantifiers, word order, case marking, tense, mood and aspect. These issues have
not been systematically explored in the Uralic languages.

The workshop will bring together scholars working on negation in Uralic
languages and/or in a typological perspective. The goal is to reach a more
systematic and typologically informed picture of negation in Uralic. The event
will take place as one of the symposia at the 11th International Congress of
Finno-Ugric Studies (CIFU11) in Piliscsaba, Hungary, August 9-14, 2010.

We invite abstracts on any aspects of negation in Uralic languages. The main
focus is on the description/analysis of the systems of negation in these
languages, especially from a typological perspective, but we are open to all
theoretical approaches. We encourage contributors to take one of the following
viewpoints:

1. The description/analysis of the system of negation in one (or more) Uralic
languages
2. The description/analysis of a particular negation-related phenomenon (e.g.
negation of a specific clause type, negative polarity, interaction between
negation and case/TAM etc.) in several Uralic languages or across the whole
Uralic family.

3. Typology (or other theoretical approaches) and Uralic languages: what the
Uralic data can contribute to our understanding of negation or what typology (or
other theoretical approaches) can contribute to our understanding of negation in
Uralic.

Papers taking a different focus are of course equally welcome.

Abstracts (max. 2 pages) are due by <deadline>10 December 2009</deadline>. Notification of
acceptance: 10 January 2010. For organizational reasons, please indicate your
interest in participation as soon as possible (the preregistration for the main
conference precedes the registration for the workshop). 

Please send your abstract to both Matti Miestamo (matti.miestamo@helsinki.fi)
and Anne Tamm (anne.tamm@unifi.it).
