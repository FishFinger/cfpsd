Call for Papers
THE GEOSPATIAL WEB - How Geo-Browsers, Social Software 
and the Web 2.0 are Shaping the Network Society

http://geoweb.know-center.at/

You are cordially invited to submit chapters for an upcoming book on the
Geospatial Web, published by Springer London in the Advanced Information
and Knowledge Processing Series. By integrating cartographic data with
geo-tagged knowledge repositories, the emerging Geospatial Web will
revolutionize the production, distribution and consumption of media
products. This edited volume will bring together high quality contributions
on the technical foundations of the Geospatial Web, present information
services and collaborative environments built on top of geo-browsers such
as Google Earth and NASA World Wind, and investigate the economic and
societal impacts of such knowledge-intensive applications. A particular
focus of the book is the integration of geospatial and semantic technology,
for example to extract geospatial context from unstructured textual resources.

*** IMPORTANT DATES

<deadline>Oct 10, 2006</deadline>: Paper Submission Deadline
Nov 01, 2006: Notification of Acceptance
<deadline>Dec 01, 2006</deadline>: Camera-ready Copy of Final Chapters Due
May 31, 2007: Publication

*** SCOPE

The Geospatial Web will have a profound impact on managing knowledge and
structuring workflows within and across organizations, and on the
interaction between those organizations and their target audience.
Geo-browsers are an ideal platform to integrate (i) cartographic data such
as topographic maps and street directories, (ii) geo-tagged knowledge
repositories aggregated from public online sources or corporate Intranets,
and (iii) environmental indicators such as emission levels, ozone
concentrations, and biodiversity density.

This edited volume emphasizes the role of contextual knowledge in shaping
the emerging network society. It investigates the impact of geospatial
technology on content production environments, with an emphasis on hybrid
approaches that combine the advantages of individual and collaborative
content production - e.g. integrating 'edited' material from traditional
encyclopedias and news media with 'evolving' content from Wiki
applications. Such collaborative environments can be enriched by automated
aggregators for Web content and news feeds in RSS, RDF, or Atom formats.
Annotating content from these heterogeneous sources creates complex
knowledge repositories spanning multiple dimensions (space, time,
semantics, etc.). The size and complexity of these repositories calls for
new interface metaphors to increase their accessibility and transparency.
Possible topics for submissions include but are not limited to:

- State-of-the-art and emerging trends of geo-browsing platforms
- Knowledge acquisition and management in a geospatial context
- Knowledge relationship discovery and management; e.g. matching 
  geospatial relationships with semantic or temporal relationships
- Knowledge-intensive, location-based services
- Marketing of products and services via the Geospatial Web
- Annotation and ontology services as enablers of the Geospatial Web
- Natural language processing to extract geospatial context
- System architectures of dynamic, distributed geospatial applications
- Platform connectivity (mash-ups, add-ons, XML/RDF exchange formats)
- Collaborative authoring via geo-browsers 
  (Web 2.0 extensions, social software)
- Geospatial environments for knowledge workers
- Tracking the behavior of users navigating the Geospatial Web
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on geospatial interfaces
- Case studies of geospatial applications in various domains
  o Mapping of environmental indicators (sustainability)
  o Geo-temporal news browsers (media industry)
  o JIT information retrieval agents for destinations (tourism)
  o Emergency response simulations (crisis & disaster management)
- Societal implications (global awareness and identity, 
  impact of virtual communities)

*** SUBMISSION

Only electronic submissions will be accepted in either MS Word or RTF
format (word limits excl. references: full papers 4000-5000 words; short
papers: 1500-2000 words). Authors should identify the type of submission:
Completed Research, Research-In-Progress, Case Study. Submissions must be
based on the MS Word template at http://geoweb.know-center.at/, and neither
be published previously nor under consideration for publication elsewhere.
