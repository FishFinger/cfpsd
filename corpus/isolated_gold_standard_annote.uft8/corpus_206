               THIRD and LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

                         Workshop

        "Quality assurance and quality measurement for
            language and speech resources"

      on Saturday, May 27th 2006, in conjunction with

    LREC 2006, The 5th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
            LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION

                  Genoa, Italy, 24-26 May 2006

==>Submission deadline for your 4 page abstract is <deadline>Feb 17 2006</deadline><==

Workshop description:
=====================

The workshop aims at
- bringing together experience with and insights in quality
   assurance and measurement for language and speech resources in
   a broad sense (including multimodal resources, annotations,
   tools, etc),
- covering both qualitative and quantative aspects,
- identifying the main tools and strategies,
- analysing the strengths and weaknesses of current practice,
- establishing what can be seen as current best practice,
- reflecting on trends and future needs.

It can be seen as a follow-up of the workshop on speech resources
that took place at LREC 2004, but the scope is wider as we
include both language and speech resources. We feel that there is
a lot to be gained by bringing these communities together, if
only because the speech community seems to have a longer
tradition in resources evaluation than the written language
community.


Relevance:
=========

Quality assurance is an important concern for both the provider,
the distributor and the user of language and speech resources.
The concept of quality is only meaningful if both the producer
and the user of the resources can rely on the same set of quality
criteria, and if there are effective procedures to check whether
these criteria are met. The universe of possible types of
language resources is huge and evolves over time, and there is no
universal set of qualitative or quantitative criteria and tests
that can be applied to all sorts of resources.

In this workshop we will try to investigate what sorts of
criteria, tests and measures are being used by providers, users
and distribution agencies such as ELRA and LDC, and we will try
to distill from this current practice general recommendations for
quality assurance and measurement for language and speech
resources,

The workshop will look at quality assurance and quality measures
both from the provider, the distributor and the user point of
view, and will explicitly address special problems in
connection with very large corpora, including numerical measures,
comparison of corpora, exchange formats, etc.

Format:
======

The workshop will be a full-day event, and will include
(1) invited presentations (25+5 minutes) from data providers,
     distributors, or validators who are working on the basis of
     an explicit QA framework
(2) submitted papers (15+5 minutes) by others who can report on
     relevant QA experience in the production, validation or use
     of resources
(3) a round-table discussion aiming at establishing best practice

Papers:
======

We invite papers that
- describe or critically analyze existing quality measures
   used to compare or validate resources
- describe or critically analyze existing quality assurance
   practices in resources production
- describe or critically analyze existing approaches to
   quality validation or measurement of third party resources
- describe future directions aimed at improving quality assurance,
   validation and measurement procedures for language and speech resources

Timetable:
=========

- Paper submission deadline:   <deadline>Feb 17, 2006</deadline>
- Notification of acceptance:  March 10, 2006
- Final version of paper:      <deadline>April 10, 2006</deadline>
- Workshop:                    May 27, 2006 (full day)

Submissions:

up to 4 pages long. Submission format is PDF.

Papers will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the scientific
committee. The reviews are NOT anonymous.

Final versions of accepted papers are up to 6 pages long, and
should be submitted in the format specified for the proceedings
