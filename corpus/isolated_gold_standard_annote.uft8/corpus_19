			Second Call for Papers
			 IJCAI 2005 Workshop

		  GRAMMATICAL INFERENCE APPLICATIONS
		   Successes and Future Challenges

		  To be held in Edinburgh, Scotland,
		 prior to IJCAI-05 on July 31, 2005.

	       http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~menno/IJCAI05/

Background

There has been growing interest over the last few years in learning
grammars from text and other types of sequential, structured, and
semi-structured data.  The family of techniques enabling such learning
is usually called grammatical inference or grammar induction (GI).  It
makes use of results and techniques from, among others, machine
learning, formal language theory, computational learning theory, and
statistics to learn, induce or infer a grammar or an automaton from a
training sample.  There have been many theoretical and experimental
results in the field as well as a wide range of applications,
including computational linguistics, text mining, speech recognition,
computational biology, web intelligence, and robotics.


Aim of the workshop

The workshop is intended as a meeting point of researchers working on
applications of grammatical inference with more speculative ideas.

Some topics that are of interest are:
* Robotics: map learning, language learning
* Computational linguistics: parsing, natural language processing,
  language modelling
* Information extraction (IE): world wide web IE, wrapper induction,
  DTD learning
* User modelling: web usage mining, web personalization
* Semantic modelling: ontology learning
* Computational biology: biological sequence analysis, motif
  extraction, structure predictions
* Machine translation: transducer learning, language alignment,
  bi-language modeling
* Music modeling: musical style classification, automatic composition
Note that this is *not* an exhaustive list and non-classical
applications such as animal language modeling, strategy learning, etc.
are strongly encouraged. 

It should be noted that a tutorial on Grammatical Inference will be
given at IJCAI, enables those interested in getting an even more
general picture of the field and the techniques to do so.


Participants

The workshop is open to all members of the AI community and we
especially encourage papers from researchers who are interested in GI
and are working on applications where these techniques might be used
and researchers with a GI background that have an interest in
applications.

To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the workshop
will be limited to 40 participants and ample time will be allotted for
general discussion.  Attendance is limited to active participants
only.  Workshop attendees need not register for the main IJCAI
conference, but are encouraged to do so.


Format

The workshop will consist of 30 minute presentations and ample time
will be allocated for discussions.  In addition to the regular papers,
we will accept position papers.  Furthermore, there will be a panel
discussion on future and more speculative work in applications of GI.


Submission Guidelines

Submissions should be formatted as for the main IJCAI-05 conference
submissions.  Information on formatting can be found on the following
url (with some changes outlined below):
   http://ijcai05.csd.abdn.ac.uk/index.php?section=papers#format
The maximum number of pages for the papers in the workshop will be 10
(instead of 6 for the main conference).  Note however, it will *not*
be possible to purchase extra pages.

The submission guidelines for position papers are the same as for the
regular papers.  However, only 2 pages may be used.

Please submit the LaTeX source of the article (including all
non-standard style files and bibtex files) as well as the PDF file
of the article combined in one file.  The filename should have the
last name of the main author in it.

Submissions should be sent by email by <deadline>March 19, 2005</deadline>.  The file
should be sent to:
   Menno van Zaanen <menno@ics.mq.edu.au>
and the subject of the email should be:
   Grammatical Inference Applications: <author>
with <author> the name of the main author.

We encourage you to send a version some time before the deadline, so
we can test if the LaTeX sources compile correctly.  If you have
problems with the requirements, please let us know as soon as possible
(on the above email address).


Important dates

* Workshop paper submission deadline:     <deadline>March 19, 2005</deadline>.
* Workshop paper acceptance notification: April 12, 2005.
* Workshop paper camera-ready deadline:   <deadline>April 30, 2005</deadline>.
* Workshop dates:                         July 30 or 31, 2005.


Reviews

Submitted papers will be reviewed by referees from the Program
Committee.  Accepted papers will be published in the working notes of
the workshop.
