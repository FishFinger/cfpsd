Meeting Description:

The workshop topic is the role of linguistic variation for the cultural

areas (historical linguistics, creolistics, computational linguistics, ...) that
are interested in the application of evolutionary concepts to natural
language.

Invited speakers: Olga Fischer (Amsterdam) & Andrew Wedel
(Arizona)

The workshop is part of the annual meeting of the DGfS (German Linguistic
Society). 

The Role of Variation in Language Evolution
Workshop at the 29th annual meeting of the German Association for Linguistics

Last call for papers

The workshop will explore the precise role of linguistic variation in language
evolution. We invite submissions to the following (and related) topics:
-Empirical studies of language variation that are relevant for language
evolution. This includes experimental psycholinguistc studies as well as corpus
investigations;
-Computer simulations of language evolution;
-Formal and computational models of the micro-dynamics of language evolution,
like stochastic, exemplar based or memory based approaches;
-Studies of grammaticalization phenomena (and language change phenomena in
general) that relate diachronic change to synchronic variation;
-The role of variation in creolization;
-Mathematical models of language evolution.

For more details please consult the workshop website at: 
http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/gjaeger/dgfs2007/cfp.html

Submissions are invited for 60-minutes presentations (45 minutes + 15 minutes
