Subject: Endangered Language Breakdown 
 


In studying the syntax of an endangered language with a very fragmented
speech community, I have come to notice that the syntax varies across
informants, demonstrating a disintegration of the language into a several
separate extremely restricted dialects (almost idiolects). 

Different informants would produce the same sentence with an underlying L1
syntax, and then 'switch' into L2 syntax in specific clauses (not unlike
codeswitching). This syntactic mutation was regular within a speaker
(always occurred in the same environment) but varied across speakers. 

I would be interested in knowing whether anyone had heard or noticed a
similar situation in other languages, or could direct me towards relevant
(non-codeswitching) literature on the topic. 

Thank you.

Dear Linguists,

My colleages and me are planning to build a corpus for ESL learners. The
potential domains for the corpus involves (mainly) the learners'
development in second language lexicon and syntactic structures. I was
wondering if there is similar database already out there and if so, what
kind of software are you using? To put the inquiry more generally, any
suggestions for a good software that meet our requirements?

I will post a summary if necessary.
Many thanks,
Ressy

Subject: Language Policy and Education in the Philippines 
 


I am very interested in the effects of language policy in multilingual
societies on the efficacy of education. Most specifically, I am curious to
find out how the Filipino-English bilingual policy employed in the
Philippines affects the learning of those schoolchildren for whom neither
English nor Filipino/Tagalog is their first language or at least language
spoken at home. I am also interested in possible comparative studies
paralleling the education experience found in the Philippines as opposed to
that found in bilingual settings in the United States and other
multilingual countries like India.

I have found some literature on the effects of bi-/multilingual language
policy in the Philippines by Smolicz, both in the International Review of
Education and the International Journal of Bilingual Education and
Bilingualism, but his studies surveyed only high school age children on
their attitudes towards the use of the vernacular, Filipino, and English. I
am more interested in numerical data investigating the success rate of
schoolchildren based on linguistic background -- are Tagalog students, for
example, more successful at learning mathematics and social sciences
because it is taught in their native tongue? The answer should be
intuitive, I suppose, but I was curious to find out if any studies have
been done with this methodology and purpose.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Much thanks in advance,

Christopher Lapinig

Subject: The Philippine Script of Alibata (Also, Baybayin) 

	

I am very interested in investigating aspects of the virtually extinct
Philippine script known as alibata (also known as baybayin), and I was
curious to find out if anyone knew of any work that had been done with this
script.

Most specifically, I am interested in the parsing of this script by
Philippine readers, as alibata is infamous for its inability to represent
the syllable-final consonants pervasive in many Philippine languages (i.e.,
the Tagalog word 'pagdating' would be represented as 'pa-da-ti'). I am
curious regarding any possible phonological reasons, if any, why parsing
this script was possible or if contextual clues really provide all of the
cues necessary for readers to understand the text.

Additionally, I would like to look into the origins of this text,
specifically whether it came directly from India or through some people of
Indonesia.

Lastly, I was wondering if any of this work has been done by using the
related and still marginally used scripts of Tagbanwa  in Palawan and
Mangyan in Mindoro or if comparative work has been done with Buginese and
other related Indonesian scripts.

Much thanks in advance,

Abstract:

Using non-technical language 'The Earliest English' provides a
comprehensive introduction to the evolution of Old English Language and
Literature for introductory students of English Language and Linguistics.

In eight carefully structured units, the authors show how the vocabulary of
Old English contains many items familiar to us today; how its
characteristic poetic form is based on a beautiful and intricate
simplicity; how its patterns of word building and inflectional structure
are paralleled in several present day languages and how and why the English
language and its literature continued to change so that by the mid 12th
century the English language looks more like the 'English' that we are
familiar with today.=20

Abstract:

'Women, Men and Language' is an essential introduction to the key area of
language and gender. It sketches the historical background, summarises
recent research and introduces students to the key issues in the field
using an unpretentious and clear style.

The book takes the reader from an initial 'men talk like this; women talk
like that' approach to a more nuanced idea of women and men performing
gender in their everyday interactions. It covers a range of sociolinguistic
research, looking at grammatical and phonological features a well as at
aspects of conversation such as compliments or swearing, and the growing
use of the word 'like' by younger speakers. This updated third edition
concludes with a new chapter summarising new developments and assessing
possible future trends for the area.=20

Abstract:

The English language varies in a number of ways, depending on the people
who use it, how it is used and in what circumstances.  Varieties of Modern
English gives readers the tools needed to understand the diversity of the
English language and the issues surrounding it.  The author introduces the
key terms and concepts for studying variation related to both users and
uses, as well as to illustrate and discuss particular varieties of English.=
=20

This text is suitable for undergraduate courses in varieties of English,
language variation, sociolinguistics and the history of English.=20

Meeting Description:

Explicit and implicit information in text. Information structure across lan=
guages
Conference to be arranged by the project SPRIK Spr=E5k i kontrast/Languages=
 in
Contrast at the University of Oslo, Norway,  June 8-10, 2006.

The goal of the conference is to present and discuss current research in te=
xt
interpretation, particularly textual cohesion and coherence across language=
s. We
aim to bring together researchers interested in systematizing and explainin=
g the
variety of means exploited across languages to create cohesion and establis=
h
dependencies and discourse hierarchies in text. Different languages exploit
similar means differently, partly due to competing structures available in =
the
individual languages, partly due to language-typological differences. We ar=
e
interested in empirically based cross-linguistic studies that contribute to=
 a
better understanding of explicit and implicit information in 'real' discour=
se,
as well as in theoretical research modelling textual cohesion/coherence.

Papers  dealing with the following topics are welcome:
- Triggers for textual updating across languages. What are the triggers and=
 how
do they differ across languages?
- Comparable clause connectives, their distribution and interpretation in
different languages.
- Discourse subordinating and discourse coordinating devices across languag=
es. =20
- Implicit and explicit means of structuring information in text - what
difference do they make?
- Presuppositional accounts of the implicit.
- The semantic/pragmatic distinction in text interpretation (cross-linguist=
ic
research and translation).
- The interplay between information structure (at sentence level) and disco=
urse
structure and information flow at text level.=20

We welcome submissions from different theoretical frameworks.

Key note speakers:
- Robyn Carston (University College London, UK)
- Regine Eckardt (Georg-August Universit=E4t G=F6ttingen/ ZAS Berlin, Germa=
ny)
- Kjell Johan S=E6b=F8 (University of Oslo, Norway)

Meeting Description:=20

Intellectual movements, political ideas, theoretical and critical positions=
, and works of a scientific, cultural, artistic or literary nature spread f=
rom society to society. In order for this spread to take place, the concept=
s underpinning these movements need to be formulated in different languages=
 and to be appropriated by these languages and cultures. It would be fair t=
o say that the forms of communication that have come with the Internet age =
have speeded up to an unprecented degree both the flow of thought across so=
cieties and cultures and the process of transfer between languages. In view=
 of this intercultural interaction, which is occurring at an ever-increasin=
g pace, the Department of Translation and Interpreting Studies at Bo?azi=E7=
i University is organising a symposium which aims to deal with the issue of=
 the translation of concepts in its manifold aspects. The key question that=
 needs to be addressed is this: from which perspectives can we look at this=
 multifaceted process when we turn to examine it? In other words, within wh=
ich paradigms is it suitable to research and investigate the relationships =
between Turkish thought/thinking, translation and discourse?=20

There is some degree of recognition of the role of translation and the tran=
slator in the development of the Turkish-language discourses on philosophy,=
 history, literature and the social sciences that make up our intellectural=
 world. Yet, until now, the dynamics and consequences which translation and=
 the translator bring into being have not been discussed within the broad c=
ontext identified above. The aim of this symposium is to open up to discuss=
ion the following and related subjects, from the vantage-points of differen=
t academic disciplines and in the context of concrete examples and in relat=
ion to actual texts:

- the translation of concepts and the emergence of translated terms within =
the context of the activity of the translator, who we take to be a subject =
and actor
- the formation of different discourses in Turkish
- clashes between terms / discourses=20
- reception and criticism
- a historical perspective on the translation of concepts from both Western=
 languages and from Arabic and Persian, which encapsulates both the contemp=
orary and the Ottoman periods
