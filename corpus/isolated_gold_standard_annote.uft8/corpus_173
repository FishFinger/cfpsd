OVERVIEW

This book is a study on the 'Infinitivus Pro Participio'-construction (IPP) 
in several West Germanic languages. IPP is a construction where an 
unexpected form (i.e. the bare infinitive) appears instead of the past 
participle which would be the expected form. The German term for the 
IPP-construction, 'Ersatzinfinitiv' ('substitute infinitive'), reflects this 
very well.

The main claim of the study is that IPP is a 'last resort' or repair 
strategy which only appears in cases where the past participle 
obviously would even 'be worse' and therefore is inadmissible. This 
claim comes along with the idea that the violation of grammatical rules 
does not inevitably cause ungrammaticality. Instead, grammatical rules 
are thought to be violable. Therefore the framework chosen for this 
study is Optimality Theory (OT) as this theory assumes violable rules 
(or constraints) and violation of constraints in OT does not lead 
automatically to ungrammaticality, contrary to other theories of 
generative grammar. In OT, the assumption of violable and 
hierarchically ordered constraints is combined with the idea of a 
competition between two or more candidates. From this competition, 
one candidate comes out as optimal and blocks the other candidates.

IPP-constructions can be found in a subset of West Germanic 
languages, including Standard German and Dutch and several 
German and Dutch varieties, and excluding English, Frisian and 
Yiddish. The study therefore is comparative in nature and it includes 
data from Standard German, Dutch, West Flemish, Afrikaans, and 
three Swiss German dialects (Bernese German, Sankt Gallen 
German, Zürich German), although the focus is on Standard German.

SYNOPSIS

After a short introductory chapter, the book starts out by presenting 
the relevant data (chapters 2 & 3). IPP-constructions are 3-verb-
clusters and they appear in the present perfect, in the past perfect as 
well as in the future perfect. In these constructions, the IPP-verb, 
marked with [2] below, appears as a bare infinitive instead of as a past 
participle. The numbers assigned to the verbs in the following 
examples mark their hierarchical, i.e. selectional, order. The highest 
verb of the hierarchy is assigned a [1], the next a [2] and the 
hierarchically lowest verb a [3].

<pre>(1) a. *dass er ihn die Medizin hat[1] trinken[3] gelassen[2] 
    b.  dass er ihn die Medizin hat[1] trinken[3] lassen[2]
        that he him the medicine has[1] drink[3]  made[2] / make[2]
       'that he has made him drink the medicine'</pre>

However, such a substitution does not take place in every 3-verb-
cluster in the present perfect as indicated by the data in (2): Here, 
substitution of the past participle with the bare infinitive leads to 
ungrammaticality. Furthermore, there are constructions where IPP is 
optional, see (3).

<pre>(2) a.  die Leute stehen[3] geblieben[2] sind[1] 
    b. *dass die Leute stehen[3] bleiben[2] sind[1] 
        that the people stand[3] remained[2] /remain [2] have[1]
       'that the people have remained standing'

(3) a. Er hat[1] sie rufen[3] hören[2].
    b. Er hat[1] sie rufen[3] gehört[2].
       He has[1] her call[3] hear[2] / heard[2]       
      'He has heard her calling'</pre>

Whether the IPP-construction in a potential IPP-language is obligatory, 
ungrammatical or optional depends among other things on the verb 
class of the IPP-verb. Schmid identifies seven verb classes which 
trigger the IPP-construction in at least one of the languages examined. 
Interestingly, this list of verb classes can be ordered hierarchically as 
in (4):

(4) causatives < modals < perception verbs < benefactives < duratives 
< inchoatives < control verbs

This means that if in a certain language IPP is obligatory with 
benefactives, IPP is also obligatory with perception verbs, modals and 
causatives. But on the other hand, this does not give any information 
about the verb classes ranked lower, i.e. from the fact that IPP is 
obligatory with benefactives it cannot be deduced whether IPP does 
also appear with duratives, inchoatives or control verbs. Thus, in a 
given language, causatives and modals are most likely to show IPP 
whereas inchoatives and control verbs are least likely to show IPP. 
The languages examined differ with regard to the verb classes for 
which they show obligatory, optional and impossible IPP. With other 
words, they seem to differ regarding the point at which they cut off the 
hierarchy in (4). 

Another important point to mention is verb order in IPP-constructions. 
The IPP-languages differ with regard to the verb order they show in 
IPP-constructions. All logically possible verb orders appear in IPP-
constructions. Verb order in IPP-constructions often differs from the 
verb order in the perfect tense with a past participle (e.g. (1b) vs. 
(2a)). Nevertheless, it is not exceptional in the sense that it does not 
appear anywhere else in the languages: there often is a coincidence 
with the verb order in the future tense. 

After introducing the relevant data, Schmid presents an overview of 
previous IPP-analyses in the literature which range from the 19th 
century (Grimm 1837) to very recent work (e.g. Wurmbrand 2004) 
both with generative and non-generative background (chapter 4). 
There are two main groups of analyses: one which assumes that the 
infinitive actually is not a true infinitive but a participle with ''IPP-
morphology'', and the other which assumes the infinitive to be what it 
looks like, namely an infinitive. Furthermore, Schmid discusses all 
analyses with regard to the languages examined and the kind of 
triggers of the IPP-construction which are assumed. As a result of 
comparing the previous analyses to her observations Schmid 
formulates the leading questions for her own analysis: How is IPP 
accounted for and what functions as a trigger for IPP? How can the 
hierarchy of potential IPP verbs (verb classes, see (4)) become 
implemented? How can optional IPP be accounted for and what about 
the alternation of obligatory, optional and impossible IPP across the 
languages? How to explain verb order?

Chapter 5 provides a short introduction to OT. The analysis of IPP in 
Standard German is presented in the chapters 6 to 8, based on the 
questions raised before. In these chapters, several constraints are 
introduced which can account for obligatory, optional and impossible 
IPP as well as for verb order. Here, I will restrict myself to presenting 
the main idea of the analysis, namely how to account for obligatory vs. 
impossible IPP (chapter 6). As said before, Schmid considers IPP 
a 'repair strategy' which only occurs if the alternative would even be 
more 'costly'. The alternative is the past participle, and 'more costly' 
means that this alternative violates more or more important constraints 
than the infinitive does. Basically, obligatory versus impossible IPP is 
the result of the interaction of two constraints. One of them excludes 
the past participle as the sister of a VP whose head is an infinitive - 
IPP (substitution of a past participle by an infinitive) is a repair strategy 
in order to avoid violation of this constraint. The other constraint 
demands the morphological selectional properties of lexical items to 
be observed. This means that if in the present perfect the auxiliary 
selects as complement a verb which is a past participle, and the past 
participle is substituted by an infinitive, the morphological selectional 
properties are not observed. Thus substitution of a past participle by 
an infinitive (=IPP) violates this constraint. 

Whether IPP comes out as obligatory or as impossible depends on the 
ranking of these two constraints: if the first one outranks the second, 
the IPP-construction comes out as optimal candidate, as it fulfills the 
higher ranked constraint and only violates the lower ranked constraint. 
If however the second one outranks the first, the past participle is the 
optimal candidate and IPP is blocked, as it violates the higher ranked 
constraint. As the question whether IPP is obligatory or impossible 
depends on the verb class, there are separate versions of the first 
constraint for each verb class, and the ranking with regard to the 
second constraint varies for each verb class.  

In chapter 7 several constraints are introduced which account for verb 
order. Chapter 8 is about optional IPP. Optionality poses a problem for 
OT because there is one optimal candidate which blocks all other 
candidates. Therefore optionality, or, in other words, the existence of 
two optimal candidates, is not expected under this approach. Schmid 
discusses several approaches which account for optionality in OT, 
from which two ('neutralization approach' and 'global tie approach') 
are shown to be able to account for her data.

The final chapter provides a comparative analysis of obligatory, 
optional and impossible IPP in the seven West Germanic languages as 
well as an explanation of the variation in word order of the IPP-
construction across these languages. It can be shown that the same 
constraints are responsible for IPP in the other Germanic languages 
as introduced before for Standard German. The differences regarding 
obligation, optionality or impossibility of IPP for each verb class across 
the languages result from different rankings of these constraints. 

EVALUATION

The comparative approach of this study is very attractive. First, 
although it has often been noted in the literature that IPP can be found 
in several languages, the studies so far are restricted to Dutch and 
German. The study at hand fills this gap. Second, a lot of data are 
given and they are presented in a very thorough and systematic way. 
Third, and what is most important, the study succeeds in giving an 
analysis which goes beyond an analysis of IPP for the individual 
languages. It is fascinating to see how much variation there is 
concerning IPP across languages which are related so close to each 
other, and, at the same time, to observe the regularities and parallels 
between these different IPP-constructions (see for example the 
ordered list of IPP-verb classes in (4)). By identifying a small number 
of constraints which are held to be responsible for IPP in all 
languages, a connection is established between IPP-constructions 
across the languages, despite the differences regarding verb classes 
triggering IPP and verb order. 

As mentioned above, the data as well as the analysis proper are 
characterized by a thorough, systematic and clearly laid out way of 
presentation. In contrast, however, the introduction to OT is very 
short. Although Schmid recommends important literature on OT for 
those interested in it, a more detailed introduction would be desirable 
as the object of investigation is and has been subject to studies with 
all kinds of theoretical backgrounds. For readers with a non-OT 
background interested in the issue a more detailed introduction would 
be helpful.

This aspect is also related to the (very difficult and basic) question 
how to motivate a certain constraint. Why does grammar have such 
rules? There are rules for which this intuitively seems clear (e.g. the 
demand of morphological properties to be obtained in the output). But 
for others this is less obvious. What for example is the motivation for 
the constraint which is responsible for the IPP-construction, namely 
that a past participle must not be the sister of a VP whose head is an 
infinitive? Is there any independent motivation except that such a 
constraint can explain the data? Of course, this is a very hard 
question to answer which probably cannot be answered at all. 
Nevertheless it would have been interesting to discuss this problem 
and thereby to got a little further into the fundamentals of OT. 

However, discussing the fundamentals of OT probably exceeds the 
limits and the intentions of this book. Taking these theoretical issues 
for granted, the study provides a thorough and inspiring analysis of 
IPP which impresses the reader by its comparative approach as well 
as by taking into consideration the aspects of verb order and verb 
classes in a systematic way like it has not been done before.

SYNOPSIS

''Kids' slips'', by Jeri J. Jaeger (henceforth, JJJ), is the first monograph 
about young children's slips of the tongue (henceforth, SOTs), based 
on the biggest collection sampled to date of child slips from 
monolingual English-speaking children from 1;7 -- 5;11 years of age, 
mostly stemming from her own three children, Anna (AN), Alice (AL), 
and Bob(by) (B).

The book is organized into six chapters. In the first chapter, the SOT 
approach to studying child language is introduced. In the second 
chapter, children's and adults' slips are compared. The remaining four 
chapters are devoted to phonetics/phonology, the lexicon, semantics, 
and morphology/syntax. Each of these four chapters is self-contained 
and may be read independently, although, of course, they build upon 
each other and there is ample cross referencing. The body of the 
book is followed by the complete and annotated corpus of the 
children's slips (n = 1383).

The purpose of her book, according to the author herself, is (i) to use 
children's slips as evidence for the development of linguistic 
representations and language production planning in phonology, 
morphology, syntax, and the lexicon and (ii) to lay out a common 
methodology as to guide future researchers in their (cross-linguistic) 
study of children's slips.

METHODOLOGY: How can we know if a child has made a slip? This 
crucial methodological problem is only manageable if (i) the 
researcher knows the current grammatical system of the child on the 
background of which a systematic deviation due to lack of competence 
can be ruled out and/or if (ii) the child possibly indicates a SOT herself 
by means of a self-repair or otherwise shows signs of having erred 
(such as looking confused). Given that the author has this intimate 
knowledge of the three main subjects of the study -- her own children -
- and given that external error sources (unavoidable in a pencil-and-
paper collection) such as perceptional and collectors' biases have 
been shown to not systematically distort off-line slip collections (for a 
survey, see Poulisse, 1999), the methodological problem of child SOT 
research can be considered as settled, in this study.

CLASSIFICATION: The SOTs have been arranged in a coherent 
classification system which JJJ mainly takes over from adult SOT 
research. The errors are classified according to:
(i) the LINGUISTIC COMPONENT, resp. the PROCESSING STAGE. Is 
this a phonological, lexical, syntactic, or propositional error?
(ii) the DIRECTIONALITY of the error, if it is a contextual/syntagmatic 
error. Is this an anticipation, perseveration, or exchange?
(iii) the FORM of the error. Is this a substitution, addition, omission, 
exchange, blend, telescoping, or multiple error?

MODEL: JJJ puts forward a REPRESENTATIONS AND PROCESSING 
COMPONENTS MODEL (RPC, pp 6-11) which is based on Levelt's 
(Levelt, 1989, Levelt, Roelofs, and Meyer, 1999) serial-modular model 
of language production but which extends it in specific ways. The RPC 
model distinguishes representations in the long term memory such as 
concepts, lemmas in the content lexicon, and forms in the form lexicon 
on the one hand from planning processes in short term memory such 
as lexical selection of words, determination of functional structures 
and selection of syntactic structures on the other hand. All SOTs can 
be allocated to respective levels of processing involving specific 
linguistic representations. In any two-stage model of production, 
access to a word's syntactic features and meaning (its lemma) and 
morpho-phonological form happens on two different levels of planning. 
Misselection due to semantic similarity may arise in the first stage 
during lexical assignment to functional structure resulting in a 
semantic substitution such as ''I wanna <b>watch</b> ... I wanna 
<i>listen</i> to Baby  Beluga'' (B-71, 2;6.2). Misordering of 
phonological segments, however, happens in the second stage when 
the word's form is accessed and its phonological units are filled into 
the respective positional slots, resulting in e.g. an anticipation such 
as ''A stecond story ... a second story'' (AL-235, 4;9.18) where the 
phoneme [t] of ''s<i>t</i>ory'' is anticipated and added to the planned 
word ''second''. 

CHILDREN'S vs. ADULTS' SLIPS: In order to compare children's to 
adults' slips, JJJ had collected a reference corpus of n=716 adult 
slips, which can be accessed at 
http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/jaeger/adultSOT.html. One 
crucial precondition in this respect is that both children's and adults' 
slips must be similar enough to fit into the same classification system 
and model. In a global survey, JJJ establishes such a comparability in 
terms of error types and error proportions. She concludes that 
children's slips are very similar to adults' slips, overall. Differences in 
the processing span of contextual errors, directionality, formal 
structure, units, and self-corrections can be attributed to the 
development of linguistic representation, working memory, and the 
monitor. Given these overall similarities and specific differences, the 
value of children's slips can be fully appreciated since ''they allow us 
to tap into the time-course of the development of specific aspects of 
language, by seeing how the substance of the errors changes over 
time'' (p 90).

PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY: Phonological SOTs are the most 
common slips in adults as well as in children. Their onset indicates 
that children no longer treat words as unanalyzed wholes but as units 
with a structural frame and segmental content. The onset coincides 
with the vocabulary spurt at around 18-21 months when children have 
acquired a critical mass of about 50 words suggesting a major 
reanalysis of words in the mental lexicon in terms of phonological 
representation. From that time on ''... the segment has primary status 
in the phonological aspects of young children's production planning'' 
(p 109). For both adults and children, it is feature similarity which 
accounts strongest for the likelihood of a phonological SOT. 
Consonantal phonological SOTs in which error and target segment 
differ in only one of the five relevant distinctive features, namely place 
of articulation (POA), +/-continuous, +/-fricative, +/-voice, and +/-
nasal, are most frequent. Vowels are less frequently affected by slips 
than consonants, in both children and adults. In vowel errors, besides 
feature distance, stress figures prominently: it is two stressed vowels 
which are most likely involved in a vowel slip.

An excellent example of how children's slips can pinpoint the onset of 
crucial developments in phonological representation and processing is 
provided by allophonic variation. In adult slips, if a novel phonological 
sequence is generated by the slip, the correct allophonic variant is 
automatically produced, as in the (additive) anticipation ''singks inches'' 
<-- six inches (OC-88, 4;1), where the alveolar nasal [n] becomes a 
velar nasal [ng]. Children, however, have to learn which allophones 
there are and the rules producing the correct variants. Low-level 
assimilations such as nasalization of the vowel before a nasal C or 
POA assimilation of C's within a syllable (see above) are present from 
the very outset whereas POA assimilation across syllables or (de-)
voicing of sonorants in C-cluster occurs only after 2 years of age, 
when the relevant contexts have been acquired. Specific phonological 
processes in English such as velarization of [l], +/-aspiration of 
plosives, or tapping are learned even later. 

The syllable as a supra-segmental domain constrains phonological 
SOTs in adults in important ways. In languages with hierarchical 
syllable structure such as English, the 'syllable position constraint' 
allows only segments in identical syllable positions to interact, i.e., 
onset with onset, nucleus with nucleus, coda with coda. Until the 
second year of life, however, infants entertain a more holistic 
representation of the whole word which is successively refined into a 
linear and hierarchical structure with highly specific phonological 
content. Only after 2;2 years of age is the syllable position constraint 
obeyed suggesting that the syllable has superseded the whole word 
as basic structural unit of phonological processing (p 215). Moreover, 
the prevalence of consonantal onset errors from 2;6 years on 
suggests the mastery of the onset-rhyme analysis of English.

LEXICAL ERRORS: Lexical errors come in two kinds: paradigmatic 
errors (substitution, blend) and syntagmatic errors (anticipation, 
perseveration, exchange, telescoping). The former are due to 
selection errors; the latter are due to linearization errors. Substitutions 
also come in two kinds: semantic substitutions and formal 
substitutions, so-called 'malapropisms'. While in both adults and 
children, (besides same lexical category) semantic similarity is the 
most influential factor accounting for a substitution (children 69%; 
adults 70%), phonological similarity is less influential in children than it 
is in adults (40% vs. 55%, p 282). This result suggests that of the two 
big dimensions by which the mental lexicon is organized -- meaning 
and form -- semantics is present earlier and remains more influential 
than phonology which develops only later and plays a secondary role. 
Besides categorical, semantic, and phonological similarity, other 
factors, too, contribute to lexical errors, among them tonic stress, 
previous utterance, rhythmic weight and environmental influences. 
Usually, 3-5 such factors are involved in a single lexical slip. 

Above all, identity of lexical category figures prominently in speech 
error research as a severe constraint on the possible interaction of 
words, often referred to as the 'grammatical category constraint' (for a 
survey, see Poulisse, 1999). According to this constraint, nouns may 
only interact with nouns, verbs with verbs, etc. On a more general 
level, it also pertains to the two broad classes of lexical vs. functional 
categories which also rarely interact. Identifying the onset of the 
lexical category constraint is relevant to the question if young children 
organize words in terms of lexical category from the very beginning or 
not, and if not, in terms of which other system they may conceive of 
them. At first glance, children seem to respect this constraint as much 
as adults do (88% vs. 86,5%, p 291), from the outset. However, by 
looking at the earliest lexical slips in the 1- and 2-word stage, JJJ finds 
that they are strongly motivated by other than strictly lexical 
categorical factors, mainly by conceptual but also phonetic similarity, 
environmental and contextual influences. Given this strong 
determination by non-linguistic factors, JJJ proposes to link the onset 
of the lexical category constraint with the onset of syntax which both 
start at around 2;6 years of age. This linking is also corroborated by 
the finding that at around 3 years there is a (modest) peak of 
syntagmatic as well as function word errors creating two coupled U-
shaped curves of development.

SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS IN LEXICAL ERRORS: Having 
established that semantics has the strongest influence on lexical 
errors from early on, JJJ asks further which the semantic relationships 
are that figure importantly in this respect. For this purpose, she 
develops a classification scheme (pp 320ff) comprising (i) taxonomic 
sets ('fruit -- apple, pear'), (ii) non-taxonomic sets ('pillow -- blanket') 
or co-members of a set ('Mommy -- Daddy'), (iii) partonomic sets 
('hand -- finger'), (iv) contrastive relations ('slow -- fast'), (v) synonymy 
('bunny -- rabbit'), (vi) associative relations (metonymy and 
connotation), and (vii) function words (esp. pronouns). Conceptual-
semantic categories such as pairs of concrete actors belonging 
together, often proper names such as 'Mommy -- Daddy', 'Bert -- 
Ernie', are among the first relationships and may be considered 
precursors of more elaborate lexical-semantic taxonomies involving co-
hyponyms ('apple -- pear') under a common hyperonym ('fruit'). 
Overall, the semantic relations between words are strikingly similar in 
children and adults: they mainly wallow in co-hyponymical relations, 
followed by associative errors. However, the importance of the 
relationships changes over time. In the beginning, binary coordinated 
relations dominate. In this context, the ''lemma'' is an important 
concept, mediating between conceptual and lexical semantics. 
Consider the two interactants in a semantic substitution, ''watch'' 
and ''listen''. Conceptually, these are quite different actions -- lexical-
categorically, however, they make great co-hyponyms in a common 
taxonomic hierarchy. The latter organization into lemmas amounts to 
an abstraction over a semantic domain which supersedes a more 
holistic conceptual organization of words. This reorganization takes 
place between 1;7 and 2;6 years of age and is intimately related with 
the onset of syntax.

MORPHOLOGY: Morphology is traditionally linked to syntax as well as 
to lexical word formation processes. In syntax, inflectional 
morphological affixes are attached to the syntactic frames, which 
provide slots for lexical roots. In the lexicon, morphological affixes 
attach to word frames and generate novel words. Morphological 
errors come in three kinds: morphological shifts such as ''two 
bubble<b>s</b> gum_'' (AL-11, 2;2), morphological substitutions such 
as ''I've been suck-<b>ed</b> on'' <-- suck-<i>ing</i> (B-456, 5;1) and 
root morpheme exchanges (so-called 'stranding' errors) such as ''my 
<b>run</b> is <b>nos</b>-ing'' (AN-57, 2;7). Overall, inflectional 
errors are more abundant than derivational errors, in children even 
more so than in adults. Children do not yet have such a rich lexicon 
with many derived words, whereas they do have already productive 
syntactic processes. Since the bonds between roots and inflectional 
affixes are weaker than the bonds between roots and derivational 
affixes, there are more inflectional errors. Only highly productive 
derivational morphemes are also stranding-prone (p 409). 

Inflectional morphemes are strongly related to syntax and thus are 
more frequent in syntagmatic errors (e.g. morpheme shifts) than in 
paradigmatic errors (e.g. substitutions). Again, the onset of inflectional 
morpheme shifts such as ''two bubble<b>s</b> gum_'' coincides with 
the onset of syntax (p 405). It takes until 2;2 years of age for the child 
to factor out the abstract morphemes and make them available as 
affixes to syntactic frames. Since children do not know so many poly-
morphemic words, they have no reason to analyze their morphological 
structure and to represent it in lexical entries. It takes even longer, 
until the 6th year of life, until children can reliably segment stem and 
bound morphemes correctly (p 456). During this time they commit 
more morpheme shift errors than adults, in poly-morphemic words and 
multi-word phrases, since the localization of the morpheme in the 
respective word frame or syntactic template is not yet as fix as in 
adults. Children show the same prevalence as adults of inflected 
words to become involved in a stranding error as compared to derived 
words. 

Like phonological similarity, morphological similarity, too, enhances the 
likelihood of a lexical substitution error. The interactants share the 
same morphological structure in children's as well as in adults' slips 
(84% vs. 76.5%), most clearly when two mono-syllabic words are 
involved. Adults, due to their bigger and more refined lexicons, 
represent more morphological information and have more poly-
morphemic words (esp. Latinate words). The strongest argument for 
the representation of morphemes in the form lexicon comes from 
malapropisms: they always show higher morphological similarity as 
opposed to semantic substitutions (86% vs. 81% for children, 81% vs. 
74.5% for adults, p 443). 

SYNTAX: Parallel to her claim of an early stage of a purely conceptual 
organization prior to a lexical organization, JJJ also claims an early 
semantic prior to a syntactic stage. The evidence against a syntactic 
account comes from SOTs in the 1- and 2-word stage in which there 
are (i) no morphological errors, there is (ii) no evidence of lexical 
categories, (iii) no influence of morpho-semantic categories (such as 
+/-transitive; mass/count noun), nor of (iv) phrasal tonic stress on 
SOTs. Only upon entering into the 3-word-stage do all these features 
appear (p 480).

The only SOT category directly related to syntax are phrasal blends 
such as ''I <b>won't let you to</b>'' (AL-71, 2;10), a blend of ''I <i>won't 
let you</i>'' and ''I <i>don't want you to</i>'' (p 468). Along the lines of 
the 'competing plans hypothesis' (Baars, 1992), phrase blends occur 
when two equally suited syntactic frames for the same propositional 
content are activated and the processor, instead of selecting one, 
blends parts of both frames into a new hybrid phrase.

Early phrase blends tend to be local, involving two individual lexical 
items whereas later, they become more global, involving advanced 
syntactic knowledge and necessitating quite complex planning of multi-
phrasal sentences (p 474).

EVALUTION OF THE BOOK

With ''Kids' slips'', JJJ has put forward the biggest collection of 
children's slips to date, analyzed with an unprecedented level of 
systematicity and specificity. This is the standard work on children's 
slips -- an absolute must for every researcher in the field of language 
acquisition and language production. ''Kids' slips'' is a highly significant 
contribution to the field of ''developmental psycholinguistics'' in that it 
investigates the on-line production of spoken language in young 
children. Besides the impressive data base, the merits of this study lie 
specifically in the theoretical explanation of the empirical data and 
phenomena. JJJ shows in an illuminating way how children's SOTs 
bear on specific research questions and longstanding controversies in 
child language research.

In the following, I would like to highlight the main methodological 
advantages (M1-M6), point out some problems (P1-4) and then 
discuss some recurrent themes of the book (R1-R5).

JJJ sets very high methodological standards and lives up to them on 
every of the 727 pages of this monograph.

M1: OBJECTIVITY, RELIABILITY, AND VALIDITY: JJJ has taken great 
pains to transcribe the children's utterances phonetically -- which 
requires a decent amount of ''multi-tasking'' at the time they were 
collected: being attentive and swift so as to notice the slip in the first 
place, then bringing to bear her excellent competence in 
phonetics/phonology to the task of noting down the slip as accurate as 
possible while managing the ongoing complex everyday situation in 
which the slip occurred. With such a detailed phonetic representation, 
a basic requirement of objectivity of the data collection is satisfied. 
The reliability of the data classification can be taken for granted since 
she analyzes the child data base with the same classification system 
as for the adults. With respect to the validity of the inferences drawn 
from the data analysis, it is an indispensable necessity of the collector 
to know the current competence of the children under observation, in 
order to tease apart true performance errors (the SOTs) from 
competence errors due to the ongoing development (pp 11ff). To fulfill 
this requirement to the highest extent possible is a privilege of a 
linguist-mother who, in a short and precious period of life, integrates 
the otherwise contradictory twofold preoccupations of exhaustive daily 
child care and excellent scientific research. By comparing the 
children's slips to an adult reference corpus, she can factor out the 
developmental effects which are at the heart of her study.

M2: THEORY-NEUTRAL FRAMEWORK: It is JJJ's explicit intention to 
make her data collection available to researchers from various 
theoretical approaches to language production  (e.g., serial-modular 
vs. interaction) as well as language acquisition. Therefore, she has 
abstained from too narrow an analysis and rather chose some very 
broad conceptions of language production and development such as 
the 'competing plans hypothesis' (Baars, 1992) as an explanation of 
the mechanisms behind SOTs and the 'frame-content metaphor' 
(MacNeilage, 1998, MacNeilage and Davis, 1993) as an account of 
language production development. However, she also takes a firm 
stand with respect to the model in terms of which she analyzes her 
data, viz. the Representations and Processing Components (RPC) 
Model of Speech Production Planning, which is an advancement of 
the Levelt model. She explicitly invites scholars from different accounts 
to re-analyze her data in terms of their own models and encourages 
them to collect children's slips in other languages in order to be able 
to make cross-linguistic comparisons -- a big desideratum for future 
research. 

M3: COMPARISON WITH OTHER CHILD SLIP CORPORA: At the 
same time she always compares her own results to those of other 
child slip researchers, namely Stemberger (1989), Warren (1986), 
Aitchison & Straf (1982), Poulisse (1999), and Wijnen (1992) as well 
as to other adult corpora. Most of the times, her results converge with 
those of the others. At times, however, she finds differences which call 
for an explanation. In her comparison of the proportion of 
paradigmatic lexical substitution errors which are related by semantics 
or only by phonology, for example, she looks at eight different 
corpora, child and adult. Although the numbers vary greatly from study 
to study, they yield converging evidence for a prevalence of semantic 
over formal errors. Differences in the samples stem from different 
methodologies and classification systems.  In this respect, she 
underlines again the need for a common methodology and fully explicit 
classification criteria (p 253). But obviously it is also sample size which 
matters. While there are many large-scale adult slip corpora, hers is 
the first child slip corpus at a comparable scale. Without belittling the 
wealth and value of the other child corpora, JJJ's corpus sets the 
standards for future child SOT research.

M4: HYPOTHESIS-TESTING: Related to her theory-neutral stance in 
her basic methodology, she applies a classical hypothesis-testing 
approach to her empirical data. She formulates a hypothesis, tests it 
against her corpora, and explains the results in terms of her RPC 
model. With respect to alternative models,  she always makes explicit 
what the data should look like if they were to fit in a specific model. To 
give an example, she asks if there is feedback from the formal to the 
semantic level in the child processor -- a hotly debated topic between 
modular-serial and interactive models. From the lack of any formal 
similarity in children's semantic substitutions she concludes that this is 
most likely not the case (p 373). However, she does not conclude that 
the interactive model is wrong, since (i) the effect is found in the adult 
data of hers and other researchers and (ii) its lack in children can be 
explained independently, e.g., in terms of their weaker monitoring 
capabilities.

M5. NOVEL MEASURES: In her hypothesis testing approach, JJJ 
often has developed novel measures or refined existing ones in order 
to answer very specific questions, e.g., a measure of semantic 
similarity between the two interactants in lexical errors or a score of 
multiple converging influences on lexical errors. As for semantic 
similarity, she comes up with seven categories (coordinate, 
subsumative, contrastive, associative, and opposed relations, 
synonyms, and pronouns), each with even finer subcategories to 
which she submits the subset of lexical errors. She can show that it is 
the opposed category which provides the first strong semantic 
coupling between items, such as 'Mommy-Daddy', 'Bert-Ernie', and 
that only later more taxonomic categories (co-hyponyms) are 
established. Thus, concrete, frequent, and closely linked pairs are the 
seeds of a later more refined and comprehensive lexical-categorical 
system. As for the multiple motivations of lexical slips she has ranked 
10 influences according to their causal strength and has determined 
how many of them are found in each slip: (i) same lexical category, (ii) 
semantic similarity, (iii) tonic stress, (iv) phonological similarity, (v) 
utterance, (vi) weight, (vii -- x) various environmental and discourse 
related influences (pp 282ff). She found that the most common 
situation for both child and adult errors was that 3-4 influences 
conspired in a lexical slip (3 for paradigmatic, 4 for syntagmatic slips), 
suggesting that the planning mechanisms and lexical representations 
are the same for children and adults. Some of these novel measures 
are used for establishing baselines of chance frequencies against 
which the frequencies of particular slip categories of features are 
tested -- a very laborious undertaking but an indispensable control if 
valid claims about effects are to be made.

M6. HYPOTHESIS-GENERATOR: The greatest asset of her analyses 
is, however, not for direct reading but may only become realized in 
future research. What I find most intriguing in this book is that it may 
be used as an immensely rich generator of hypotheses to be tested in 
subsequent experiments. The problems JJJ asks herself are so 
precise and the application of the results in terms of particular models 
are so informative that a straightforward translation of the problem into 
a concrete experimental design is often self-evident. There is a whole 
set of problems that lends itself to further experimental testing, such 
as the lack of clear demarcation of syllables and distinction of the 
syllable position in young children < 2 years of age, the preference for 
binary oppositions in conceptualization, the interference of language 
production by contextual distractors, or the stronger coupling of 
production and perception, to name but a few. Any child 
psycholinguist will greatly appreciate the research impetus by JJJ's 
findings, providing a basis for further experimentation. The field of 
developmental psycholinguistics would immensely benefit if such an 
extended research cycle -- a broad corpus study followed by specific 
experiments enabling a reappraisal of the original findings -- could be 
established in child slip research. It is only recently that the synergy 
arising from the integration of different kinds of linguistic evidence -- 
through corpus linguistics and experimental approaches -- has 
become widely acknowledged (Kepser and Reis, 2005).


There are a couple of problematic aspects which make the reading 
and working through of this exceptional book quite hard sometimes. 
Having said this, I hasten to add that these problems are partly 
inevitably, given the very nature of the data.

P1: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS: This is the most 
comprehensive book about children's slips ever written with the 
biggest corpus of children's slips ever collected. This wealth of data is 
a mercy and a curse at the same time. On the one hand, slips are 
probabilistic in nature and major insights can be gained by looking at 
statistical distributions and frequencies, as in a nomothetic/quantitative 
approach. On the other hand, each slip is unique and deserves a 
careful analysis on its own, as in an idiomatic/qualitative approach. JJJ 
runs the risk of giving a too in-depth account of single slips and 
getting lost in too many details, at times, e.g., what the semantic 
differences between 'holes' and 'patches' are in a semantic 
substitution (p 362). After having gathered all these slips, Jaeger falls 
prey of hunting down each single one in her analysis until it has 
revealed all its marvels to us. However, this weakness is readily 
forgiven, since it is scientifically highly satisfying to follow JJJ through 
all the ramifications of e.g. the phonological structure of a particular 
SOT. After all, each single slip is a universe and deserves being 
admired for its intricacy and beauty, take for example the meanwhile 
legendary slip ''Not by the <b>ch</b>air of my <b>h</b>inny 
<b>h</b>in <b>h</b>in'' (Jaeger, 1992). Moreover, this meticulous 
analysis is greatly amended for by excellent summaries at the end of 
each chapter and subchapter.

P2: ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE: The major analytic tool JJJ uses is 
descriptive frequency statistics, which she displays in tables. Overall, 
this monograph contains 91 tables which resemble each other very 
closely. In a typical table, the frequencies of slip types XYZ are 
tabulated at the ages 1,2,3,4, and 5, a total is drawn an compared to 
the adults. But honestly, what else can one do about a slip corpus? 
JJJ has excessively exploited the tool of descriptive statistics and has 
gained major insights in doing so. She has made the best of this plain 
methodology, risking to bore the reader at times. Also, the lack of any 
inferential statistics is not worth complaining, as JJJ notes herself (p 
48). Not much would be gained, indeed, by knowing that e.g. the 
frequencies for malapropisms in children vs. adults differ significantly. 
The only reasonable thing one can do about differences in the 
distributions, be they big or small, is to come up with good 
explanations in terms of a processing and developmental model and 
to look for further evidence corroborating particular findings. The 
search for novel measures (see M5) is surely related to the somewhat 
restricted statistical possibilities of analyzing the data. 

P3. CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM: There is a slight oddity in the 
classification system insofar as JJJ does not primarily classify SOTs in 
terms of error unit (segment, morpheme, word, phrase) but with 
respect to processing stage, directionality, and form of the error. This 
is fine but in the case of lexical errors it leads to an artificial disruption 
of the unit 'word' which appears twice, on the two processing 
levels, 'lexical' and 'syntactic'. While it is certainly true that 
paradigmatic semantic substitutions and syntagmatic word 
anticipations occur on different processing levels, they involve the 
same unit, though. This division is actually overcome in chapter (4) on 
lexical errors where she looks at e.g. semantic and phonological 
similarity of both paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical errors. This is 
not to say that her classification system is wrong -- it is not. It is just a 
matter of perspective. A unit such as 'word' can be involved in 
different kinds of errors on different stages of processing (lemma 
retrieval, syntactic serialization). However, the unit 'word' can also be 
tracked across processing levels. 

P4. ERRATA: As is inevitable in such an opus, there are some very 
minor errors and typos. They are not the least disruptive and most of 
them will go unnoticed by the reader anyway. JJJ has registered them 
faithfully in a list of errata, which she kindly made available to me. 
Those who have bought the book may address JJJ by e-mail and ask 
her to send them the list of errata. The errors will certainly be 
corrected in the next edition of this book.

There are a couple of recurrent themes in this book relating to deep 
issues of language production and development. 

R1. THE FRAME-CONTENT METAPHOR: JJJ finds MacNeilage's 
(1998, MacNeilage and Davis, 1993) 'frame-content' metaphor very 
well suited to account for the development in various processing 
domains, namely in phonology (where segments are filled into the 
slots of syllabic frames), morphology (where morphemes are fit into 
word frames), and syntax (where words are inserted into phrasal or 
sentential templates). A principled explanation of this similarity across 
structural levels is given by MacNeilage and Davies in terms of a 
species-specific organizational property of speech. In the evolution of 
the speech production process, independent control of structural 
frames and their content has emerged, possibly sustained by different 
cortical areas. In language production, the 'slots-and-filler model' of 
Shattuck-Hufnagel (1979) and subsequent models provide an 
explanation of how slots in a planned word become filled with 
segments, thus accounting for serialization and also for errors of 
serialization. 

R2. PARALLEL BETWEEN PHONOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTIC 
DEVELOPMENT: JJJ finds striking evidence for the coincidence of 
serialization of segments within syllables with the onset of syntax at 
around 2;2 years of age (for a diagrammatic representation of the 
acquisition of syllable structure, see p 183). She accounts for this 
parallel in terms of a general systems strategy of dealing with growing 
complexity. ''Thus this linearization seems to appear throughout the 
linguistic system at approximately the same point in time, as the child's 
utterances become more complex and require a higher level of 
organization'' (p 183). The issue of linearization is intimately related to 
the frames-content issue above. The frames, in MacNeilage's terms, 
allow for the content units to become linearized by inserting them into 
the frame's pre-specified slots. From a generative perspective, the 
relation between hierarchy and linear order has most thoroughly been 
discussed by Kayne (1993). His 'Linear Correspondence Axiom' (LCA) 
requires the syntactic phrase marker to exclusively specify binary a-
symmetric relations between structural positions such as specifier and 
head or head and complement so that the respective terminal 
elements (words) will not be in too symmetric a relation to one 
another. Only through asymmetry can an unambiguous linearization of 
elements be provided. Linearity is a crucial constraint on the 
articulatory-perceptual interface of spoken languages since the single 
temporal dimension of speech requires units to become strictly 
serialized. Syntagmatic errors and blends are speech errors that 
relate to this major constraint on language processing. JJJ has shown 
in the respective chapters how this ability evolves simultaneously 
across units (segments, morphemes, words) and levels of processing 
(phonological, morphological, and syntactic). In phonology, this 
development -- first frame, then content -- leads to the emergence of 
segments as basic content units and syllables instead of words as 
basic supra-segmental frames. Until the second year of life, around 
2;2, infants entertain a holistic representation of the whole word as a 
frame which, successively, is refined into a syllabic representation 
which is now a linear and hierarchical structure with highly specific 
phonological content. In this respect, Levelt speaks of 
the 'phonologization of the lexicon' (1998, 175): by way of indexing 
structural positions such as onset, nucleus, and coda with matching 
consonants and vowels of the word, the child becomes able to 
distinguish huge numbers of syllabic gestures in the syllabary and 
thereby creates the precondition for rapidly acquiring more lexical 
items, as in the vocabulary spurt. According to Levelt, the 
phonologization of the lexicon is followed by the 'grammaticalization of 
the lexicon' at around 2;6 years of age. It is now the lemma 
information which becomes refined as to include information about the 
argument structure and theta grid of verbs. With this information, the 
processor can build up hierarchical sentential frames into which words 
are inserted.  Note that JJJ assumes a coincidence of phonologization 
and grammaticalization of the lexicon whereas Levelt assumes a slight 
developmental prominence of the former over the latter. Both 
accounts, however, capture the important insight of a parallel 
structural development and also give the same explanation in terms of 
an emergent strategy of dealing with growing complexity.

R3. PARALLEL BETWEEN NOUNS AND CONSONANTS AND VERBS 
AND VOWELS: Another aspect of this parallel is manifested in the 
similarity in the behavior of nouns and consonant on the one hand 
and verbs and vowels in SOTs on the other hand. Both nouns and 
consonants are affected by slips above average, verbs and vowels, 
however, below average (even if frequency is controlled for). Why is 
this so? JJJ reasons that verbs as well as vowels are the core anchor 
of their respective structures, the syllable and the phrase. Their 
selection is a central issue on which the system obviously spends 
considerable effort. The significance of this parallel behavior is most 
clearly expressed in Carstairs-McCarthy's (1999) assumption that the 
noun-verb distinction actually derived from the consonant-vowel 
distinction as its evolutionary antecedent. Crucially, both nouns and 
consonants occupy parallel structural positions around the nucleus -- 
consonants occupy onset and coda positions, nouns occupy specifier 
and complement positions. Vowels occupy the nucleus in a syllable 
and verbs the head position in a phrase, respectively.

R4. THE ROLE OF LEXICON SIZE: Young children build up a mental 
lexicon in an amazingly short time. JJJ discusses how the lexicon 
develops with respect to the two major dimensions -- meaning and 
form. Form does not play a role in very young children's lexicons. 
Semantics, however, is relevant from the very beginning. She traces 
how the complex semantic network of adults with various taxonomic 
levels in the vertical dimension emerges from the first simple, 
concrete, binary oppositions such as 'Mommy -- Daddy', 'Bert -- 
Ernie', 'see -- hear' which only exist on a horizontal plane. She argues 
that lexicon size is the crucial driving force behind structure-building in 
the lexicon leading not only to an intricate semantic network but also 
to the emergence of morphology as an interface between form and 
meaning. It is the increasing number of lexical entries (of increasing 
length) which necessitates a formal morphological analysis. There has 
to be a rich substrate from which semantic as well as morphological 
dimensions can be factored out. This factoring out leads to a more 
coherent organization of lexical elements in terms of lexical semantics 
and morpho-phonological structure. Again, hierarchical structure is an 
emergent solution to the problem of handling a critical mass of lexical 
items in an economic way.

R5. INFLECTION vs. DERIVATION: Inflected and derived words 
behave differently in processing, as is well known. In the Levelt model, 
this difference is accounted for by treating inflected words such 
as ''read -- read-s'' as a single lemma (with diacritics for the functional 
information added by the inflection) but treating derived words such 
as ''read -- read-er'' as separate lemmas. JJJ accumulates rich 
evidence that inflected and derived words also behave differently in 
child SOTs. That inflectional suffixes are (i) only loosely integrated into 
their host word, (ii) extra-syllabic, (iii) detach more easily (iv) belong to 
syntax more closely is evidenced by a higher frequency of morpheme 
shifts (''bubble-<b>s</b> gum_''), stranding errors (''my <b>run</b> is 
<b>nos</b>-ing''), suffix substitution (''<b>turn</b>-ing'' <-- <i>talk</i>-
ing) (p 409), and suffix adding. That derivational suffixes show exactly 
the opposite behavior is evidenced by SOTs such as ''<b>cold</b>'' <--
 <i>clos-ed</i> where an un-derived word (''cold'') substitutes for a 
derived word (''closed''), without stranding its derivational suffix (*cold-
ed, p 413). For the same reason, stranding errors and suffix 
substitutions are rarer with derived words. Thus, the different 
representation of derivational and inflectional morphology is also 
corroborated by child and adult SOTs.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

''Kids' slips'' is JJJ's life work. It has only become possible by the 
curiosity and versatility of a very attentive mother-linguist observing 
her three children growing up and acquiring language during the first 
five years of their lives. Later on it required a decent amount of 
stamina to sift the more than thousand SOTs and to analyze them 
which she did with admirable accuracy and specificity. The fruits of 
this long lasting enterprise are now available to the benefit of all. JJJ 
explicitly invites us to re-analyze her data or to start collecting 
children's slips in the same way as she did, preferably cross-
linguistically, so as to evaluate and extend her findings in the future.

SUMMARY

This ''advanced resource book'' targets upper undergraduates and 
postgraduates on communication studies programmes. It is ultimately 
about developing skilled communication strategies and principles in a 
globalizing world.

The book is structured, like the other books in the series, in three 
main sections, each made up of approximately ten units. Every section 
features the three themes ''Identity'', ''Otherization'' 
and ''Representation''. Section A defines concepts, i.e. it presents a 
variety of definitions for the core ideas and gives extensive examples 
in which the concepts shine through. Section B explores these 
concepts further with a series of extensive quotations of usually 
scholarly writings of the 1990s. As there are some negative or dubious 
examples, the authors comment on the texts and encourage the 
student to reflect upon them through numerous tasks. This section 
makes out about half of the book (page 51-146 out of 213 pages). 
Section C proposes a series of research tasks and establishes a 
methodology for addressing intercultural communication.

EVALUATION

As to form, the quotations in section B are in very small grey font and 
require therefore an excellent eye. The references are mainly from the 
90s and not abundant. Unfortunately the cited literature appears only 
summarily and never indicates the page number, so that it is nearly 
impossible to check the statements in the book. Even worse, the 
extensively quoted scholars in section B do not figure in the 
references, and neither do the titles quoted in the quotations 
(although name and year is given in the text). For a book that is 
intended to be read across the sections, this is actually a considerable 
advantage (e.g. p. 146 quotes Triandis. Not being in the bibliography, 
you have to go back to p. 142 to find the reference. There, the text is 
quoted in ''extracts'', without dots indicating the omitted text.)

The authors of this book subscribe to a non-essentialist view of 
culture, as opposed to an essentialist view. The largest part of the 
book is an apt criticism of a simple ''one nation-one language-one 
culture'' ideology. However, arguments are much less convincing 
when the new paradigm, the non-essentialist view, is defined. As the 
name points out, the concept was coined in opposition. ''People in one 
culture are'' not ''essentially different from people in another'' and 
there are ''a lot of cultural similarities'' (p.4). This suggests that the 
concept of 'culture' remains basically the same and only the 
perception of its intermingling is different: essentialists deny 
multiculturalism and are against it, while non-essentialists detect and 
welcome it. In this direction go the declarations in section C: ''[T]his is 
not to say that the issue of cultural difference can be hypothesized 
away. People ... belong to distinct cultural groups which 
promote 'distinctive capacities and characteristics'. If this were not a 
reality then there would be no such thing as culture and there would 
be no need to study 'intercultural communication''' (p.159).

What is then the point of non-essentialism, if culture actually is a hard 
fact of life with a distinctive content and a name? The criticism of the 
concept would boil down to a criticism of the (still?) predominant 
discourse. The same concept filled with other contents: The 
uncivilized becomes the noble primitive. 

In sections A and B the two authors of take a more radical stance: For 
them, the essentialists ''define the person before understanding the 
person'', whereas ''the non-essentialist strategy is a moral one to do 
with how we approach and learn about a person as a human being'' 
(p. 10). They rebuke even the weaker essentialist position, i.e. the 
forming of ideal types that act as a template and help us to make 
working assumptions about the 'default value' of the majority, being 
well aware that this will be wrong in some cases. They argue that ''we 
do not behave sufficiently rational in intercultural dealings to be able 
to work objectively with such templates''. (p. 23) People interpret new 
information in the light of the default values, and reduce the 
complexity of the new information up to the point that already on the 
level of perception confirming information is memorized and competing 
information blended out -- a well described process in cognitive 
sciences.

A general rule might very well ascribe correctly a certain trait to a 
number of strangers, and nevertheless we may not use that rule, 
because it is crying injustice for 20 % of them. Here we are in the 
presence of a new paradigm, because the goal is not anymore 
inductive information, but politically correct information. The social 
sciences are left for deontology. 

This is anti-discrimination in all respects and all its consequences, but 
are we in the field of justice? Intercultural communication is about 
social relations, and those should be as just as possible. If so, are we 
rather in the field of the legislator who works with rules, or before the 
court where every man comes as innocent before us? The theory of 
intercultural communication should guide us in the practice of the 
encounter with other individuals, so it is also about doing justice to the 
person before us. But there are difficulties: schemas are 
psychologically inevitable (p. 198) but must never harden. And 
ethology teaches that humans tend to expel or tease outsiders, 
because group homogeneity has under certain circumstances a 
selective advantage (Eibl-Eibesfeldt 2004, p. 533). Therefore, if we 
want to become non-essentialists, we have to fight actively the 
impulse to look down on outsiders. We have to deconstruct the 
situation, step in the shoes of the individual before us and gather 
a ''thick description'' (p. 8). This is the moral and idealistic 
commandment of the book. 

But is there still place for the concept of 'culture'? It is very well to 
substitute the stereotype of cultures clashing with a complex picture of 
cultures melting into each other on contact. But how can we then 
define the essence of a group and distinguish group capacities and 
characteristics, either conceptually or in examples? In the book, all 
generalizing equals 'otherization'. Otherization is defined 
as ''imagining someone as alien and different to 'us' in such a way 
that 'they' are excluded from 'our' 'normal', 'superior' and 'civilized' 
group'' (p.3). The authors quote extensively examples for otherization 
from literature, science and popular culture (cartoons, 
advertisements), and from colonialist times to our days. The reader is 
urged very intelligently to deconstruct the underlying ideology. But 
if ''culture is basically a group phenomenon which interacts with 
individual identity'' (p. 152), what group is not excluding and 
otherizing?

We all agree with the authors that we have to ''avoid the trap of over-
generalization'' (p. 3), but in the book any generalization and theory-
building is pictured as a trap. The authors succeed in making the 
reader very attentive to generalization in all forms, so that even the 
book itself could be criticized in some passages out of its own 
instruments (e.g. p. 181, Example C2.1.1 reports the situation in very 
essentialist terms; p. 28 ''out of character'' presupposes a 'true' 
character that can be in opposition to 'superficial' cultural influences; 
on p. 193 the authors otherize a critic of Irish in schools, insinuating 
that he cannot appreciate the Irish language as a consequence of his 
religion, and not out of his agent quality and autonomous reasoning 
based on personal experience.). 

Without doubt the book teaches the reader to be more attentive and 
critical towards essentialism, and this is the great achievement of this 
book. But in some cases the authors go also too far: They sustain on 
p.186 that it is 'Languacism' (i.e. stereotyping people according to 
their language use) when we take incorrect pronunciation (pronounce 
the ''th''-sound as ''f'' for example) as marker for less education. 
Sociolinguists find a correlation between language standardization 
and higher education, to name only one thing. Nothing is said about 
cause relation, and it may be society's fault that some get excluded 
both from education and language norms. And of course, there are 
special cases, e.g. when people have another mother-language and 
are highly educated in another social context. Still, as a rule (or 
stereotype?), linguistic competences are a meaningful indicator for the 
time passed in the English education system. To state that fact is not 
politically incorrect, it is social science. But for the authors, who are 
talking about morals, it is, because of the close connection between 
stereotyping, prejudice and otherization (p. 23). There is no reflection 
of the censorship their stance imposes. For further development of 
this argument refer to the criticism of political correctness.

The great virtue of the book is that it incites reflection about those 
almost philosophical questions. It is a bit confusing to find several 
views instead of one solution. But the real defect of the book is that 
the authors do not share the main concepts and their writing becomes 
incoherent and sometimes contradictory. Still, it is a recommendable 
book, because it leads to the core of the problems in intercultural 
communication and provides new insights.

One way out of the philosophical dilemma might come from the 
intriguing metaphor of ''culture cards'' (p.166). Everybody holds a set 
of culture cards standing for a group membership. ''Some of these 
cards you cannot change but others you can gain, get rid of, or 
change, and indeed play.'' (p.166). In this way, the world is not made 
out of solipsistic individuals in constant need of personal encounter, 
but of multi-group (multicultural) persons. Membership in a culture 
becomes something positive in this metaphor, and instead of reducing 
the other to an alien, it ascribes an asset. As those culture cards are 
so many, you can be almost sure that you are always able to hold 
some cards in common. When you play the common cards, you 
strengthen both yourself and the other, you have found the right 
channel for communication. Intercultural communication is then not the 
science of (cultural) difference, but of finding common (cultural) 
ground.

INTRODUCTION

''Compliments and Compliment Responses: Grammatical Structure and 
Sequential Organization'' lives up to its name and provides a well-
organised, detailed and comprehensive analysis of compliments and 
compliment responses in German.  This book is not only an excellent 
example of research on talk-in-interaction but also a work that sets an 
agenda for future developments in the field.  One of the main 
contributions of this conversational analytic work is that it raises the 
standards of research in this area and introduces readers to 
innovative scientific reasoning.

The book consists of seven well-written, interesting and stimulating 
chapters and each one of them deals with compliments and/or 
compliment responses from a different perspective: Chapter 1: 
Preliminaries (pp. 1-9), Chapter 2: Methodology (pp. 11-25), Chapter 
3: Giving Compliments: The Design of First Compliment Turns (pp. 27-
84), Chapter 4: Giving Compliments: Sequential Embedding and 
Function of First Compliment Turns (pp. 85-132), Chapter 5: 
Compliments in Multi-party Interactions: Third Parties Providing 
Second Compliments (pp. 133-166), Chapter 6: Compliment 
Responses (pp. 167-199), Chapter 7: Concluding Discussions (pp. 
201-212).  Notes, references, name and subject indices are given at 
the end of the book.  This review will first, present a concise 
description of the content of each of the chapters and will then offer 
critical assessment of the book as a whole.

SYNOPSIS

In Chapter 1, Andrea Golato prepares the audience to read the book.  
She starts by briefly outlining the previous research on compliments 
and compliment responses (henceforth C&CR) and presents the 
relationship between the earlier studies and her own research.  She 
also shows, however, how different her study is from prior research on 
compliments.  The data collection procedure (i.e., recordings of 
naturally occurring conversations between family and friends), the 
methodological framework (i.e., Conversational Analysis (CA)), the 
new approach to the analysis of the relationship between 'interaction 
and grammar' creates a golden combination that allows the author to 
analyze C&CR from a newer, more detailed, more exciting perspective 
which lets her to uncover relations and results not mentioned in work 
on this topic before.  The chapter ends with an outline of the following 
sections in the book.

Chapter 2 entitled ''Methodology'' consists of two main parts.  In the 
first part, the author discusses a topic which is of vital importance for 
studies based on the analysis of data, i.e., various data collection 
procedures utilized in different studies on C&CR.  A good data 
collection method for a study is the one that is able to shed light on 
the research questions under investigation (Yuan 2001).  However, 
studies done in this area also show that linguists should choose wisely 
since as Kasper and Dahl (1991:215) put it researchers in the area of 
pragmatics are dealing with ''a double layer of variability'': the first of 
these layers being the sociolinguistic properties of the speech event, 
and the second being the variability induced by different data 
collection instruments.  Each data collection procedure has its 
strengths and weaknesses and the quality of the gathered material 
and the validity of the obtained results may be affected by the 
selected data collection procedure (Fukushima 2000; Golato 2003; 
Kasper 2000; Lorenzo-Dus 2001).  Therefore, while discussing the 
different data collection tools (i.e., discourse completion tasks and 
questionnaires, role plays, recall protocols, field observations, and 
recordings of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction), Golato presents 
both their advantages and disadvantages.  She also warns 
researchers about the problems they may encounter in using each of 
these data gathering techniques if the aim is to study 'actual language 
use'.  

In the latter section of this chapter, the author introduces the 
informants and the characteristics of the data collected for the present 
study (i.e., 30 hours of non-elicited videotaped face-to-face 
conversations and 6 hours of audiotape telephoned conversations 
between close friends and family members) and the methodological 
framework (i.e., CA) chosen for the analysis of the gathered material.  
Golato explains that the main objective of CA methodology is to 
comprehend the sequential organisation of talk-in-interaction.  
Therefore, while analysing her data the researcher did not aim at 
making probability-based assertions and/or broad generalisations.  
The major goal in this study is to present ''an adequate level of 
description of the organisation of talk-in-interaction'' (p. 24).

In ''Giving Compliments: The Design of First Compliment Turns'' 
(Chapter 3), the author aims to uncover the attributes of the 
compliment speech act and the place of the first compliment turn in a 
particular interactional sequence.  She bases her analysis on two 
assumptions: (1) the assessable (i.e., the ability, characteristic, object 
that the compliment is about) has to be identified/referred to by the 
speaker so that the receiver of the compliment knows what the 
compliment is about and (2) the positiveness of the compliment has to 
be conveyed and this can be done semantically and/or syntactically.  
The analysis of the referring expressions in compliments reveals their 
systematic and context dependent nature.  Speakers produce 
references that are tailored to the needs of the recipient and to the 
requirements of the ongoing interaction.  In this respect, Golato's 
study yields support for the anaphora studies initiated by Fox (1996) 
and Schegloff (1996) and shows that analysis based on notions such 
as 'topic' or 'distance to the last mentioned item' fails to account for 
her talk-in-interaction data.

In the section devoted to the syntactic features of 'first compliment 
turns' the author focuses on 'verb-first constructions' and 'right 
dislocated elements'.  Golato draws attention to the fact that many of 
the first compliment turns in her corpus did not include overt 
references to the assessable (i.e., their topic slots were empty) and 
had some elements of the sentence moved from their normal position 
to a position beyond sentence bracket or sentence field.  Similarly to 
Auer (1993), she argues that spoken German allows empty topic slots 
in syntactic environments in which topics are normally obligatory due 
to pragmatic reasons.  Speakers (i.e., those who give the compliment) 
in Golato's study used 'verb first constructions' when they assumed 
that all participants in the conversation shared a common orientation 
to the assessable and that, as a result of this, the receiver of the 
compliment would be able to locate the referent without any 
ambiguity.  Those who gave compliments also tended to put the 
positive evaluation of somebody/something at the end of the first turn 
(i.e., used right-dislocated elements) since they believed that in doing 
so they would make compliments more accessible to the next speaker 
and, therefore, would better recipient's chances of understanding the 
compliment.  When discussing the semantic features of German 
compliments Golato, first, lists features such as: (1) formulaic in 
nature, (2) positive value not carried by the verb but by appreciation 
sounds (either gustatory such as mmmh or other sounds of 
appreciation such as ohh, aah), (3) usually include positive degree 
adverbs such as 'schon' and 'gut', (4) most of them lack first person 
pronouns; but then, she points to the fact that these features do not 
render them obviously different from general assessments.  According 
to Golato, what really makes a compliment a compliment is the context 
within which it is uttered.

Therefore, in the following chapter she sets out to prove this point.  
Similarly to the preceding chapter, Chapter 4 (Giving Compliments: 
Sequential Embedding and Function of First Compliment Turns) deals 
only with first compliment turns.  Differently from Chapter 3, however, 
here the author focuses not only on the syntactic and semantic 
features of compliments but on the relationship between the structural 
features of compliments and the overall organisation of the sequence 
in which compliment turns are situated.  Drawing on data coming from 
a multi-party talk, Golato shows that the syntactic and semantic 
features of compliments alone do not suffice to disambiguate the 
function of the turns in question.  She points out to the fact that turns 
with the same structural properties can function not only as 
compliments and general assessments, but also as interruptions, 
reproaches, sarcasm and teases.  What is more, she shows that 
within multiparty interactions compliments can perform a number of 
(sometimes conflicting) functions at the same time.  A compliment for 
one interlocutor can serve as a criticism/reproach of another 
interlocutor in the multiparty talk, for instance.

The dual function of this speech act is also illustrated by the fact that 
compliments, in Golato's corpus, occurred in both preferred and 
dispreferred turns.  In dispreferred sequences they mostly preceded 
or followed rejections of offers, disagreements and criticisms.  That is, 
they were used to either delay the dispreferred element or to convert 
the potentially face threatening utterance into a more positive one.  
Stated differently, compliments in dispreferred responses fulfilled/had 
the function of social solidarity builders.  In preferred environments, on 
the other hand, compliments served as expressions of appreciation 
(e.g., they are used to disagree with self-depreciations, to respond to 
announcements, to support or replace thanks), transition acts from 
one activity/topic to another, or conversation closings.  These findings 
in Golato's study support Brown and Levinson's (1987), Holmes's 
(1995), and Wolfsons's (1983) claims that compliments can both 
strengthen or soften other speech acts.  Nonetheless, differently from 
these earlier studies, Golato goes beyond the observational stage, 
and by using the sequential organisation of talk-in-interaction 
framework, she is able to explain why and how compliments can carry 
out these multiple tasks successfully.

Differently from the previous two sections, Chapter 5 (Compliments in 
Multi-party Interactions: Third Parties Providing Second Compliments), 
focuses on 'second compliments' (i.e., compliments that are given by a 
third party either before or after the compliment recipient has 
responded) in multi-party talk.  More specifically, the author tries to 
uncover when and what type of compliments third parties produce, 
and where they place these compliments in the interactional sequence.

Golato's analyses indicate that 'third party compliments' are usually 
agreements.  That is, similarly to Ruhi (2001, 2002), she concludes 
that compliments define ingroupness or alignment with the compliment 
speaker.  'Second compliments' are minimal in nature (i.e., consist of 
only one turn construction unit), hence, non-intrusive.  In other words, 
they do not disturb the flow of the conversation and do not require a 
shift in the participants' roles.  Speakers continue to speak and 
listeners to listen, while the member of the group who utters 
the 'second compliment' just shows his/her alignment with the 
complimenter.  In most of the contexts 'third party compliments' are 
expressed as gustatory mmmhs, confirmation markers (e.g., yes, mm 
hm, or a head-nod), response pursuit markers (e.g., German 'ne?', 
English 'right?') or additional assessments (i.e., adjective).

Further examinations of the data reveal that third parties are highly 
sensitive to the function performed by 'first compliments'.  Golato 
points out to the fact that in her corpus 'second compliments' never 
occurred in situations in which the 'first compliment' was a part of a 
dispreferred turn.  The author states that all second compliments 
occurred in preferred environments, but she also calls for attention to 
the fact that not all compliments given in such environments were 
accompanied by a second compliment.  She argues that in most of the 
cases where a second compliment was absent, it was not noticeably 
missing since in these contexts the non-intended participants either 
did not have access to the assessable (e.g., did not see it/him/her) 
or ''the participation context made the compliment implausible'' (e.g., 
the non-intended participant was a host) (p. 204).

The penultimate chapter in the book (Chapter 6: Compliment 
Responses) has two main goals.  First, to examine the features of 
compliment responses in German, and second, to compare and 
contrast them with Pomerantz's (1978) compliment response data 
coming from American English.  The comparison of these two corpora 
is made possible because both studies are conducted within the 
conversational analytic framework.

Golato mentions that in her analysis of American English, Pomerantz 
(1978) concludes that recipients of compliments face a dilemma 
between agreeing with compliments as the preferred next turn for 
positive assessments and avoiding engagement in self-praising 
behaviour.  In attempt to solve this predicament, compliment recipients 
respond to positive assessments (i.e., compliments) with expressions 
that partly agree and partly disagree wit the complimenter's statement 
(e.g., 'A: Gee, Hon, you look nice in that dress.', 'B: Do you really think 
so? It's just a rag that my sister gave me', p. 170).  According to 
Herbert (1986, 1989), Herbert and Straight (1989), and Pomerantz 
(1978), there are a number of formulae Americans use to achieve 
this 'in between' effect: (1) shifting the evaluation, (2) shifting the 
evaluation in form of a qualification, (3) deflecting the compliment to 
an object or to a third party, (4) giving a non-evaluative comment, (5) 
reinterpreting the compliment.

When discussing the compliment responses in German, Golato points 
out to the fact that differently from the example compliment responses 
in etiquette books and against native speakers' intuitions, German 
native speakers 'overwhelmingly' accepted compliments.  Again, 
contrary to all recommendations in etiquette books, none of the 
informants in her study accepted the compliment by using an 
appreciation marker/token such as 'Danke' (Thank you).  What is 
more, none of the German compliment response types were parallel to 
ones found in American English.  The two most common German ways 
of expressing an appreciation of a compliment, encountered in the 
current corpus, were to provide an assessment of the compliment or 
to agree with the compliment assertion by confirming the assertion 
(i.e., by saying 'ja').  What the author concludes at the end of this 
chapter is that even though both Americans and Germans have a 
number of ways of accepting compliments, 'the design of these 
acceptance turns differ drastically across the two speech communities' 
(p. 207), a fact which might cause conversation breakdowns (i.e., 
misunderstandings and misinterpretations) when interlocutors from 
those two cultures interact with each other.

In the last chapter of the book (Chapter 7: Concluding Discussions), 
before discussing the limitations of the current study and presenting 
some suggestions for further research, Golato summarizes the 
findings of the study and presents the broader implications of her 
results in terms of sequence organisation and grammar and 
interaction research.

CRITICAL EVALUATION

''Compliments and Compliment Responses: Grammatical Structure and 
Sequential Organization'' is a thought-provoking research which looks 
at compliments and compliment responses (C&CR) from a newer, 
more dynamic, more sophisticated perspective.  Therefore, this work 
will undoubtedly stimulate future research in this area.  By combining 
finely the data collection procedure, the methodological framework 
and the approach to the examination of data, Golato is able to not 
only illustrate but also to explain the multifaceted, often covert nature 
of the relationship between the structure, place in the sequence and 
function of C&CR in German.  The issues raised and discussed in the 
book are important for the study of talk-in-interaction and for the study 
of interactional linguistics as well as for the fields of cross-cultural 
communication, speech acts and foreign/second language education.  

The language and the style of the author and the interesting and 
insightful examples make the book a very enjoyable read.  The 
connectedness between the chapters and the well-rounded analysis 
of the material make the volume an excellent resource for all those 
interested in discourse and pragmatics.  Hence, I recommend it in the 
highest possible terms.

Meeting Description:

organized as part of the European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2006 
31 July - 11 August, 2006 in Malaga, Spain 

-Concord Phenomena- 
In natural languages a functional operation can be manifested more than once in the morphosyntax of one sentence. Most notable are the phenomena of negative concord (where several negative elements contribute to one negation) and sequence of tense phenomena, where the same happens in the temporal domain. Similar observations can be made regarding the domain of mood, case-agreement, multiple Wh, and conditional sentences. On a general and intuitive level, the similarities are striking.

-Thematic Questions-
These phenomena have each been studied in various domains, from both an empirical and a theoretica point of view. With this workshop we want to solicit contributions which approach the phenomena from a general, cross-categorial perspective: across the various domains, theoretical, and typological as well. Thematic questions: What should be the logical form of those constructions? To what extent (at what cost) does it allow for a compositional treatment? How similar and how general are the phenomena really? What do these phenomena tell us about the model of grammar?

-Workshop Aims-
The general aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers of different disciplines (semantics, syntax, typology) in order to create new insights about concord phenomena and the syntax-semantics interface. The workshop aims to provide a forum for advanced PhD students and researchers to present and discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who work in the broad subject areas represented at ESSLLI.

-Submission Details-
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract on the general theme of the worshop. (Cognitive and evolutionary analyses are welcome, too.) Submissions should be anonymous and no longer than two pages and should be either in .pdf, .txt, .doc or .rtf format. Please send your submission electronically to the above email addresses of the organizers, with the name of the author(s) and their affilitation(s), their adresses and the title of the paper in the body of the message. The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme committee (see below).  The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The format for the final version will be .pdf.

-Workshop Format-
The workshop is part of ESSLLI 2006. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI. Depending on the number and quality of the submissions there will be 2 or 3 slots for paper presentation so the talks including the discussion will be either 45 or 30 minutes. On the first day the workshop organizers will give an introduction to the topic, and the workshop ends with a general discussion.

-Follow Up-
The organizers intend both to organize a follow up of this workshop, and a book or special journal issue around the subject. Both options will be discussed at the workshop in Malaga.

Meeting Description: 

39th annual meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea (SLE), to be held at the university of Bremen/Germany 

Meeting Description: The theme of this international meeting is RELATIVISM AND UNI-VERSALISM IN LINGUISTICS. Throughout the history of linguistics, two opposing views on linguistic facts have been competing with each other. Simplifying, a crude version of relativism takes the structural diversity of human languages to be evidence of the differential determina-tion of language structures by non-linguistic factors (most prominently, culture-dependent world-views, etc.). An equally crude universalism, on the other hand, denounces the very same facts as secondary and thus largely unimportant phenomena behind which the ''real'' language is hidden. This supposed real language, then, is organized in such a way that it obeys universally valid rules (which may be innate). SLE2006 wants to tackle the question of whether and how a reconciliation of the two standpoints can be achieved. Therefore, we especially welcome papers and workshop proposals which explicitly invite the discussants!
  to weigh the pros and cons of the two vistas on language. Empirically-minded and theory-oriented contributions are equally welcome as long as they directly address the Relativism vs. Universalism dichotomy. This topic is relevant for all areas of grammar and practically all other disciplines subsumed under linguis-tics (from diachronic linguistics via language contact to ethnolinguistics).

Registration fees (to be paid in advance by 30 May 2006): 
Members:		
70 euro (100 euro after 30 May 2006)
Non-Members:	
100 euro (130 euro after 30 May 2006)

OVERVIEW

The meaning of simple numeral expressions like 'two', 'three', 'twenty-
seven' etc. has turned out to be one of the most problematic issues 
within linguistic semantics and pragmatics. Part of the problem is that 
there seem to be several candidates for 'the' meaning of an English 
cardinal.  Numerals can be used in many ways, three of which have 
been the focus of discussion in the pragmatic literature of the past 
thirty to thirty five years: 'two' as specifying exact cardinality, 'two' as 
specifying a lower bound and 'two' as specifying an upper bound. 
Bultinck's book 'numerous meanings' is an attempt at tackling the 
issue by comparing the most influential theoretical trend of the past 
three decades, the so-called neo-Gricean programme, with the results 
of an extensive corpus study of numerals. The book contains a 
detailed discussion of the legacy of Paul Grice's theory of 
conversation, with particular focus on the repercussions for the 
analysis of English cardinals. It is argued that the 'conventional' 
meaning of a numeral needs to be established by means of a corpus 
analysis. As Bultinck subsequently aims to show, such an analysis 
undermines the neo-Gricean assumption that numerals present a 
lower bound in their coded meaning.

CONTENTS

Bultinck starts with an thorough discussion of Grice's original motives 
and proposals (CHAPTER TWO). Crucial is the distinction between 
conventional meanings and implicated meanings. Whereas the former 
are to be seen as the 'coded' or 'literal' meaning of an expression, the 
latter arise through inferences licensed by the assumption that the 
speaker observes maxims on the quantity, quality, relevance and 
manner of what (s)he says. Grice intended to keep the semantics of 
expressions simple by showing that a single conventional meaning 
could give rise to more than one meaning by means of conversational 
implicatures. The content of the conversational principles as well as 
their formalisation have subsequently been much debated and 
Bultinck describes these developments in considerable detail. 

While acknowledging the general success of Grice's theory and its 
offspring, Bultinck argues that Grice's goal to combine a theory of 
conversation with the intention of preserving the logical meaning of 
logical expressions is misguided. He states that there is no 
methodological justification for taking the conventional meaning of a 
logical natural language expression (like 'or', 'and', 'if...then') to be 
exactly that of their logical counterparts. Bultinck associates what is 
conventional with what is familiar and therefore argues that frequency 
data can help determine which meaning is more conventional than 
others. 

In CHAPTER THREE, Bultinck continues his discussion of Grice's 
legacy, but now focusing entirely on the literature on numerals. Most 
attention goes to the neo-Gricean line of theories that is 
labeled 'minimalism' and that is inspired by Horn's 1972 notion 
of 'scalar implicature', a generalisation over phenomena where a weak 
item on a scale implicates the negation of the stronger items. 
Minimalists argue that if the numerous meanings displayed by 
numerals are to be explained by means of conversational implicatures, 
then it must be the case that their coded meanings line up in an 
entailment scale. So, numerals are thought to form an entailment scale 
such that a sentence like ''two students came'' is entailed by the 
stronger ''three students came''. By uttering ''two students came'', the 
speaker therefore (potentially) implicates that the stronger alternative 
is false, thus arriving at the meaning ''exactly two students came''. The 
entailments are accounted for by assuming that the conventional 
meaning of a numeral like 'two' is 'at least two'. In the following 
chapters Bultinck aims at showing that his corpus data falsifies this 
line of thinking, but in the theoretical discussion he also presents 
some non-empirical counterarguments, most of which are familiar from 
the literature. His most salient critique, however, is a repetition of the 
methodological critique he presented in chapter two. Bultinck argues 
that what Grice aimed at with his notion of conventional meaning was 
a standard meaning. Bultinck proposes to identify conventional 
meaning with ''familiar meaning''. Conventionality is thus equated with 
a relative high level of frequency. He argues that this implies that 
conventional meanings are frequent. The minimalist's choice for a 
conventional 'at least' meaning, however, is not based on frequency at 
all. In fact, conventional meanings are solely chosen on the basis of 
their potential for conversational inferences.

In chapter three, there is furthermore a short discussion of the 
underspecification account (Carston 1988), where the ''logical form'' of 
a numeral is underdetermined and can be enriched by specifying 
with 'at least', 'at most', 'exactly' or even 'approximately'. Some other 
positions (called 'marginal' by Bultinck), like those arguing for bilateral 
conventional meanings or ambiguity, are discussed as well.

In CHAPTER FOUR, a ''general corpus analysis'' is discussed which 
aims at discovering the different forms and functions of numerals. The 
analysis involves one thousand occurrences of ''two'' from the British 
National Corpus. In chapter five, Bultinck analyses the core meaning 
of numerals, namely the cardinal one. Chapter four, however, is 
focused on a more general analysis which aside from taking the 
syntactic form and function into account, focuses on all possible ways 
of using a numeral. Apart from the core use of the specification of 
cardinality, these include the numeral as a label, the numeral as a 
temporal indicator and the numeral as a mathematical primitive. 
Bultinck isolates a wealth of variation in usages and discusses the 
underlying corpus data in great detail. He stresses that the data 
clearly demonstrate that it is a mistake to simply assume that the 
meaning of numerals can be reduced to a notion of cardinality. One 
clear result of the analysis, however, is a correspondence between 
adnominal uses and the expression of cardinality. Almost all 
adnominal numerals in some sense express the cardinality of a group. 
Bultinck tries to come to a hierarchy of numeral constructions in terms 
of the degree of cardinality that is involved and concludes that ''the 
expression of cardinality is clearly the most important function of 'two''' 
(p. 153), followed by the expression of measurement, which, as 
acknowledged by Bultinck, in many respects involves cardinality as 
well.

In CHAPTER FIVE, a corpus analysis is presented that focuses on 
what kind of meanings cardinal uses of numerals display. It is this 
analysis that is supposed to contribute to the issue of the conventional 
meaning of 'two'. Again, Bultinck refers to the corpus method as ''the 
methodological outcome of [Grice's] theoretical insights'' (p. 168).

Bultinck distinguishes four possible meanings (pp. 176,177): 
'''at least n': necessarily n + possibly more than n;
'at most n': possibly n + not possible more than n;
'exactly n': necessarily n + not possible more than n + not possible 
less than n''; and '''absolute value n': non-modal, the group of 
elements denoted by the NP is determined as having n elements''.

Crucial here is the assumption that the first three of these meanings 
involve modal statements about cardinality. The 'absolute value n' 
meaning, on the other hand, is relatively simple. In fact, Bultinck 
maintains that it is 'cognitively' simple, since it refers to nothing more 
than cardinality of a group, and that the other interpretations are 
therefore in some sense marked. That is, the first three meanings 
make what is said (understood in a non-Gricean way) about the 
cardinality much more prominent than the 'absolute value' 
interpretation does. 

The majority of occurrences of 'two' turn out to be either of 
the 'absolute value'-type or of the 'exactly n'-type. Bultinck notices that 
the 'exactly n' readings are mostly caused by definite markers. There 
are no findings in the corpus of 'absolute value' uses with such 
markers. This observation also serves to explain the distribution of the 
different usages over different syntactic positions. For instance, the 
majority of direct objects contain numerals of the 'absolute value' type, 
whereas the majority of numerals in adverbial phrases are used 
as 'exactly n'. According to Bultinck this distribution is simply a reflex of 
the attested fact that direct objects are generally good candidates for 
introducing new topics, whereas it is less likely that material in 
adverbial phrases is there to (existentially) introduce a new referent.

In subject position, occurrences of 'two' without definite markers are 
mostly 'absolute value' or 'exactly n'. But the difference between these 
two usages is blurred. The trend is that subject position indefinite 
numerals are less likely to allow for a subsequent revision of the 
involved cardinality than object indefinite numerals. Bultinck proposes 
that this is due to the fact that it is marked to use a subject for the 
introducing of a new referent. The focused use of the numeral hints at 
excluding the possibility of there being more than the 'n' elements that 
are expressed. This means that there is a continuum from 'absolute 
value' to 'exactly n' meanings. In 'pure absolute value' use there is a 
neutrality toward the possibility of there being more elements. This 
neutrality is reduced in subject position. A further finding supports this 
idea of a continuum. In predicative constructions (such as existential 
there sentences), most samples show the absolute value meaning of 
the numeral. Bultinck's idea is that such constructions hardly change 
the default 'absolute value' interpretation of the numeral. Although 
Bultinck is careful not to present it as a clear result from his corpus 
research, he hypothesises that the continuum from 'absolute value' 
to 'exactly n' is paired with a scale of syntactic constructions, ranging 
from existential there sentences, to objects, to subjects, to adverbials. 

The picture emerging from this is one where a great multitude of 
factors influence the 'value interpretation' of a numeral. In particular, it 
seems generally the case that when there is an 'exactly n' 
interpretation of the ''meaning complex'' that contains the numeral, this 
meaning can be reduced to a combination of the 'absolute value' 
meaning and the influence of other co-textual factors. It follows 
that ''[the] 'absolute value' interpretation is the starting-point for the 
interpretation of 'two''' (p. 225), or as Bultinck concludes in chapter 
six, ''the conventional meaning (the ''coded content'') of 'two' is 
the 'absolute value' meaning'' (p. 307).

The corpus analysis shows that 'at least n' uses of numerals are 
highly infrequent (3,9%). This, Bultinck claims, is highly problematic for 
the neo-Griceans. In fact, the corpus analysis shows that the few 'at 
least' uses that are found are all due to the co-occurrence with a 
linguistic element and, in most cases, that element is 'at least'.

Another finding from the corpus discredits the neo-Gricean account of 
numerals in another way. One of the traditional arguments for 
assuming the 'at least n' meaning to be conventional is that 
were 'exactly n' conventional, then it would be redundant to combine 
the numeral with 'exactly'. It is not and hence, the argument 
goes, 'exactly n' cannot be the coded meaning of 'n'. The corpus 
shows, however, some very clear facts about numeral modifiers 
(called 'restrictions' by Bultinck). The most common kind of 
modification is with 'at least' (44.8%), whereas combinations of 'two' 
with 'exactly' are relatively rare at 9.5%. If the neo-Gricean argument 
holds, exactly the reverse distribution of 'exactly' and 'at least' would 
be expected.

CHAPTER SIX briefly sums up the results of Bultinck's work and 
repeats the general conclusions. 

CRITICAL EVALUATION

The first half of the book is devoted to the discussion of the literature 
on (neo-)Gricean implicatures in general and the pragmatics of 
numerals in particular. A shorter discussion might have been more 
effective, since one has to wait a long time for Bultinck's main feat, the 
discussion of his corpus study of numerals (chapters four and five). 
Furthermore, the literature discussion is often overly detailed and 
repetitive. For instance, some of the arguments Bultinck discusses in 
the chapter on Gricean pragmatics are repeated in both his discussion 
of the literature on numerals and in the discussion of the corpus data. 
Nevertheless, it is certainly admirable that Bultinck so successfully 
weaves together discussions from linguistic pragmatics, corpus 
linguistics and cognitive linguistics. Although tedious at some points, 
the many repetitions might actually guarantee that this book is suitable 
for the broad audience it sets out to reach.

A more serious problem is the fact that the discussion in chapters two 
and three is in many ways dated. Browsing the references, one finds 
that the most recent literature that is being discussed dates from 2001 
(the book is published in 2005). Of course, many of the high points of 
the discussion of scalar implicatures can be traced back to the 1970s 
and 1980s, so it is perhaps not entirely unexpected to find mostly 
older literature. However, in the past few years the study of 
implicatures and numerals has flourished once again. Now, there is a 
wealth of new findings and theoretic proposals (e.g. Geurts 1998, 
Chierchia 2002, Recanati 2003, van Rooy and Schulz 2004). 
Furthermore, an increase in the interest of psycholinguists into 
pragmatic issues has lead to a considerable amount of empirical data 
challenging the traditional theoretic approaches to make more precise 
predictions (see, for instance, Noveck 2001, Papafragou and 
Musolino 2003 and, especially, Musolino 2004). Unfortunately, such 
recent works are completely absent from Bultinck's discussions and 
arguments. This may be explained by the fact that this book, as I 
understand it, is a published version of Bultinck's dissertation which 
dates from 2001. Curiously, however, this fact is not mentioned in the 
book.

The main objective of Bultinck's corpus analysis seems to be to 
discredit the idea that numerals carry a conventional meaning that 
involves a lower bound. With this in mind, I think the three most 
relevant findings are: (A) the corpus is argued to display the 
infrequency of this alleged coded meaning; (B) the data suggest that 
there are 'numerous meanings' associated with English cardinals and 
that these are less rigidly distributed than the neo-Gricean programme 
would have it; and (C) the 'absolute value' meaning is the most basic 
one of these numerous meanings.

It is not entirely clear to what extend Bultinck's 'at least n' meaning 
corresponds to the lower bound conventional meaning defended by 
the minimalists. I doubt whether the neo-Griceans really had a modal 
coded meaning in mind. It is certainly not the case that the lower 
bound meaning necessarily involves modality. It is quite easy to 
imagine a 'cognitively simple' lower bound analysis which simply 
describes the cardinality of a group as being 'greater or equal than n'. 
In fact, such a proposal comes very close to Bultinck's own 'absolute 
value' meaning. This becomes clear from Bultinck's specification of the 
four candidate meanings. The 'at least n' meaning is described 
as ''necessarily n + possibly more then n'' (p. 176). Note that in this 
definition, one needs to assume that the number symbol 'n' has a 
greater-or-equal reading itself. If the cardinality of a group is 
necessarily 'n', how can it at the same time be possible that this 
cardinality is 'more than n'? A formulation like this one presupposes 
once again that numerals somehow line up in entailment scales. It 
follows that the 'absolute value' meaning is really a lower bound 
meaning. Consequently, one could characterise Bultinck's proposal as 
minimalistic, except that the conversational implicatures have been 
replaced by co-textual factors that trigger modal cardinality statements.

So how well does this proposal account for the data? The 'absolute 
value' meaning of numerals seems consistent with the data in the 
corpus. It is important, however, to explain in detail how the 
compositional meaning of numerals is defined, especially since these 
very meanings have turned out to be so remarkably deceptive. 
Unfortunately, the semantic processes Bultinck refers to are often not 
specified enough to assess how the sentential meanings are derived 
from a single core lexical meaning. 

Nevertheless, 'numerous meanings' contains a wealth of data and 
ideas that will stimulate the ongoing discussion of the semantics of 
simplex and complex English numerals. Anyone working on a linguistic 
topic that is somehow related to numeral meaning will definitely find a 
lot to learn in this book, especially since Bultinck's most important 
point, I feel, is not theoretical but methodological. The data are much 
more varied and complex than the neo-Gricean theories have 
assumed. On the basis of this, Bultinck argues convincingly that it is a 
mistake to search for 'the' meaning of English cardinals.

Abstract:

Fluent aphasia is a language disorder that follows brain damage, causing
difficulty in finding the correct words and structuring sentences. Speakers
also experience problems in understanding language, severely impairing
their ability to communicate. In this informative and up-to-date study,
Susan Edwards provides a detailed description of fluent aphasia, by drawing
widely on research data, and by comparing fluent aphasia with other types
of aphasia as well as with normal language. She discusses evidence that the
condition affects access to underlying grammatical rules as well as to the
lexicon, and explores the relationship between language and the brain, the
controversy over aphasia syndromes, the assessment of aphasia via
standardised tests, and the analysis of continuous speech data. Extensive
examples of aphasic speech are given, and the progress of one fluent
aphasic speaker is discussed in detail. Written by an
internationally-renowned expert, this book will be invaluable to linguists
and practitioners alike.

Ambiguity in Anaphora: Call for Papers

   http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/Research/nle/anaphora/

   7-11 August 2006, Málaga, Spain.

   A workshop held as part of ESSLLI 2006, the Eighteenth European Summer
   School in Logic, Language and Information.

   Deadline for receipt of five-page extended abstracts: <deadline>8 March 2006</deadline>
   Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

Organizers

   Ron Artstein, Massimo Poesio (University of Essex)

Description

   We invite extended abstracts for 45-minute presentations (including
   discussion) relating to ambiguity in anaphora. Anaphoric expressions
   such as pronouns and definite descriptions can be ambiguous: they may
   relate to more than one antecedent, or (potentially) denote more than
   one referent. Such ambiguity poses challenges to the representation
   of anaphoric relations in grammar and discourse and to computational
   algorithms which resolve anaphoric reference, all of which should
   allow for representing ambiguity.

   The workshop aims to create a dialogue between researchers who work on
   anaphoric ambiguity from a variety of perspectives, such as:

     - Theoretical studies of the representation of ambiguous anaphoric
       relations in syntax and semantics;
     - Discourse models which represent referential ambiguity;
     - Computational studies on the annotation and resolution of
       anaphoric ambiguity;
     - Psychological studies on the interpretation of ambiguous anaphoric
       expressions;
     - Studies of anaphoric expressions and anaphora antecedents which
       are not noun phrases.

   We especially welcome studies that cross disciplinary boundaries and
   look at anaphoric ambiguity from multiple viewpoints.

Submission

   Deadline for receipt of extended abstracts: <deadline>8 March 2006</deadline>
   Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

   Extended abstracts should conform to the following guidelines.

     - Maximum five (5) pages, including data/tables/figures/references.
     - Anonymous; do not identify the author via self-reference.
     - First paragraph should be a brief summary of the entire work.
     - A4 or letter size paper, 12 point font, 2.5 cm / 1 inch margins.
     - PDF file format, with all fonts embedded.

   Submit your extended abstracts as email attachments. In the body
   of the message include the paper title and the authors' names and
   affiliations, as well as the email address for the corresponding
   author.

   Address for submission: anaphora@essex.ac.uk

Review

   Submissions will be reviewed by an international committee of
   theoretical linguists, computational linguists and psycholinguists.

       Jennifer Arnold, University of North Carolina
       Chris Barker, University of California, San Diego
       Kees van Deemter, University of Aberdeen
       Paul Elbourne, University of Manchester
       Alan Garnham, University of Sussex
       Klaus von Heusinger, University of Stuttgart
       Véronique Hoste, University of Antwerp
       Christer Johansson, University of Bergen
       Elsi Kaiser, University of Southern California
       Ruslan Mitkov, University of Wolverhampton
       Christoph Müller, EML Research
       Rebecca Passonneau, Columbia University
       Tanya Reinhart, Tel Aviv University
       Bonnie Webber, University of Edinburgh

   Selection will be strictly by quality, and there are no quotas based
   on discipline; we hope to get a mix of papers from a variety of
   viewpoints.

Proceedings

   Final versions of the accepted papers, slightly longer than the
   extended abstracts, will be distributed in a summer school reader.
   If there is sufficient interest among the contributors, we intend
   to approach a journal for publication as a special issue.

Workshop format

   The workshop is part of ESSLLI and attendance is open to all ESSLLI
   participants. It will consist of five sessions of 90 minutes each,
   held over five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI. Each
   session will consist of two 45-minute presentations (including time
   for questions and discussion).

Registration

   All workshop contributors will be required to register for ESSLLI
   2006. The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will
   correspond to the early student registration fee.

   A number of additional fee-waiver grants might be made available
   by the ESSLLI local organizing committee on a competitive basis
   and workshop participants are eligible to apply for those.

   There will be no reimbursement for travel costs or accommodation.
   Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should
   contact the ESSLLI local organizing committee to ask for the
   possibilities of a grant.

Abstract:

Luigi Burzio's Principles of English Stress challenges many of the
assumptions that have underpinned the generative description of English
stress and more generally 'standard' metrical theory. Central to Burzio's
analysis is a novel typology of metrical constituents that includes ternary
feet and excludes monosyllabic feet. The analysis is essentially
nonderivational in character: principles of well-formedness check for the
presence of stress and weight in the output. The principles themselves are
organized into a hierarchy consisting of a hardcore-controlling foot form
that in cases of conflict may override principles of metrical consistency
and alignment of edges. The interplay among these competing principles
accounts for the cyclic effects of the standard theory. A special role is
accorded phonetically null syllables that analyse hidden metrical structure
to preserve a simple foot inventory and sharply curtail the standard
theory's extrametricality.

"The ideas explored in Principles of English Stress are highly original,
the analysis is remarkably comprehensive, the arguments are lucidly
presented and will surely prompt a serious reconsideration of many central
tenets of metrical stress theory."   Michael Kenstowicz, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

Abstract:

This new edition, updated and with additional exercises, equips those who
work, travel, and study in Arab countries with an educated form of spoken
Arabic that functions flexibly in the face of various regional colloquial
variants in the Arab world. 

Because the Arabic language has a number of very different spoken
vernaculars, being able to speak and be understood in all Arab countries
has become a challenge for English speakers. Ryding and Mehall have
designed a course that teaches a standardized variant of spoken Arabic that
is close to, but more natural than, the literary Modern Standard Arabic. 

With a non-grammar-based approach, this book fosters communicative
competence in Arabic on all levels and develops speaking proficiency
without abandoning Arabic script. It has proven to be clear, effective, and
relevant to the needs of Americans living and working in the Arab East.
Task-based lessons feature basic dialogues between Americans and Arabs,
explanations of new structures, vocabulary expansion, and exercises; and
provide gradual access to the sounds and script of Arabic by emphasizing
listening and reading comprehension first, then slowly adding oral
exercises and activities until the student has achieved basic proficiency. 

Not intended for self-instruction for beginners, Formal Spoken Arabic Basic
Course with MP3 Files assumes some previous knowledge of Modern Standard
Arabic, Arabic script and phonology, and previous or simultaneous
instruction in orthography. This new edition includes a CD of MP3 audio
exercises that are keyed to the text and drill students on listening and
speaking. 


Lessons cover topics including:

Heads of State

Cities and Countries

Official Titles

Geography

Systems of Government

Lost Luggage

Getting Acquainted

Establishing Common Ground

Seeking and Giving Information

Personal Needs and Family

Handling Problems

Eating Out

Bargaining and Buying

Meeting Description:

Celebrating more than thirty years of critically applied linguistic research at
the University of East Anglia, the School of Language, Linguistics and
Translation Studies is hosting CADAAD, an opportunity for interdisciplinary
application and development in critical approaches to discourse analysis. 

Thirty years have passed since research began at the University of East Anglia
(UEA) into what would be inaugurated as Critical Linguistics with the
publication of Language and Control in 1979. UEA has since remained at the
forefront of critically applied linguistic research.

In continuation of this tradition, the School of Language, Linguistics and
Translation Studies (LLT) invites abstracts to be considered for a conference
designed to assess the state of the art and offer new directions for critical
discourse research across disciplines. The conference is organized in
cooperation with the Centre for Applied Research in Education (CARE) and the
Centre for Staff and Educational Development (CSED).

Whilst it is CDA that has claimed the most attention, papers dealing with any
critical approaches to discourse analysis are invited across a variety of
disciplines.

Interdisciplinarity as a central theme for the conference can be interpreted in
two ways. First, we are interested in critical approaches to discourse analysis
as applied within disciplines including all humanities and sciences but also
applied and professional areas such as medicine, environmental studies,
engineering, social policy, education, law, etc. Second, the methodological
foundations of critical discourse analysis historically lie with linguistics
(from transformational to systemic functional grammar) and ethnography. However,
recently the critical discourse analysis enterprise has benefited from a wider
range of methodlogies. We therefore also welcome and encourage papers reflecting
the theoretical advances in linguistics, psychology and cognitive science
amongst other disciplines which offer the opportunity for critically applied
discourse research to expand its methodological arsenal.

As of now, CAADAD appears to be the only international forum during 2006
offering the opportunity for scholars to exchange ideas in a conference setting.
The conference will experiment with a new form of online proceedings inviting
post-conference interaction between presenters, participants and an external
audience. From this process selected presentations will be published as printed
proceedings. CADAAD is pursuing publication opportunities with the John
Benjamins series Discourse Approaches to Politics, Society and Culture (DAPSAC).

Abstracts of 300 words plus references should be submitted to
discourse@uea.ac.uk by <deadline>25 February, 2006</deadline> in Word format (RTF or plain text are
acceptable alternatives, use of PDF is discouraged). Successful applicants will
be notified by 1 May.

Further details including information on plenary speakers, registration dates,
fees, accommodation and travel tips will be available soon on the conference
website at http://discourse.uea.ac.uk.

International Conference
Research on second and foreign language acquisition and teaching 
Paris, 6-8 September 2006
Organized by Groupe 'Langues en contacts et appropriations', DILTEC, Paris III
Call for papers
colloque@groupelca.org 

Research on second and foreign language acquisition has been conducted during the past thirty years from various theoretical perspectives, focussing on multiple factors, cognitive and social. Lately, several attempts have been made to describe developmental routes and stages in the L2 acquisition process. They mainly consist of lists of morphosyntactic means pertaining to the noun phrase, to the verb phrase, and to the clause, that are mustered by learners  at given stages for a specific L1. SLA research has also been devoted to classroom discourse and teaching activities during the past years. Yet, the relevance of SLA research for second or foreign language teaching is regularly questioned. This conference aims at a dialogue between researchers in language acquisition and language pedagogy over grammar, the lexicon, pragmatics, and discourse. 
	
This conference invites SLA researchers and those involved in research on second language pedagogy to examine their findings in terms of its relevance for language teaching.

Proposals that include specific interest for language teaching are expected. They will focus on the learning of L2 (or L3, L4 or Lx) grammar, lexicon, pragmatics, and discourse in classroom or guided settings. The mode of implication of teachers and learners during the SLA research process shall also be discussed from the angle of the impact of the research design on teaching activity and, conversely, from the angle of the intricate relation between teaching and researching.

Proposals are expected to fit in one of the following sections :

A. Discourse practices and grammatical marking: teaching and learning.

In this section , shall be discussed the relations between grammatical markers, lexicon and the learners' discourse practices. The learnability of discourse, of macrosyntactic patterns and of the grammatical markers of the target language shall be examined as well as the order of acquisition of different L2 forms and of different functions for a given form. The teachability of macrosyntactic structures and of grammatical markers in their specific context shall also be discussed. 

B. L2 development, curriculum design, pedagogical grammars and testing

Contributions which bear on the use of research findings in SLA to design teaching and testing materials will be selected for this section. The focus will be on the analysis of curriculum design and of teaching activities that are organized to enhance and facilitate the input-intake process. Theoretical constructs involved in course and class design shall be discussed. 

C. Research design and teaching tasks and activities in L2 learning

The design of data collection for SLA research may foster or develop L2 classroom learning. This workshop is devoted to methodological and theoretical issues related to the organization of data gathering and other experimental tasks of SLA research in relation to learners and teachers, and teaching activities in institutional settings.

Proposals based on empirical data analysis are most welcome. 

Contributors are asked to submit two copies of their proposal (about 300 words long) before the <deadline>15th of February 2006</deadline> (final deadline) - one the copies will have been anonymized - to colloque@groupelca.org

Acceptance or refusal of the submitted proposal shall be notified on the 31 st of March 2005. 

Organizing committee : Catherine Carlo, Cyrille Granget, Dominique Klingler, Kim Jin-ok, Mireille Prodeau, Kamila Sefta, Georges Daniel Véronique

Abstract:

How do people learn nonnative languages? Is there one part or function of
our brains solely dedicated to language processing, or do we apply our
general information-processing abilities when learning a new language? In
this book, an interdisciplinary collaboration of scholars and researchers
presents an overview of the latter approach to adult second language
acquisition and brings together, for the first time, a comprehensive
picture of the latest research on this subject. 

Clearly organized into four distinct but integrated parts, Mind and Context
in Adult Second Language Acquisition first provides an introduction to
information-processing approaches and the tools for students to understand
the data. The next sections explain factors that affect language learning,
both internal (attention and awareness, individual differences, and the
neural bases of language acquisition) and external (input, interaction, and
pedagogical interventions). It concludes by looking at two pedagogical
applications: processing instruction and content based instruction. 

This important and timely volume is a must-read for students of language
learning, second language acquisition, and linguistics who want to better
understand the information-processing approaches to learning a non-primary
language. This book will also be of immense interest to language scholars,
program directors, teachers, and administrators in both second language
acquisition and cognitive psychology.

Dissertation Abstract:

Comparison of English with two Asian tone languages (Naxi and Vietnamese)
suggests that lexical specifications (phonemic contrasts and lexical
accentuation) and intonation stand in a relationship of resource-sharing:
the former provide the framework within which intonational variation takes
on its meaning. Typologically, each language arguably allows speakers a
given degree of freedom; Naxi (4 lexical tones) appears more constrained
than English, and also than Vietnamese (although the latter has 6 tones).
The experimental results (which include an estimation of voice quality by
electroglottography) hint at the presence of a superposition of several
phenomena, rather than one single prosodic structure. They allow for a
discussion of a question raised by the autosegmental-metrical framework of
intonation studies: do accentuation and intonation converge to shape a
tonal string for the utterance (in all languages)? The results suggest that
the latter view may be an oversimplification.

Dissertation Title: The Effects of Different Task Types on Intake and
Acquisition of Two English Grammatical Structures 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics


Dissertation Director(s):
Rod Ellis

Dissertation Abstract:

Recent years have seen a growing interest in the role of tasks in second
language acquisition. A substantial body of research now exists
investigating the effects of different task types and their accompanying
instructions on learning. Less is known about how tasks affect intake and
the relationship between intake and acquisition. 

This study investigated the effects of 1) implicit and explicit inductive
instructions and 2) various task types on both intake and acquisition of
two English grammatical structures. Fifty adult ESL learners enrolled in
private language schools in New Zealand were pretested with the help of a
timed and an untimed grammaticality judgement test for prior knowledge of
negative adverbs and adverb placement and were randomly assigned to either
a dictation, an indvidual reconstruction, or a collaborative reconstruction
treatment. Treatments were accompanied by either implicit instructions
(containing only practical instructions on how to perform the task) or
explicit instructions (drawing participants' attention to the target
structures and giving an example of it). Performance on the treatments was
taken as a measure of intake, and talk-aloud reports were obtained to gauge
participants' awareness during task completion. Gain scores from pretest to
posttest and to delayed posttest were taken as an indication of learning
effects. 

The results show that the explicit instructions of the inductive type used
in this study were unable to affect participants' intake and acquisition in
comparison with the implicit instructions. Also, the three types of
treatments did not have an effect on acquisition in many cases. Where there
was an effect, the treatments differentially affected intake and
acquisition. Dictation led to high intake, but less acquisition, and the
individual reconstruction treatment led to low intake, but greater
acquisition. The collaborative reconstruction treatment was the most
consistent of the three. The cognitively more demanding reconstruction
treatments (i.e. those involving the retention of larger amounts of texts
over longer periods of time) resulted in greater acquisition than the
dictation treatment. 

The main theoretical implications of the results are that the type of
inductive and low-level explicit instructions used in this study were not
sufficient to differentially affect intake and acquisition. Other, more
explicit types of treatments may be necessary. The results also indicate
that task types that are relatively easy, affect intake to a greater extent
than more demanding tasks, but that more demanding tasks are more likely to
affect acquisition. 

On a methodological level, the concept of intake was found to be very
difficult to operationalise, and it is suggested that additional measures
be developed. Finally, the implications for teaching practice are that for
relatively complex structures such as negative adverbs and adverb placement
exposure to the input with minimal pedagogic intervention may not be
sufficient. Teachers may also want to consider the effects of different
task types on both intake and acquisition and both teachers and researchers
need to be careful in drawing conclusion on the basis of immediate task
performance.

Dissertation Title: Evaluating Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis for use in
Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) 

Linguistic Field(s): Applied Linguistics


Dissertation Director(s):
Marie-Josée Hamel
Harold Somers

Dissertation Abstract:

Despite the fact that Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis has the potential to
bring a number of new possibilities to Computer-Assisted Language Learning
(CALL), it has not yet made an impact on CALL. It is believed that this is
because it has not been adequately evaluated for the purposes. With the aim
of validating this claim, an infrastructure for the evaluation of CALL
applications integrating TTS synthesis is put forward and evaluations
conducted to date are assessed with respect to it. This analysis indicates
that TTS synthesis has indeed not been adequately evaluated for the
purposes of CALL, specifically, that an important stage in the process of
evaluation has been omitted in all evaluations that have been conducted to
date, namely requirements analysis. With the aim of developing a benchmark
test for the evaluation of the adequacy of TTS synthesis systems for use in
CALL applications, this thesis looks to SLA research for indications of
what the requirements of TTS synthesis for use in CALL might be. This
literature review suggests that CALL applications place demands on the
quantity, quality and flexibility of the speech generated by TTS synthesis
systems. Regarding the demands that it is suggested that CALL applications
place on the quality of the speech generated, in order to validate these
requirements, two investigations are carried out. The results of these
investigations, which also attempt to determine whether the different roles
that TTS synthesis systems may assume in CALL applications impose different
requirements on the quality of the speech generated, suggest that, as
suggested by the SLA literature, CALL applications do place demands on the
comprehensibility, accuracy and naturalness of the speech generated by TTS
synthesis, but that, in addition, they also place demands on
intelligibility, choice of pronunciation, naturalness of voice,
expressiveness and register and that the different roles do indeed place
different demands on the quality of the speech generated by TTS synthesis
systems, but that teachers and CALL researchers have difficulty
differentiating between the different roles and their requirements. It is
believed that the results of these investigations imply that evaluations of
the adequacy of TTS synthesis systems for use in CALL applications ought to
address all of the aspects of the quality of the speech generated by the
TTS synthesis systems mentioned above. Regarding the different roles that
TTS synthesis systems may assume within CALL applications, it is believed
that they imply that, while the different roles do impose different
demands, it will not be possible to ask participants to differentiate
between these roles and their requirements. Rather, participants can only
be asked to rate the quality of the speech generated by TTS synthesis
systems for use in CALL applications in general.

OVERVIEW

Two key questions open a fascinating discussion introduced by Daniel 
Wedgwood's ''Shifting the Focus: From Static Structures to the 
Dynamics of Interpretation''. The first is how are we to delimit the 
object of study of semantic and syntactic competence and produce 
realistic models if not taking into account extra-linguistic cognitive 
capacities? The second is what kind of theory is required to give the 
analyst the access to all potentially significant extra-linguistic factors? 
Stating that pragmatics is typically not given nearly its due as a source 
of explanation of linguistic phenomena Daniel Wedgwood suggests a 
very elegant and profound theoretical model to explain meaning 
construction during parsing which involves significant pragmatic 
enrichment. By pragmatics the author means general inferential 
processes which participate in meaning construction and 
interpretation. The book opens with two chapters of theoretical 
discussion while chapters 3-8 provide illustration to thorough linguistic 
analysis of what is called ''focus position'' of Hungarian.

CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER SUMMARY

Chapter 1 ''Language and Meaning'': This chapter challenges some 
fundamental assumptions of conventional analytical approaches that 
attempt to explain the relationship between natural languages and 
meanings they convey. Frameworks maintaining a traditional notion of 
syntax-semantics interface are argued to be incoherent. Throughout 
the chapter the author discusses the approaches to pragmatics and 
its place in the study of grammar; semantics and its role in the 
interpretation of natural language; and argues that the assumption (as 
conventionally construed) of compositionality is conceptually 
inappropriate to the study of natural languages. The author provides 
the theoretical and empirical considerations to show that approaches 
which explain grammar mechanisms of translating word-strings into 
compositional derivations of propositional meanings lead to 
unnecessary and undesirable over-complication of the grammar itself. 
By introducing the considerable evidence for the widespread 
existence of ''pragmatic intrusion'' the author suggests abandoning of 
conventional conception of the syntax-semantics interface as a direct 
mapping from one set of static structures to another. The approach 
logically presumes to revise and more precisely define the 
term ''semantics''.

Chapter 2 ''Relevance Theory and Implications for Linguistic Structure'' 
gives a brief overview of Relevance Theory (RT) as the most well-
grounded of available inferential pragmatic approaches to account for 
inferential side of the construction of meaning. RT recognizes that 
interpreting a linguistic act practically always involves a mixture of 
decoding and inference, it provides a way of reasoning about what the 
scope of encoding within a generative framework should be. The 
author emphasizes the fact, that owing a considerable historical debt 
to Grice's work, the actual mechanisms of RT and the drawing of the 
semantic-pragmatic distinction are significantly different to those of 
Grice and his followers. Stating that little work in RT has addressed 
the question of inference during parsing an utterance, the author 
suggests a 'dynamic' approach which views the surface structures of 
natural language as consisting of incrementally 
processed 'instructions' to the interpreter to build certain kinds of 
structured propositional form. From the 'dynamic' perspective, the 
construction of propositional meaning should be modelled in terms of 
building partial representations during the incremental parse of a 
string of words which makes hierarchical syntactic representations not 
logically necessary on the assumption that linguistic objects encode 
significant amounts of procedural information.

Chapter 3 ''The Hungarian Data'' gives a brief overview of the main 
trends in the analysis of PV phenomena under mainstream syntactic 
approaches. Introducing the basic data the author characterizes the 
basic positions of the Hungarian sentence, immediately pre-verbal 
position, verbal modifiers, and other PV elements.  The syntactic 
accounts of the data discussed do not provide relevant explanation 
between VMs, syntactic foci, etc., because they rely on a considerable 
number of highly abstract elements, many of which encode semantic 
effects. By analyzing the notion of focus itself the author proves that 
introducing pragmatic theory to explain syntactic effects should 
undoubtedly help the researchers to overcome the limitations set by 
compositional semantics and static representations of syntactic 
structure.

Chapter 4 ''Focus and Grammar'' begins with some comments 
regarding the notion of focus and brief reviews of existing approaches 
to focus. It shows that the common analysis of the Hungarian 'focus 
position' based on compositional semantic view leads to incorrect 
empirical predictions. Introducing Szabolcsi's arguments for the 
exhaustivity operator approach the author shows that the supposedly 
encoded exhaustive reading arise as the unmarked reading of narrow 
foci in both Hungarian and English, despite their different ways of 
expressing focus. Non-exhaustive narrow foci require special forms of 
signaling in both languages. Another important contribution of this 
chapter is to show that standard forms of pragmatic reasoning -- 
specifically, 'quantity implicature' -- straightforwardly predict the 
unmarked exhaustive reading to narrow foci. The relevant notion 
of 'narrow focus' is considered briefly in this chapter and suggestions 
are made for a more adequate definition with reference to the 
existence of a particular presupposed eventuality in accordance with 
pragmatic reasoning about the derivation of exhaustive readings.

Chapter 5 ''Focus and Quantifier Distribution'' aims at resolving one 
further important issue that revolves around the use of the PV position 
for the expression of narrow focus. This is the question of how 
quantified noun phrases are distributed across PV and the other 
linearly pre-verbal positions of the Hungarian sentence. This chapter 
investigates quantificational data to provide further illustration of the 
negative consequences of conventional assumptions about the syntax-
semantics interface and the concomitant under-use of inferential 
pragmatics. Adding to the arguments of the previous chapter, the 
analysis of QNP's provides a further illustration of how compositional 
encoding accounts for the exhaustive reading associated with PV 
leads to an unsustainable analysis. The author suggests the analysis 
which follows from re-interpreting Szabolcsi's insight that 
different 'semantic assessment procedures' are encoded in the 
different pre-verbal positions, such that these procedures are taken to 
be reflections of the cognitive perspective taken on different pieces of 
information conveyed by parts of the sentence.

Chapter 6 ''Dynamic Structured meaning: Predication and Information 
Structure'' develops the idea that a 'syntactically focused' expression 
is in fact a predicate over a logical subject that is formed out of the 
rest of the sentence and it forms the basis for a formal analysis of the 
PV position In the current chapter the basis of the analysis is put 
through the continued investigation of the information-structure 
significance of PV. The emphasis is on the connection between the 
narrow focus and the creation of ''topic : comment'' readings, in which 
the tensed verb is not preceded by a PV expression and its denotation 
is understood to be part of the (broad) focused part of the utterance, 
that is the analysis is centered around the role of the verb in the 
relation to the discourse. The resulting account brings together 
narrow foci and the 'comment-initial' verbs of topic : comment 
sentences via the notion of 'main predication', a term coined by the 
author for the act of predication that creates  a propositional form out 
of a non-truth-conditional representation. The procedure is 
represented using a flat, neo-Davidsonian semantics, in combination 
with the epsilon calculus.

Chapter 7 ''Verbal Modifiers and Main Prediction''. In this chapter it is 
shown that that VMs share with VM-less verbs the property of 
introducing certain key elements of structure into the eventuality and 
that this is the basis of the ability to be an unmarked main predicate. 
Such structure must be introduced at the point of main predication or it 
can not be introduced at all, other than by presupposition. The 
behavior of VNs both in the presence of narrow foci and in 'neutral' 
sentences is shown to follow from the dynamics of the main 
predication analysis, being fundamentally a matter of the order in 
which different expressions are processed, relative to each other and 
to crucial point of procedural encoding. This proves once again that a 
processing-based, inferentially informed approach gives an 
explanatory analysis and as such introduces great clarity into a model 
of linguistic competence.

Chapter 8 ''Aspectual Constructions' and Negation''. At issue of this 
chapter are two 'aspectual' constructions that are often claimed to 
encode aspectual semantics. These are the so-called 'progressive 
construction' (PC) and 'existential' or 'evidential' construction (EC). 
The last major issue is the distribution of the Hungarian negative 
particle nem. PC is shown to be a simple case of main prediction by 
the main verb, under which the analysis the necessarily inferential 
interpretation of a post-verbal VN is predicted without further 
stipulation/ EC on the other hand involves tense itself acting as main 
predicate. The negation particle nem is given a new analysis as a 
consistently local operator, converting an act of predication into one of 
negative predication. Thus, once again, this phenomenon 
demonstrates how the dynamic, pragmatically informed approach to 
linguistic analysis produces an explanatory theory of natural language 
processing phenomena.

Chapter 9 ''Summary and Conclusions'' encompasses the most 
important theoretical implications of the book and outlines the 
perspective on further research.

EVALUATION

This book brings together a variety of approaches, theoretical as well 
as practical, for dealing with focus position in Hungarian. Rejecting the 
idea of direct mapping between linguistic structures and their 
interpretations Daniel Wedgwood extends current ideas from 
frameworks such as Relevance theory and Dynamic Syntax to 
introduce a new approach to modeling linguistic competence. As the 
author remarks in his book the ideas of his theory stem from some 
very basic observations about the nature of human language.

Most of such observations found their explanation in research on 
natural language processing. The last decades suggested different 
approaches to explain the mechanisms of natural language 
processing.  The current debate on natural language processing is 
not restricted to Linguistics, but also takes place in Psychology, 
philosophy, Neurosciences, and related disciplines.  The present book 
is another contribution to this domain, as it brings evidence from the 
language of a very rich morphology, Hungarian.

The author's approach corresponds to interactive models which treat 
the mental lexicon as a dynamic functional system and an integral part 
of human cognitive abilities. Under interactive approach the items in 
the mental lexicon are viewed as the products of a complex interaction 
of perceptual, cognitive, emotional and verbal experience stored in 
one's memory and simultaneously utilized at different levels of 
consciousness when a word provides access to interconnected 
fragments of the personal knowledge and world image. In his book 
Daniel Wedgwood presents a very impressive and broad linguistic 
analysis and very convincing explanation of a complex set of 
syntactico-semantic analysis of predication, quantification, negation, 
etc. however, what might be even more important, he sets a new 
perspective for modeling linguistic competence. The attempt to model 
the processes involved in this complex activity may present quite a 
challenge to other researchers. The book cools the heat existing in 
debate on natural language processing existing between linguists and 
psycholinguists who approach linguistic phenomena from a language 
user's perspective, and is a valuable reading for the specialists in the 
field of linguistics, psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence, and 
language philosophy. 

ABOUT THE REVIEWER

Tatiana Sazonova (PhD in General Linguistics, Academy of Science, 
Moscow, Russia, 2000) holds the Chair of General Linguistics at 
Kursk State University in Kursk, Russia. Her current research focuses 
on modeling the processes of word identification in communication to 
account how words are used to access the interconnected fragments 
of knowledge stored in one's memory. The theory of word 
identification is a part of the cognitive theory of language 
understanding. The strategic model was suggested to account for 
multiple effect of the interaction of semantic, syntactic, 
phonetic/phonemic graphemic, and morphological representations in 
the natural language processing. Her work has appeared in a variety 
of edited volumes and journals.

Abstract:

People often mean more than they say. Grammar on its own is typically
insufficient for determining the full meaning of an utterance; the
assumption that the discourse is coherent or 'makes sense' has an important
role to play in determining meaning as well. Logics of Conversation
presents a dynamic semantic framework called Segmented Discourse
Representation Theory, or SDRT, where this interaction between discourse
coherence and discourse interpretation is explored in a logically precise
manner. Combining ideas from dynamic semantics, commonsense reasoning and
speech act theory, SDRT uses its analysis of rhetorical relations to
capture intuitively compelling implicatures. It provides a computable
method for constructing these logical forms and is one of the most formally
precise and linguistically grounded accounts of discourse interpretation
currently available. The book will be of interest to researchers and
students in linguistics and in philosophy of language.

Abstract:

In Lexical Strata in English, Heinz Giegerich investigates the way in which
alternations in the sound patterns of words interact with the morphological
processes of the language. Drawing examples from English and German, he
uncovers and spells out in detail the principles of 'lexical morphology and
phonology', a theory that has in recent years become increasingly
influential in linguistics. Giegerich queries many of the assumptions made
in that theory, overturning some and putting others on a principled
footing. What emerges is a new, formally coherent and highly constrained
theory of the lexicon - the theory of 'base-driven' stratification - which
predicts the number of lexical strata from the number of base-category
distinctions recognized in the morphology of the language. Finally, he
offers new accounts of some central phenomena in the phonology of English
(including vowel 'reduction', [r]-sandhi and syllabification), which both
support and are uniquely facilitated by this new theory.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Concord Phenomena and the Syntax Semantics Interface
http://www.heddezeijlstra.nl/cpssi.htm
August 7 -- 11, 2006

organized as part of the
European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information
ESSLLI 2006 http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es/
31 July - 11 August, 2006 in Malaga, Spain

Organizers:
Paul J.E. Dekker (p.j.e.dekker@uva.nl)
Hedde H. Zeijlstra (hedde.zeijlstra@uni-tuebingen.de)

-Concord Phenomena-
In natural languages a functional operation can be manifested more than once in the morphosyntax of one sentence. Most notable are the phenomena of negative concord (where several negative elements contribute to one negation) and sequence of tense phenomena, where the same happens in the temporal domain. Similar observations can be made regarding the domain of mood, case-agreement, multiple Wh, and conditional sentences. On a general and intuitive level, the similarities are striking.

-Thematic Questions-
These phenomena have each been studied in various domains, from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view. With this workshop we want to solicit contributions which approach the phenomena from a general, cross-categorial perspective: across the various domains, theoretical, and typological as well. Thematic questions: What should be the logical form of those constructions? To what extent (at what cost) does it allow for a compositional treatment? How similar and how general are the phenomena really? What do these phenomena tell us about the model of grammar?

-Workshop Aims-
The general aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers of different disciplines (semantics, syntax, typology) in order to create new insights about concord phenomena and the syntax-semantics interface. The workshop aims to provide a forum for advanced PhD students and researchers to present and discuss their work with colleagues and researchers who work in the broad subject areas represented at ESSLLI.

-Submission Details-
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract on the general theme of the worshop. (Cognitive and evolutionary analyses are welcome, too.) Submissions should be anonymous and no longer than two pages and should be either in .pdf, txt, .doc or .rtf format. Please send your submission electronically to the above email addresses of the organizers, with the name of the author(s) and their affilitation(s), their adresses and the title of the paper in the body of the message. The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop's programme committee (see below).  The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by ESSLLI. The format for the final version will be .pdf.

-Workshop Format-
The workshop is part of ESSLLI 2006. It will consist of five 90-minute sessions held over five consecutive days in the second week of ESSLLI. Depending on the number and quality of the submissions there will be 2 or 3 slots for paper presentation so the talks including the discussion will be either 45 or 30 minutes. On the first day the workshop organizers will give an introduction to the topic, and the workshop ends with a general discussion.

-Follow Up-
The organizers intend both to organize a follow up of this workshop, and a book or special journal issue around the subject. Both options will be discussed at the workshop in Malaga.

Final programme    :  June 21, 2006
Workshop Dates     : August 7 - 11, 2006

-Local Arrangements-
All workshop participants including the presenters will be required to register for ESSLLI.  The registration fee for authors presenting a paper will correspond to the early student/workshop speaker registration fee.
There will be no reimbursement for travel costs or accommodation. Workshop speakers who have difficulty in finding funding should contact the local organizing committee to ask for the possibilities of a grant.

Meeting Description:

LENS is an annual international workshop focusing on formal semantics and is organized as a satellite of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence conference. This year's workshop, the third LENS, will include a special session on formal pragmatics. In recent years there have been a number of exciting developments in this area. Researchers have applied game-theoretical and utility-theoretic techniques to problems such as Gricean communication and relevance, implicature, and blocking; for instance, new work in multidimensional logic has given insight into conventional implicature; new formal techniques have been applied to discourse structure and coherence. We hope in this year's workshop to bring together researchers in this area.

Meeting Description:

The second conference on Quantitative Investigations in Theoretical Linguistics (QITL-2) will be hosted in June 2006 by the Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück, Germany. 

Invited speakers: Tom Wasow (Stanford), Suzanne Stevenson (Toronto) 

Call for Papers:

Quantitative Investigations in Theoretical Linguistics 2 (QITL-2)
                          1-2 June 2006

Traditionally, theoretical linguistic investigation and quantitative methodologies have been antithetical. But this has been changing rapidly in recent years, with an increasing recognition of the role that quantitative methods can play in the investigation of the structure of the human language faculty.  As at the first QITL meeting (Osnabrueck 2002), we would like to bring together researchers from theoretical, computational, quantitative and psycholinguistics who are interested in applying quantitative methods to theoretical issues in language to share their work.

We invite researchers engaged in quantitative investigations of theoretical linguistic questions to submit abstracts for 30-minute talks (plus 10 minutes of discussion).  The focus should be on a question of linguistic interest, which may be approached either from a more theoretical or a more quantitative perspective.  Applications in computational linguistics may also be of interest if they lead to or shed light on theoretical questions.  Relevant topics include (but are by no means limited to): models of lexical semantic preferences, rule productivity, grammar acquisition, and the issues surrounding the use of the Web as a representative corpus.

Abstracts should be 2-3 pages long, including figures, tables and references (this corresponds to approx. 1000-1500 words).  

Electronic submission by e-mail to qitl@uos.de is strongly preferred (PDF, PostScript, RTF).


Important dates:

        <deadline>24 February 2006</deadline> - Deadline for abstracts
