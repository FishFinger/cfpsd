IJCAI-07 Workshop 

Workshop on Analytics for Noisy Unstructured Text Data 
8 January 2007 , Hyderabad, India 

http://research.ihost.com/and2007 
 
Call for Papers 


Workshop Description and Objectives 
Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as
online chat, SMS, emails, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, wikis and
web pages. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech,
printed text, handwritten text contains processing noise. Text
produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing
spelling errors, abbreviations, non-standard words, false starts,
repetitions, missing punctuations, missing case information, pause
filling words such as "um" and "uh." Such text can be seen in large
amounts in contact centers, on-line chat rooms, OCRed text documents,
SMS corpus etc. The theme of the IJCAI 2007 Conference is "AI and its
benefits to society." In keeping with this theme, this workshop
proposes to look at text analytics of highly noisy text that is
produced in such everyday applications in society. 
The goal of the workshop is to focus on the problems encountered in
analyzing such noisy documents coming from various sources. The nature
of the text warrants moving beyond traditional text analytics
techniques. We hope that the workshop will allow researchers to
present current research and development in addressing this
challenge. We also believe that as a result of this workshop there
will be sharing of real life noisy data sets and will result in their
becoming available to a wider research community. 
 
Topics 
We welcome original research papers that identify key problems related
to noisy text analytics and offer solutions. We particularly encourage
contributions that look at solving real life problems in the different
settings where such data is produced in huge amounts. Potential topics
include (but not limited to): 
"	NLP techniques for handling noisy unstructured data 
"	Characterization of the types of noise in documents 
"	Genre recognition based on the type of noise 
"	Robust parsing 
"	Characterizing, modeling and accounting for historical
language change 
"	 Methods for detecting and correcting spelling and grammatical
errors in noisy text 
"      Information Extraction and Retrieval from noisy text 
"      Automatic classification and clustering of imprecise documents 
"      Noise-invariant document summarization techniques 
"      Issues in keyword search in presence of noise in unstructured
data 
"    Machine Translation for noisy text 
"    Text analysis techniques for analysis and mining of call-logs,
transcribed calls, web logs, chat logs, email exchanges 
"	    Business Intelligence(BI) applications for contact centers
that deal with noisy data 
"    Surveys on aspects of text analytics for noisy unstructured data
  
Participation 
We hope that the workshop will allow researchers working in areas
related to unstructured data analytics, Natural Language Processing,
Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, etc., to focus on the
needs of users extracting useful information from noisy text. The
target audience is a mixture of academia and industry researchers
working with noisy text. We believe this work is of direct relevance
to domains such as call centers, the world-wide web, and government
organizations that need to analyze huge amounts of noisy data.

IAPR Best Student Paper Award 
IAPR is sponsoring the Best Student Paper Prize at AND 2007. One paper
in which a student is the primary author (first author/presenter) will
be selected for the IAPR Best Student Paper Award. The awardee will be
nominated through the paper reviewing process and the final decision
will be made during the workshop. The award carries a cash prize of
$160 which will be given at the conclusion of the workshop. 

Publication 
We are currently in negotiation with a leading publisher for the
proceedings to be available onsite. We have also received tentative
approval for a special issue of a journal for post-workshop
publication of selected papers.
