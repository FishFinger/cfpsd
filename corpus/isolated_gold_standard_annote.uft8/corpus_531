Subject: Journal of Natural Language Engineering -- Call for Special Issue
        Proposals
Message-ID: <CMM-RU.1.5.1154378483.rasmusse@research.rutgers.edu>


Journal of Natural Language Engineering 

*** Call for special issue proposals *** 


The area of Natural Language Engineering is following the trend of
many other areas, becoming highly specialised with a number of
application-orientated and narrow-domain topics emerging or growing in
importance. These developments, often coincident with a lack of
related literature, necessitates and warrants the publication of
specialised volumes focusing on a specific topic of interest to the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) research community. 

The Journal of Natural Language Engineering invites proposals for
special issues on a competitive basis on any topics of applied NLP
which have emerged as important developments in Natural Language
Engineering and which have attracted the attention of a number of
researchers or research groups. 

Topics could cover a variety of NLP methods, tasks and resources as
well as NLP-related applications but should focus on the practical
implications of operation on the large scale. Topics covering NLP
methods, tasks and resources could include but are not limited to POS
tagging, parsing, semantic role labelling, word sense disambiguation,
anaphora and coreference resolution, named entity recognition, natural
language generation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, multimodal
processing, statistical methods in Natural Language Engineering,
machine learning, evaluation methodologies, corpora and
ontologies. Topics covering NLP applications could include but are not
limited to machine translation, translation memory, translation tools,
summarisation, information retrieval, information extraction,
alignment, term extraction, question answering and CALL. 

Calls for special issue proposals may be based on a successful
workshop or a body of work associated with a particular group or
section of the community. In all cases, however, the reviewing process
of the accepted proposals will be rigorous and all submissions must be
be reviewed by at least 3 members of the Guest Editorial Board or
other suitable reviewers agreed by the NLE Editors. In the case of
papers previously submitted to workshops, the Guest Editors will not
be able to re-use previous workshop reviews. In addition, the call for
papers of the accepted proposals must be open to all interested
parties and all authors will be given equal treatment; in the case of
proposals based on previous workshops, submissions cannot be limited
to workshop participants only. 

Interested editors have the option of preliminary feedback should by
emailing expressions of interest accompanied by a brief description of
the intended special issue to the Executive Editor
(<mailto:John.Tait@sunderland.ac.uk>John.Tait@sunderland.ac.uk). He
will give a brief indication of whether the topic is appropriate to
Natural Language Engineering.  In the case of initial positive
feedback, the prospective Guest Editors will be asked to submit a
proposal for a special issue which will be reviewed by the Editors of
the journal and where appropriate, by other members of the Journal
Editorial Board. One proposal will be selected on a competitive basis
for each call with the envisaged publication date for the successful
proposal from this call on or after June 2008. 

The proposal for a special issue should include a brief outline of the
field and rationale as to why it is important to launch a special
issue on the particular topic of interest. It should include a
relevant literature survey (related previous special issues, volumes,
workshop and conference proceedings) and should explain the added
value of the proposed special issue against the background of other
relevant publications and volumes (if applicable). The proposals
should also include a tentative Guest Editorial Board, tentative
time-scale for the production of the special issue and information
about the prospective Guest Editors (relevant experience, publications
etc.).
