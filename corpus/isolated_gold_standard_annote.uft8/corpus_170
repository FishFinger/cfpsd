Conference description: 
Academic mobility is growing year after year. University staff, students,  researchers and officers in higher education are increasingly travelling Europe and the  world as part of their work or studies. In Europe, several EU programmes have proved  to be successful within the European countries and are now extending to the whole  world (ex: Erasmus Mundus). Yet, few studies are available on the ''hypermodern''  mobile academic individuals. What is known of the lives of these ''new strangers''  (Murphy-Lejeune)? How do they deal with their daily lives? What sort of  relationships do they develop? What about the competences they develop while  abroad? Do they alter their views on their own ''foreignness'' and that of the others? In  what way do their experiences differ from those of ''normal migrants''?  Aim of the conference:  The main aim of the conference is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for discussing  the actors of academic mobility. Papers are welcomed from lingu!
 istics, education,  anthropology, sociology, psychology, geography and educational policy, among  others. 

Other aims include: 
- To promote debate and reflection in the existing information and research in 
academic mobility and related fields; 
- To  raise awareness within higher education regarding academic mobility; 
- To identify needs inhome and host institutions; 
- To improve administrative, intercultural and teaching experiences of  staff;
- To support academic mobility; 
- To establish research networks on academic mobility. 

Conference themes: 
- Categories of mobile / non-mobile individuals in higher education 
- Daily lives 
- Identification (ex: national, European, Erasmus identities) 
- Mobile academics' representations (of themselves, the EU, of their home  countries, their hosts, etc.) 
- Learning (foreign language acquisition, intercultural competence...) 
- Challenges (student support) 
- Virtual academic mobility 
- Long-term effects of academic mobility 
- Representations on academicmobility (in the media, with ''locals''...)

ELIGIBILITY

You do not have to be a member of LACUS to submit an abstract. If your abstract is accepted, you must be a member to present your paper at the meeting. Members will automatically receive the publication resulting from the conference.

PRESIDENTS' PRIZES

Continuing a tradition started by the late Kenneth Pike, a committee consisting of the President, the President-Elect, and former Presidents of LACUS will select the winner of the annual Presidents' Prize, with an award of $500, for the best paper by a junior scholar. For purposes of this prize, 'junior scholar' is defined as one who has had a doctoral degree or its equivalent for less than five years.

The Presidents' Predoctoral prize, with an award of $100, will be given for the best paper by a student who has not yet received a doctor's degree.

For purposes of these prizes, 'best paper' is defined as that which in the judgement of the committee makes the most important contribution to knowledge. Organization and presentation and the quality of the abstract are also considered.

The prizes will be awarded at the annual banquet, to be held at the end of the meeting, Saturday, August 5th.

Only single-authored presentations will be considered for prizes. A person who has won the same prize twice is no longer eligible.

Junior scholars and predoctoral scholars should identify their status in the e-mail message sent in with the abstracts, to indicate their eligibility for one of the prizes.

FINANCIAL AID

Thanks to the Ruth Brend Memorial Fund, limited assistance may be available for scholars from countries with weak currencies who submit strong abstracts. For information, contact the Conference Committee Chair, Douglas Coleman.

2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

                       EACL 2006 Workshop on
       Multi-dimensional Markup in Natural Language Processing:
              5th Workshop on NLP and XML (NLPXML-2006)

               http://ilps.science.uva.nl/nlpxml2006/

                    April 4, 2006, Trento, Italy

                  Submission deadline: <deadline>January 6, 2006</deadline> 

The EACL 2006 Workshop on Multi-dimensional Markup in Natural Language
Processing will be hosted in conjunction with the 11th Conference of the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, which will
take place April 3-7, 2006, in Trento, italy.

This workshop is also the fifth in the NLPXML series, following workshops at
NLPRS 2001 in Tokyo, COLING 2002 in Taipei, EACL 2003 in Budapest, and ACL 2004
in Barcelona. 

- TOPICS

The widespread adoption of XML within the NLP community as the main standard for
both data and meta-data representation has led to research in a number of issues
relating to XML and NLP.  One particularly interesting challenge arises from the
difficulty in combining annotations resulting from disparate NLP systems in a
single hierarchical structure.  For downstream applications that rely on a range
of linguistic annotations, problems such as crossing boundaries and overlapping
elements from different sources make it difficult to query data with multiple
dimensions of annotation.

As in previous NLPXML workshops, we invite papers addressing the full range of
topics relating NLP and XML.  The special focus of this workshop is
multi-dimensional markup.  Our goal is to bring together researchers from
several different fields --- natural language processing, corpus linguistics,
markup languages, and information retrieval --- to discuss theoretical and
practical issues related to the integration of different layers of text
annotation.  Thus, we particularly welcome papers that discuss the problems
associated with such integration as well as those that provide solutions,
whether proposed or implemented, within any of the four fields.  We are
especially interested in the effects that chosen solutions have on the type of
queries that can be made, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.

- SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop.  Submissions should be formatted using the EACL
2006 stylefiles with overt author and affiliation information and not exceeding
8 pages. The EACL 2006 stylefiles are available at
http://eacl06.itc.it/submission/submission.htm

Please send your PDF file no later than <deadline>January 6, 2006</deadline>, to

COMPUTATIONALLY HARD PROBLEMS IN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING:
   EXPRESSIVENESS VS. TRACTABILITY IN LEARNING AND INFERENCE

WEBSITE: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ryantm/naaclWS06/

Call for Papers

Modern machine learning methods (such as maximum entropy models, decision trees
and support vector machines) have provided the language processing community
with robust tools for supervised learning problems with simple outputs.  These
methods provide natural mechanisms for representing linguistic knowledge through
weighted features and obtain high accuracy by maximizing performance on training
data.

Unfortunately, when one wishes to apply similarly robust techniques to
problems with complex outputs, one is limited to models with nice computational
properties, such as those that can be formulated in terms of sequence or tree
representations.  Even for these relatively simple structures, polynomial time
algorithms exist only under strong restrictions on the locality of features (the
Markov assumption for sequences and the context free assumption for trees). 
Moreover, even under such assumptions, the complexity of these algorithms can
grow unwieldy even while remaining polynomial, for instance in the case of
synchronous or lexicalized context free grammars.

Recent work on ranking, sampling and other approximate solutions to such
problems have indicated that researchers are coming back to the hard problems in
speech and text, for which efficient algorithms do not (or are not known to)
exist.  Some might even argue that language processing has more to gain from
richer and more global feature representations than it does from new machine
learning solutions.

The purpose of this workshop will be to explore new research aimed at
identifying and solving speech and language processing problems that do not have
practical computational properties.  We also wish to explore the adaptation of
current state-of-the-art inference and learning algorithms to problems beyond
sequence and tree analysis.  In particular the workshop will have the following
themes:

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATION

- Formal investigations on the computational properties of new and old  
problems in speech, parsing, translation, summarization, information  
extraction and other common language processing areas.

- Moving beyond the Markov and context-free assumptions of our   underlying
representations.  Identifying the linguistic   (im)plausibility of these
assumptions.  Global feature functions   that incorporate much richer
information about sentence and document   level properties as well as long
distance dependencies.

- Joint representations such as those incorporating both syntax  
(phrase-structure, dependencies, etc.) and semantics (entities,   relations,
predicate-arguments).

- Efficient solutions to problems that have historically been viewed   as
intractable.

- Appropriate (natural) representations of problems, and how this   effects
complexity/performance.  Structure of search.

- Identifying when old solutions (e.g. classification, sequential   labeling) to
new problems are appropriate and when more flexible   solutions are required.

LEARNING AND INFERENCE

- Approximate inference algorithms.  The pros and cons of pruning   techniques.
 New approximation algorithms for hard problems   including those based on beam
search, sampling or other motivated   methods.  Surveys of known approximation
and pruning methods   identifying specific properties of success and failure. 
Efficiency   vs. performance trade-offs.  Formal characterizations of search  
errors, and their relation to complexity.

- Approximate parameter estimation.  Training techniques for models in   which
parameter estimation is intractable for both generative and   discriminative
frameworks.  The effects of approximate parameter   estimation on performance. 
Learning parameters with respect to   approximation in search.  Batch vs. online
learning techniques when   combined with approximate inference.

- Joint structures and complex systems.  When are pipelined methods  
sufficient?  When do we need joint learning and inference to achieve   maximum
benefit?  Are the benefits of joint inference and learning   for factorizable
structures worth the computational cost?

- The trade off between loss functions and tractability.  When is it   necessary
to use structure, or can components be predicted   separately?  Theoretical or
practical comparisons between   computational complexity and performance for
different loss   functions.

- Differences between complex one-pass systems versus   stacked/multi-pass
''decoding.''

We encourage the submission of papers that address any of the above themes.

This workshop is interested in completed work as well as works in progress.

Submissions should be a maximum of 8 pages and should use the HLT-NAACL
formatting guidelines that can be obtained here.  Furthermore, the reviewing

Meeting Description:

'Exploring the Lexis-Grammar Interface' (ELeGI 2006), International Conference,
5-7 October 2006, University of Hanover, Germany 

We would like to announce a 3-day international conference on the topic
''Exploring the Lexis-Grammar Interface'' that will be hosted by the English
Department at the University of Hanover, Germany, from 5-7 October 2006
(Thursday to Saturday). 

Conference organisers: Rainer Schulze and Ute Römer
Contact: Ute Römer, ute.roemer@anglistik.uni-hannover.de  

Over the last two or three decades, research in corpus linguistics has shown
that lexis and grammar are closely interdependent. The conference aims to bring
together scholars with a common interest in aspects of lexis-grammar
co-selection in the English language. We aim to discuss empirical evidence on
the inseparability of lexis and grammar, and explore in what respects these two
parts that are often treated separately in linguistic description form an
organic whole. 

We are pleased to announce that the following keynote speakers have accepted our
invitation:
Professor Sylviane Granger, University of Louvain, Belgium
Professor Michael Hoey, University of Liverpool, UK
Professor Susan Hunston, University of Birmingham, UK
Professor Joybrato Mukherjee, University of Giessen, Germany
Professor Michael Stubbs, University of Trier, Germany

We invite the submission of 1-page abstracts (300-500 words, excluding
references) for 20-minute presentations (plus discussion) of original research
on any aspect related to the conference theme, including (but not restricted to)
pedagogical, diachronic, and genre-specific aspects.

Conference language: English

The deadline for submitting abstracts is <deadline>15 March 2006</deadline>. All abstracts will be
reviewed and authors will be notified of acceptance/rejection by 1 May 2006. 

To submit your abstract, please use the Word form that is available on the
conference website (http://www.elegi-2006.com) and send it as an email
attachment to ute.roemer@anglistik.uni-hannover.de.

Making Sense of Sense: Bringing Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics
Together

April 4, 2006, Trento, Italy

http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/EACL06WS/

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

The EACL 2006 Workshop on Making Sense of Sense: Bringing Psycholinguistics and
Computational Linguistics Together will be hosted in conjunction with the 11th
Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics that will take place April 3-7, 2006, in Trento, italy.

- TOPICS

Although research on lexical ambiguity has a long history in the field of
psycholinguistics, work in this area is rarely considered in debates concerned
with identifying relevant sense distinctions for NLP. Recent research in the
field of psycholinguistics may offer significant insight into the sense
distinctions that humans readily recognize. This workshop will explore
approaches to the problem of sense distinction from the viewpoint of both
computational linguists and psycholinguists, in order to bring the work in each
field to bear on the problem.


- SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers on original, unpublished work in the
topic area of this workshop.  Submissions should be formatted using the EACL
2006 stylefiles with overt author and affiliation information and not exceeding
8 pages. The EACL 2006 stylefiles are available at

Meeting Description:

A 2 day conference, organised by the Language Learning and Teaching Special Interest Group of the British Association of Applied Linguistics.  The goals of this conference are to explore, synthesise and build upon what is currently known about:
a)	how instructed second/foreign language learners perceive, process and internalize environmental language, and 
b)	the teaching and learning of strategies which best promote this internalization.

A 2 day conference, organised by the Language Learning and Teaching Special Interest Group of the British Association of Applied Linguistics and hosted by the Centre for Applied Language Research, University of Southampton, UK

Keynote Speakers:
Professor Merrill Swain, University of Toronto
Professor Suzanne Carroll, University of Calgary 
Professor Michael Grenfell, University of Southampton 
 
Call for Papers:
This event follows the highly successful BAAL/CUP seminar at York University in April 2005, at which the LLT SIG of BAAL was first launched. The overall aim of the SIG is to promote new thinking about language learning and teaching processes within BAAL, and within UK applied linguistics more generally. The goals of this second conference are to explore, synthesise and build upon what is currently known about:

a)	how instructed second/foreign language learners perceive, process and internalize environmental language, and 
b)	the teaching and learning of strategies which best promote this internalization.  

Papers and discussion will focus on the relationships between language perception and parsing processes, language practice, language use, and language learning, from different theoretical perspectives. Whether, and how, these interfaces can be enhanced by instruction will be of prime concern. A further important aim will be to identify methods and research agendas for investigating what learners do with the input they are exposed to in classrooms. The programme will also incorporate a strand of papers organized by UKPOLLS (UK Project on Language Learning Strategies).

We invite contributions relating to these themes from both established and less experienced researchers. The selection of individual papers will privilege reports of empirical research and/ or papers addressing methodological issues.   

The final deadline for receipt of paper proposals is <deadline>3 February 2006</deadline>.

Notification of acceptance of papers will be given by 17 February 2006.

Inquiries are welcomed by the SIG Coordinators and Conference organizers:
Prof Ros Mitchell, University of Southampton	r.f.mitchell@soton.ac.uk
Dr Emma Marsden, University of York		em502@york.ac.uk.
 
Programme: Further Details
The keynote speakers will address the theme of the topic from different perspectives: sociocultural theory (Prof Swain), autonomous induction theory (Prof Carroll), learning strategies (Prof Grenfell). Their provisional topics / titles are as follows:

-Professor Merrill Swain (University of Toronto)
''Languaging, agency and collaboration in second language learning''

-Professor Suzanne Carroll (University of Calgary)
''From input to output: how the raw material of SLA affects the learning process''

-Professor Michael Grenfell (University of Southampton)
''Modern Foreign Language Learning and Teaching in the UK and Language Learner Strategy Research''  

In addition to the plenary keynote talks there will be two strands of individual papers including a group of papers organized by the UK Project on Language Learning Strategies. Papers will be selected by a panel of LLTSIG committee members and a UKPOLLS representative. The selection criteria will be: relevance to the conference theme; originality of contribution (in terms of theoretical perspective, empirical findings and/ or research methodology); overall coherence of argument. Papers reporting work-in-progress with an emphasis on methodologies for researching links between language use and language learning in classroom settings will be especially welcome. The timeslot  for individual papers will be 30 minutes to include discussion.

The BAAL LLT SIG
The Language Learning and Teaching Special Interest Group of BAAL was established in 2004 to provide a focus for BAAL members and other UK-based researchers with research interests in language learning and teaching. The shared interests of SIG members include:
-	Research into language classroom interaction, language learning and teaching and relationships between these, in a range of learning sites (conventional classrooms, immersion, CLIL, language learning VLEs);
-	Research strategies and new methodologies for researching language learning and teaching;
-	Theories of (instructed) second language acquisition;
-	Teaching and learning of first, second and third languages and relationships between these;
-	Language education policies and implementation e.g. in task/ curriculum design;
-	Motivation, language learning strategies and language awareness.

The LLT SIG organized a successful BAAL/ CUP Seminar at the University of York in April 2004, on the topic ''Instructed SLA: State of the art''. It has also organized a successful SIG strand at the 2004 BAAL Annual Meeting in Bristol, and will be organizing a symposium at BAAL 2006 in Cork. The first formal Annual General Meeting of the SIG will take place during the Southampton conference.

Membership of the SIG is free to all BAAL members and open to others on payment of a subscription of £15 per year (the standard BAAL reduced -rate subscription).  Conference participants are actively encouraged to join both BAAL and the LLT SIG!

Meeting Description: 

39th annual meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea (SLE), to be held at the university of Bremen/Germany 

Meeting Description: The theme of this international meeting is RELATIVISM AND UNI-VERSALISM IN LINGUISTICS. Throughout the history of linguistics, two opposing views on linguistic facts have been competing with each other. Simplifying, a crude version of relativism takes the structural diversity of human languages to be evidence of the differential determina-tion of language structures by non-linguistic factors (most prominently, culture-dependent world-views, etc.). An equally crude universalism, on the other hand, denounces the very same facts as secondary and thus largely unimportant phenomena behind which the ''real'' language is hidden. This supposed real language, then, is organized in such a way that it obeys universally valid rules (which may be innate). SLE2006 wants to tackle the question of whether and how a reconciliation of the two standpoints can be achieved. Therefore, we especially welcome papers and workshop proposals which explicitly invite the discussants!
  to weigh the pros and cons of the two vistas on language. Empirically-minded and theory-oriented contributions are equally welcome as long as they directly address the Relativism vs. Universalism dichotomy. This topic is relevant for all areas of grammar and practically all other disciplines subsumed under linguis-tics (from diachronic linguistics via language contact to ethnolinguistics).

Registration fees (to be paid in advance by 30 May 2006): 
Members:		
70 euro (100 euro after 30 May 2006)
Non-Members:

DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK'S PURPOSE AND CONTENT

Semantics is generally defined as the linguistic subfield that studies 
the meaning of linguistic expressions, be they words, phrases, 
sentences, and texts (see Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990). 
There are more areas of study in semantics: the relations between 
different linguistic expressions (synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, 
meronymy, etc.), thematic roles, argument structure (thus having 
connections with syntax), the area of studying the sense and 
reference, the truth conditions, and the formalization of meaning.

Paul Bennett's ''Semantics'' is an intermediate-level textbook on 
semantics. As the subtitle indicates, the book covers topics related to 
non-lexical aspects of meaning, thus one cannot expect to find here 
discussions related to lexico-semantic relations and not even to 
formalization of the meaning of linguistic expressions (although this is 
also not specifically lexical in nature).

Besides delimiting the area of interest, the introductory chapter 
provides explanations for the grammaticalization phenomenon, the 
distinctions polysemy-monosemy, semantics-pragmatics, and for 
prototypes. These notions prove useful in the other chapters, where 
the author focuses on specific topics.

Chapter 2 deals with syntactic and semantic categories. The main 
questions receiving an answer here are the following: can one predict 
the syntactic category and behaviour of a word by only considering its 
meaning? do syntactic characteristics of words follow directly from 
their meaning? Both questions receive a partially affirmative answer. 
The prototype theory is helpful here to distinguish between words that 
are prototypical representatives of a syntactic category and those that 
are marginal within the syntactic category they belong to (see the 
case of words derived from members of other category and retaining 
the semantics of their source category).

Chapter 3 presents the proposition types, with special focus on 
Vendler classes (states, activities, achievements, accomplishments): 
their characteristics, some problems related to this classification, 
alternative approaches (Steedman1977, Chafe 1970), the distinction 
between grammatical relations and argument structure, two notions 
that are useful in some classifications of propositions.

Chapter 4 deals with deixis in its four forms: person, social, special 
and temporal. 

The semantics of the three tenses (past, present, future) makes the 
topic of the fifth chapter. The notion of time is also necessary to 
describe the tense system. Reichenbach's system is presented 
altogether with alternative analyses (Klein's, Bull's). The future tense 
stands alone among the English tenses due to its modal-like status 
(that is why this is also discussed in chapter 7 where modality is in 
focus).

A discussion of the semantics of tense must also consider aspect. 
Chapter 6 presents the characteristics of the perfective and 
imperfective (habitual and progressive) aspects, their more or less 
controversial status, and some aspect frameworks.

The semantics of verbs and of proposition also cannot ignore 
modality, which makes the topic of the seventh chapter. There are 
different ways of expressing modality, but special emphasis here is on 
the grammaticalized forms of expressing it: auxiliaries. The distinction 
between deontic and epistemic modality (and other types with a 
controversial or at least not widely recognized status) is exemplified 
and discussed drawing the reader's attention on the degrees of 
modality. Auxiliaries are polysemantic: they are used to express 
various modal meanings. Different approaches to this problem are 
critically presented.

Chapter 8 deals with negation: its types (sentential versus constituent 
negation), its scope and focus (here metalinguistic negation and 
negative raising are presented), polarity, its interaction with modality, 
the semantics of negative sentences, the pragmatic aspects involved 
in the use of negation. However, when discussing the semantics of 
negation, we think that it is worth mentioning expletive negation (a 
formally negative sentence with a positive meaning) (for a detailed 
classification of negation using various criteria and with examples from 
Romanian see Barbu Mititelu and Maftei Ciolaneanu 2004).

The last chapter focuses on the semantics of determination: its types, 
and its lexical ways of expression.

Each chapter is followed by some notes and suggestions for further 
reading on the topics dealt with in the respective chapter. The book 
also contains a short glossary of the key terms used, a bibliography 
and an index.

CRITICAL EVALUATION

Whenever an approach is presented, it is critically evaluated by the 
author: its advantages and disadvantages, its coverage of the 
phenomenon, its applicability are discussed. Any shortcoming of an 
approach is exploited to justify alternative approaches existent in the 
literature dealing with the respective phenomenon. For instance, the 
fact that in Reichenbach's tense system there is no definition for the 
notion of reference time was objected to by W. Klein, who proposed 
another tense system. In cases when more than one approach to a 
phenomenon is presented, the correspondences between them are 
emphasized.

In chapter 3, we think that an enlarged discussion about the inventory 
of semantic roles would have been appropriate. The author's reasons 
for avoiding that are stated on page 54: ''defining semantic roles is 
extremely difficult'', ''they are no longer central objects of linguistic 
investigations'', ''their usefulness is very limited''. We agree with that 
position only partially. The FrameNet project 
(http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/), the attempts to build such a 
resource for other languages than English, and the utility of such a 
resource is proof that it is worth studying semantic roles and creating 
databases with such roles for predicates. They are useful for further 
applications in Natural Language Processing.

Terminology may vary from one school to another and sometimes from 
one linguist to another. The author mentions them and also provides 
reasons for the terminology he adopts (see for instance page 140 for 
the discussion of the terms ''mood'' and ''modality''). 

Each topic discussed is presented from both a monolingual and a 
cross-lingual perspective. Languages vary in the way semantic 
classes are realized syntactically, in the fact that translationally 
equivalent propositions may display different grammatical structures, 
in the means used to express the meanings associated with tense, 
aspect and modality, in the types of negation they display, etc. 

Phenomena in linguistics are not isolated from each other. And neither 
are they presented in isolation in this textbook. References from one 
chapter to another, that is from the presentation of one linguistic 
phenomenon to another, and presentations of the way phenomena 
interact are quite frequent throughout the book.

Examples are illustrative for the purpose they are given. However, 
there are situations when the reader would better understand some 
explanations had the author exemplified the facts presented. For 
instance, on page 4, grammaticalization is defined, after Hopper and 
Traugott (1993), as ''the process whereby lexical items and 
constructions come in certain contexts to serve grammatical functions, 
and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical 
functions'' but no example in the history of any natural language is 
provided for the reader, to ease understanding. 

The quality of this textbook is sustained by the clarity with which topics 
are introduced, by the fact that they are presented in the way they 
interact in language. However, some exercises at the end of each 
chapter would have helped students understand through practicing.

SUMMARY:

This second edition of ''American English: Dialects and Variation'' by 
Walt Wolfram and Natalie Schilling-Estes is a ''thoroughly revised and 
updated version'' of the 1998 text by the same title.  This volume is 
written for a broad-based student audience, including those who have 
not previously studied linguistics.  The language is accessible and the 
authors' goal is to keep linguistic terminology to a minimum.  It is 
appropriate for upper level undergraduate and graduate students.  
The text is conceptually divided into four sections: a basic introduction 
to dialect variation (ch.1-3), the history and development of dialects of 
American English (ch. 4), social factors influencing dialect variation 
(ch. 5-9), and applications of dialect study (ch. 10-11).  

SYNOPSIS

Chapter 1 (1-27): In ''Dialects, Standards, and Vernaculars,'' the 
authors begin by defining the term 'dialect' as used in linguistics and 
as used popularly.  Then they move into a discussion of myths and 
linguistic realities concerning dialect variation, notions of standard 
versus vernacular varieties, and choice of labels for vernaculars. 
Some of the myths considered are: ''a dialect is something that 
someone else speaks; only varieties of a language spoken by socially 
disfavored groups are dialects, and [dialects] are deviations from 
standard speech.''  The chapter ends with a consideration of why 
people study dialects.  

Chapter 2 (28-63), ''Why Dialects,'' addresses questions such as, why 
are there so many dialects, what factors influence dialect difference, 
and why do dialects persist in a country where there is widespread 
media influence?  To answer these and other questions, social, 
historical, and linguistic explanations are provided.  However, the 
authors acknowledge that varying combinations of these factors 
produce unique results.  Therefore, ''...when sociohistorical and 
linguistic factors come together in combinations and proportions that 
are sometimes difficult to specify exactly...the resultant product- the 
dialect- turns out to be a unique variety whose distinctive flavor would 
be lost if it were mechanistically constructed...(63)

Chapter 3 (64-102): ''Levels of Dialect,'' discusses the ways in which 
dialects may differ.  Each ''level'' -- lexicon, phonology, grammar, 
semantic, and pragmatic--provides one type of distinctiveness.  
Moreover, the chapter explores how these levels of dialect variation 
are distributed across social groups and considers American reactions 
to such differences.

Chapter 4 (102-133): ''Dialects in the United States: Past, Present, 
and Future,'' examines the development of dialects in the United 
States from the earliest arrival of settlers through the current period.  
The basis for understanding dialect patterning is found in the 
interaction among groups, and in settlement and migration patterns.  
Classic analyses (by Kurath) and more recent analyses (by Labov; 
Schneider) of dialect distribution are discussed in this chapter.  

Chapter 5 (134-166): ''Regional Dialects'' discusses various methods 
used in the study of regional dialects.  This chapter takes a more in-
depth look at some of the methodologies introduced in the previous 
chapter.  It includes such topics as elicitation methods, distribution 
patterns of characteristic (and non-characteristic) forms, mechanisms 
of dialect diffusion, and people's perceptions of dialect variation 
(perceptual dialectology).

Chapter 6 (167-210): ''Social and Ethnic Dialects'' delves into an 
examination of varieties that are correlated with specific social and 
ethnic groups.  From the outset the authors indicate that there 
important social implications connected to these varieties, ''...speakers 
may be judged on capabilities ranging from innate intelligence to 
employability and on personal attributes ranging from sense of humor 
to morality'' (167).  Generally less well-known varieties are included in 
this chapter, such as Latino English, Cajun English, and Lumbee 
English.

Chapter 7 (211-233): ''African American English'' is one of the 
revisions made to this second edition.  That is, the 1998 edition 
included the discussion of this variety as part of the previous chapter.  
In addition to discussing the origin and early development of African 
American English, its distinctiveness vis-à-vis European American 
English and its contemporary development are explored.  

Chapter 8 (234-265): ''Gender and Language Variation'' has been 
significantly revised and updated.  The first four subsections discuss 
some of the same gender-based issues as in the 1998 edition, but 
additionally bring to bear new research, including the authors' work on 
Ocracoke English.  The chapter investigates gender-based language 
variation from two research perspectives: that of regional and social 
dialects and that of gender-based individual and conversational 
patterns.  From these perspectives, the reader gets a more 
global, ''large-scale'' view of the subject, as well as one that is more 
local, ''close-up.'' 

Chapter 9 (266-293): ''Dialects and Style'' focuses on variation in the 
speech styles of individuals. The discussion highlights the influence 
that situational changes, attention to speech, audience, and individual 
initiative exert on speech style shifts.  The chapter ends with a focus 
on speaker design approaches to variation, indicating that these 
approaches ''increase our understanding of intra-speaker language 
variation (290).''   

Chapter 10 (294-328): ''On the Applications of Dialect Study'' moves 
the reader to consider practical applications of the information 
presented in the 9 chapters  leading up to this one.  Invoking the 
words of Labov (1982) concerning the ''principle of error correction'' 
and the ''principle of debt incurred,'' the authors recount linguists' 
social activism in situations occurring from the 1960s through 2003. 
The chapter continues by showing the connections that information on 
dialect variation has on general standardized testing, on language 
testing, and on teaching standard English.

Chapter 11 (329-360): ''Dialect Awareness: Extending Application'' 
continues the discussion about the applications of dialect study.  The 
focus in this chapter is applicability to reading and writing.  For 
reading, the writers' concern is the correlation between dialect-
speaking populations and reading failure.  Linguistic considerations 
are placed along side cultural and social ones in addressing this 
area.  In examining dialect features that appear in writing, the chapter 
discusses both inadvertent and deliberate uses.  Information on 
themes for curriculums about dialects and on roles that dialectologists 
can play in increasing dialect awareness, especially within the 
communities in which they have carried out their research, end the 
chapter.

Appendix (361-384): ''An Inventory of Distinguishing Dialect Features'' 
includes phonological and grammatical features that were mentioned 
(and some not mentioned) within the chapters.  The emphasis is on 
features that are ''socially significant in terms of the standard-
vernacular continuum''.

EVALUATION

This second edition of ''American English'' is written in an 
approachable style that should be inviting to a broad audience, 
including those who have not studied linguistics.  Often, chapters 
begin with anecdotes that are familiar scenarios, drawing the reader 
into the material.  The authors state in the preface, ''we have tried to 
keep technical linguistic terminology to a minimum,'' yet, there seems 
to be significant number in the text.  One issue is, of course, how to 
determine what constitutes a ''minimum.''  Another issue is the broad 
audience for which the text is intended.  That is, to the non-linguist 
undergraduate, the technical terms may seem numerous, but to their 
other potential audience--graduate students in linguistics--the 
terminology may be welcomed, feeling just right.  However, to the 
authors' credit, they have integrated the terminology into the narrative 
in an unobtrusive manner such that the beginner can grasp meanings 
without focusing on them, while the incipient specialist can take note 
of them for further study. The text maintains a good balance between 
presenting informative material and providing theoretical frameworks 
for understanding important issues.  Such a balance is quite difficult to 
carry out.

Unlike some revised editions, this one has been ''thoroughly revised'' 
as indicated in the preface.  For example, five of the eleven chapters 
(5, 6, 8, 9, and 11) have been expanded or have new material added.  
Moreover, the chapter on African American English has been 
expanded to the point of becoming its own separate chapter, rather 
than being a subsection of ''Social and Ethnic Dialects, as in the first 
edition.  Even the comprehensive Appendix of dialect features has 
been updated with new entries covering vowel mergers in words like 
Don and Dawn, the progressive with stative verbs, and a new 
structure in the verb phrase section -- the quotative 'be like' and 'go'.  
There are also newly added reference sources for those who want 
more extensive descriptions of dialects.

Another strong feature is the inclusion of many exercises in each 
chapter. These too have been updated or changed.  For instance, 
exercise 4 in the first chapter discussed the term 'ebonics' in the 1998 
edition.  At that time, the 1996 Ebonics Resolution by the Oakland, 
California School Board was a current topic of much research.  In the 
current revised edition, exercise 4 uses the Hispanic or Latino 
population as its focus.  Moreover, labels such as Anglo American 
English have been updated to ones in current use, European 
American English.

While ''American English, 2nd edition'' contains numerous components 
that make it an exceptional text, one that is particularly strong is the 
infusion of cultural, political, and educational implications throughout.  
These are the emphases that Allen (1993) has indicated as relevant 
for ''today's'' student (15).  These foci continue to be important.  In 
addition, since the authors indicate that the text is intended for ''a full 
range of students interested in a course on dialects...,'' highlighting 
such elements is crucial for helping readers understand real world 
connections to the linguistic material and for encouraging the 
development of more positive attitudes about linguistic differences. 

Two additions might make this text even more inviting.  First, while 
each chapter ends with an annotated bibliography of additional 
sources, only two contain web-based resources.  The internet is such 
a ubiquitous site of information for most students that it is almost an 
unspoken expectation that more of these sources will be identified.  
Next, this text fills such an important need -- to provide well 
researched information to counter the many myths and misinformation 
about dialects and dialects speakers -- that strengthening its appeal to 
a wider teacher audience would certainly increase its positive impact.  
That is, it is already written to appeal to the student who is not 
specializing in linguistics.  That very feature makes it also accessible 
to the teacher who has an interest in offering a course on dialects, but 
who is not a linguist.  For such persons, an accompanying teacher's 
manual that provides models (or potential responses) for the 
exercises and that gives additional detailed insights about 
using/teaching the text would make ''American English'' more 
approachable from an instructional perspective.  In this way, this 
incredible text could be of the most good to the most people.

DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS

The first four chapters of this slim volume (129 pages of text, plus 
several indexes and appendices) are a good introduction to the 
language situation in Africa as a whole, while the last four chapters 
explicitly address issues of language endangerment.

Chapter 1 is a useful summary of the language families of Africa - 
where they are spoken, and a few sample languages. Batibo (B) also 
introduces what I find a useful term - ''plurilingualism'' - to label a 
situation where a country or continent has many languages, 
reserving ''multilingual'' to describe an individual speaking several 
languages. He also sketches the situation with regard to language 
contacts between African languages, both ancient and modern, and 
the situations that arise from these.

Chapter 2 introduces patterns of language use and prestige. B 
presents an admittedly idealized ''triglossic'' structure of language use, 
with a colonial language often having higher prestige than a dominant 
indigenous language. However, the dominant indigenous language 
has more prestige than a minority language. Here he also mentions 
that national leaders associate ex-colonial languages with socio-
economic development, and this trumps resolutions for promotions of 
indigenous languages passed by OAU and similar bodies (including 
linguists...). He describes characteristics of dominant languages which 
make them dominant, and also the dynamism of languages in contact 
that leads to phenomena of code-mixing, code-switching, and 
borrowing. His summary statement is a guiding principle for those 
involved in trying to sustain endangered languages: ''As long as 
speakers see some social status or socio-economic value in their 
languages, they will certainly wish to maintain them.''

Chapter 3 talks of characteristics of African languages, viewing them 
as a resource. First he discusses the functions that languages play, 
focusing on Africa, but the same points could be made elsewhere in 
the world. Language serves as a vehicle for cultural transmission, as a 
means of self-identity, societal cohesion, social stratification, of 
socialization and even establishing social relations (a young lady in 
Lomé addressed by a young man in the Mina language may answer in 
French as a sign that she does not desire any relationship with him). B 
then goes on to summarize the unique linguistic characteristics of 
African languages, from clicks to labialvelars to ATR vowel harmony, 
noun class systems, serial verb constructions, etc. The cultural wealth 
of African languages is illustrated, with figurative speech, 
proverbs, ''joking relations,'' etc.  The indigenous languages could be 
used for national development, but generally are not.

Chapter 4 delves into the status of minority languages in more detail, 
defining them not only in terms of low number of speakers, but also 
functionally as not being used in official or public domains. Colonial 
languages may be actually spoken by relatively few people, but they 
function in public domains more commonly. Local languages may be 
areally dominant, and these are not considered minority languages 
either. In most African nations, most of the languages are minority 
languages. Speakers of these are often caught in a dilemma, wishing 
to retain their own linguistic and cultural heritage, but also wanting 
access to education and better-paying jobs. Even though studies have 
shown the advantages of mother-tongue education, most minority 
languages have no resources for such. Governments, in their 
understandable desire for national unity and to eradicate tribalism, 
often devalue or actively discourage minority languages in their 
language policies.

In Chapter 5, B starts in on specifics of endangered African 
languages, first defining endangered as ''threatened by extinction,'' 
and noting that endangerment is a sliding scale, with ''highly 
endangered'' on one end and ''safe'' on the other. He discusses 
factors leading to language endangerment when two unequal 
languages are in contact. These include the resistance of the weaker 
language to the stronger one, the amount of pressure exerted by the 
stronger language, and finally, the perceived advantages of joining 
the stronger community. He acknowledges that any attempt to quantify 
endangerment runs into the problem of inadequate data, and so many 
of the conclusions must remain ''highly speculative.'' For information 
on specific languages, B cites a number of resources which the 
serious investigator might consult, including the Ethnologue (Grimes 
2000), and various papers from Brenzinger's (1998) volume. The 
remainder of the chapter is a country-by-country summary, listing 
population, major languages, and what B considers highly 
endangered languages. His judgment of the latter is based on 
population figures, degree of bilingualism in the dominant language, 
socio-political pressures, negative attitudes and non-transmission of 
the language to children, and especially where only older people 
spoke the language. It is admittedly based on partial information in 
many cases, but he estimates that 14% of African languages are 
presently highly endangered.

In Chapter 6, B defines more carefully the processes of language shift 
and language death. He mentions the Gaelic-Arvanitika model of 
Sasse, based on causal factors leading to cessation of transmission of 
the language, but spends more time on his own model, a process-
based one. This model assumes that for language shift and eventually 
death to take place, there must be bilingualism, a differential prestige 
in the 2 languages, and that attraction to the new language outweighs 
resistance to change. It has five phases: 1) relative monolingualism, 2) 
bilingualism with L1 predominance, 3) bilingualism with L2 
predominance, 4) restricted use of L1, and 5) L1 as a substratum, at 
which stage L1 is dead. He mentions sudden language death due to 
disease, genocide, or deliberate decision to switch languages, but 
most language death is gradual, involving the factors discussed in the 
models. He stresses that attitudes toward language are crucial.

Chapter 7 concentrates on language maintenance, particularly in 
cases of the lesser of two unequal languages. It is common in Africa 
for two (or more) languages to exist in a more or less state of equal 
prestige. In this case, L1 and L2 speakers learn each others' 
language, which B calls ''unmarked bilingualism.'' If L1 is more 
dominant than L2, L2 is maintained only when people are able to 
resist pressures, and the most important factor is their attitude toward 
their own language. B gives a summary of a previous study of his 
application of Auberger's ''proficiency resistance model.'' Lists of 
factors by Blench and UNESCO are also given. Among these factors 
is a written form of the language, something that is missing in many 
African languages. B also discusses language revitalization, but gives 
non-African examples such as Maori, since there has been virtually no 
documentation of any African language being revitalized. He is not 
optimistic about most African minority languages, since ''gains in the 
prestige of minority languages are not a common phenomenon.''

Chapter 8 speaks of language empowerment. We have the label 
of ''minority'' languages, though the sum total of ''minority'' language 
speakers in a country is often a majority of the population. But they 
are often disenfranchised from national life and discourse - the 
powerless. Language empowerment measures are discussed here, 
including specific language policies by governments, planning and 
what is often more difficult, implementation of those plans. B singles 
out Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa as having 
explicit language policies, but these are not the norm in the continent. 
There are ideological and technical issues to be dealt with, and B 
gives a number of recommendations for government actions. He lists a 
number of African initiatives of recent decades, most of which have 
vanished, as well as listing a number of organizations that are 
becoming quite interested in endangered languages recently.

B ends with three useful Appendices. The first lists the nationally and 
areally dominant languages, country by country. The second, more 
debatably, lists highly endangered, extinct, or nearly extinct languages 
for each country. The third lists the number of dominant and minority 
languages of Africa, also by country, concluding that of 2477 African 
languages, 308 are highly endangered. A Language Index as well as 
a Subject/Author Index are included.

EVALUATION

This is an excellent introduction to the topic of endangered languages 
in Africa. But beyond that, by referencing and summarizing much of 
the theoretical literature on endangered languages, it actually serves 
as a readable primer to the factors that make languages endangered 
around the world and what can be done about them. Those who 
would like more detailed and specific African case studies may want to 
take a look at other works such as Brenzinger (1998).

B is occasionally uncritical of sources, as when he labels the 
predictions of Michael Krauss that 90% of the world's languages will 
disappear by 2100 as ''statistics'' rather than speculation. He cites 
Sapir and Whorf uncritically, whereas their views are a continual 
source of debate.  He also calls labialvelars as ''unique'' to Africa, 
whereas they also occur in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and (rarely) 
in South America as well. His book is understandably weighted by his 
experience in Tanzania and Botswana, and would benefit especially 
from more West African input. However, these are minor quibbles 
compared to the overall value of the book.

Also, I believe there is reason to be somewhat more hopeful than 
Batibo is about the survival of many African languages. With 
orthographies being developed by groups such as NACALCO and 
CABTAL in Cameroon, BTL in Kenya, SIL and Lutheran Bible 
Translators in various countries, as well as by other groups, several 
hundred languages are in the process of receiving orthographic 
representations, literacy materials, and Bibles in their own language, 
and a number of these are also getting dictionaries and grammars. 
Besides the direct value of having literacy and other materials 
available, the presence of these tends to raise the prestige of the 
language in the speakers' minds, and their attitudes towards their own 
languages become crucially more positive (as B himself notes in the 
case of the Naro language). Still, it remains to be seen how much 
these positive factors will be able to counteract the negative ones 
against the survival of the minority languages of Africa.

DESCRIPTION

In Grammar and Philosophy in Late Antiquity, Anneli Luhtala (L.) of the 
University of Helsinki argues that, since the grammatical treatise 
Techne Grammatike is not wholly attributable to Dionysius Thrax and 
thus does not date to the first century BCE, one must look to later 
centuries for the development of the so-called 'standard philosophical 
or semantic categories'; as a result of such later developments, L. is 
able to argue for a continued interaction between grammar and 
philosophy into Late Antiquity that is longer and more intensive than 
traditional accounts would allow, and that better explains seeming 
philosophical inconsistencies in the categories as they appear in 
Priscian.

Written generally in the spirit of E. F. K. Koerner's 'linguistic 
historiography' (the book is published in the series edited by him; and 
see e.g. Koerner 1999), L.'s study is explicitly framed as a contribution 
to the 'new model' of scholarship on 'ancient language science' 
(Taylor 1987), and to its ongoing revision of traditionally teleological 
and overly schematic accounts of nascent linguistics in the ancient 
Greco-Roman world. It is detailed and, I think, convincing, and will be 
of interest to students of the history of linguistics and philosophy 
generally and the history of grammar in particular.

CONTENTS

A short Preface (ix-x) contextualizes the study in terms of L.'s own 
interests in ''Priscian's grammatical theory'' and ''the reception of 
Priscian ... in the Carolingian Renaissance'': at issue are 
the ''inconsistencies in [his] philosophical framework'' (ix). Rejecting 
the influential but outdated work of Karl Barwick, L. aligns herself with 
Vincenzo di Benedetto (1958-1959), in particular his ''arguing in 
favour of the inauthenticity of the Techne'' (x), and with subsequent 
scholars who thought out the consequences of the issue.

Chapter 1, Introduction (1-11), summarizes L.'s reading of the 
traditional position and her response to it in light of more recent 
scholarship: ''to diminish the role of philosophy in pre-Apollonian 
grammar and to argue for a constant interaction between grammar 
and philosophy in Late Antiquity'' (9). Traditionally, the 'standard 
philosophical or semantic categories' of the noun (loosely defined 8-9; 
see further the Critical Evaluation, below) were ascribed to the 
Techne Grammatike, itself attributed to Dionysius Thrax. Since that 
attribution is at least not wholly correct, in light of Taylor's ''new model 
of the history of Graeco-Roman language science'' (Taylor 1987) a 
revised understanding of the history of the categories is needed. 
Going farther than Taylor, L. ''would like to emphasize a continuous 
interaction between grammar and philosophy even after grammar has 
become an independent discipline'' (7), i.e. into Late Antiquity. The 
standard philosophical or semantic categories may thus be attributed 
to an ''Apollonian renovation of grammar'' and to a 
subsequent ''process of canonization'' (11).

Chapter 2, Philosophical Tradition (12-24), paves the way for there 
being necessary what L. calls 'Hellenistic syncretism' (Chapter 4 and 
below, Critical Evaluation) by examining the possibility that three 
Classical and Hellenistic Greek philosophical schools may have been 
the ''sources for the standard semantic concepts in ancient grammar: 
the Academy, the Stoa and the Peripatos'' (12). The examination is 
especially interested in comparing Stoic and Aristotelian doctrine (23-
24), in that the grammarians' definitions of the noun and the pronoun 
are attributable to Stoic theory, whereas Aristotle's conception was not 
influential; but also in that, despite this general Stoic origin, Priscian 
occasionally defines the noun in a way that is not Stoic and thus 
presupposes a ''different source'' that ''cannot go back to Hellenistic 
times'' (24). As a result, a later antique development is implied.

Chapter 3, The Alexandrian Grammarians (25-29), briefly treats the 
philosophical and philological researches of Hellenistic Alexandria, 
concluding that their apparently more purely formal definitions of parts 
of speech, linked to a prevailing concern with exegesis and textual 
criticism, imply an absence of the more semantic subcategories of the 
noun seen in later Antiquity.

Chapter 4, Hellenistic Syncretism (30-37), the final stage in L.'s 
preliminary argument, argues that ''it is in the late antique context 
where philosophers showed a vivid interest in language and literature 
that ancient grammar received its canonical form'' (37). In particular, 
philosophers of Middle and Neo-Platonism discuss ''the grammarian's 
parts of speech'' (33), such that the interaction between grammar and 
philosophy continued, in the event productively for the definition of the 
noun.

Chapter 5, Latin Grammarians (38-78), building on the groundwork of 
the preceding chapters, argues that the 'standard definition of the 
noun' (by case inflection and a signification of concrete objects or 
abstract things) ''is a novelty which [is] part of the 'Apollonian 
renovation''' (39, citing Luhtala 2002): ''the Apollonian definition is 
likely to have provided the basis for the standard definition'' (40). The 
bulk of the chapter is devoted to demonstrating this point, including 
interesting excursions on Greek vs. Latin grammarians (the former 
more philosophically inclined) and into the idea of an ongoing debate 
among grammarians as to the relevance of philosophical analysis in 
grammatical analysis (in which Consentius assumes special 
importance, 77-78).

Chapter 6, Priscian (79-128), is a detailed application of L.'s 
developed argument to explain the seeming 'inconsistencies' in 
Priscian's definitions of the noun: although part of Priscian's 
discussion depends on a ''genuinely Apollonian'' set of standard 
semantic subtypes for the noun, another part of his discussion is non-
Apollonian and ''contains many Platonic elements'' (128).

Chapter 7, The Status of the Eight Parts of Speech (129-137), 
surveys the contrast between ''the grammarian's eight parts of speech 
[with] the dialectician's two, the noun and the verb'' as an example of 
how ''grammar continued to interact with philosophy in Late Antiquity'' 
(129). 

The final substantive chapter, Chapter 8, Augustine (138-150), 
extends L.'s central argument to a reading of Augustine's Ars breviata 
as ''an excellent example of a total absence of semantic categories in 
Latin grammar'' (138) - in the terms of her argument, Augustine's Ars 
and his source material were not affected by the ''post-Apollonian 
renovation of grammar'', i.e. by ''the introduction of the semantic 
subcategories of common nouns'' (149), because Augustine himself 
was unaware of such material: ''Augustine is therefore promoting 
something which was already in existence, but the existence of which 
he did not know'' (150). Thus the Ars is good evidence for how the 
Late Antique interaction between grammar and philosophy, by now a 
given, included many varieties dependant among other things on an 
author's extra-linguistic concerns.

Chapter 9, General Conclusions (151-155), summarizes L.'s argument 
about the 'standard philosophical or semantic categories': it is not in 
the Techne Grammatike, wrongly attributed to Dionysius Thrax, but in 
the work of Apollonius Dyscolos ''that we first encounter philosophical 
definitions of the noun and the verb'' (152) which ''probably provided 
models for the standard definitions used both in Latin and Greek 
grammarians'' (154). Moreover, since Apollonius himself does not use 
the definitions as such, whereas they are used as such in subsequent 
grammarians, a continued interaction of grammar and philosophy is 
implied for Late Antiquity.

The end-matter includes References (divided into Primary and 
Secondary sources), an index of authors/passages, and an index of 
topics.

CRITICAL EVALUATION

For a long time, accounts of 'ancient language science' were 
teleological. Accounts of Greco-Roman linguistics in particular looked 
to the first century BCE for both (1) the decisive emergence of 
grammar as a discipline independent of, on the one hand, rhetoric and 
philology (textual criticism), and, on the other, philosophy (including 
dialectic and the analysis of linguistic concepts, e.g. 'meaning'); and 
(2) the canonization of grammatical concepts in a form which would 
remain essentially unchanged through late antiquity, thereby to 
influence European linguistics in the Middle Ages and the 
Renaissance (see esp. Barwick 1922 and 1957; and Steinthal 1890-
1891). Recently such accounts have been subject to reexamination 
and revision, thanks to the ''new model of the history of Graeco-
Roman language science'' as articulated by Daniel J. Taylor (1987).

L.'s study takes part in, and adds to, this ongoing revision. Although L. 
agrees that grammar became independent in the first century BCE, 
she seeks to extend one implication of the new model, that the 
attribution of the Techne Grammatike to Dionysius Thrax is incorrect, 
in order to argue that grammar, even after its emergence as an 
independent discipline, continued to interact with philosophy through 
Late Antiquity, and that it is primarily this late influence, and not a 
putative earlier philosophical influence, that accounts for the 
philosophical aspects of late antique grammar, including the so-
called 'standard philosophical (or semantic) categories' of the noun. In 
L.'s words, the argument seeks ''to diminish the role of philosophy in 
pre-Apollonian grammar and to argue for a constant interaction 
between grammar and philosophy in Late Antiquity'' (9).

This application of the new model successfully produces a more 
nuanced picture of a fundamental topic in Late Antique thought on 
language. At a more general level (i.e., that of Koerner's 
historiography of linguistics), the study joins others in demonstrating 
how ancient thought about language, like pre-modern thought and 
non-Western thought about the same, deserves careful attention 
regardless of whether or not such thought  is 'language science' 
or 'linguistics' avant la lettre.

Some small complaints do not detract from the study's success. L. 
alternates between 'standard semantic' and 'standard philosophical 
subcategories', at times combining them, and defines the term later 
than might be liked. Very awkward is L.'s term 'Hellenistic syncretism' 
(Ch. 4). At first glance, this might naturally mean 'syncretism of 
different definitions and theories in the Hellenistic Age'. If I have 
understood L. correctly, however, this meaning is prohibited by her 
own chh. 2 and 3, such that the term means something like 'Late 
Antique syncretism of what were in origin, at least in some parts, 
Hellenistic definitions and theories': for this I might have 
preferred 'Late Antique syncretism'.

ABOUT THE REVIEWER

Benjamin Stevens is Assistant Professor of Classics at Bard College in 
Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. His research interests include the 
history of thought about language, esp. the origin of language; 
linguistic life in Roman antiquity; and Latin and Greek languages and 
literatures. His current research project, tentatively entitled "Like 
Strangers in our Own City: Roman Wanderings in Language and

Dear all,

In late May 2005, I posted my first CFP with LINGUIST List  (see 16.1708) -
resulting in then only a few but nevertheless promising paper proposals. So
far we've gathered papers from potential contributors dealing with
different L3 such as German (2), Spanish (2), French (1) in Japan as well
as Japanese (1) in the US. I'd like to take this opportunity to encourage
further authors to take part in this specific and indeed exciting topic
that, by the way, is increasingly gaining the interest it deserves,
particularly among FL teachers themselves and psycholinguists.
Nevertheless, especially addressed are those authors who on an almost daily
basis notice in their own FL classes that their students usually recur to
their prior L2-knowledge rather than to their mother tongue(L1). By
formulating these observations from first hand classroom experience and
possibly providing practical advice for converting them into useful tips
for the benefit of our FL students I'm confident the anthology in
preparation might turn out to become a sort of manual for all colleagues
interested in utilizing both L2, i.e. English, positive as well negative
transfer, thus sharpening teachers' awareness of this phenomenon.

Further paper proposals are highly welcome by submitting an abstract in
English no later than <deadline>31st of  March, 2006</deadline>. Upon receipt of the abstract,
you will be informed asap whether your paper in principal has been accepted
for publication. As already stated in my first CFP, I'd especially like to
attract native speakers of modern European languages such as Dutch, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish to write papers; however,
and this is the essential expansion of the current CFP, this time it's not
restricted to classroom experiences solely with Japanese students (L1) but
with speakers of any native language. After accepting your paper for
publication, you are required to submit the full version by the end of
<deadline>September 2006</deadline>.

Language(s) of publication: contributors' respective mother tongue,
accompanied by an English abstract and author's bio or, alternatively, the
other way round, i.e. paper in English along with the abstract and author's
bio in your mother tongue.

Planned year of publication: late 2006/early 2007

Deadline for submitting paper proposals, i.e., English abstract: the end of
<deadline>March, 2006</deadline>

Style sheet available at:
http://www.linguistik-online.de/deutsch/stylesheet.html (in German;
however, guidelines should be easily understood by non-native German
speakers, too).

Thanks for your attention and consideration! Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year to all LL-members and -users!
