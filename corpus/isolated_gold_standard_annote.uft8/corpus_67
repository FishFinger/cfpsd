The Second Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using Natural
Language Processing 

 
<http://www.ets.org/research/conferences/nlp.html>
Two major research areas in educational applications, automated evaluation
of students' free-responses and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), have
developed fairly autonomously within the NLP community. We made progress
toward bridging this gap in the First Workshop on Building Educational
Applications Using NLP in 2003, where researchers in a wide variety of
educational applications met at NAACL 2003 in Edmonton to share their
research - both in the speech- and text-based communities. Papers dealt with
automated evaluation of essay-length texts and classification of brief
responses that students enter into a tutoring system. Other research that
was reported included exploring the value of using grammar checking within a
tutoring system, comparing speech- and text-based tutoring systems, and
automatically generating multiple-choice questions. 
There continues to be a significant and fast-growing body of research toward
developing educational applications that incorporate NLP.  This has become
apparent as, since the First Workshop in 2003, subsequent workshops have
been held by scientists working in this field (InSTIL/ICALL 2004 Symposium
on Computer Assisted Learning and the eLearning International Workshop,
COLING 2004 <http://www.issco.unige.ch/coling2004/>). We hope that this
workshop will continue to facilitate communication between researchers who
work on all types of instructional applications, for K-12, undergraduate,
and graduate school. Our goal is to continue to expose the NLP research
community to these technologies with the hope that they may see novel
opportunities for use of their tools in educational applications. 

For this workshop, we will invite submissions including, but not limited to:

*	Speech-based tools for educational technology
*	Innovative text analysis for evaluation of student writing with
regard to: a) general writing quality, or b) accuracy of content for
domain-specific responses
*	Content-based scoring
*	Intelligent tutoring systems that incorporate state-of-the-art NLP
methods to evaluate response content, using either text- or speech-based
analyses
*	Dialogue systems in education
*	Evaluation of NLP-based tools for education
*	Use of student response databases (text or speech) for tool building
*	Multi-modal communication between human learners and machines 
*	Automated assessment of students' language and cognitive skill
levels 
*	Automated systems that detect and adapt to learners' cognitive or
emotional states
*	Semantic-based access to instructional materials
*	Automated universal access to educational materials
*	Knowledge representation in learning systems
	*	Visualization of concepts in learning systems
	*	Automated processing of spoken and written lecture materials
	*	Hypothesis formation and testing in automated tutoring
systems
	*	Machine translation for education-related tools
*	Tools for teachers and test developers
*	E-learning tools for personalized course content
*	Text analysis methods to handle particular writing genres, such as
legal or business writing, or creative aspects of writing

Special Student Short Papers:  We invite student submissions for Regular
Papers, but also plan to accept 2 - 4 student Short Papers for the workshop.
These Short Papers may be on more preliminary research, or research that is
based on class projects. The length of the papers will be a maximum of 4
pages.  At the workshop, these short papers will be delivered in a 15 minute
timeframe, instead of 30 minutes.


Submission Deadlines:

Submissions Due: <deadline>April 7, 2005</deadline>
Acceptance Notification to Authors: May 9, 2005
Camera-Ready Papers Due: <deadline>May 20, 2005</deadline> 


Instructions for Submission:
Submissions should be in PDF, PostScript, or MS Word. Please let us know if
this is not possible for you. Regular Papers should not exceed 8 pages, and
student Short Papers should not exceed 4 pages. More detailed information
about format of submissions can be found here: 
http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/index.php?stylefiles
Submission Method:

Please enter your submission into the START Conference Manager System
located at http://www.softconf.com/start/ACL05-EduAppNLP/submit.html, no
later than <deadline>April 7, 2005</deadline>, by noon EST. Please feel free to contact the
organizers with any questions regarding the workshop.
