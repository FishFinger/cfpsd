influential,
competitive and far-reaching conferences, with wide international
participation from all over the world. Featuring leading lights in the
area as keynote speakers or tutorial speakers, RANLP has now grown
into a
larger-scale meeting with accompanying workshops and other events. In
addition to the 6 keynote speeches and tutorials on hot NLP topics,
RANLP07 will be accompanied by workshops and shared task competitions.

Volumes of selected papers are traditionally published by John
Benjamins
Publishers and previous conferences have enjoyed support from the
European
Commission.
