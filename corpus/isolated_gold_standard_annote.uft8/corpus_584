The series of workshops on Computational Models of Natural Argument
is continuing to attract high quality submissions from researchers
around the world. CMNA 1 was held at ICCS in San Francisco in 2001,
CMNA 2 was held at ECAI in Lyon in 2002, CMNA 3 was held at IJCAI in
Acapulco in 2003, CMNA 4 was held at ECAI in Valencia in 2004, CMNA 5
was held at IJCAI in Edinburgh in 2005, and CMNA 6 takes place at
ECAI in Riva del Garda in 2006.

Like the past editions, CMNA-7 intends to recognise and consolidate
the critical mass that research in the field overlapping Argumentation
Theory and Artificial Intelligence has developed in recent years.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

     * The characteristics of "natural" arguments: ontological aspects
        and cognitive issues.
     * The use of models from informal logic and argumentation theory,
       and in particular, approaches to specific schools of thought
       developed in informal logic and argumentation.
     * Rhetoric and affect: the role of emotions, personalities, etc.
       in models of argumentation.
     * The roles of licentiousness and deceit and the ethical implications
       of implemented systems demonstrating such features.
     * The linguistic characteristics of natural argumentation, including
       discourse markers, sentence format, referring expressions, and style.
       Persuasive discourse processing (discourse goals and structure,
       speaker/hearer models, content selection, etc.).  Language dependence
       and multilingual approaches. Empirical work based on corpora looking=
 at
       these topics would be especially welcomed.
     * Non-monotonic, defeasible and uncertain argumentation.
     * Natural argumentation and media: visual arguments,
       multi-modal arguments, spoken arguments.
     * Models of argumentation in multi-agent systems inspired by or
       based upon theories of human argument.
     * Empirically driven models of argument in AI and Law.
     * Evaluative arguments and their application in AI systems
       (such as decision support and advice giving).
     * Issues of domain specificity, and in particular, the independence of
       argumentation techniques from the domain of application.
     * Applications of computer supported collaborative argumentation, in
       realistic domains in which argument plays a key role, including
       pedagogy, e-democracy and public debate.
     * Applications of argumentation based systems, including,  for example,
       the pedagogical, health-related, political, and promotional.
     * Methods to better convey the structure of complex argument, including
       representation and summarisation.
     * Tools for interacting with structures of argument, including
       visualisation tools and interfaces supporting natural, stylised
       or formal dialogue.
     * The building of computational resources such as online corpora relat=
ed
       to argumentation.
     * Early results from applications and implementations of the ideas from
       earlier CMNA  workshops.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

The workshop encourages submissions in three categories:

     * Long papers, either reporting on completed work or offering a
       polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 6000 words)
     * Short papers describing work in progress (up to 3000 words)
     * Demonstration of implemented systems: submissions should be
       accompanied by written reports (up to 3000 words). Authors
       should contact the organisers to ensure suitable
       equipment is available.

Electronic submissions should be received by ALL of the organisers no
later than <deadline>26 September 2006</deadline> for long papers, and <deadline>10 October 2006</deadline>
for short papers and demonstration reports.

Extended versions of selected papers accepted to CMNA 1, CMNA 2 and
CMNA 3 are to appear in a special issue of the International Journal
of Intelligent Systems. Similar avenues will be explored for CMNA 4,
CMNA 5, CMNA 6 and CMNA7.
