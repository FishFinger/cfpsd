TRANSLATING AND THE COMPUTER 28 Conference
(16-17 November 2006, Kensington, London).
Sponsors: TILP and Alchemy Software Development
Supported by: BCS, EAMT, IAMT, IoL and ITI

This conference focuses on the user's perspective of how computers/software 
are used in translation. The conference series attracts a wide audience 
which includes translators, business managers, researchers and language 
experts.

Once again, this year the conference will address the latest developments 
in translation (and translation-related) software. It will address the 
needs of the following conference attendees: industry, public 
administration, agencies, freelancers and development.

This call for papers invites abstracts of papers to be presented at the 
conference. The papers (and the presentations) should focus on the user 
aspects of translation or translation-related software rather than on 
theoretical issues. Presentations accompanied by demonstrations are 
especially welcome.

TOPICS
The range of topics includes (but is not limited to):
	- use of MT systems
	- CAT tools including TM and various translation aids
	- controlled languages and their use in MT
	- speech translation
	- terminology
	- localisation
	- multilingual document management/workflow
	- case studies of technology-based solutions
	- the Internet and translation aids/services
	- application of XML tools and XML standards
	- Project Management
	- quality assurance tools
	- workflow systems
	- resources for translation including corpora
