Final Call for Papers for NAACL HLT 2010

June 1 - June 6, 2010, Los Angeles, California
http://naaclhlt2010.isi.edu

IMPORTANT DATES
Deadline for BOTH Full and Short paper submission: Tuesday, <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline>
[New] Author response period: January 12 - 14, 2010
Notification to Authors: Monday, January 25, 2010
Final, camera-ready papers due: Wednesday, March 31, 2010

*** IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION ***: Please DO NOT submit the same paper in lon=
g and
short paper form. (See Multiple submission policy section.)=20

NAACL is pleased to announce the North American Chapter of the Association =
for Computational Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL HLT) 201=
0 conference. The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working=
 towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural=
 language, and towards enhancing human-human communication through services=
 such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, =
text summarization, and information extraction. This year, we are especiall=
y interested in papers discussing research with noisy data, including data =
from informal communications (such as, Twitter, Blogs, Email, SMS) and proc=
essed data (such as, Speech, OCR, Historical Data, and Machine Translation)=
. NAACL HLT 2010 will feature full papers, short papers, demonstrations, an=
d a doctoral consortium, as well as pre-conference tutorials and post-confe=
rence workshops. The conference invites the submission of full and short pa=
pers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in disciplines that=
 could impact human language processing systems. We also encourage the subm=
ission of short papers that can be characterized as a small, focused contri=
bution, a work in progress, a negative result, an opinion piece or an inter=
esting application note.

Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas, and are unders=
tood to be applied to speech and/or text:

	- Phonology
	- Morphology (including word segmentation)
	- Part of speech tagging
	- Syntax and parsing (e.g., grammar induction, formal grammar, algorithms)
	- Grammar Engineering
	- Word sense disambiguation
	- Lexical semantics
	- Formal semantics and logic
	- Mathematical Linguistics
	- Textual entailment and paraphrasing
	- Discourse and pragmatics
	- Knowledge acquisition and representation
	- Statistical and machine learning techniques for language processing
	- Multilingual processing
	- Noisy data analysis
	- Large-scale language processing
	- Machine translation
	- Language generation
	- Summarization
	- Question answering
	- Information retrieval (including monolingual and CLIR)
	- Information extraction
	- Topic classification and information filtering
	- Non-topical classification (e.g., sentiment/attribution/ genre analysis)
	- Topic clustering
	- Text and speech mining
	- Spoken term detection and spoken document indexing
	- Speech indexing and retrieval
	- Speech analysis and recognition
	- Speech synthesis
	- Speech understanding
	- Dialog(ue) systems
	- Speech-centered applications (e.g., human-computer, human-robot interact=
ion, education and learning systems, assistive technologies, digital entert=
ainment)
	- Evaluation (e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, user studies)
	- Development of language resources (e.g., lexicons, ontologies, annotated=
 corpora)
	- Rich transcription (automatic annotation of information structure and so=
urces in speech)
	- Multimodal representations and processing, including speech, gaze, gestu=
re, and other sensory inputs

SUBMISSION

Full papers: NAACL HLT 2010 submissions must describe substantial, original=
, completed and
unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis sh=
ould be
included. The long paper deadline is <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific St=
andard Time (GMT-8). Submissions will be
judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness=
/soundness,
meaningful comparison, thoroughness, significance, contributions to researc=
h resources, and
replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program c=
ommittee members.

Full papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus one extra=
 page for references, and will be presented orally *OR* as a poster present=
ation as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which pap=
ers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be base=
d on the nature rather than on the quality of the work. There will be no di=
stinction in the proceedings between full papers presented orally and those=
 presented as poster presentations.

Short papers: NAACL HLT 2010 also solicits short papers. Short paper submis=
sions must describe original and unpublished work. The short paper deadline=
 this year is also <deadline>December 1, 2009</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8=
). Characteristics of past short papers include:

	- A small, focused contribution
	- Work in progress
	- A negative result
	- An opinion piece
	- An interesting application nugget

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions, and =
will be given four (4) pages including references in the proceedings. While=
 short papers will be distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, th=
ere will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presente=
d orally and those presented as poster presentations. Each short paper subm=
ission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members.
Submission Deadline: The deadline for both full and short papers is <deadline>Decembe=
r 1, 2009</deadline> by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8).

Electronic Submission: Submission is electronic using submission software a=
t: https://www.softconf.com/naaclhlt2010/HLT2010

Format: Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of NAACL=
 HLT 2010 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one=
 extra page for references. Short paper submissions should also follow the =
two-column format of NAACL HLT 2010 proceedings, and should not exceed four=
 (4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX=
 style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's confere=
nce, which are available on the conference website under http://naaclhlt201=
0.isi.edu/authors.html. Submissions must conform to the official style guid=
elines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be electronic=
 in PDF.

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' nam=
es and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's =
identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. I=
nstead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." P=
apers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without re=
view. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until aft=
er the review process is complete.

Multiple-submission policy: Papers that have been or will be submitted to
other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. Autho=
rs submitting multiple papers to
NAACL HLT may not submit papers that overlap significantly (> 50%) with eac=
h other in content or
results. Authors should not submit a short and long version of the same pap=
er. Authors of papers accepted for
presentation at NAACL HLT 2010 must notify the program chairs by February 1=
5, 2010 as to whether the paper
will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference =
to appear in the
proceedings. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that=
 overlap significantly in content or
results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.
