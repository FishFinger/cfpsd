		*** Second Call for Papers ***

	Fourth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing

		http://www.sighan.org/swclp4/	

		      IJCNLP-05 Workshop

		      October 14-15, 2005
		       Jeju Island, Korea


Background and Goals

Growing interest in Chinese Language Processing is leading to the
development of resources such as annotated corpora, automatic word
segmenters, part-of-speech taggers and parsers. As more resources have
become available recently, it is crucial to create a platform that 
allows easy exchange of information and data and the comparison of 
different approaches to various NLP tasks. The SIGHAN workshops 
provide a forum where the latest research in these areas can
be shared.

The Second SIGHAN Workshop held in Sapporo  with ACL2003 
included the First International Chinese Word Segmentation
Bakeoff, where 12 systems from Industry and Academia from six
countries  and regions were evaluated, generating significant interest.
 The Third SIGHAN Workshop held in Barcelona followed on with 
wide-ranging technical presentations and began planning a Fourth 
SIGHAN workshop with a new bakeoff.

IJCNLP-05 in Korea will provide an opportunity to bring  together again
influential as well as aspiring researchers from Hong Kong, Mainland China, 
Singapore, and Taiwan  and other interested Chinese language researchers
from  around the world, to deliberate and interact on a range of NLP issues.

The first day of the workshop will consist of papers on all aspects
of Chinese language processing, including but not limited to:

* word segmentation, 
* POS tagging, 
* parsing, 
* lexical semantics, 
* word sense disambiguation, 
* lexicon acquisition, 
* corpus development, 
* discourse processing, 
* generation, 
* cross-lingual information retrieval, and 
* machine translation. 



The second half-day of the workshop will present results from the 
Second International Chinese Segmentation Bakeoff to be held in the 
summer of 2005. Participants will choose from five training and 
testing corpora. The bakeoff is being organized by Tom Emerson 
(Basis Technology, Corp.) and Jianfeng Gao (Microsoft Research). 
Information, including information on the task, important dates, 
and submission of working papers will be made available on the SIGHAN 
website. 
		(http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2005/). 
A SIGHAN business meeting will discuss lessons learned and future plans.

Important dates:
Paper submissions due: <deadline>May 31, 2005</deadline> 
Notification of acceptance: June 24, 2005 
Camera-ready due: <deadline>July 23, 2005</deadline> 
Workshop dates: October 14-15, 2005

Paper submissions must be anonymous and are limited to at most 8 pages 
including references, figures, etc. Authors are required to follow the 
guidelines of IJCNLP-05 workshop style, by hopefully using either the LaTeX
