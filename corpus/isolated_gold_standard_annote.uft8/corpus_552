INVITATION
----------

The 2006 IEEE ICDM Workshop on Reliability Issues of Data Mining and
Knowledge Discovery will focus on the theory and techniques that can
ensure the discovered knowledge is reliable and to identify in which
cases or under which conditions the discovered knowledge is reliable or
the discovery process is robust. In the last 20 years, many data mining
algorithms have been developed for the discovery of knowledge from given
data bases.  However in many cases, the discovery process
is not robust or the discovered knowledge is not reliable or even
incorrect in certain cases. In some cases, the discovered knowledge may
not necessary be the real reflection of the data.  Why does this happen?
What are major factors which affect the discovery process? How can we make .....

We are looking for candidates for a PhD position in the research area of
database support for bioinformatics. The PhD student shall investigate
the management of bio-datatypes in relational databases, as well as
the tight integration of biodata and bioinformatics algorithms using
.NET-based stored procedures. The objective of this project is to
explore the feasibility of running scientific algorithms, e.g. from
the bioinformatics area, inside a database and to develop practical
optimisation guidelines for the integration of biodata and virtual
machines in today's database engines.

This scholarship is funded by an ARC Linkage-Projects grant and
will provide support for 3 years on a full-time basis for a research
