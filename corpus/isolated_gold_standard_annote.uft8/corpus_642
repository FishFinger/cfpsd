                     LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

                 The 6th Discourse Anaphora and
                 Anaphor Resolution Colloquium
                         (DAARC'2007)

                   Lagos (Algarve), Portugal
       hosted by University of Lisbon, Faculty of Sciences
                       March 29-30, 2007

                 http://daarc2007.di.fc.ul.pt/


Anaphora is a central topic in the study of natural language and
has long been the object of research in a wide range of disciplines
such as theoretical, corpus and computational linguistics, philosophy
of language, cognitive science, psycholinguistics and cognitive
psychology. On the other hand, the correct interpretation of anaphora
has played an increasingly vital role in real-world natural language
processing applications, including machine translation, automatic
abstracting, information extraction and question answering. As a result,
the processing of anaphora has become one of the most productive
topics of multi- and inter-disciplinary research, and has enjoyed
increased interest and attention in recent years.

In this context, the Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution
Colloquia (DAARC) have emerged as the major regular forum for
presentation and discussion of the best research results in this area.
Initiated in 1996 at Lancaster University and taken over in 2002 by
the University of Lisbon, the DAARC series established itself as
a specialised and competitive forum for the presentation of the latest
results on anaphora processing, ranging from theoretical linguistic
approaches through psycholinguistic and cognitive work to corpus
studies and computational modelling.

The sixth Discourse Anaphora and Anaphor Resolution Colloquium (DAARCÃ¯Â¿Â½2007)
will take place in Lagos (Algarve), Portugal, in March 29-30, 2007.
We would like to invite anyone currently researching in the areas
of discourse anaphora and anaphor resolution, from any methodological
perspective or framework, to submit a paper to DAARC'2007.

*The closing date for submission is <deadline>October 16, 2006</deadline>.*

Notification of acceptance will be sent by December 15, 2006. Final
versions of selected papers to be included in the proceedings are
expected by January 19, 2007.

Submissions (extended abstracts) must be anonymous and at most 3 pages
in length. For further details on the submission procedure, and other
relevant info on the colloquium visit its website at:
