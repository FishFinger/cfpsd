NEW APPROACHES TO MACHINE TRANSLATION

                            A METIS-II WORKSHOP
                         LEUVEN, JANUARY 11TH 2007
		     http://ccl.kuleuven.be/ws-metis/

First Call for Papers

Aim 

The aim of the workshop ''New Approaches To Machine Translation'' is
to raise awareness of innovative approaches to MT, be it rule-based,
example-based, statistical, hybrid, ... which tackle issues raised by
''classical approaches'', such as issues with respect to algorithms and
resources.
The workshop consists of a keynote lecture (t.b.a.), invited and submitted
papers, a panel discussion and demonstrations.

Topics

Papers are invited that describe research and development with respect to
new approaches in MT, including, but not restricted to, the following:
   · New machine translation architectures (rule-based, example-based,
   statistical, hybrid); projects and currently available software:
   complete engines, modules; 
   · Quality of the translations obtained, especially in comparison to
   other techniques; 
   · When using lean resources, the effect this has on your
   techniques/algorithms, or the information to be specified in these
   resources; 
   · Post-editing and feedback to the translation engine;
   · New approaches to the evaluation of MT.

All contributions will be published in the workshop proceedings. They will
also be made available at the METIS website.

Submissions

Abstracts should be in English and up to 10 pages long. For instructions
for authors, have a look at http://ccl.kuleuven.be/ws-metis/.
The (anonymous) papers will be reviewed by members of the programme committee.
Abstracts should be sent via e-mail to metis-clin@ccl.kuleuven.be. The
deadline for submission is <deadline>October 1st, 2006</deadline>.

About the METIS-II project

The partners involved in the METIS-II project are:
         ILSP (Institute for Language and Speech Processing), Athens, Greece
         K.U.Leuven (Centre for Computational Linguistics), Leuven, Belgium
         IAI (Institut fur Angewandte Informationsforschung), Saarbrucken, Germany
         FUPF (Fundacio Universitat Pompeu Fabra), Barcelona, Spain

METIS-II (10-2004 09-2007) is a hybrid machine translation system, in which
insights from statistical, example-based, and rule-based machine
translation (SMT, EBMT, and RBMT respectively) are used.  
METIS investigates rule-based and data-driven methods to the extent they
can be built and used with relative ease and they complement each
other. Rule-based methods are used where representations and decisions can
be determined a-priori with high accuracy, for instance, based on
linguistic insight. Corpora serve as a basis to ground decisions where
uncertainty remains. Data-driven methods are used for target language
generation, using only a target language corpus and a bilingual dictionary
instead of a parallel corpus.

CLIN 17

The METIS-II workshop is organised in conjunction with CLIN 17
(Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands), which will also be
organised in Leuven (January 12th 2007).
