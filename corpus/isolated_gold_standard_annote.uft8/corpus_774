Background

Language acquisition has for a long time stood as one of the most =

fundamental, =

beguiling, and surprisingly open questions of modern science.  Recent =

advances in =

natural language processing, statistical parsing and machine learning, =

together =

with the availability of large corpora of child directed speech and other =

corpora, =

make a wide range of computationally-oriented approaches to the study of =

this =

problem available. In this special issue, we will provide a forum for the f=
ull =

range =

of current approaches to this important field.  =


Psychocomputational models of language acquisition are of particular =

interest in =

light of recent results in developmental psychology that suggest that very =

young =

infants are adept at detecting statistical patterns in an audible input str=
eam. =

Though, how children might plausibly apply statistical 'machinery' to the =

task of =

grammar acquisition, with or without an innate language component, =

remains an =

open and important question. One effective line of investigation is to =

computationally model the acquisition process, through simulation, =

mathematically, the statistical analysis of corpora, etc., and determine =

interrelationships between a model and linguistic or psycholinguistic theor=
y, =

and/or correlations between a model's performance and data from =

linguistic =

environments that children are   =

exposed to.  =


Topics

We aim to publish papers that describe state of the art techniques in =

computational models of language acquisition. These should be =

computationally =

explicit but not necessarily implemented and these could be evaluated =

empirically, theoretically or on the basis of a detailed case study.  =

This special issue should provide an interdisciplinary forum where =

researchers in =

theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, natural language processing, =

grammatical =

inference, machine learning and cognitive science can present research on =

the =

computational modelling of first language acquisition.  =


We welcome papers from any of the current models of linguistic theorising: =

standard and enriched context free models, Principles and Parameters =

models, =

Optimiality theory and reseachers working within the Minimalist Program, =

and =

other approaches.  =


Topics include but are not limited to:

* Models that address the acquisition of word-order;
* Models that combine parsing and learning
* Formal learning-theoretic and grammar induction models that use =

   psychologically plausible models of the information available to the =

learner
* Comparative surveys that critique previously reported studies
*  Models that address learning bias in terms of innate linguistic knowledg=
e  =

   versus statistical regularity in the input
* Models that employ language modeling techniques from corpus linguistics
* Models that employ techniques from machine learning
* Models of language change and its effect on language acquisition or vice =

versa
* Models that employ statistical/probabilistic grammars
* Computational models that can be used to evaluate existing linguistic or  =

   developmental theories (e.g., principles & parameters, optimality theory=
,  =

   construction grammar, etc.)
* Empirical models that make use of child-directed corpora such as =

CHILDES,  =

   or indeed adult corpora as contrasted with child-directed corpora
