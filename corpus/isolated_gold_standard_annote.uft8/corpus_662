Meeting Description:

The Hong Kong Polytechnic University - Peking University Research Centre on 
Chinese Linguistics is proud to organize the 6th International Workshop on
Theoretical East Asian Linguistics (TEAL-6) at Peking University, Beijing, China
on August 15-16, 2010. 

Call for Papers

We welcome submissions of works that address problems of languages commonly 
classified as East Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and 
also languages spoken in the area of Southeast Asia and the minority languages 
spoken in China from a theoretical perspective. We are particularly interested 
in theoretically oriented work on any aspect of the syntax, semantics,
phonology, and morphology of an East Asian language or comparative work among
East Asian languages and/or between an East Asian language and any other
languages that contributes to the parametric theory of Universal Grammar. Each
paper will be allotted at least 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for
discussion.

Selection of papers is based on anonymous review of abstracts. A selection 
committee will be formed to review the submitted abstracts which are considered 
by the reviewers to be of high interest to the development of theoretical East 
Asian linguistics and linguistic theory in general. Please follow these
guidelines to submit your abstracts:

All submitted abstracts should be written in English and limited to two
single-spaced pages, complete with examples and bibliography. All texts should
fit  within two A4 pages, with 1-inch margin all around. Each abstract should start 
with the title (centered) at top, followed by 3 single-spaced blank lines, above
the main text. Use font size 12 throughout, preferably in Times or Times New
Roman. Romanize all Asian texts, and avoid Asian character fonts unless
absolutely necessary. The abstract should be camera-ready. 

Abstract submission is by email-attachment only. We do not accept submissions 
by postal mail. Save your abstract as a PDF or DOC file. Documents in other 
formats must be converted before submission. Name your abstract with your last 
name followed by the suffix pdf or doc (e.g., huang.pdf or kim.doc). Send your 
abstract to the selection committee via the online submission system.

Abstract selection is based on anonymous review. Please leave your name and 
affiliation out of the abstract (but keep 3 blank lines between title and text).
The workshop will accept at most one single-authored work OR one joint-authored
work by an individual. Each author may submit abstracts to the TEAL-6 workshop
and to the 8th GLOW in Asia. The submitted abstracts should, however, be
substantially different in content. Abstracts submitted to TEAL-6 are reviewed
separately from those submitted to the 8th GLOW in Asia and the "Zhu-Lu Symposium".

Some of the papers presented at the TEAL-6 workshop will be selected for
publication in Journal of East Asian Linguistics, an international SSCI journal,
subject to double-blind peer review and the final decision of the editorial board.
