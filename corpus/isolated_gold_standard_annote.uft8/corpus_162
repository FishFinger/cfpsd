		      Second Call For Tutorial Proposals

				COLING/ACL'06


Tutorial proposals are invited for the Tutorial Program of
COLING/ACL'06, to be held in Sydney, Australia, July 17th-21st, 2006
(see www.coling2006.org or www.acl2006.org). COLING/ACL'06 combines
the Joint 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics
and the 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (COLING/ACL'06). The tutorials will be held on the weekend
preceding the conference.

Proposals for tutorials on all topics of computational linguistics and
its applications are sought. Especially encouraged are
cross-disciplinary tutorials that educate the community about recent
technical advancements in semantic processing, machine learning,
statistics, or data mining technology that are of interest to
computational linguistics, or introduce relevant algorithms and theory
that may be "old hat" to specialists in these areas but are still
unfamiliar to part of the natural language processing community.

The ACL has a set of policies on tutorials. You can find general
information on policies regarding financial support of ACL tutorials,
at the following URL:
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/ACL/tutorial-payment-policy.html.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals for tutorials should contain:

* A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its
 relevance to the COLING/ACL community (not more than 2 pages).
* A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
 tutorial's core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including
 a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are
 available as well.
* The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
 the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their
 research interests and areas of expertise.
* A list of previous venues and approximate audience sizes, if the same
 or a similar tutorial has been given elsewhere; otherwise an estimate
 of the audience size.  
* A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g.,
 internet access). 

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text
no later than <deadline>January 5, 2006</deadline> to

       Claire.Gardent@loria.fr

The subject line should be: "COLING/ACL'06 TUTORIAL PROPOSAL".

PLEASE NOTE: PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY REGULAR MAIL OR FAX.


TUTORIAL SPEAKER RESPONSIBILITIES

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by January 20, 2006, and
must then provide descriptions of their tutorials for inclusion in the
conference registration material by April 10, 2006. The description
should be in three formats: a LaTeX version that fits onto 1/2 page;
an ASCII version that can be included with the email announcement; and
an HTML version that can be included on the conference web site.
Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials, at least containing
copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the material
covered in the tutorial, by June 6, 2006.
